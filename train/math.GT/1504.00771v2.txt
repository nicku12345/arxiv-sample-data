Within crystallization theory, two interesting PL invariants for d-manifolds have been introduced and studied, namely {\it gem-complexity} and {\it regular genus}. In the present paper we prove that, for any closed connected PL 4-manifold M, its gem-complexity \mathit{k}(M) and its regular genus  \mathcal G(M) satisfy: \mathit{k}(M) \ \geq \ 3 \chi (M) + 10m -6 \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \mathcal G(M) \ \geq \ 2 \chi (M) + 5m -4, where rk(\pi_1(M))=m. These lower bounds enable to strictly improve previously known estimations for regular genus and gem-complexity of product 4-manifolds. Moreover, the class of {\it semi-simple crystallizations} is introduced, so that the represented PL 4-manifolds attain the above lower bounds. The additivity of both gem-complexity and regular genus with respect to connected sum is also proved for such a class of PL 4-manifolds, which comprehends all ones of "standard type", involved in existing crystallization catalogues, and their connected sums.
