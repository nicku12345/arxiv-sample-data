We prove the following: Let 2p + 1 be no less than 5 and p be a natural number. Let K and J be closed, oriented, (2p+1)-dimensional connected, (p-1)-connected, simple submanifolds of the standard (2p+3)-sphere. Then K is equivalent to J if and only if a Seifert matrix associated with a simple Seifert hypersurface for K is (-1)^p-S-equivalent to that for J.   We also discuss the 2p+1=3 case. This result implies one of our main results: Let \mu be a natural number. A 1-link A is pass-move equivalent to a 1-link B if and only if the knot product of A and \mu copies of the Hopf link is (2\mu+1, 2\mu+1)-pass-move equivalent to that of B and \mu copies of the Hopf link.   It also implies the other of them: Two-fold cyclic suspension commutes with the performance of the twist move for spherical (2k+1)-knots (2k+1>4).   Furthemroe we prove the following: Let 2p+1 be no less than 5 and p be a natural number. Let K be a closed oriented (2p+1)-dimensionalsubmanifold of the standard (2p+3)-sphere. Then K is a Brieskorn submanifold if and only if K is connected, (p-1)-connected, simple and has a (p+1)-Seifert matrix associated with a simple Seifert hypersurface that is (-1)^p-S-equivalent to a Kauffman-Neumann-type, or a KN-type (See the body of the paper for a definition.) We also discuss the 2p+1=3 case.
