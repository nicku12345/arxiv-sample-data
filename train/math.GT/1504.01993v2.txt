We prove the existence of an exact triangle for the Pin(2)-monopole Floer homology groups of three manifolds related by specific Dehn surgeries on a given knot. Unlike the counterpart in usual monopole Floer homology, only two of the three maps are those induced by the corresponding elementary cobordism. We use this triangle to describe the invariants associated to homology spheres obtained by (\pm1)-surgery on alternating knots.
