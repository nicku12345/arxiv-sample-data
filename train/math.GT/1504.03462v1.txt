This paper continues the study of periodic links started in \cite{Politarczyk2}. It contains a study of the equivariant analogues of the Jones polynomial, which can be obtained from the equivariant Khovanov homology. In this paper we describe basic properties of such polynomials, show that they satisfy an analogue of the skein relation and develop a state-sum formula. The skein relation in the equivariant case is used to strengthen the periodicity criterion of Przytycki from \cite{Przytycki}. The state-sum formula is used to reproved the classical congruence of Murasugi from \cite{Murasugi1}.
