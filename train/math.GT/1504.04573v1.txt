We prove a uniqueness result for finite-dimensional representations of the Kauffman skein algebra \mathcal{S}_A(S) of a surface S, when A is a root of unity and when the surface S is a sphere with at most four punctures or a torus with at most one puncture. We show that, if two irreducible representations of \mathcal{S}_A(S) have the same classical shadow and the same puncture invariants, and if this classical shadow is sufficiently generic in the character variety \mathcal{X}_{SL_2(\mathbb{C})} (S), then the two representations are isomorphic.
