We exhibit an infinite family of knots in the Poincare homology sphere with tunnel number 2 that have a lens space surgery. Notably, these knots are not doubly primitive and provide counterexamples to a few conjectures. In the appendix, it is shown that hyperbolic knots in the Poincare homology sphere with a lens space surgery has either no symmetries or just a single strong involution.
