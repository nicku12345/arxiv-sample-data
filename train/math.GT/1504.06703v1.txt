We construct examples of codimension two hyperbolic link complements in closed smooth 4-manifolds with homeomorphism type \#_{2k}S^2 \times S^2. All our examples are based on a construction of J. Ratcliffe and S. Tschantz, who constructed 1171 non-compact finite volume hyperbolic 4-manifolds of minimal volume. We then give necessary conditions for a closed smooth simply connected 4-manifold to contain a codimension two link complement that admits a hyperbolic structure.
