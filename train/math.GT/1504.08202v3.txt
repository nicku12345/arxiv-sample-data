We consider a homology sphere M_n(K_1,K_2) presented by two knots K_1,K_2 with linking number 1 and framing (0,n). We call the manifold {\it Matsumoto's manifold}. We show that there exists no contractible bound of M_n(T_{2,3},K_2) if n<2\tau(K_2) holds. We also give a formula of Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o's \tau-invariant as the total sum of the Euler numbers of the reduced filtration. We compute the \delta-invariants of the twisted Whitehead doubles of torus knots and correction terms of the branched covers of the Whitehead doubles. By using Owens and Strle's obstruction we show that the 12-twisted Whitehead double of the (2,7)-torus knot and the 20-twisted Whitehead double of the (3,7)-torus knot are not slice but the double branched covers bound rational homology 4-balls. These are the first examples having a gap between sliceness and rational 4-ball bound-ness of the double branched cover.
