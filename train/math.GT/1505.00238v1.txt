This paper concerns the truly or purely cosmetic surgery conjecture. We give a survey on exceptional surgeries and cosmetic surgeries. We prove that the slope of an exceptional truly cosmetic surgery on a hyperbolic knot in S^3 must be \pm 1 and the surgery must be toroidal but not Seifert fibred. As consequence we show that there are no exceptional truly cosmetic surgeries on certain types of hyperbolic knot in S^3. We also give some properties of Heegaard Floer correction terms and torsion invariants for exceptional cosmetic surgeries on S^3.
