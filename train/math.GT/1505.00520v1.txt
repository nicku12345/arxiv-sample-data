In this paper we find infinitely many Mazur type manifolds and corks with shadow complexity one among the 4-manifolds constructed from contractible special polyhedra having one true vertex by using the notion of Turaev's shadow. We also find such manifolds among 4-manifolds constructed from Bing's house. Our manifolds with shadow complexity one contain the Mazur manifolds W^{\pm }(l,k) which were studied by Akbulut and Kirby.
