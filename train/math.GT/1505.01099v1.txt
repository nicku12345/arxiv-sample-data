Let X_0 be a complete borderless infinite area hyperbolic surface. We introduce Thurston's boundary to the Teichm\"uller space T(X_0) of the surface X_0 using Liouville (geodesic) currents. Thurston's boundary to T(X_0) is identified with the space PML_{bdd}(X_0) of projective bounded measured laminations on X_0 which naturally extends Thurston's result for closed surfaces. Moreover, the quasiconformal mapping class group MCG_{qc}(X_0) acts continuously on the closure T(X_0)\cup PML_{bdd}(X_0).
