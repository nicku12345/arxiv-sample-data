We will prove that, for a 2 or 3 component L-space link, HFL^- is completely determined by the multi-variable Alexander polynomial of all the sub-links of L, as well as the pairwise linking numbers of all the components of L. We will also give some restrictions on the multi-variable Alexander polynomial of an L-space link. Finally, we use the methods in this paper to prove a conjecture by Yajing Liu classifying all 2-bridge L-space links.
