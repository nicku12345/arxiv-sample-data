We compute the \mathrm{Pin}(2)-equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer homology of Seifert rational homology three-spheres in terms of their Heegaard Floer homology. As a result of this computation, we prove Manolescu's conjecture that \beta=-\bar{\mu} for Seifert integral homology three-spheres. We show that the Manolescu invariants \alpha, \beta, and \gamma give new obstructions to homology cobordisms between Seifert fiber spaces, and that many Seifert homology spheres \Sigma(a_1,...,a_n) are not homology cobordant to any -\Sigma(b_1,...,b_n). We then use the same invariants to give an example of an integral homology sphere not homology cobordant to any Seifert fiber space. We also show that the \mathrm{Pin}(2)-equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum provides homology cobordism obstructions distinct from \alpha,\beta, and \gamma. In particular, we identify an \mathbb{F}[U]-module called connected Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, whose isomorphism class is a homology cobordism invariant.
