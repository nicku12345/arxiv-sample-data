We give explicit deformations of embeddings of abstractly planar graphs that lie on the standard torus T^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3 and that contain neither a nontrivial knot nor a nonsplit link into the plane. It follows that ravels do not embed on the torus. Our results provide general insight into properties of molecules that are synthesized on a torus.
