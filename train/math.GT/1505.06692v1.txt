Let X be an infinite geodesically complete hyperbolic surface which can be decomposed into geodesic pairs of pants. We introduce Thurston's boundary to the Teichm\"uller space T(X) of the surface X using the length spectrum analogous to Thurston's construction for finite surfaces. Thurston's boundary using the length spectrum of X is a "closure" of projective bounded measured laminations PML_{bdd} (X), and it coincides with PML_{bdd}(X) when X can be decomposed into a countable union of geodesic pairs of pants whose boundary geodesics \{\alpha_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}} have lengths pinched between two positive constants. When a subsequence of the lengths of the boundary curves of the geodesic pairs of pants \{\alpha_n\}_n converges to zero, Thurston's boundary using the length spectrum is strictly larger than PML_{bdd}(X).
