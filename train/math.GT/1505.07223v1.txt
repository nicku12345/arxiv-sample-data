In the bordered Floer theory, gluing thickened torus of positive meridional Dehn twist to the boundary of a knot complement result in the knot complement of increased framing. For a fixed knot K, we construct a direct system of positively framed knot complements and study the direct limit. We also study the morphism space between two type-DD modules, and derive type-DA morphisms from DD morphisms to derive the direct system maps. In addition, we introduce a direct limit invariant from the direct system which can detect non-unstable chains in the type-D module of a knot complement, if the type-D modules of the direct system are obtained by algorithm of Lipshitz, Ozsvath and Thurston.
