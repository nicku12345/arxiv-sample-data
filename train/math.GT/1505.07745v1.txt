Thurston's boundary to the universal Teichm\"uller space T(\mathbb{D}) is the space PML_{bdd}(\mathbb{D}) of projective bounded measured laminations of \mathbb{D}. A geodesic ray in T(\mathbb{D}) is of Teichm\"uller type if it shrinks vertical foliation of an integrable holomorphic quadratic differential. In a prior work we established that each Teichm\"uller geodesic ray limits to a multiple (by the reciprocal of the length of the leaves) of vertical foliation of the quadratic differential.   Certain non-integrable holomorphic quadratic differential induce geodesic rays and we consider their limit points in PML_{bdd}(\mathbb{D}). Somewhat surprisingly, the support of the limiting projective measured laminations might be a geodesic lamination whose leaves are not homotopic to leaves of either vertical or horizontal foliation of the non-integrable holomorphic quadratic differential.
