We will discuss a method for visual presentation of knotted surfaces in the four space, by examining a number and a position of its Morse's critical points. Using this method, we will investigate surface-knot with one critical point of index 1. Then we show infinitely many mutually distinct surface-knots that has an embedding with two critical points of index 1. Next we define a long flat for a banded link for any surface-knot and show diagrammatically a long flat form of n-twist-spun (2,t)-torus knots.
