Tight triangulated manifolds are generalisations of neighborly triangulations of closed surfaces and are interesting objects in Combinatorial Topology. Tight triangulated manifolds are conjectured to be minimal. Except few, all the known tight triangulated manifolds are stacked. It is known that locally stacked tight triangulated manifolds are strongly minimal. Except for three infinite series and neighborly surfaces, very few tight triangulated manifolds are known. From some recent works, we know more on tight triangulation. In this article, we present a survey on the works done on tight triangulation. In Section 2, we state some known results on tight triangulations. In Section 3, we present all the known tight triangulated manifolds. Details are available in the references mentioned there. In Section 1, we present some essential definitions.
