A \textit{multicurve} \C on a closed orientable surface is defined to be a finite collection of disjoint non-isotopic essential simple closed curves. The Dehn twist t_{\C} about \C is the product of the Dehn twists about the individual curves. In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a root of such a Dehn twist, that is, a homeomorphism h such that h^n = t_{\C}. We give combinatorial data that corresponds to such roots, and use it to determine upper bounds for n. Finally, we classify all such roots up to conjugacy for surfaces of genus 3 and 4.
