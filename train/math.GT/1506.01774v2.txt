Let K be a (2p,q)-torus knot and M_n is a 3-manifold obtained by 1/n-Dehn surgery along K. We consider a polynomial whose zeros are the inverses of the Reideimeister torsion of M_n for SL(2;C)-irreducible representations. Johnson gave a formula for the case of the (2,3)-torus knot under some modification and normalization. We generalize this formula by using Tchebychev polynomials.
