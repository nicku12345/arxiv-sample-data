Let S_g be the closed oriented surface of genus g and let \text{Mod}(S_g) be the mapping class group. When the genus is at least 3, \text{Mod}(S_g) can be generated by torsion elements. We prove the follow results. For g \geq 4, \text{Mod}(S_g) can be generated by 4 torsion elements. Three generators are involutions and the forth one is an order 3 element. \text{Mod}(S_3) can be generated by 5 torsion elements. Four generators are involutions and the fifth one is an order 3 element.
