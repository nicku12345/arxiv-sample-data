Conjecturally, there are only finitely many Heegaard Floer L-space knots in S^3 of a given genus. We examine this conjecture for twist families of knots \{K_n\} obtained by twisting a knot K in S^3 along an unknot c in terms of the linking number \omega between K and c. We establish the conjecture in case of |\omega| \neq 1, prove that \{K_n\} contains at most three L-space knots if \omega = 0, and address the case where |\omega| = 1 under an additional hypothesis about Seifert surgeries. To that end, we characterize a twisting circle c for which \{ (K_n, r_n) \} contains at least ten Seifert surgeries. We also pose a few questions about the nature of twist families of L-space knots, their expressions as closures of positive (or negative) braids, and their wrapping about the twisting circle.
