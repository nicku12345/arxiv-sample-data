In this paper we study the typical speed of a generic earthquake trajectory leaving compact sets in the moduli space of the once-punctured torus. Mirzakhani showed that the earthquake flow is measurably equivalent to the horocyclic flow, which has been studied extensively. Our main result shows that the earthquake flow and the horocyclic flow behave very differently in cusp excursions. In particular, we prove a relation between the systole function and continued fractions and discuss the cusp excursions of earthquake trajectories.
