Let S be a closed oriented surface of genus at least 2, and denote by \mathcal{T}(S) its Teichm{\"u}ller space. For any isotopy class of closed curves \gamma, we compute the first three derivatives of the length function \ell\_\gamma:\mathcal{T}(S)\rightarrow\mathbf{R}\_+ in the shearing coordinates associated to a maximal geodesic lamination \lambda. We show that if \gamma intersects every leaf of \lambda, then the Hessian of \ell\_\gamma is positive-definite. We extend this result to length functions of measured laminations. We also provide a method to compute higher derivatives of length functions of geodesics. We use Bonahon's theory of transverse H{\"o}lder distributions and shearing coordinates.
