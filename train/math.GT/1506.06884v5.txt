Let M_{n}\stackrel{\mathbb R P^1}\to M_{n-1}\stackrel{\mathbb R P^1}\to\ldots\stackrel{\mathbb R P^1}\to M_{1}\stackrel{\mathbb R P^1}\to M_0 = \{ \bullet\}  be a sequence of real projective bundles such that M_i\to M_{i-1}, i=1,2,\ldots,n, is a projective bundle of a Whitney sum of a real line bundle L_{i-1} and the trivial line bundle over M_{i-1}. The above sequence is called the real Bott tower and the top manifold M_n is called the real Bott manifold.   There are a few ways to decide whether there exists a Spin-structure on an oriented flat manifold M^n. An oriented flat manifold M^n has a Spin-structure if and only if there exists a homomorphism \epsilon\colon\Gamma\to\operatorname{Spin}(n) such that \lambda_n\epsilon=p, where \lambda_n:\operatorname{Spin}(n)\to\operatorname{SO}(n) is the covering map. There is an equivalent condition for existence of Spin-structure. This is well known that the closed oriented differential manifold M has a Spin-structure if and only if the second Stiefel-Whitney class vanishes.   Our paper is a sequel of A. G\k{a}sior, A. Szczepa\'nski, Flat manifolds with holonomy group Z_2^k of diagonal type, Osaka J. Math. 51 (2014), 1015 - 1025. There are given non-complete conditions of the existence of Spin-structures on real Bott manifolds. In this paper, if k is even, we formulate necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of Spin-structure on real Bott manifolds. Here is our main result   The real Bott manifold M(A) has a Spin-structure if and only for all 1\leq i<j\leq n manifolds M(A_{ij}) have a Spin-structure, where A_{ij} are n\times n-integer matrices with i-th and j-th nonzero rows.
