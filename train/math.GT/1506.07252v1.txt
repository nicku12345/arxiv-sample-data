These are course notes I wrote for my Fall 2013 graduate topics course on geometric structures, taught at ICERM. The notes rework many of proofs in William P. Thurston's beautiful but hard-to-understand paper, "Shapes of Polyhedra". A number of people, both in and out of the class, found these notes very useful and so I decided to put them on the arXiv.
