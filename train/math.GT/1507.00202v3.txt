We consider several classes of knotted objects, namely usual, virtual and welded pure braids and string links, and two equivalence relations on those objects, induced by either self-crossing changes or self-virtualizations. We provide a number of results which point out the differences between these various notions. The proofs are mainly based on the techniques of Gauss diagram formulae.
