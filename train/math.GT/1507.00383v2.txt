Using the conjugation symmetry on Heegaard Floer complexes, we define a three-manifold invariant called involutive Heegaard Floer homology, which is meant to correspond to \mathbb{Z}_4-equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer homology. Further, we obtain two new invariants of homology cobordism, \underline{d} and \bar{d}, and two invariants of smooth knot concordance, \underline{V}_0 and \overline{V}_0. We also develop a formula for the involutive Heegaard Floer homology of large integral surgeries on knots. We give explicit calculations in the case of L-space knots and thin knots. In particular, we show that \underline{V}_0 detects the non-sliceness of the figure-eight knot. Other applications include constraints on which large surgeries on alternating knots can be homology cobordant to other large surgeries on alternating knots.
