We study framed translation surfaces corresponding to meromorphic differentials on compact Riemann surfaces, for which a horizontal separatrix is marked for each pole or zero. Such geometric structures naturally appear when studying flat geometry surfaces "near" the Deligne-Mumford boundary.We compute the number of connected components of the corresponding strata, and give a simple topological invariant that distinguishes them. In particular we see that for g>0, there are at most two such components, except in the hyperelliptic case.
