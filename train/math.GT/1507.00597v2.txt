We show that the Witten genus of a string manifold M vanishes, if there is an effective action of a torus T on M such that \dim T>b_2(M). We apply this result to study group actions on M\times G/T, where G is a compact connected Lie group and T a maximal torus of G.   Moreover, we use the methods which are needed to prove these results to the study of torus manifolds. We show that up to diffeomorphism there are only finitely many quasitoric manifolds M with the same cohomology ring as #_{i=1}^k \pm\mathbb{C} P^n with k<n.
