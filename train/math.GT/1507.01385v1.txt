J.P. Levine introduced a clover link to investigate the indeterminacy of the Milnor invariants of a link. It is shown that for a clover link, the Milnor numbers of length at most 2k+1 are well-defined if those of length at most k vanish, and that the Milnor numbers of length at least 2k+2 are not well-defined if those of length k+1 survive. For a clover link c with the Milnor numbers of length at most k vanishing, we show that the Milnor number \mu_c(I) for a sequence I is well-defined up to the greatest common devisor of \mu_{c}(J)'s, where J is a subsequence of I obtained by removing at least k+1 indices. Moreover, if I is a non-repeated sequence with length 2k+2, the possible range of \mu_c(I) is given explicitly. As an application, we give an edge-homotopy classification of 4-clover links.
