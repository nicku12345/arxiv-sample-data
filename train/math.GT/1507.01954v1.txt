The \textit{volume density} of a hyperbolic link K is defined to be the ratio of the hyperbolic volume of K to the crossing number of K. We show that there are sequences of non-alternating links with volume density approaching v_8, where v_8 is the volume of the ideal hyperbolic octahedron. We show that the set of volume densities is dense in [0,v_8]. The \textit{determinant density} of a link K is [2 \pi \log \det(K)]/c(K). We prove that the closure of the set of determinant densities contains the set [0, v_8].
