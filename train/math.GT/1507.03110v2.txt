We consider a random link, which is defined as the closure of a braid obtained from a random walk on the braid group. For such a random link, the expected value for the number of components was calculated by Jiming Ma. In this paper, we determine the most expected number of components for a random link, and further, consider the most expected partition of the number of strings for a random braid.
