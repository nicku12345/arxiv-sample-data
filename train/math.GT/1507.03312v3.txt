In this paper we compute the automorphism groups \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{P}_n(\Sigma)) and \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{B}_n(\Sigma)) of braid groups \mathbf{P}_n(\Sigma) and \mathbf{B}_n(\Sigma) on every orientable surface \Sigma, which are isomorphic to group extensions of the extended mapping class group \mathcal{M}^*_n(\Sigma) by the transvection subgroup except for a few cases.   We also prove that \mathbf{P}_n(\Sigma) is always a characteristic subgroup of \mathbf{B}_n(\Sigma) unless \Sigma is a twice-punctured sphere and n=2.
