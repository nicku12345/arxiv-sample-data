In a previous paper Kobayashi and Rieck defined the growth rate of the tunnel number of a knot K, a knot invariant that measures the asymptotic behavior of the tunnel number under iterated connected sum of K. We denote the growth rate by \mbox{gr}_t(K).   In this paper we construct, for any \epsilon > 0, a hyperbolic knots K \subset S^{3} for which 1 - \epsilon < \mbox{gr}_t(K) < 1. This is the first proof that the spectrum of the growth rate of the tunnel number is infinite.
