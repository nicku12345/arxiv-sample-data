In 1976 Thurston associated to a 3-manifold N a marked polytope in H_1(N;\mathbb{R}), which measures the minimal complexity of surfaces representing homology classes and determines all fibered classes in H^1(N;\mathbb{R}). Recently the first and the last author associated to a presentation \pi with two generators and one relator a marked polytope in H_1(\pi;\mathbb{R}) and showed that it determines the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariant of \pi. In this paper, we show that if the fundamental group of a 3-manifold N admits such a presentation \pi, then the corresponding marked polytopes in H_1(N;\mathbb{R})=H_1(\pi;\mathbb{R}) agree.
