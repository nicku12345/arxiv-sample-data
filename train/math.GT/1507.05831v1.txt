Let X be an infinite hyperbolic surface endowed with an upper bounded geodesic pants decomposition. Alessandrini, Liu, Papadopoulos, Su and Sun \cite{ALPSS}, \cite{ALPS} parametrized the quasiconformal Teichm\"uller space T_{qc}(X) and the length spectrum Teichm\"uller space T_{ls}(X) using the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates. A quasiconformal map f:X\to Y is said to be {\it asymptotically conformal} if its Beltrami coefficient \mu =\bar{\partial}f/\partial f converges to zero at infinity. The space of all asymptotically conformal maps up to homotopy and post-composition by conformal maps is called "little" Teichm\"uller space T_0(X). We find a parametrization of T_0(X) using the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates and a parametrization of the closure \overline{T_0(X)} of T_0(X) in the length spectrum metric. We also prove that the quotients AT(X)=T_{qc}(X)/T_0(X), T_{ls}(X)/\overline{T_{qc}(X)} and T_{ls}(X)/\overline{T_0(X)} are contractible in the Teichm\"uller metric and the length spectrum metric, respectively. Finally, we show that the Wolpert's lemma on the lengths of simple closed geodesics under quasiconformal maps is not sharp.
