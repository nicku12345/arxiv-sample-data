We construct a braid conjugacy class invariant \kappa by refining Plamenevskaya's transverse element \psi in Khovanov homology via the annular grading. While \kappa is not an invariant of transverse links, it distinguishes some braids whose closures share the same classical invariants but are not transversely isotopic. Using \kappa we construct an obstruction to negative destabilization (stronger than \psi) and a solution to the word problem in braid groups. Also, \kappa is a lower bound on the length of the spectral sequence from annular Khovanov homology to Khovanov homology, and we obtain concrete examples in which this spectral sequence does not collapse immediately. In addition, we study these constructions in reduced Khovanov homology and illustrate that the two reduced versions are fundamentally different with respect to the annular filtration.
