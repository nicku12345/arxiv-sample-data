For a finite simplicial graph \Gamma, let G(\Gamma) denote the right-angled Artin group on the complement graph of \Gamma. In this article, we introduce the notions of "induced path lifting property" and "semi-induced path lifting property" for immersions between graphs, and obtain graph theoretical criteria for the embedability between right-angled Artin groups. We recover the result of S.-h.{} Kim and T.{} Koberda that an arbitrary G(\Gamma) admits a quasi-isometric group embedding into G(T) for some finite tree T. The upper bound on the number of vertices of T is improved from 2^{2^{(m-1)^2}} to m2^{m-1}, where m is the number of vertices of \Gamma. We also show that the upper bound on the number of vertices of T is at least 2^{m/4}. Lastly, we show that G(C_m) embeds in G(P_n) for n\geqslant 2m-2, where C_m and P_n denote the cycle and path graphs on m and n vertices, respectively.
