Quasitoric manifolds, introduced by M. Davis and T. Januskiewicz in 1991, are topological generalizations of smooth complex projective spaces. In 1992, Banchoff and K\"uhnel constructed a 10-vertex equilibrium triangulations of \CP^2. We generalize this construction for quasitoric manifolds and construct some equilibrium triangulations of 4-dimensional quasitoric manifolds. In some cases, our constructions give vertex minimal equilibrium triangulations.
