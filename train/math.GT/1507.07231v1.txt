Suppose K is a knot in S^3 with bridge number n and bridge distance greater than 2n. We show that there are at most {2n\choose n} distinct minimal genus Heegaard splittings of S^3\setminus\eta(K). These splittings can be divided into two families. Two splittings from the same family become equivalent after at most one stabilization. If K has bridge distance at least 4n, then two splittings from different families become equivalent only after n-1 stabilizations. Further, we construct representatives of the isotopy classes of the minimal tunnel systems for K corresponding to these Heegaard surfaces.
