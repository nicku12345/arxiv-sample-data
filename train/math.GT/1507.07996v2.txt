A symmetric union of two knots is a classical construction in knot theory which generalizes connected sum, introduced by Kinoshita and Terasaka in the 1950s. We study this construction for the purpose of finding an infinite family of hyperbolic non-fibered three-bridge knots of constant determinant which satisfy the well-known cosmetic crossing conjecture. This conjecture asserts that the only crossing changes which preserve the isotopy type of a knot are nugatory.
