The difference between slice and doubly-slice knots is reflected in algebra by the difference between metabolic and hyperbolic Blanchfield linking forms. We exploit this algebraic distinction to refine the classical Witt group of linking forms by defining a `double Witt group' of linking forms. We calculate the double Witt group for Dedekind domains and precisely determine its relationship to the classical Witt group. Finally, we prove that the double Witt group of Seifert forms is isomorphic to the double Witt group of Blanchfield forms.
