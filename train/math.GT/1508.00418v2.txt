We provide the optimal linear bound for the signature of positive four-braids in terms of the three-genus of their closures. As a consequence, we improve previously known linear bounds for the signature in terms of the first Betti number for all positive braid links. We obtain our results by combining bounds for positive three-braids with Gordon and Litherland's approach to signature via unoriented surfaces and their Goeritz forms. Examples of families of positive four-braids for which the bounds are sharp are provided.
