The aim of this text is to provide an elementary and self-contained exposition of Gromov's argument on topological overlap (the presentation is based on Gromov's work, as well as two follow-up papers of Matousek and Wagner, and of Dotterrer, Kaufman and Wagner). We also discuss a simple generalization in which the vertices are weighted according to some probability distribution. This allows to use von Neumann's minimax theorem to deduce a dual statement.
