The Heegaard Floer correction term (d-invariant) is an invariant of rational homology 3-spheres equipped with a Spin^c structure. In particular, the correction term of 1-surgeries along knots in S^3 is a (2\mathbb{Z}-valued) knot concordance invariant d_1. In this paper, we estimate d_1 for the (2,q)-cable of any knot K. This estimate does not depend on the knot type of K. If K belongs to a certain class which contains all negative knots, then equality holds. As a corollary, we show that the relationship between d_1 and the Heegaard Floer \tau-invariant is very weak in general.
