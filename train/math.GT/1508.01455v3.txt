We study the four-genus of linear combinations of torus knots: aT(p,q) # -bT(p',q'). Fixing positive p, q, p', and q', our focus is on the behavior of the four-genus as a function of positive a and b. Three types of examples are presented: in the first, for all a and b the four-genus is completely determined by the Tristram-Levine signature function; for the second, the recently defined Upsilon function of Ozsvath-Stipsicz-Szabo determines the four-genus for all a and b; for the third, a surprising interplay between signatures and Upsilon appears.
