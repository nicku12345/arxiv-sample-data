We prove the following well known conjecture: let \Sigma be an oriented surface of finite type whose fundamental group is a nonabelian free group. Let \phi \in \textup{Mod}(\Sigma) be a an infinite order mapping class. Then there exists a finite solvable cover \widehat{\Sigma} \to \Sigma, and a lift \widehat{\phi} of \phi such that the action of \widehat{\phi} on H_1(\widehat{\Sigma}, \mathbb{Z}) has infinite order. Our main tools are the theory of homological shadows, which was previously developed by the author, and Fourier analysis
