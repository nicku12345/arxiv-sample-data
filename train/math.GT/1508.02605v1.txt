In this paper we classify maps from a torus phase space X to \mathcal{H}_n^*, the space of n \times n, non-singular hermitian operators up to equivariant homotopy. The equivariance is with respect to a time-reversal involution on X and an involution on \mathcal{H}_n^* defining a certain symmetry class. Furthermore we study certain controlled degenerations of such maps and describe how one can implement jumps from one homotopy class to another while allowing only "small" degenerations.
