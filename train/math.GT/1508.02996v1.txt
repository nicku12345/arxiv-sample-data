We study the concept of coarse disjointness and large scale n-to-1 functions. As a byproduct, we obtain an Ostrand-type characterization of asymptotic dimension for coarse structures. It is shown that properties like finite asymptotic dimension, coarse finitism, large scale weak paracompactness, ect. are all invariants of coarsely n-to-1 functions. Metrizability of large scale structures is also investigated.
