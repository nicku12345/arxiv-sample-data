The Kinoshita graph is the most famous example of a Brunnian theta graph, a nontrivial spatial theta graph with the property that removing any edge yields an unknot. We produce a new family of diagrams of spatial theta graphs with the property that removing any edge results in the unknot. The family is parameterized by a certain subgroup of the pure braid group on four strands. We prove that infinitely many of these diagrams give rise to non-isotopic Brunnian theta graphs.
