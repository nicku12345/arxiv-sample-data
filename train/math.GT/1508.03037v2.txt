We examine the relationship between the (untwisted) knot Floer cube of resolutions and HOMFLY-PT homology. By using a filtration induced by additional basepoints on the Heegaard diagram for a knot K, we see that the filtered complex decomposes as a direct sum of HOMFLY-PT homologies of various subdiagrams. Jaeger's composition product formula shows that the graded Euler characteristic of this direct sum is the HOMFLY-PT polynomial of K.
