In the previous paper the author defined an infinite order plug (P,\varphi) which gives rise to infinite Fintushel-Stern's knot-surgeries. Here, we give two 4-dimensional infinitely many exotic families Y_n, Z_n of exotic enlargements of the plug. The families Y_n, Z_n have b_2=3, 4 and the boundaries are 3-manifolds with b_1=1, 0 respectively. We give a plug (or g-cork) twist (P,\varphi_{p,q}) producing the 2-bridge knot or link surgery by combining the plug (P,\varphi). As a further example, we describe a 4-dimensional twist (M,\mu) between knot-surgeries for two mutant knots. The twisted double concerning (M,\mu) gives a candidate of exotic \#^2S^2\times S^2.
