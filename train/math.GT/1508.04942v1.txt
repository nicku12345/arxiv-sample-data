This paper considers "geometric" ideal triangulations of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds, i.e. decompositions into positive volume ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra. We exhibit infinitely many geometric ideal triangulations of the figure eight knot complement. As far as we know, this is the first construction of infinitely many geometric triangulations of a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold. In contrast, our approach does not extend to the figure eight sister manifold, and it is unknown if there are infinitely many geometric triangulations for this manifold.
