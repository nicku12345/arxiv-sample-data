We consider a class of manifolds with torus boundary admitting bordered Heegaard Floer homology of a particularly simple form, namely, the type D structure may be described graphically by a disjoint union of loops. We develop a calculus for studying bordered invariants of this form and, in particular, provide a complete description of slopes giving rise to L-space Dehn fillings as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for L-spaces resulting from identifying two such manifolds along their boundaries. As an application, we show that Seifert fibered spaces with torus boundary fall into this class, leading to a proof that, among graph manifolds containing a single JSJ torus, the property of being an L-space is equivalent to non-left-orderability of the fundamental group and to the non-existence of a coorientable taut foliation.
