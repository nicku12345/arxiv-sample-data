The purpose of this paper is to discuss how topology and geometry provide, in many instances, the connective tissue that enables logical comprehension. We illustrate this theme with many examples including Venn diagrams, knot diagrams, knot-logical diagrams and an arrow of reference that elucidates self-reference and Goedelian self-reference.
