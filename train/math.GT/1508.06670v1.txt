We define a family of virtual knots generalizing the classical twist knots. We develop a recursive formula for the Alexander polynomial \Delta_0 (as defined by Silver and Williams) of these virtual twist knots. These results are applied to provide evidence for a conjecture that the odd writhe of a virtual knot can be obtained from \Delta_0.
