Let M be an orientable, irreducible 3-manifold admitting a weakly reducible genus three Heegaard splitting as a minimal genus Heegaard splitting. In this article, we prove that if [f], [g]\in Mod(M) give the same correspondence between two isotopy classes of generalized Heegaard splittings consisting of two Heegaard splittings of genus two, say [\mathbf{H}]\to[\mathbf{H}'], then there exists a representative h of the difference [h]=[g]\cdot[f]^{-1} such that (i) h preserves a suitably chosen embedding of the Heegaard surface F' obtained by amalgamation from \mathbf{H}' which is a representative of [\mathbf{H}'] and (ii) h sends a uniquely determined weak reducing pair (V',W') of F' into itself up to isotopy. Moreover, for every orientation-preserving automorphism \tilde{h} satisfying the previous conditions (i) and (ii), there exist two elements of Mod(M) giving correspondence [\mathbf{H}]\to[\mathbf{H}'] such that \tilde{h} belongs to the isotopy class of the difference between them.
