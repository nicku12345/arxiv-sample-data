We give new examples of 2-component links with linking number one and unknotted components that are topologically concordant to the positive Hopf link, but not smoothly so - in fact they are not smoothly concordant to the positive Hopf link with a knot tied in the first component. Such examples were previously constructed by Cha-Kim-Ruberman-Strle; we show that our examples are distinct from theirs.
