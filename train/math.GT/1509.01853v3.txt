In this article we construct a family of genus two Lefschetz fibrations f_{n}: X_{\theta_n} \rightarrow \mathbb{S}^{2} with e(X_{\theta_n})=11, b^{+}_{2}(X_{\theta_n})=1, and c_1^{2}(X_{\theta_n})=1 by applying a single lantern substitution to the twisted fiber sums of Matsumoto's genus two Lefschetz fibration over \mathbb{S}^2. Moreover, we compute the fundamental group of X_{\theta_n} and show that it is isomorphic to the trivial group if n = -3 or -1, \mathbb{Z} if n =-2, and \mathbb{Z}_{|n+2|} for all integers n\neq -3, -2, -1. Also, we prove that our fibrations admit -2 section, show that their total space are symplectically minimal, and have the symplectic Kodaira dimension \kappa = 2. In addition, using the techniques developed in \cite{A, AP1, ABP, AP2, AZ, AO}, we also construct the genus two Lefschetz fibrations over \mathbb{S}^2 with c_1^{2} = 1, 2 and \chi = 1 via the fiber sums of Matsumoto's and Xiao's genus two Lefschetz fibrations, and present some applications in constructing exotic smooth structures on small 4-manifolds with b^{+}_{2} = 1 and b^{+}_{2} = 3.
