Let X be the space of isometry classes of ordered sextuples of points in the hyperbolic plane such that the product of the six corresponding rotations of angle \pi is the identity. This space X is closely related to the PSL_2(\mathbb{R})-character variety of the genus 2 surface \Sigma. In this article we study the topology and the natural symplectic structure on X, and we describe the action of the mapping class group of \Sigma on X. This completes the classification of the ergodic components of the character variety in genus 2 initiated in our previous work.
