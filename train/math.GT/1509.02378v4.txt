The potential function of the optimistic limit of the colored Jones polynomial and the construction of the solution of the hyperbolicity equations were defined in the authors' previous articles. In this article, we define the Reidemeister transformations of the potential function and the solution by the changes of them under the Reidemeister moves of the link diagram and show the explicit formulas. These two formulas enable us to see the changes of the complex volume formula under the Reidemeister moves. As an application, we can simply specify the discrete faithful representation of the link group by showing a link diagram and one geometric solution.
