We establish some facts about the behavior of the rational-geometric subvariety of the SL_2(\c) or PSL_2(\c) character variety of a hyperbolic knot manifold under the restriction map to the SL_2(\c) or PSL_2(\c) character variety of the boundary torus, and use the results to get some properties about the A-polynomials and to prove the AJ conjecture for certain class of knots in S^3 including in particular any 2-bridge knot over which the double branched cover of S^3 is a lens space of prime order.
