Consider a three dimensional cusped spherical \mathrm{CR} manifold M and suppose that the holonomy representation of \pi_1(M) can be deformed in such a way that the peripheral holonomy is generated by a non-parabolic element. We prove that, in this case, there is a spherical \mathrm{CR} structure on some Dehn surgeries of M. The result is very similar to R. Schwartz's spherical \mathrm{CR} Dehn surgery theorem, but has weaker hypotheses and does not give the unifomizability of the structure. We apply our theorem in the case of the Deraux-Falbel structure on the Figure Eight knot complement and obtain spherical \mathrm{CR} structures on all Dehn surgeries of slope -3 + r for r \in \mathbb{Q}^{+} small enough.
