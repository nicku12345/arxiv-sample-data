In this paper, we first classify singular fibers of proper C^\infty stable maps of 3-dimensional manifolds with boundary into surfaces. Then, we compute the cohomology groups of the associated universal complex of singular fibers, and obtain certain cobordism invariants for Morse functions on compact surfaces with boundary.
