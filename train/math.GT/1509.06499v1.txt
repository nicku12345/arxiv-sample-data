We show that the Teichm\"uller space of a surface without boundary and with punctures, equipped with Thurston's metric is the limit (in an appropriate sense) of Teichm\"uller spaces of surfaces with boundary, equipped with their arc metrics, when the boundary lengths tend to zero. We use this to obtain a result on the translation distances for mapping classes for their actions on Teichm\"uller spaces equipped with their arc metrics.
