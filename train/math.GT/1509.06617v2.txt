We show that, if the local dimension of the branch set of a discrete and open mapping f\colon M\to N between n-manifolds is less than (n-2) at a point y of the image of the branch set fB_f, then the local monodromy of f at y is perfect. In particular, for generalized branched covers between n-manifolds the dimension of fB_f is exactly (n-2) at the points of abelian local monodromy. As an application, we show that a generalized branched covering f\colon M \to N of local multiplicity at most three between n-manifolds is either a covering or fB_f has local dimension (n-2).
