We describe how to formulate Khovanov's functor-valued invariant of tangles in the language of bordered Heegaard Floer homology. We then give an alternate construction of Lawrence Roberts' Type D and Type A structures in Khovanov homology, and his algebra \mathcal{B}\Gamma_n, in terms of Khovanov's theory of modules over the ring H^n. We reprove invariance and pairing properties of Roberts' bordered modules in this language. Along the way, we obtain an explicit generators-and-relations description of H^n which may be of independent interest.
