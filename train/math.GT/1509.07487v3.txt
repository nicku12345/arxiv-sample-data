Let M_\phi be a surface bundle over a circle with monodromy \phi:S \rightarrow S. We study deformations of certain reducible representations of \pi_1(M_\phi) into \text{SL}(n,\mathbb{C}), obtained by composing a reducible representation into \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{C}) with the irreducible representation \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{C}) \rightarrow \text{SL}(n,\mathbb{C}). In particular, we show that under certain conditions on the eigenvalues of \phi^*, the reducible representation is contained in a (n+1+k)(n-1) dimensional component of the representation variety, where k is the number of components of \partial M_\phi. This result applies to mapping tori of pseudo-Anosov maps with orientable invariant foliations whenever 1 is not an eigenvalue of the induced map on homology, where the reducible representation is also a limit of irreducible representations.
