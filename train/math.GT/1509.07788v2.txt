We prove a folklore theorem of W. Thurston which provides necessary and sufficient conditions for primality of a certain class of theta-curves. Namely, a theta-curve in the 3-sphere with an unknotted constituent knot U is prime if and only if lifting the third arc of the theta-curve to the double branched cover over U produces a prime knot. We apply this result to Kinoshita's theta-curve.
