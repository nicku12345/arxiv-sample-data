We study the (relative) SL(2,C) character varieties of the three-holed projective plane and the action of the mapping class group on them. We describe a domain of discontinuity for this action, which strictly contains the set of primitive stable representations defined by Minsky, and also the set of convex-cocompact characters. We consider the relationship with the previous work of the authors and S. P. Tan on the character variety of the four-holed sphere.
