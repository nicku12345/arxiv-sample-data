Suppose that \mathcal F is a transversely oriented, codimension one foliation of a connected, closed, oriented 3-manifold. Suppose also that \mathcal F has continuous tangent plane field and is {\sl taut}; that is, closed smooth transversals to \mathcal F pass through every point of M. We show that if \mathcal F is not the product foliation S^1\times S^2, then \mathcal F can be C^0 approximated by weakly symplectically fillable, universally tight, contact structures. This extends work of Eliashberg-Thurston on approximations of taut, transversely oriented C^2 foliations to the class of foliations that often arise in branched surface constructions of foliations. This allows applications of contact topology and Floer theory beyond the category of C^2 foliated spaces.
