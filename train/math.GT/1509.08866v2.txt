For an irreducible orientable compact 3-manifold N with empty or incompressible toral boundary, the full L^2--Alexander torsion \tau^{(2)}(N,\phi)(t) associated to any real first cohomology class \phi of N is represented by a function of a positive real variable t. The paper shows that \tau^{(2)}(N,\phi) is continuous, everywhere positive, and asymptotically monomial in both ends. Moreover, the degree of \tau^{(2)}(N,\phi) equals the Thurston norm of \phi. The result confirms a conjecture of J.~Dubois, S.~Friedl, and W.~L\"uck and addresses a question of W.~Li and W.~Zhang. Associated to any admissible homomorphism \gamma:\pi_1(N)\to G, the L^2--Alexander torsion \tau^{(2)}(N,\gamma,\phi) is shown to be continuous and everywhere positive provided that G is residually finite and (N,\gamma) is weakly acyclic. In this case, a generalized degree can be assigned to \tau^{(2)}(N,\gamma,\phi). Moreover, the generalized degree is bounded by the Thurston norm of \phi.
