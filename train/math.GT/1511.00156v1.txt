The n-solvable filtration of the m-component smooth (string) link concordance group, \dots \subset \mathcal{F}^m_{n+1} \subset \mathcal{F}^m_{n.5} \subset \mathcal{F}^m_n \dots \subset \mathcal{F}^m_1 \subset \mathcal{F}^m_{0.5} \subset \mathcal{F}^m_0 \subset \mathcal{F}^m_{-0.5} \subset \mathcal{C}^m, as defined by Cochran, Orr, and Teichner, is a tool for studying smooth knot and link concordance that yields important results in low-dimensional topology. The focus of this paper is to give a characterization of the set of 0-solvable links. We introduce a new equivalence relation on links called 0-solve equivalence and establish both an algebraic and a geometric classification of \mathbb{L}_0^m, the set of links up to 0-solve equivalence. We show that \mathbb{L}_0^m has a group structure isomorphic to the quotient \mathcal{F}_{-0.5}/\mathcal{F}_0 of concordance classes of string links and classify this group, showing that \mathbb{L}_0^m \cong \mathcal{F}_{-0.5}^m/\mathcal{F}_0^m \cong \mathbb{Z}_2^m \oplus \mathbb{Z}^{m \choose 3} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_2^{m \choose 2}. Finally, using results of Conant, Schneiderman, and Teichner, we show that 0-solvable links are precisely the links that bound class 2 gropes and support order 2 Whitney towers in the 4-ball.
