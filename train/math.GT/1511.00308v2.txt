The traceless SU(2) character variety R(S^2,\{a_i,b_i\}_{i=1}^n) of a 2n-punctured 2-sphere is the symplectic reduction of a Hamiltonian n-torus action on the SU(2) character variety of a closed surface of genus n. It is stratified with a finite singular stratum and a top smooth symplectic stratum of dimension 4n-6.   For generic holonomy perturbations \pi, the traceless SU(2) character variety R_\pi(Y,L) of an n-stranded tangle L in a homology 3-ball Y is stratified with a finite singular stratum and top stratum a smooth manifold. The restriction to R(S^2, 2n) is a Lagrangian immersion which preserves the cone neighborhood structure near the singular stratum.   For generic holonomy perturbations \pi, the variant R_\pi^\natural(Y,L), obtained by taking the connected sum of L with a Hopf link and considering SO(3) representations with w_2 supported near the extra component, is a smooth compact manifold without boundary of dimension 2n-3, which Lagrangian immerses into the smooth stratum of R(S^2,\{a_i,b_i\}_{i=1}^n).   The proofs of these assertions consist of stratified transversality arguments to eliminate non-generic strata in the character variety and to insure that the restriction map to the boundary character variety is also generic.   The main tool introduced to establish abundance of holonomy perturbations is the use of holonomy perturbations along curves C in a cylinder F\times I, where F is a closed surface. When C is obtained by pushing an embedded curve on F into the cylinder, we prove that the corresponding holonomy perturbation induces one of Goldman's generalized Hamiltonian twist flows on the SU(2) character variety \mathcal{M}(F) associated to the curve C.
