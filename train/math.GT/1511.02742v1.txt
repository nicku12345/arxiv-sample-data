The structure of the Khovanov homology of (n,m) torus links has been extensively studied. In particular, Marko Stosic proved that the homology groups stabilize as m\rightarrow\infty. We show that the Khovanov homotopy types of (n,m) torus links, as constructed by Robert Lipshitz and Sucharit Sarkar, also become stably homotopy equivalent as m\rightarrow\infty. We provide an explicit bound on values of m beyond which the stabilization begins. As an application, we give new examples of torus links with non-trivial Sq^2 action.
