We study the group of leafwise holomorphic smooth automorphisms of Reeb components of leafwise complex foliation which are obtained by a certain Hopf construction. In particular, in the case where the boundary holonomy is infinitely tangent to the identity, we determine the structure of the group of leafwise holomorphic automorphisms.
