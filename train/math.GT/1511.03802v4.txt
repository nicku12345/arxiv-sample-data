We show that if M and N have the same homotopy type of simply connected closed smooth m-manifolds such that the integral and mod-2 cohomologies of M vanish in odd degrees, then their homotopy inertia groups are equal. Let M^{2n} be a closed (n-1)-connected 2n-dimensional smooth manifold. We show that, for n=4, the homotopy inertia group of M^{2n} is trivial and if n=8 and H^n(M^{2n};\mathbb{Z})\cong \mathbb{Z}, the homotopy inertia group of M^{2n} is also trivial. We further compute the group \mathcal{C}(M^{2n}) of concordance classes of smoothings of M^{2n} for n=8. Finally, we show that if a smooth manifold N is tangentially homotopy equivalent to M^8, then N is diffeomorphic to the connected sum of M^8 and a homotopy 8-sphere.
