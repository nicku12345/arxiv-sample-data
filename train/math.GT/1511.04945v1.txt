We give a topological characterisation of alternating knot exteriors based on the presence of special spanning surfaces. This shows that alternating is a topological property of the knot exterior and not just a property of diagrams, answering an old question of Fox. We also give a characterisation of alternating link exteriors which have marked meridians. We then describe a normal surface algorithm which can decide if a knot is prime and alternating given a triangulation of its exterior as input.
