We establish a characterization of alternating links in terms of definite spanning surfaces. We apply it to obtain a new proof of Tait's conjecture that reduced alternating diagrams of the same link have the same crossing number and writhe. We also deduce a result of Banks and Hirasawa-Sakuma about Seifert surfaces for special alternating links. The appendix, written by Juh\'asz and Lackenby, applies the characterization to derive an exponential time algorithm for alternating knot recognition.
