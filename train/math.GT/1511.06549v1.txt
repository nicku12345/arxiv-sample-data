Let M be a manifold or (more generally) a locally compact, metrizable ANR. If K is an attractor for a flow in M, with basin of attraction \mathcal{A}(K), it is well known that the inclusion i : K \subseteq \mathcal{A}(K) is always a shape equivalence. In this paper we investigate to what extent this generalizes to discrete dynamical systems generated by homeomorphisms, proving that it holds if (and only if) K has polyhedral shape. Then we specialize to the case when M is a manifold of dimension \leq 3.
