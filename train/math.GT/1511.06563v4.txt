A pair of distinct free homotopy classes of closed curves in an orientable surface F with negative Euler characteristic is said to be length equivalent if for any hyperbolic structure on F, the length of the geodesic representative of one class is equal to the length of the geodesic representative of the other class. Suppose \alpha and \beta are two intersecting oriented closed curves on F and P and Q are any two intersection points between them. If the two terms \langle\alpha *_P\beta\rangle and \langle\alpha*_Q\beta\rangle in [\langle\alpha\rangle,\langle\beta\rangle], the Goldman bracket between them, are the same, then we construct infinitely many pairs of length equivalent curves in F. These pairs correspond to the terms of the Goldman bracket between a power of \alpha and \beta. As a special case, our construction shows that given a self-intersecting geodesic \alpha of F and any self-intersection point P of \alpha, we get a sequence of such pairs. Furthermore if \alpha is a filling curve then these pairs are also filling.
