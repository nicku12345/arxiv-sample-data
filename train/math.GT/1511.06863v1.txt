A dessin is a 2-cell embedding of a connected bipartite graph into an orientable closed surface. An automorphism of a dessin is a permutation of the edges of the underlying graph which preserves the colouring of the vertices and extends to an orientation-preserving self-homeomorphism of the supporting surface. A dessin is regular if its automorphism group is transitive on the edges, and a regular dessin is totally symmetric if it is invariant under all dessin operations. Thus totally symmetric dessins possesses the highest level of external symmetry. In this paper we present a classification of totally symmetric dessins with a nilpotent automorphism group of class three
