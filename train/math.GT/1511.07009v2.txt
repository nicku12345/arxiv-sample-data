A pretzel knot K is called odd if all its twist parameters are odd, and mutant ribbon if it is mutant to a simple ribbon knot. We prove that the family of odd, 5-stranded pretzel knots satisfies a weaker version of the Slice-Ribbon Conjecture: All slice, odd, 5-stranded pretzel knots are mutant ribbon. We do this in stages by first showing that 5-stranded pretzel knots having twist parameters with all the same sign or with exactly one parameter of a different sign have infinite order in the topological knot concordance group, and thus in the smooth knot concordance group as well. Next, we show that any odd, 5-stranded pretzel knot with zero pairs or with exactly one pair of canceling twist parameters is not slice.
