In the 60's Levine proved that if R is a slice knot, then on any genus g Seifert surface for R there is a g component link J, called a derivative of R, on which the Seifert form vanishes. Many subsequent obstructions to R being slice are given in terms of slice obstructions of J. Many of these obstructions can be derived from a 4-manifold called a null-bordism. Recently the authors proved that that it is possible for R to be slice without J being slice, disproving a conjecture of Kauffmann from the 80's. In this paper we cut open these null-bordisms in order to derive new obstructions to being the derivative of a slice knot. As a proof of the strength of this approach we re-derive a signature condition due to Daryl Cooper. Our results also apply to doubling operators, giving new evidence for their weak injectivity. We close with a new sufficient condition for a genus 1 algebraically slice knot to be 1.5-solvable.
