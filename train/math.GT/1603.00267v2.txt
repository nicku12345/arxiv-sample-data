Every classical knot is band-pass equivalent to the unknot or the trefoil. The band-pass class of a knot is a concordance invariant. Every ribbon knot, for example, is band-pass equivalent to the unknot. Here we introduce the long virtual knot concordance group \mathscr{VC}. It is shown that for every concordance class [K] \in \mathscr{VC}, there is a J \in [K] that is not band-pass equivalent to K and an L \in [K] that is not band-pass equivalent to either the long unknot or any long trefoil. This is accomplished by proving that v_{2,1}+v_{2,2} \pmod 2 is a band-pass invariant but not a concordance invariant of long virtual knots, where v_{2,1} and v_{2,2} generate the degree two Polyak group for long virtual knots.
