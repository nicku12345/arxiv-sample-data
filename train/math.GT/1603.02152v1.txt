For arbitrary integer n, we describe a large class of right-angled Coxeter systems for which the visual baundary (of the corresponding Coxeter-Davis complex) is homeomorphic to the n-dimensional Sierpi\'nski compactum. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a planar simplicial complex L under which the right-angled Coxeter system whose nerve is L has the visual boundary homeomorphic to the Sierpi\'nski curve.
