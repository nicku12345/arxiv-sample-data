The first algorithm for sampling the space of thick equilateral knots, as a function of thickness, will be described. This algorithm is based on previous algorithms of applying random reflections.   To prove the existence of the algorithm, we describe a method for turning any knot into the regular planar polygon using only thickness non-decreasing moves. This approach ensures that the algorithm has a positive probability of connecting any two knots with the required thickness constraint and so is ergodic. This ergodic sampling unlocks the ability to analyze the effects of thickness on properties of the geometric knot such as radius of gyration.   This algorithm will be shown to be faster than previous methods for generating thick knots, and the data from this algorithm shows that the radius of gyration increases strongly with thickness and that the growth exponent for radius of gyration increases with thickness.
