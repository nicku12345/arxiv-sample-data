In this paper, it is shown that for any closed orientable 3-manifold with positive simplicial volume, the growth of the Seifert volume of its finite covers is faster than the linear rate. In particular, each closed orientable 3-manifold with positive simplicial volume has virtually positive Seifert volume. The result reveals certain fundamental difference between the representation volume of the hyperbolic type and the Seifert type. The proof is based on developments and reactions of recent results on virtual domination and on virtual representation volumes of 3-manifolds.
