By studying the Seiberg-Witten equations on end-periodic manifolds, we give an obstruction on the existence of positive scalar curvature metric on compact 4-manifolds with the same homology as S^{1}\times S^{3}. This obstruction is given in terms of the relation between the Fr{\o}yshov invariant of the generator of H_{3}(X;Z) with the 4-dimensional Casson invariant \lambda_{SW}(X) defined by Mrowka-Ruberman-Saveliev. Along the way, we develop a framework that can be useful in further study of the Seiberg-Witten theory on general end-periodic manifolds.
