In 1976, Thurston proved that taut foliations on closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds have Euler class of norm at most one, and conjectured that conversely, any integral second cohomology class with norm equal to one is the Euler class of a taut foliation. This is the first from a series of two papers that together give a negative answer to Thurston's conjecture. Here counterexamples have been constructed conditional on the fully marked surface theorem. In the second paper, joint with David Gabai, a proof of the fully marked surface theorem is given.
