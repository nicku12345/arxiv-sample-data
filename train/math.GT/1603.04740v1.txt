Let D_+(K,t) denote the positive t-twisted double of K. For a fixed integer-valued additive concordance invariant \nu that bounds the smooth four genus of a knot and determines the smooth four genus of positive torus knots, Livingston and Naik defined t_\nu(K) to be the greatest integer t such that \nu(D_+(K,t)) = 1. Let K_1 and K_2 be any knots then we prove the following inequality : t_\nu(K_1) + t_\nu(K_2) \leq t_\nu(K_1 \# K_2) \leq min(t_\nu(K_1) - t_\nu(-K_2), t_\nu(K_2) - t_\nu(-K_1)). As an application we show that t_\tau(K) \neq t_s(K) for infinitely many knots and that their difference can be arbitrarily large, where t_\tau(K) (respectively t_s(K)) is t_\nu(K) when \nu is Ozv\'{a}th-Szab\'{o} invariant \tau (respectively when \nu is normalized Rasmussen s invariant).
