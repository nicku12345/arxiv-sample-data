We construct a compact, contractible 4-manifold C, an infinite-order self-diffeomorphism f of its boundary, and a smooth embedding of C into a closed, simply connected 4-manifold X, such that the manifolds obtained by cutting C out of X and regluing it by powers of f are all pairwise nondiffeomorphic. The manifold C can be chosen from among infinitely many homeomorphism types, all obtained by attaching a 2-handle to the meridian of a thickened knot complement.
