We consider Milnor invariants for certain covering links as a generalization of covering linkage invariants formulated by R. Hartley and K. Murasugi. A set of Milnor invariants for covering links is a cobordism invariant of a link, and that this invariant can distinguish some links for which the ordinary Milnor invariants coincide. Moreover, for a Brunnian link L, the first non-vanishing Milnor invariants of L is modulo-2 congruent to a sum of Milnor invariants of covering links. As a consequence, a sum of linking numbers of ' iterated' covering links gives the first non-vanishing Milnor invariant of L modulo 2.
