Let \gamma be an essential closed curve with at most k self-intersections on a surface \mathcal{S} with negative Euler characteristic. In this paper, we construct a hyperbolic metric \rho for which \gamma has length at most M \cdot \sqrt{k}, where M is a constant depending only on the topology of \mathcal{S}. Moreover, the injectivity radius of \rho is at least 1/(2\sqrt{k}). This yields linear upper bounds in terms of self-intersection number on the minimum degree of a cover to which \gamma lifts as a simple closed curve (i.e. lifts simply). We also show that if \gamma is a closed curve with length at most L on a cusped hyperbolic surface \mathcal{S}, then there exists a cover of \mathcal{S} of degree at most N \cdot L \cdot e^{L/2} to which \gamma lifts simply, for N depending only on the topology of \mathcal{S}.
