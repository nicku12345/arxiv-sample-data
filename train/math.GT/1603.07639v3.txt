In the present note we describe geometrically the homology classes in the total space of a surface bundle over a surface in terms of the holonomy map. We treat the cases where the base surface is closed or has one boundary component.   We replace the wrong theorem of the previous version by some observations on the homology of surface bundles and explain why our previous strategy failed.
