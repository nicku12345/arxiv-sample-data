Let Y be a closed oriented 3-manifold and \mathcal{F} a smooth oriented foliation on Y. Assume that \mathcal{F} does not admit any transverse invariant measure. This article constructs an invariant c(\mathcal{F}) for \mathcal{F} which takes value in \Hto_{\bullet}(Y). The invariant is well defined up to a sign. If two foliations \mathcal{F}_1 and \mathcal{F}_2 are homotopic through foliations without transverse invariant measure, then c(\mathcal{F}_1)=c(\mathcal{F}_2). The grading of c(\mathcal{F}) is represented by the homotopy class of the tangent plane field of \mathcal{F}, and its image in \Hred_{\bullet}(Y) is nonzero.
