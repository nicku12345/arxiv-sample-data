In this paper, the following three are shown. (1) For a C^\infty convex integrand \gamma: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+, its dual convex integrand \delta: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+ is of class C^\infty. (2) For a stable convex integrand \gamma: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+, its dual convex integrand \delta: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+ is stable. (3) Let \gamma: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+ be a stable convex integrand. Then, for any i (0\le i\le n), \theta_0\in S^n is a non-degenerate critical point of \gamma with Morse index i if and only if -\theta_0\in S^n is a non-degenerate critical point of the dual convex integrand {\delta} with Morse index (n-i).
