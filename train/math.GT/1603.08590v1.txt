Homology theories for associative algebraic structures are well established and have been studied for a long time. More recently, homology theories for self-distributive algebraic structures motivated by knot theory, such as quandles and their relatives, have been developed and investigated. In this paper, we study associative self-distributive algebraic structures and their one-term and two-term (rack) homology groups.
