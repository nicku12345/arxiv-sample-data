In this paper we study the topology of three different kinds of spaces associated to polynomial knots of degree at most d, for d\geq2. We denote these spaces by \mathcal{O}_d, \mathcal{P}_d and \mathcal{Q}_d. For d\geq3, we show that the spaces \mathcal{O}_d and \mathcal{P}_d are path connected and the space \mathcal{O}_d has the same homotopy type as S^2. Considering the space \mathcal{P}=\bigcup_{d\geq2}\mathcal{O}_d of all polynomial knots with the inductive limit topology, we prove that it too has the same homotopy type as S^2. We also show that if two polynomial knots are path equivalent in \mathcal{Q}_d, then they are topologically equivalent. Furthermore, the number of path components in \mathcal{Q}_d are in multiples of eight.
