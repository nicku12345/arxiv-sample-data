A derivative of an algebraically slice knot K is an oriented link disjointly embedded in a Seifert surface of K such that its homology class forms a basis for a metabolizer H of K. We show that for a genus three algebraically slice knot K, the set \{ \bar{\mu}_{\{\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\gamma_3\}}(123) - \bar{\mu}_{\{\gamma'_1,\gamma'_2,\gamma'_3\}}(123)| \{\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\gamma_3\} and \{\gamma'_1,\gamma'_2,\gamma'_3\} are derivatives of K associated with a metabolizer H\} contains n\cdot \mathbb{Z} where n is determined by a Seifert form of K and a metabolizer H. As a corollary, we show that it is possible to realize any integer as a Milnor's triple linking number of a derivative of the unknot on a fixed Seifert surface with a fixed metabolizer. In addition, we show that a knot, which is a connected sum of three genus one algebraically slice knots, has at least one derivative which has non-zero Milnor's triple linking number.
