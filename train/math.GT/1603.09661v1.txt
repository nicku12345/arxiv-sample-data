We show that the skein vector space of the 3-torus is finitely generated. We show that it is generated by 9 elements: the empty set, some simple closed curves representing the non null elements of the first homology group with coefficients in \Z_2, and a link consisting of two parallel copies of one of the previous non empty knots.
