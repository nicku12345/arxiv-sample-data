In~\cite{Ma} Manturov studied groups G_{n}^{k} for fixed integers n and k such that k<n. In particular, G_{n}^{2} is isomorphic to the group of free braids of n-stands. In~\cite{KiMa} Manturov and the author studied an invariant valued in free groups not only for free braids but also for free tangles, which is derived from the group G_{n}^{2}. On the other hands, in~\cite{FeMa} Manturov and Fedoseev studied groups Br_{2}^{n} of virtual braids with parity and groups Br_{d}^{n} of virtual braids with dots. They showed that there is a monomorphism from Br_{2}^{n} to Br_{d}^{n} and it is deduced that a parity of the braid can be represented by a geometric object, dots on strands. In this paper we study G_{n}^{2} with structures, which are corresponded to parity and points on a braid, which are denoted by G_{n,p}^{2} and G_{n,d}^{2}, respectively. In section 3, it is proved that there is a monomorphism from G_{n}^{2} to G_{n,p}^{2} and that there is a monomorphism from G_{n,p}^{2} to G_{n,d}^{2}. By the homomorphism from G_{n}^{2} to G_{n,p}^{2}, it can be deduced that a given parity of a braid has geometric representation, which is the number of points on the braid. In section 4, it can be proved that for each element \beta in G_{n,d}^{2}, an element in G_{n+1}^{2} obtained by adding another strand by tracing points on \beta. That is, a parity of free braid of n-stands is represented not only by points on strands, but also by an n+1-th strand. Conversely, for a braid of n+1-strands, a braid of n-strands is obtained by deleting one strand of the braid of n+1-strand. Finally, we will simply discuss about the way to adjust the previous observations to know whether a given braid is Brunnian or not.
