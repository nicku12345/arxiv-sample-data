In this remark, we show how the monopole Fr{\o}yshov invariant, as well as the analogues of the Involutive Heegaard Floer correction terms \underline{d},\overline{d}, are related to the \mathrm{Pin}(2)-equivariant Floer homology \mathit{SWFH}^G_*. We show that the only interesting correction terms of a \mathrm{Pin}(2)-space are those coming from the subgroups \mathbb{Z}/4, S^1, and \mathrm{Pin}(2) itself.
