We describe notions of tautness that arise in the study of C^0 foliations, C^{1,0} or smoother foliations, and in geometry. We give examples to show that these notions are different, and discuss how these differences impact some classical foliation results.   We construct examples of smoothly taut C^{\infty,0} foliations that can be C^0 approximated by both weakly symplectically fillable, universally tight contact structures and by overtwisted contact structures.
