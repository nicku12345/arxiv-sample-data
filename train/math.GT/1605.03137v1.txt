We study the behavior of \mathrm{Pin}(2)-monopole Floer homology under connected sums. After constructing a (partially defined) \mathcal{A}_{\infty}-module structure on the \mathrm{Pin}(2)-monopole Floer chain complex of a three manifold (in the spirit of Baldwin and Bloom's monopole category), we identify up to quasi-isomorphism the Floer chain complex of a connected sum with a version of the \mathcal{A}_{\infty}-tensor product of the modules of the summands. There is an associated Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence converging to the Floer groups of the connected sum whose E^2 page is the \mathrm{Tor} of the Floer groups of the summands. We discuss in detail a simple example, and use this computation to show that the \mathrm{Pin}(2)-monopole Floer homology of S^3 has non trivial Massey products
