These lecture notes are a friendly introduction to monopole Floer homology. We discuss the relevant differential geometry and Morse theory involved in the definition. After developing the relation with the four-dimensional theory, our attention shifts to gradings and correction terms. Finally, we sketch the analogue in this setup of Manolescu's recent disproof of the long standing Triangulation Conjecture.
