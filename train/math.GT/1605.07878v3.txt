We study two homomorphisms to the rational homology sphere group. If \psi denotes the inclusion homomorphism from the integral homology sphere group, then using work of Lisca we show that the image of \psi intersects trivially with the subgroup of the rational homology sphere group generated by lens spaces. As corollaries this gives a new proof that the cokernel of \psi is infinitely generated, and implies that a connected sum K of 2-bridge knots is concordant to a knot with determinant 1 if and only if K is smoothly slice. Furthermore, if \beta denotes the homomorphism from the knot concordance group defined by taking double branched covers of knots, we prove that the kernel of \beta contains a \mathbb{Z}^{\infty} summand by analyzing the Tristram-Levine signatures of a family of knots whose double branched covers all bound rational homology balls.
