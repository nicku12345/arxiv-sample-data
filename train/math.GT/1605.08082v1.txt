We investigate a relationship between Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o's bordered theory and the algebras and bimodules constructed by Khovanov-Seidel. Specifically, we show that (a variant of) a special case of Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o's algebras has a quotient which is isomorphic to the Khovanov-Seidel quiver algebra with coefficients in \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}. Furthermore, we show that after induction and restriction of scalars, the dg bimodule over quiver algebras associated to a crossing by Khovanov-Seidel is homotopy equivalent to Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o's DA bimodule for the crossing in this special case.
