Cochran, Orr, and Teichner developed a filtration of the knot concordance group indexed by half integers called the solvable filtration. Its terms are denoted by \mathcal{F}_n. It has been shown that \mathcal{F}_n/\mathcal{F}_{n.5} is a very large group for n\ge 0. For a generalization to the setting of links the third author showed that \mathcal{F}_{n.5}/\mathcal{F}_{n+1} is non-trivial. In this paper we provide evidence that for knots \mathcal{F}_{0.5}=\mathcal{F}_1. In particular we prove that every genus 1 algebraically slice knot is 1-solvable.
