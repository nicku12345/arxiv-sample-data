We establish several results about two short exact sequences involving lower terms of the n-solvable filtration, \{\mathcal{F}^m_n\} of the string link concordance group \mathcal{C}^m. We utilize the Thom-Pontryagin construction to show that the Sato-Levine invariants \bar{\mu}_{(iijj)} must vanish for 0.5-solvable links. Using this result, we show that the short exact sequence 0\rightarrow \mathcal{F}^m_0/\mathcal{F}^m_{0.5} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}^m_{-0.5}/\mathcal{F}^m_{0.5} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}^m_{-0.5}/\mathcal{F}^m_0 \rightarrow 0 does not split for links of two or more components, in contrast to the fact that it splits for knots. Considering lower terms of the filtration \{\mathcal{F}^m_n\} in the short exact sequence 0\rightarrow \mathcal{F}^m_{-0.5}/\mathcal{F}^m_{0} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}^m/\mathcal{F}^m_{0} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}^m/\mathcal{F}^m_{-0.5} \rightarrow 0, we show that while the sequence does not split for m\ge 3, it does indeed split for m=2. We conclude that the quotient \mathcal{C}^2/\mathcal{F}^2_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}_2\oplus \mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}.
