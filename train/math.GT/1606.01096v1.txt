We give an explicit basis \mathcal{B} of the quotient of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra \mathcal{S} (\Sigma) on a surface \Sigma by the square of an augmentation ideal. As an application, it induces two kinds of finite type invariants of links in a handle body in the sense of Le. Moreover, we construct an embedding of the mapping class group of a compact connected surface of genus 0 into the Kauffman bracket skein algebra on the surface completed with respect to a filtration coming from the augmentation ideal.
