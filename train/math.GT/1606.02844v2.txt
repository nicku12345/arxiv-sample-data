We prove the Farrell-Jones Conjecture for mapping class groups. The proof uses the Masur-Minsky theory of the large scale geometry of mapping class groups and the geometry of the thick part of Teichmueller space. The proof is presented in an axiomatic setup, extending the projection axioms of Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara. More specifically, we prove that the action of the mapping class group on the Thurston compactification of Teichmueller space is finitely F-amenable for the family F consisting of virtual point stabilizers.
