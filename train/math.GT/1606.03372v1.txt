We show that two Dehn surgeries on a knot K never yield manifolds that are homeomorphic as oriented manifolds if V_K''(1)\neq 0 or V_K'''(1)\neq 0. As an application, we verify the cosmetic surgery conjecture for all knots with no more than 11 crossings except for three 10-crossing knots and five 11-crossing knots. We also compute the finite type invariant of order 3 for two-bridge knots and Whitehead doubles, from which we prove several nonexistence results of purely cosmetic surgery.
