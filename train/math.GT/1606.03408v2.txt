We define two new families of invariants for (3-manifold, graph) pairs which detect the unknot and are additive under connected sum of pairs and (-1/2)-additive under trivalent vertex sum of pairs. The first of these families is closely related to both bridge number and tunnel number. The second of these families is a variation and generalization of Gabai's width for knots in the 3-sphere. We give applications to the tunnel number and higher genus bridge number of connected sums of knots.
