In \cite{Manturov} the second author defined the k-free braid group with n strands G_{n}^{k}. These groups appear naturally as groups describing dynamical systems of n particles in some "general position". Moreover, in \cite{ManturovNikonov} the second author and I.M.Nikonov showed that G_{n}^{k} is closely related classical braids. The authors showed that there are homomorphisms from the pure braids group on n strands to G_{n}^{3} and G_{n}^{4} and they defined homomorphisms from G_{n}^{k} to the free product of \mathbb{Z}_{2}. That is, there are invariants for pure free braids by G_{n}^{3} and G_{n}^{4}.   On the other hand in \cite{FedoseevManturov} D.A.Fedoseev and the second author studied classical braids with addition structures: parity and points on each strands. The authors showed that the parity, which is an abstract structure, has geometric meaning -- points on strands. In \cite{Kim}, the first author studied G_{n}^{2} with parity and points. the author construct a homomorphism from G_{n+1}^{2} to the group G_{n}^{2} with parity.   In the present paper, we investigate the groups G_{n}^{3} and extract new powerful invariants of classical braids from G_{n}^{3}. In particular, these invariants allow one to distinguish the non-triviality of Brunnian braids.
