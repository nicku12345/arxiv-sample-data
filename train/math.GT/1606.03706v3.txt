Flat surfaces that correspond to meromorphic 1-forms or to meromorphic quadratic differentials containing poles of order two and higher are surfaces of infinite area. We classify groups that appear as Veech groups of translation surfaces with poles. We characterize those surfaces such that their GL^{+}(2,\mathbb{R})-orbit or their SL(2,\mathbb{R})-orbit is closed. Finally, we provide a way to determine the Veech group for a typical infinite surface in a given chamber of a stratum.
