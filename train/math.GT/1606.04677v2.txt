Suppose that there exists an epimorphism from the knot group of a 2-bridge knot K onto that of another knot K'. In this paper, we study the relationship between their crossing numbers c(K) and c(K'). Especially it is shown that c(K) is greater than or equal to 3 c(K') and we estimate how many knot groups a 2-bridge knot group maps onto. Moreover, we formulate the generating function which determines the number of 2-bridge knot groups admitting epimorphisms onto the knot group of a given 2-bridge knot.
