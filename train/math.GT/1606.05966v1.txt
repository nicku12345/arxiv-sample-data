This paper is a continuation of the previous paper of the author[M]. We show that an affine deformation space of a hyperbolic surface of type (g,b) can be parametrized by Margulis invariants and affine twist parameters with a certain decomposition of the surface, which are associated with the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates in Teichmuller theory. W.Goldman and G.Margulis[GM] introduced that a translation part of an affine deformation canonically corresponds to a tangent vector on the Teichmuller space. By this correspondence, we explicitly represent tangent vectors on the Teichmuller space from the perspective of Lorentzian geometry, only when the tangent vectors correspond to Fenchel-Nielsen twists along separating geodesic curves on a hyperbolic surface.
