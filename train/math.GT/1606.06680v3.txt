We define a diffeology on the Milnor classifying space of a diffeological group G, constructed in a similar fashion to the topological version using an infinite join. Besides obtaining the expected classification theorem for smooth principal bundles, we prove the existence of a diffeological connection on any principal bundle (with mild conditions on the bundles and groups), and apply the theory to some examples, including some infinite-dimensional groups, as well as irrational tori.
