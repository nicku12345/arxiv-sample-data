We study how the genus, the simplicial volume and the L^2-Alexander invariant of W. Li and W. Zhang can detect individual knots among all others. In particular, we use various techniques coming from hyperbolic geometry and topology to prove that the L^2-Alexander invariant contains strictly more information than the pair (genus, simplicial volume). Along the way we prove that the L^2-Alexander invariant detects the figure-eight knot 4_1, the twist knot 5_2 and an infinite family of cables on the figure-eight knot.
