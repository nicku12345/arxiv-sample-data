Conjecture \mathbb{Z} is a knot theoretical equivalent form of the Kervaire Conjecture. We say that a knot have property \mathbb{Z} if it satisfies Conjecture \mathbb{Z} for that specific knot. In this work, we show that alternating Montesinos knots with three tangles have property \mathbb{Z}. We also show that all the pretzel knots of the form P(p,q,r) (not necessarily alternating) have property \mathbb{Z}.
