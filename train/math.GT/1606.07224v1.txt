Suppose a knot in a 3-manifold is in n-bridge position. We consider a reduction of the knot along a bridge disk D and show that the result is an (n-1)-bridge position if and only if there is a bridge disk E such that (D, E) is a cancelling pair. We apply this to an unknot K, in n-bridge position with respect to a bridge sphere S in the 3-sphere, to consider the relationship between a bridge disk D and a disk in the 3-sphere that K bounds. We show that if a reduction of K along D yields an (n-1)-bridge position, then K bounds a disk that contains D as a subdisk and intersects S in n arcs.
