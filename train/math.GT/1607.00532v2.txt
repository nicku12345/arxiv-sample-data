Let M be an orientable, irreducible 3-manifold and (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{W};F) a weakly reducible, unstabilized Heegaard splitting of M of genus at least three. In this article, we define an equivalent relation \sim on the set of the generalized Heegaard splittings obtained by weak reductions and find special subsets of the disk complex \mathcal{D}(F) named by the "equivalent clusters", where we can find a canonical function \Phi from the set of equivalent clusters to the set of the equivalent classes for the relation \sim. As an application, we prove that if F is topologically minimal and the topological index of F is at least three, then there is a 2-simplex in \mathcal{D}(F) formed by two weak reducing pairs such that the equivalent classes of the generalized Heegaard splittings obtained by weak reductions along the weak reducing pairs for the relation \sim are different. In the last section, we prove \Phi is a bijection if the genus of F is three. Using it, we prove there is a canonical function \Omega from the set of components of \mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{VW}}(F) to the set of the isotopy classes of the generalized Heegaard splittings obtained by weak reductions and describe what \Omega is.
