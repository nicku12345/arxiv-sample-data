For a banded link L in a surface times a circle, the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are topological invariants depending on a sequence of complex 2p-th roots of unity (A_p)_{p\in 2\mathbb{N}}. We show that there exists a polynomial P_L such that these normalized invariants converge to P_L(u) when A_p converges to u, for all but a finite number of u's in S^1. This is related to the AMU conjecture which predicts that non-simple curves have infinite order under quantum representations (for big enough levels). Estimating the degree of P_L, we exhibit particular types of curves which satisfy this conjecture. Along the way we prove the Witten asymptotic conjecture for links in a surface times a circle.
