We show that Tim Cochran's invariants \beta^i(L) of a 2-component link L in the 3--sphere can be computed as intersection invariants of certain 2-complexes in the 4--ball with boundary L. These 2-complexes are special types of twisted Whitney towers, which we call {\em Cochran towers}, and which exhibit a new phenomenon: A Cochran tower of order 2k allows the computation of the \beta^i invariants for all i\leq k, i.e. simultaneous extraction of invariants from a Whitney tower at multiple orders. This is in contrast with the order n Milnor invariants (requiring order n Whitney towers) and consistent with Cochran's result that the \beta^i(L) are integer lifts of certain Milnor invariants.
