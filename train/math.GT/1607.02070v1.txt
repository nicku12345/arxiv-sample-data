Let q be a 2Nth root of unity where N is odd. Let U_q(sl_2) denote the quantum group with large center corresponding to the lie algebra sl_2 with generators E,F,K, and K^{-1}. A semicyclic representation of U_q(sl_2) is an N-dimensional irreducible representation \rho:U_q(sl_2)\rightarrow M_N(\mathbb{C}), so that \rho(E^N)=aId with a\neq 0, \rho(F^N)=0 and \rho(K^N)=Id. We construct a tangle functor for framed homogeneous tangles colored with semicyclic representations, and prove that for (1,1)-tangles coming from knots, the invariant defined by the tangle functor coincides with Kashaev's invariant.
