In his celebrated paper "Generic projections", John Mather has shown that almost all linear projections from a submanifold of a vector space into a subspace are transverse with respect to a given modular submanifold. In this paper, an improvement of Mather's result is stated. Namely, we show that almost all linear perturbations of a smooth mapping from a submanifold of \mathbb{R}^m into \mathbb{R}^\ell yield a transverse mapping with respect to a given modular submanifold. Moreover, applications of this result are given.
