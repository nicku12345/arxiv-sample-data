Manolescu correction terms are numerical invariants of homology three-spheres arising from \mathrm{Pin}(2)-equivariant Seiberg-Witten theory that contain information about homology cobordism. We discuss several constraints on these invariants for homology spheres obtained by Dehn surgery on a knot in the three-sphere (and, more generally, in an integral homology L-space) in terms of the surgery coefficient, the concordance order, and the genus.
