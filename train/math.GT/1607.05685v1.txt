We show that on a hyperbolic knot K in S^3, the distance between any two finite surgery slopes is at most two and consequently there are at most three nontrivial finite surgeries. Moreover in case that K admits three nontrivial finite surgeries, K must be the pretzel knot P(-2,3,7). In case that K admits two noncyclic finite surgeries or two finite surgeries at distance two, the two surgery slopes must be one of ten or seventeen specific pairs respectively. For D-type finite surgeries, we improve a finiteness theorem due to Doig by giving an explicit bound on the possible resulting prism manifolds, and also prove that 4m and 4m+4 are characterizing slopes for the torus knot T(2m+1,2) for each m\geq 1.
