We extend some part of the unpublished paper written by Mednykh and Rasskazov. Using the approach indicated in this paper we derive the Riley-Mednykh polynomial for some family of the 2-bridge knot orbifolds. As a result we obtain explicit formulae for the volume of cone-manifolds and the Chern-Simons invariant of orbifolds of the knot with Conway's notation C(2n,4).
