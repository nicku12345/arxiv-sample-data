By considering negative surgeries on a knot K in S^3, we derive a lower bound to the non-orientable slice genus \gamma_4(K) in terms of the signature \sigma(K) and the concordance invariants V_i(\overline{K}), which strengthens a previous bound given by Batson, and which coincides with Ozsv\'ath-Stipsicz-Szab\'o's bound in terms of their \upsilon invariant for L-space knots and quasi-alternating knots. A curious feature of our bound is superadditivity, implying, for instance, that the bound on the stable non-orientable genus is sometimes better than the one on \gamma_4(K).
