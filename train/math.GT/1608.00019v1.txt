The trunk of a knot in S^3, defined by Makoto Ozawa, is a measure of geometric complexity similar to the bridge number or width of a knot. We prove that for any two knots K_1 and K_2, we have tr(K_1 \# K_2) = \max\{tr(K_1),tr(K_2)\}, confirming a conjecture of Ozawa. Another conjecture of Ozawa asserts that any width-minimizing embedding of a knot K also minimizes the trunk of K. We produce several families of probable counterexamples to this conjecture.
