Let M and N be topological spaces such that M admits a free involution \\tau. A homotopy class \beta \in [M, N ] is said to have the Borsuk-Ulam property with respect to \\tau if for every representative map f : M \rightarrow N of \beta, there exists a point x \in M such that f (\\tau (x)) = f (x). In the case where M is a compact, connected manifold without boundary and N is a compact, connected surface without boundary different from the 2-sphere and the real projective plane, we formulate this property in terms of the pure and full 2-string braid groups of N , and of the fundamental groups of M and the orbit space of M with respect to the action of \\tau. If M = N is either the 2-torus T^2 or the Klein bottle K^2 , we then solve the problem of deciding which homotopy classes of [M, M ] have the Borsuk-Ulam property. First, if \\tau : T^2 \rightarrow T^2 is a free involution that preserves orientation, we show that no homotopy class of [T^2 , T^2 ] has the Borsuk-Ulam property with respect to \\tau. Secondly, we prove that up to a certain equivalence relation, there is only one class of free involutions \\tau : T^2 \rightarrow T^2 that reverse orientation, and for such involutions, we classify the homotopy classes in [T^2 , T^2 ] that have the Borsuk-Ulam property with respect to \\tau in terms of the induced homomorphism on the fundamental group. Finally, we show that if \\tau : K^2 \rightarrow K^2 is a free involution, then a homotopy class of [K^2 , K^2 ] has the Borsuk-Ulam property with respect to \\tau if and only if the given homotopy class lifts to the torus.
