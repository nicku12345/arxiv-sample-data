We extend Howie's characterization of alternating knots to give a topological characterization of toroidally alternating knots, which were defined by Adams. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a knot to be toroidally alternating. We also give a topological characterization of almost-alternating knots which is different from Ito's recent characterization.
