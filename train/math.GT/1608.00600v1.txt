In this note, we extend the Bridgeman-Kahn identity to all finite-volume orientable hyperbolic n-manifolds with totally geodesic boundary. In the compact case, Bridgeman and Kahn are able to express the manifold's volume as the sum of a function over only the orthospectrum. For manifolds with non-compact boundary, our extension adds terms corresponding to intrinsic invariants of boundary cusps.
