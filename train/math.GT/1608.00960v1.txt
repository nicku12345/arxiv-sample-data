Inspired by the properties of an n-frame of gradients (\nabla f_1, \ldots, \nabla f_n) of a Morin map f:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n, with \dim M\geq n, we introduce the notion of Morin singularities in the context of singular n-coframes and singular n-frames. We also study the singularities of generic 1-forms associated to a Morin n-coframe, in order to generalize a result of T. Fukuda [4, Theorem 1], which establishes a modulo 2 congruence between the Euler characteristic of a compact manifold M and the Euler characteristics of the singular sets of a Morin map defined on M, to the case of Morin n-coframes and Morin n-frames.
