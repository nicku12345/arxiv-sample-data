We present a new 2-variable generalization of the Jones polynomial that can be defined through the skein relation of the Jones polynomial. The well-definedness of this new generalization is proved both algebraically and diagrammatically as well as via a closed combinatorial formula. This new invariant is able to distinguish more pairs of non-isotopic links than the original Jones polynomial such as the Thistlethwaite link from the unlink with two components.
