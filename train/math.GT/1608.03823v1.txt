In this paper, we explore minimal contact triangulations on contact 3-manifolds. We give many explicit examples of contact triangulations that are close to minimal ones. The main results of this article say that on any closed oriented 3-manifold the number of vertices for minimal contact triangulations for overtwisted contact structures grows at most linearly with respect to the relative d^3 invariant. We conjecture that this bound is optimal. We also discuss, in great details, contact triangulations for a certain family of overtwisted contact structures on 3-torus.
