Let X and Y be proper metric spaces. We show that a coarsely n-to-1 map f\colon X\to Y induces an n-to-1 map of Higson coronas. This viewpoint turns out to be successful in showing that the classical dimension raising theorems hold in large scale; that is, if f \colon X\to Y is a coarsely n-to-1 map between proper metric spaces X and Y then asdim(Y) \leq asdim(X) + n -1. Furthermore we introduce coarsely open coarsely n-to-1 maps, which include the natural quotient maps via a finite group action, and prove that they preserve the asymptotic dimension.
