We show that the problem of constructing a real rational knot of a reasonably low degree can be reduced to an algebraic problem involving the pure braid group: expressing an associated element of the pure braid group in terms of the standard generators of the pure braid group. We also predict the existence of a real rational knot in a degree that is expressed in terms of the edge number of its polygonal representation.
