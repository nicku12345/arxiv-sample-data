The ray graph is a Gromov hyperbolic graph on which the mapping class group of the plane minus a Cantor set acts by isometries. We give a description of the Gromov boundary of the ray graph in terms of cliques of long rays on the plane minus a Cantor set. As a consequence, we prove that the Gromov boundary of the ray graph is homeomorphic to a quotient of a subset of the circle.   This version contains some updates and corrections.
