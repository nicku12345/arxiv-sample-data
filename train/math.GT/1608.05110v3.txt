We introduce new symplectic cut-and-paste operations that generalize the rational blowdown. In particular, we will define k-replaceable plumbings to be those that, heuristically, can be symplectically replaced by Euler characteristic k 4-manifolds. We will then classify 2-replaceable linear plumbings, construct 2-replaceable plumbing trees, and use one such tree to construct a symplectic exotic \mathbb{C}P^2\#6\overline{\mathbb{C}P^2}.
