We study the asymptotic behavior of the twisted Alexander polynomial for the sequence of SL(n ,C)-representations induced from an irreducible metabelian SL(2, C)-representation of a knot group. We give the limits of the leading coefficients in the asymptotics of the twisted Alexander polynomial and related Reidemeister torsion. The concrete computations for all genus one two-bridge knots are also presented.
