We define a family of link concordance invariants \left\{ s_n \right\}_{n=2,3, \cdots}. These link concordance invariants give lower bounds on the slice genus of a link L. We compute the slice genus of positive links. Moreover, these invariants give lower bounds on the link splitting number of a link. Especially, this new lower bound determines the splitting number of positive torus links. This is a generalization of Lobb's knot concordance invariants \left\{ s_n \right\}, obtained from Gornik's spectral sequence.
