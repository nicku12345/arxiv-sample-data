An element in Artin's braid group B_n is called periodic if it has a power which lies in the center of B_n. The conjugacy problem for periodic braids can be reduced to the following: given a divisor 1\le d<n-1 of n-1 and an element \alpha in the super summit set of \epsilon^d, find \gamma\in B_n such that \gamma^{-1}\alpha\gamma=\epsilon^d, where \epsilon=(\sigma_{n-1}\cdots\sigma_1)\sigma_1.   In this article we characterize the elements in the super summit set of \epsilon^d in the dual Garside structure by studying the combinatorics of noncrossing partitions arising from periodic braids. Our characterization directly provides a conjugating element \gamma. And it determines the size of the super summit set of \epsilon^d by using the zeta polynomial of the noncrossing partition lattice.
