Let \Sigma be a surface of negative Euler characteristic and S a generating set for \pi_1(\Sigma,p) consisting of simple loops that are pairwise disjoint (except at p). We show that the word length with respect to S of an element of \pi_1(\Sigma,p) is given by its intersection number with a well-chosen collection of curves and arcs on \Sigma. The same holds for the word length of (a free homotopy class of) an immersed curve on \Sigma. As a consequence, we obtain the asymptotic growth of the number of immersed curves of bounded word length, as the length grows, in each mapping class group orbit.
