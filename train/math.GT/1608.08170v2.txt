The \emph{action dimension} of a discrete group G is the minimum dimension of a contractible manifold, which admits a proper G-action. In this paper, we study the action dimension of general Artin groups. The main result is that the action dimension of an Artin group with the nerve L of dimension n for n \ne 2 is less than or equal to (2n + 1) if the Artin group satisfies the K(\pi, 1)-Conjecture and the top cohomology group of L with \mathbb{Z}-coefficients is trivial. For n = 2, we need one more condition on L to get the same inequality; that is the fundamental group of L is generated by r elements where r is the rank of H_1(L, \mathbb{Z}).
