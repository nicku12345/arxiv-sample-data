We solve some computational problems for triangulated closed three-dimensional manifolds using groups of simplicial homology and cohomology modulo 2. Two efficient algorithms for computing the intersection numbers of 1- and 2-dimensional cycles are developed. By means of these algorithms it is possible to construct a basis of cohomology group from the homology group of two cycles of complementary dimensions.
