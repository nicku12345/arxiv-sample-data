Given a hyperbolic surface \S, a classic result of Birman and Series states that for each K, all complete geodesics with at most K self-intersections can only pass through a certain nowhere dense, Hausdorff dimension 1 subset of \S. We define a self-intersection function for each complete geodesic, which bounds the number of self-intersections in finite length subarcs. We then extend the Birman-Series result to sets of complete geodesics with certain bounds on their self-intersection functions. In fact, we get the same conclusion as the Birman-Series result for sets of complete geodesics whose self-intersection functions are in o(l^2), where l measures arclength.
