In the first few homological gradings, there is an isomorphism between the Khovanov homology of a link and the categorification of the chromatic polynomial of a graph related to the link. In this article, we show that the categorification of the chromatic polynomial only contains torsion of order two, and hence Khovanov homology only contains torsion of order two in the gradings where the isomorphism is defined. We also prove that odd Khovanov homology is torsion-free in its first few homological gradings.
