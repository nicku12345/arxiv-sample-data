By Torelli topology the author understands aspects of the topology of surfaces (potentially) relevant to the study of Torelli groups. The present paper is devoted to a new approach to the results of W. Vautaw about Dehn multi-twists in Torelli groups and abelian subgroups of Torelli groups. The new proofs are more transparent and lead to stronger estimates of the rank of an abelian subgroup when some additional information is available. An unexpected application of our methods is a new proof of the algebraic characterization of the Dehn twist about separating circles and the Dehn-Johnson twists about bounding pairs of circles. This proof is much shorter than the original one and bypasses one of the main difficulties, which may be called the extension problem, specific to Torelli groups as opposed to the Teichm\"uller modular groups. The extension problem is discussed in details in the second paper of this series.
