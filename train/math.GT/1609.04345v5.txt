For any positive integer n we give a {\mathbb Z}^n-cork with a {\mathbb Z}^n-effective embedding in a 4-manifold being homeomorphic to E(n). This means that a cork gives a subset {\mathbb Z}^n in the differential structures on E(n). Further, we describe handle decompositions of the twisted doubles (homotopy S^4) of Gompf's infinite order corks and show that they are Gluck twists and log transforms of S^4.
