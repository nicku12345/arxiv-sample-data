Recently Auckly-Kim-Melvin-Ruberman showed that for any finite subgroup G of SO(4) there exists a contractible 4-manifold with an effective G-action on its boundary so that the twists associated to the non-trivial elements of G do not extend to diffeomorphisms of the entire manifold. We use a Heegaard Floer theoretic argument originating in work of Akbulut-Karakurt to give a different proof of this phenomenon.
