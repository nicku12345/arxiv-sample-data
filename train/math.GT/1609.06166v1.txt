It is an open problem whether Kirk's \sigma invariant is the complete obstruction to a link map S^2\cup S^2\to S^4 being link homotopically trivial. With the objective of constructing counterexamples, Li proposed a link homotopy invariant \omega that is defined on the kernel of \sigma and also obstructs link nullhomotopy. We show that \omega is determined by \sigma, and is a strictly weaker invariant.
