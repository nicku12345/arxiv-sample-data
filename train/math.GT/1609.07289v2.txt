Kuperberg introduced web spaces for some Lie algebras which are generalizations of the Kauffman bracket skein module on a disk with marked points. We derive some formulas for A_1 and A_2 clasped web spaces by graphical calculus using skein theory. These formulas are colored version of skein relations, twist formulas and bubble skein expansion formulas. We calculate the \mathfrak{sl}_2 and \mathfrak{sl}_3 colored Jones polynomials of 2-bridge knots and links explicitly using twist formulas.
