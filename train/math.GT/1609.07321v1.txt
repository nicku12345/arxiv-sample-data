Let  M be a cusped hyperbolic  3-manifold, e.g. a knot complement. Thurston showed that the space of deformations of its fundamental group in  \mathrm {PGL}(2,\mathbf {C}) (up to conjugation) is of complex dimension the number  \nu  of cusps near the hyperbolic representation. It seems natural to ask whether some representations remain discrete after deformation. The answer is generically not. A simple reason for it lies inside the cusps: the degeneracy of the peripheral representation (i.e. representations of fundamental groups of the  \nu  peripheral tori). They indeed generically become non-discrete, except for a countable set. This last set corresponds to hyperbolic Dehn surgeries on  M, for which the peripheral representation is no more faithful.We work here in the framework of  \mathrm {PGL}(n,\mathbf {C}). The hyperbolic structure lifts, via the  n-dimensional irreducible representation, to a representation  \rho \_{\mathrm {geom}}. We know from the work of Menal-Ferrer and Porti that the space of deformations of  \rho \_{\textrm {geom}} has complex dimension  (n-1)\nu .We prove here that, unlike the  \mathrm {PGL}(2)-case, the generic behaviour becomes the discreteness (and faithfulness) of the peripheral representation: in a neighbourhood of the geometric representation, the non-discrete peripheral representations are contained in a real analytic subvariety of codimension  \geq 1.
