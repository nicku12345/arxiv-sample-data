Given an L^2-acyclic connected finite CW-complex, we define its universal L^2-torsion in terms of the chain complex of its universal covering. It takes values in the weak Whitehead group \operatorname{Wh}^w(G). We study its main properties such as homotopy invariance, sum formula, product formula and Poincar\'e duality. Under certain assumptions, we can specify certain homomorphisms from the weak Whitehead group \operatorname{Wh}^w(G) to abelian groups such as the real numbers or the Grothendieck group of integral polytopes, and the image of the universal L^2-torsion can be identified with many invariants such as the L^2-torsion, the L^2-torsion function, twisted L^2-Euler characteristics and, in the case of a 3-manifold, the dual Thurston norm polytope.
