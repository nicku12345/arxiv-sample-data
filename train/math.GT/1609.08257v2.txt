Let \Gamma be a chart. For each label m, we denote by \Gamma_m the "subgraph" of \Gamma consisting of all the edges of label m and their vertices. Let \Gamma be a minimal chart of type (m;3,3). That is, a minimal chart \Gamma has six white vertices, and both of \Gamma_m\cap\Gamma_{m+1} and \Gamma_{m+1}\cap\Gamma_{m+2} consist of three white vertices. Then \Gamma is C-move equivalent to a minimal chart containing a "subchart" representing a 2-twist spun trefoil or its "reflection".
