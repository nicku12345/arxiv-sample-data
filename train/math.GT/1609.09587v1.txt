In this paper, we formulate a construction of ideal coset invariants for surface-links in 4-space using invariants for knots and links in 3-space. We apply the construction to the Kauffman bracket polynomial invariant and obtain an invariant for surface-links called the Kauffman bracket ideal coset invariant of surface-links. We also define a series of new invariants \{{\mathbf K}_{2n-1}(\mathcal L) | n=2, 3, 4, \ldots\} for surface-links \mathcal L by using skein relations, which are more effective than the Kauffman bracket ideal coset invariant to distinguish given surface-links.
