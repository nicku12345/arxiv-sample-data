Let N (resp., U) be a manifold (resp., an open subset of \mathbb{R}^m). Let f:N\to U and F:U\to \mathbb{R}^\ell be an immersion and a C^{\infty} mapping, respectively. Generally, the composition F\circ f does not necessarily yield a mapping transverse to a given subfiber-bundle of J^1(N,\mathbb{R}^\ell). Nevertheless, in this paper, for any \mathcal{A}^1-invariant fiber, we show that composing generic linearly perturbed mappings of F and the given immersion f yields a mapping transverse to the subfiber-bundle of J^1(N,\mathbb{R}^\ell) with the given fiber. Moreover, we show a specialized transversality theorem on crossings of compositions of generic linearly perturbed mappings of a given mapping F:U\to \mathbb{R}^\ell and a given injection f:N\to U. Furthermore, applications of the two main theorems are given.
