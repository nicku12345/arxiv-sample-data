We consider the double twist link J(2m+1, 2n+1) which is the two-bridge link corresponding to the continued fraction (2m+1)-1/(2n+1). It is known that J(2m+1, 2n+1) has reducible nonabelian SL_2(\mathbb{C})-character variety if and only if m=n. In this paper we give a formula for the volume of hyperbolic cone-manifolds of J(2m+1,2m+1). We also give a formula for the A-polynomial 2-tuple corresponding to the canonical component of the character variety of J(2m+1,2m+1).
