It is known that a knot complement can be decomposed into ideal octahedra along a knot diagram. A solution to the gluing equations applied to this decomposition gives a pseudo-developing map of the knot complement, which will be called a pseudo-hyperbolic structure. In this paper, we study these in terms of segment and region variables which are motivated by the volume conjecture so that we can compute complex volumes of all the boundary parabolic representations explicitly. We investigate the octahedral developing and holonomy representation carefully, and obtain a concrete formula of Wirtinger generators for the representation and also cusp shape. We demonstrate explicit solutions for T(2,N) torus knots, J(N,M) knots and also for other interesting knots as examples. Using these solutions we can observe the asymptotic behavior of complex volumes and cusp shapes of these knots. We note that this construction works for any knot or link, and reflects systematically both geometric properties of the knot complement and combinatorial aspect of the knot diagram.
