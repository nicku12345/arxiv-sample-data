A well-known conjecture in knot theory says that the percentage of hyperbolic knots amongst all of the prime knots of n or fewer crossings approaches 100 as n approaches infinity. In this paper, it is proved that this conjecture contradicts several other plausible conjectures, including the 120-year-old conjecture on additivity of the crossing number of knots under connected sum and the conjecture that the crossing number of a satellite knot is not less than that of its companion.
