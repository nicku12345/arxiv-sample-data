In the present paper, we construct a monomorphism from (Artin) pure braid group PB_{n} into a group, which is `bigger' than PB_{n}. Roughly speaking, this mapping is defined on words of braids by adding `new generators' between generators of PB_{n}. By this mapping we can get a new invariant for classical braids. As one of application of this invariant, we will show examples, which are minimal words in PB_{n} and the minimality can be shown by the invariant.
