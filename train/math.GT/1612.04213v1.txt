Let X_{0} be a complete hyperbolic surface of infinite type with geodesic boundary which admits a countable pair of pants decomposition. As an application of the Basmajian identity for complete bordered hyperbolic surfaces of infinite type with limit sets of 1-dimensional measure zero, we define an asymmetric metric (which is called arc metric) on the quasiconformal Teichm\"uller space \mathcal{T}(X_{0}) provided that X_{0} satisfies a geometric condition. Furthermore, we construct several examples of hyperbolic surfaces of infinite type satisfying the geometric condition and discuss the relation between the Shiga's condition and the geometric condition.
