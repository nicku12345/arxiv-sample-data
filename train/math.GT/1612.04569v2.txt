In this paper, we study the geometry of surfaces with the generalised simple lift property. This work generalises previous results by Bernstein and Tinaglia, and it is motivated by the fact that leaves of a minimal lamination obtained as a limit of a sequence of properly embedded minimal disks satisfy the generalised simple lift property.
