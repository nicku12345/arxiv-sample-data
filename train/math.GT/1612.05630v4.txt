We prove a Tverberg type theorem: Given a set A \subset \mathbb{R}^d in general position with |A|=(r-1)(d+1)+1 and k\in \{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}, there is a partition of A into r sets A_1,\ldots,A_r with the following property. The unique z \in \bigcap_1^r \mathrm{aff} A_j can be written as an affine combination of the element in A_j: z = \sum_{x \in A_j} \alpha(x)x for every p and exactly k of the coefficients \alpha(x) are negative. The case k=0 is Tverberg's classical theorem.
