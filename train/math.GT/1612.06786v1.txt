We explore under what conditions one can obtain a nontrivial knot, given a collection of n vectors. First, we show how to get a crossing from any 3 vectors equal in magnitude, by arbitrarily picking 2 vectors and identifying the sufficient and necessary criteria for picking a third vector that will guarantee a crossing when the vectors are reordered. We also show that it's always possible for a set of vectors to be reordered to form the unknot, if they sum to \vec{0} when added together.   Our main results are restricted to sets of n vectors that, when reordered appropriately, project to a regular n-gon in \mathbb{R}^2. We prove that if n=6, we cannot form a nontrivial knot with our vectors. The first nontrivial knot possible (3_1) is when n=7, and the first 4_1 knot possible is when n=8. We prove that if n\geq7, we can always reorder the vectors to get a projection of a nontrivial knot, and also provide an algorithm to choose how to reorder the vectors to get such a knot.
