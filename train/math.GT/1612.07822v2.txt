Let t_{\alpha,\beta}\subset S^2\times S^1 be an ordinary fiber of a Seifert fibering of S^2\times S^1 with two exceptional fibers of order \alpha. We show that any Seifert manifold with Euler number zero is a branched covering of S^2\times S^1 with branching t_{\alpha,\beta} if \alpha\geq3.   We compute the Seifert invariants of the Abelian covers of S^2\times S^1 branched along a t_{\alpha,\beta}.   We also show that t_{2,1}, a non-trivial torus knot in S^2\times S^1, is not universal.
