We describe a presentation for the augmented fundamental rack of a link in the lens space L(p,1). Using this presentation, the (enhanced) counting rack invariants that have been defined for the classical links are applied to the links in L(p,1). In this case, the counting rack invariants also include the information about the action of \pi_{1}(L(p,1)) on the augmented fundamental rack of a link.
