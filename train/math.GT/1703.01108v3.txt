The uniform boundary condition in a normed chain complex asks for a uniform linear bound on fillings of null-homologous cycles. For the \ell^1-norm on the singular chain complex, Matsumoto and Morita established a characterisation of the uniform boundary condition in terms of bounded cohomology. In particular, spaces with amenable fundamental group satisfy the uniform boundary condition in every degree. We will give an alternative proof of statements of this type, using geometric F{\o}lner arguments on the chain level instead of passing to the dual cochain complex. These geometric methods have the advantage that they also lead to integral refinements. In particular, we obtain applications in the context of integral foliated simplicial volume.
