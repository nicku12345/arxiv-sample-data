Let E_{k}^{F}(D) be the spectral sequence induced by the oriented cube of resolutions on knot Floer homology. We prove that E_{2}^{F}(D) is a triply graded link invariant whose graded Euler characteristic is the HOMFLY-PT polynomial and that the higher pages are link invariants. By construction, the spectral sequence converges to knot Floer homology. We show that the rank of the torsion-free part of E_{2}^{F}(D) is the rank of HOMFLY-PT homology.
