Thurston's Circle Pattern Theorem studies existence and rigidity of circle patterns of a given combinatorial type and the given non-obtuse exterior intersection angles. Using topological degree theory, variational principle, Teichmuller theory, and Sard's Theorem, this paper generalizes Circle Pattern Theorem to the case of obtuse exterior intersection angles.
