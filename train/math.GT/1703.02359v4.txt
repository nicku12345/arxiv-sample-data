An embedding of a metric graph (G, d) on a closed hyperbolic surface is \emph{essential}, if each complementary region has a negative Euler characteristic. We show, by construction, that given any metric graph, its metric can be rescaled so that it admits an essential and isometric embedding on a closed hyperbolic surface. The essential genus g_e(G) of (G, d) is the lowest genus of a surface on which such an embedding is possible. In the next result, we establish a formula to compute g_e(G). Furthermore, we show that for every integer g\geq g_e(G), (G, d) admits such an embedding (possibly after a rescaling of d) on a surface of genus g.   Next, we study minimal embeddings where each complementary region has Euler characteristic -1. The maximum essential genus g_e^{\max}(G) of (G, d) is the largest genus of a surface on which the graph is minimally embedded. Finally, we describe a method explicitly for an essential embedding of (G, d), where g_e(G) and g_e^{\max}(G) are realized.
