Every closed hyperbolic geodesic \gamma on the triply--punctured sphere M =\widehat{{\mathbb C}} - \{0,1,\infty\} has a self--intersection number I(\gamma) \ge 1 and a combinatorial length L(\gamma) \ge 2, the latter defined by the number of times \gamma passes through the upper halfplane.   In this paper we show that \delta(\gamma) = I(\gamma) - L(\gamma) \ge -1 for all closed geodesics; and that for each fixed \delta, the number of geodesics with invariants (\delta,L) is given exactly by a quadratic polynomial p_\delta(L) for all L \ge 4 + \delta.
