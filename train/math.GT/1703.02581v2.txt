A curve \gamma: [0,1] \rightarrow S^n of class C^k (k \geqslant n) is locally convex if the vectors \gamma(t), \gamma'(t), \gamma"(t), \cdots, \gamma^{(n)}(t) are a positive orthonormal basis to R^{n+1} for all t \in [0,1]. Given an integer n \geq 2 and Q \in SO_{n+1}, let LS^n(Q) be the set of all locally convex curves \gamma: [0,1] \rightarrow S^n with fixed initial and final Frenet frame F_\gamma(0)=I and F_\gamma(1)=Q. Saldanha and Shapiro proved that there are just finitely many non-homeomorphic spaces among LS^n(Q) when Q varies in SO_{n+1} (in particular, at most 3 for n=3). For any n \geqslant 2, the homotopy type of one of these spaces is well-known, but not of the others. For n=2, Saldanha determined the homotopy type of the spaces LS^2(Q). The purpose of this work is to study the case n=3. We will obtain information on the homotopy type of one of these 2 other spaces, allowing us to conclude that its connected components are not homeomorphic to the connected components of the known space.
