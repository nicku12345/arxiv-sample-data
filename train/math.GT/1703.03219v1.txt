In 1998, R. Gompf defined a homotopy invariant \theta_G of oriented 2-plane fields in 3-manifolds. This invariant is defined for oriented 2-plane fields \xi in a closed oriented 3-manifold M when the first Chern class c_1(\xi) is a torsion element of H^2(M;\mathbb{Z}). In this article, we define an extension of the Gompf invariant for all compact oriented 3-manifolds with boundary and we study its iterated variations under Lagrangian-preserving surgeries. It follows that the extended Gompf invariant is a degree two invariant with respect to a suitable finite type invariant theory.
