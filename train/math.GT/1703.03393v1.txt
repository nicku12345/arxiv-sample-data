We prove that if L is a non-trivial alternating link embedded (without crossings) in a closed surface F\subset S^3, then F has a compressing disk whose boundary intersects L in no more than two points. Moreover, whenever the surface is incompressible and \partial-incompressible in the link exterior, it can be isotoped to have a standard tube at some crossing of any reduced alternating diagram.
