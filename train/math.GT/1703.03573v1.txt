We introduce an up-down coloring of a virtual-link diagram. The colorabilities give a lower bound of the minimum number of Reidemeister moves of type II which are needed between two 2-component virtual-link diagrams. By using the notion of a quandle cocycle invariant, we determine the necessity of Reidemeister moves of type II for a pair of diagrams of the trivial virtual-knot. This implies that for any virtual-knot diagram D, there exists a diagram D' representing the same virtual-knot such that any sequence of generalized Reidemeister moves between them includes at least one Reidemeister move of type II.
