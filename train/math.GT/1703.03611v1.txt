A crosscap transposition is an element of the mapping class group of a nonorientable surface represented by a homeomorphism supported on a one-holed Klein bottle and swapping two crosscaps. We prove that the mapping class group of a compact nonorientable surface of genus g\ge 7 is generated by conjugates of one crosscap transposition. In the case when the surface is either closed or has one boundary component, we give an explicit set of g+2 crosscap transpositions generating the mapping class group.
