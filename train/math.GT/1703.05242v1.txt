In this paper, we study R-closed foliations which are generalization of compact Hausdorff foliations. We show that the class space of a codimension-two-like R-closed foliation \mathcal{F} (resp. group-action) on a compact connected manifold M is a surface with conners, which is a generalization of the codimension two compact foliation cases, where the class space is a quotient space M/\sim defined by x \sim y if \overline{\mathcal{F}(x)} = \overline{\mathcal{F}(y)} (resp. \overline{O(x)} = \overline{O(y)}). Moreover, a nontrivial R-closed flow on a connected compact 3-manifold is either "almost two dimensional" or "almost one dimensional" or with "complicated" minimal sets. In addition, a homeomorphism on a hyperbolic compact surface S is periodic if and only if it is R-closed (i.e. the orbit class space is Hausdorff). Each minimal set of an R-closed non-minimal non-periodic toral homeomorphism is a finite disjoint union of essential circloids.
