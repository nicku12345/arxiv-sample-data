We extend the theory of relative trisections of smooth, compact, oriented 4-manifolds with connected boundary given by Gay and Kirby to include 4-manifolds with an arbitrary number of boundary components. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions under which relatively trisected 4-manifolds can be glued to one another along diffeomorphic boundary components so as to induce a trisected manifold. These two results allow us to define a category \textrm{Tri} whose objects are smooth, closed, oriented 3-manifolds equipped with open book decompositions, and morphisms are relatively trisected cobordisms. Additionally, we extend the Hopf stabilization of open book decompositions to a relative stabilization of relative trisections.
