Given any oriented link diagram, one can construct knot invariants using skein relations. Usually such a skein relation contains three or four terms. In this paper, the author introduces several new ways to smooth a crossings, and uses a system of skein equations to construct link invariant. This invariant can also be modified by writhe to get a more powerful invariant. The modified invariant is a generalization of both the HOMFLYPT polynomial and the two-variable Kauffman polynomial. Using the diamond lemma, a simplified version of the modified invariant is given. It is easy to compute and is a generalization of the two-variable Kauffman polynomial.
