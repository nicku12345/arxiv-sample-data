For a closed manifold M, let Fib(M) be the number of distinct fiberings of M as a fiber bundle with fiber a closed surface. In this paper we give the first computation of Fib(M) where 1<\text{Fib}(M)<\infty but M is not a product. In particular, we prove Fib(M)=2 for the Atiyah-Kodaira manifold and any finite cover of a trivial surface bundle. We also give an example where Fib(M)=4.
