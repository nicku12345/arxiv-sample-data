For every genus g\geq 2, we construct an infinite family of strongly quasipositive fibred knots having the same Seifert form as the torus knot T(2,2g+1). In particular, their signatures and four-genera are maximal and their homological monodromies (hence their Alexander module structures) agree. On the other hand, the geometric stretching factors are pairwise distinct and the knots are pairwise not ribbon concordant.
