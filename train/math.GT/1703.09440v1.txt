A site-specific Gordian distance between two spatial embeddings of an abstract graph is the minimal number of crossing changes from one to another where each crossing change is performed between two previously specified abstract edges of the graph. It is infinite in some cases. We determine the site-specific Gordian distance between two spatial embeddings of an abstract graph in certain cases. It has an application to puzzle ring problem. The site-specific Gordian distances between Milnor links and trivial links are determined. We use covering space theory for the proofs.
