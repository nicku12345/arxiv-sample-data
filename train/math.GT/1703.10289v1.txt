Tight geodesics were introduced by Masur-Minsky in [17]. They and their hierarchies have been a powerful tool in the study of the curve complex, mapping class groups, Teichm\"uller spaces, and hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In the same paper, they showed that there are at least one and at most finitely many tight geodesics between any two vertices in the curve complex. Bowditch found a uniform finiteness property on tight geodesics [9], and this property has given further important applications in some of the above studies. In this paper, we introduce classes of geodesics which are not tight but still have the uniform finiteness property. These classes of geodesics will be obtained as examples of weak tight geodesics which were introduced and shown to have the property in [19]. The aim of this paper is to study about weak tight geodesics focusing on giving examples of them with canonical constructions and investigating gaps between two classes of them. Our main investigation will be on weak tight geodesics contained in the class of M-weakly tight geodesics where M is the bound given by the bounded geodesic image theorem. As M-weakly tight geodesics contain tight geodesics, the classes of weak tight geodesics to be introduced in this paper will live around tight geodesics. In appendices, we expand some of these studies to outside of the class of M-weakly tight geodesics.
