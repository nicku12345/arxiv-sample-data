Given a link L, the Blanchfield pairing \operatorname{Bl}(L) is a pairing which is defined on the torsion submodule of the Alexander module of L. In some particular cases, namely if L is a boundary link or if the Alexander module of L is torsion, \operatorname{Bl}(L) can be computed explicitly; however no formula is known in general. In this article, we compute the Blanchfield pairing of any link, generalizing the aforementioned results. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof that the Blanchfield pairing is hermitian. Finally, we also obtain short proofs of several properties of \operatorname{Bl}(L).
