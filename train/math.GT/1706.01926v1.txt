We consider random walks on the mapping class group that have finite first moment with respect to the word metric, whose support generates a non-elementary subgroup and contains a pseudo-Anosov map whose invariant Teichmuller geodesic is in the principal stratum of quadratic differentials. We show that a Teichmuller geodesic typical with respect to the harmonic measure for such random walks, is recurrent to the thick part of the principal stratum. As a consequence, the vertical and horizontal foliations of such a random Teichmuller geodesic have no saddle connections.
