Let A\neq 0 be a complex number with  |A|\neq 1. Let M be a compact smooth oriented 3-manifold, the SU(3)-skein space of M, S_A(M), is the vector space over \mathbb{C} generated by framed oriented links (including framed oriented trivalent graphs in M) quotient by the SU(3)-skein relations due to Kuperberg. For a closed, orientable surface F, we construct a local diffeomorphism invariant trace on S_A(F\times I).
