Hom and Wu introduced a knot concordance invariant called \nu^+, which dominates many concordance invariants derived from Heegaard Floer homology. In this paper, we give a full-twist inequality for \nu^+. By using the inequality, we extend Wu's cabling formula for \nu^+ (which is proved only for particular positive cables) to all cables in the form of an inequality. In addition, we also discuss \nu^+-equivalence, which is an equivalence relation on the knot concordance group. We introduce a partial order on \nu^+-equivalence classes, and study its relationship to full-twists.
