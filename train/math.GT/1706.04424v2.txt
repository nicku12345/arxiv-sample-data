We show that the problem of recognizing that a knot diagram represents a specific torus knot, or any torus knot at all, is in the complexity class {\sf NP} \cap {\sf co\text{-}NP}, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis. We also show that satellite knot detection is in {\sf NP} under the same assumption, and that cabled knot detection and composite knot detection are unconditionally in {\sf NP}. Our algorithms are based on recent work of Kuperberg and of Lackenby on detecting knottedness.
