We consider bundle homomorphisms between tangent distributions and vector bundles of the same rank. We study the conditions for fundamental singularities when the bundle homomorphism is induced from a Morin map. When the tangent distribution is the contact structure, we characterize singularities of the bundle homomorphism by using the Hamilton vector fields.
