In quantum geometry, we consider a set of loops, a compact orientable surface and a solid compact spatial region, all inside \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3 \equiv \mathbb{R}^4, which forms a triple. We want to define an ambient isotopic equivalence relation on such triples, so that we can obtain equivalence invariants. These invariants describe how these submanifolds are causally related to or `linked' with each other, and they are closely associated with the linking number between links in \mathbb{R}^3. Because we distinguish the time-axis from spatial subspace in \mathbb{R}^4, we see that these equivalence relations, will also imply causality.
