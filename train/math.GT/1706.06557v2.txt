We give a bordered extension of involutive HF-hat and use it to give an algorithm to compute involutive HF-hat for general 3-manifolds. We also explain how the mapping class group action on HF-hat can be computed using bordered Floer homology. As applications, we prove that involutive HF-hat satisfies a surgery exact triangle and compute HFI-hat of the branched double covers of all 10-crossing knots.
