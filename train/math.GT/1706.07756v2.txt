Geometric interpretations of some virtual knot invariants are given in terms of invariants of links in \mathbb{S}^3. Alexander polynomials of almost classical knots are shown to be specializations of the multi-variable Alexander polynomial of certain two-component boundary links of the form J \sqcup K with J a fibered knot. The index of a crossing, a common ingredient in the construction of virtual knot invariants, is related to the Milnor triple linking number of certain three-component links J \sqcup K_1 \sqcup K_2 with J a connected sum of trefoils or figure-eights. Our main technical tool is virtual covers. This technique, due to Manturov and the first author, associates a virtual knot \upsilon to a link J \sqcup K, where J is fibered and \text{lk}(J,K)=0. Here we extend virtual covers to all multicomponent links L=J \sqcup K, with K a knot. It is shown that an unknotted component J_0 can be added to L so that J_0 \sqcup J is fibered and K has algebraic intersection number zero with a fiber of J_0 \sqcup J. This is called fiber stabilization. It provides an avenue for studying all links with virtual knots.
