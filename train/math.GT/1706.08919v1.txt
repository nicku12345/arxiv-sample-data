The family of negative torus links T_{p,q} over a fixed number of strands p admits a stable limit in reduced Khovanov homology as q grows to infinity. In this paper, we endow this stable space with a bi-graded commutative algebra structure. We describe these algebras explicitly for p=2,3,4. As an application, we compute the homology of two families of links, and produce a lower bound for the width of the homology of any 4-stranded torus link.
