We prove an inequality that must be satisfied by displacement of generators of free Fuchsian groups, which is the two-dimensional version of the \log (2k-1) Theorem for Kleinian groups due to Anderson-Canary-Culler-Shalen. As applications, we obtain quantitative results on the geometry of hyperbolic surfaces such as the two-dimensional Margulis constant and lengths of closed curves, which improves a result of Buser's.
