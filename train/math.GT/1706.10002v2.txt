For a finite simplicial graph \Gamma, let A(\Gamma) denote the right-angled Artin group on \Gamma. Recently Kim and Koberda introduced the extension graph \Gamma^e for \Gamma, and established the Extension Graph Theorem: for finite simplicial graphs \Gamma_1 and \Gamma_2 if \Gamma_1 embeds into \Gamma_2^e as an induced subgraph then A(\Gamma_1) embeds into A(\Gamma_2). In this article we show that the converse of this theorem does not hold for the case \Gamma_1 is the complement of a tree and for the case \Gamma_2 is the complement of a path graph.
