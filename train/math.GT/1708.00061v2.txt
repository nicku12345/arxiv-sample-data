We generalize H. Seifert's algorithm for finding a Seifert surface for a knot or link. The generalization applies to "framed oriented measured lamination links." For knots, a Seifert surface determines a unique framing. In our setting, we analyze the set of framed lamination links which bound Seifert laminations and are carried by an S^1-fibered tube neighborhood of an oriented train track embedded in a 3-manifold.
