We provide a geometric characterization of spaces with measured walls that embed isometrically into median metric spaces, so that the embedded image is at finite Hausdorff distance from the target median space. Products of real hyperbolic spaces satisfy this property, therefore uniform lattices in such products act properly coboundedly on a median space. This is the best one can obtain in terms of median geometry for the latter lattices, since they are not cubulable, and more generally cannot act properly cocompactly on a median metric space. As a byproduct we provide evidence that Rips-type theorems cannot hold for actions on median spaces, even under strong hypotheses such as proper cobounded action and finite presentability. We prove that complex hyperbolic metric spaces, when endowed with the only known structure of space with measured walls, cannot be at finite Hausdorff distance from a median metric space.
