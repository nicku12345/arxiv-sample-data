In this paper, we investigate abelian knot contact homology by using the trace-free slice of a knot, which is the cross-section of the character variety of a knot cut by the hyperplanes defined by meridionally trace-free (traceless) conditions. We first give a set of equations whose common solutions coincide with the trace-free slice. This gives us a strong tool to describe exactly the relationship between the trace-free slice, degree 0 abelian knot contact homology and the character variety of the 2-fold branched cover of the 3-sphere branched along the knot. Using this relationship, we introduce a notion called ghost characters of a knot to check the followings: (1) when the conjecture given by L. Ng concerned with the above relationship does not hold, (2) when the map from the trace-free slice to the character variety of the 2-fold branched cover, constructed by Y. Yamaguchi and the author, is not surjective. Note that in the recent paper of Christopher R. Cornwell, he has translated the results on the above relationship into the language of "reflective augmentation".
