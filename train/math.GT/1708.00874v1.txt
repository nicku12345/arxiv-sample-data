We calculate ghost characters for the (5,6)-torus knot, and using them we show that the (5,6)-torus knot gives a counter-example of Ng's conjecture concerned with the relationship between degree 0 abelian knot contact homology and the character variety of the 2-fold branched covering of the 3-sphere branched along the knot.
