In this paper, we consider generalizations of the Alexander polynomial and signature of 2-bridge knots by considering the Gordon-Litherland bilinear forms associated to essential state surfaces of the 2-bridge knots. We show that the resulting invariants are well-defined and explore properties of these invariants. Finally we realize the boundary slopes of the essential surfaces as a difference of signatures of the knot.
