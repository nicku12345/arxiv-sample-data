It is known that for any knot K every (meridionally) trace-free SL_2(C)-representation of the knot group G(K) gives an SL_2(C)-representation of the fundamental group \pi_1(\Sigma_2K) of the 2-fold branched covering \Sigma_2K of the 3-sphere branched along K. In this paper, we show by using a notion called a ghost character of a knot that for the (4,5)-torus knot T_{4,5} the fundamental group \pi_1(\Sigma_2T_{4,5}) has an SL(2,C)-representation which cannot be given by any trace-free SL_2(C)-representation of G(T_{4,5}).
