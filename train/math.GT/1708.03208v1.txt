Any two homologous surfaces of the same genus embedded in a smooth 4-manifold X with simply-connected complements are shown to be smoothly isotopic in the connected sum of X and the product of a 2-sphere with itself, if the surfaces are ordinary, and in the connected sum of X with the non-trivial sphere bundle over the sphere if they are characteristic.
