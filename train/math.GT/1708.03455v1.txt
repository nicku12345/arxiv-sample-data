For each n, we construct a separable metric space \mathbb{U}_n that is universal in the coarse category of separable metric spaces with asymptotic dimension (\mathop{asdim}) at most n and universal in the uniform category of separable metric spaces with uniform dimension (\mathop{udim}) at most n. Thus, \mathbb{U}_n serves as a universal space for dimension n in both the large-scale and infinitesimal topology. More precisely, we prove:   \[   \mathop{asdim} \mathbb{U}_n = \mathop{udim} \mathbb{U}_n = n   \] and such that for each separable metric space X,   a) if \mathop{asdim} X \leq n, then X is coarsely equivalent to a subset of \mathbb{U}_n;   b) if \mathop{udim} X \leq n, then X is uniformly homeomorphic to a subset of \mathbb{U}_n.
