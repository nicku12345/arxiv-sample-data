In this paper, we define the set of singular grid diagrams \mathcal{SG} which provides a unified description for singular links, singular Legendrian links, singular transverse links, and singular braids. We also classify the complete set of all equivalence relations on \mathcal{SG} which induce the bijection onto each singular object. This is an extension of the known result of Ng-Thurston for non-singular links and braids.
