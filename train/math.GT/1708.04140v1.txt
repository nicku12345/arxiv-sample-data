Scharlemann and Thompson define the width of a 3-manifold M as a notion of complexity based on the topology of M. Their original definition had the property that the adjacency relation on handles gave a linear order on handles, but here we consider a more general definition due to Saito, Scharlemann and Schultens, in which the adjacency relation on handles may give an arbitrary graph. We show that for compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds, this is linearly related to a notion of metric complexity, based on the areas of level sets of Morse functions to graphs, which we call Gromov area.
