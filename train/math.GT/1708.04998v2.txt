We characterize the fractional Dehn twist coefficient of a braid in terms of a slope of the homogenization of the Upsilon function, where Upsilon is the function-valued concordance homomorphism defined by Ozsv\'ath, Stipsicz, and Szab\'o. We use this characterization to prove that n-braids with fractional Dehn twist coefficient larger than n-1 realize the braid index of their closure. As a consequence, we are able to prove a conjecture of Malyutin and Netsvetaev stating that n-times twisted braids realize the braid index of their closure. We provide examples that address the optimality of our results. The paper ends with an appendix about the homogenization of knot concordance homomorphisms.
