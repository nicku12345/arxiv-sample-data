In this work we will build a fundamental domain for Deligne-Mostow lattices in PU(2,1) with 2-fold symmetry, which complete the whole list of Deligne-Mostow lattices in dimension 2. These lattices were introduced by Deligne and Mostow using monodromy of hypergeometric functions and have been reinterpreted by Thurston as authomorphisms on a sphere with cone singularities. Following his approach, Parker, Boadi and Parker, and Pasquinelli built a fundamental domain for the class of lattices with 3-fold symmetry, i.e. when three of five cone singularities have same cone angle. Here we extend this construction to the asymmetric case, where only two of the five cone points on the sphere have same cone angle, so to have a fundamental domain for each commensurability class of Deligne-Mostow lattices in PU(2,1).
