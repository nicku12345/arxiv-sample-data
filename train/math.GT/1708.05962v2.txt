We show that for each Seifert form of an algebraically slice knot with nontrivial Alexander polynomial, there exists an infinite family of knots having the Seifert form such that the knots are linearly independent in the knot concordance group and not concordant to any knot with coprime Alexander polynomial. Key ingredients for the proof are Cheeger-Gromov-von Neumann rho-invariants for amenable groups developed by Cha and Orr and polynomial splittings of metabelian rho-invariants.
