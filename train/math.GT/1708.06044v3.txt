Let Sp(2,1) be the isometry group of the quaternionic hyperbolic plane {{\bf H}_{\mathbb H}}^2. An element g in Sp(2,1) is `hyperbolic' if it fixes exactly two points on the boundary of {{\bf H}_{\mathbb H}}^2. We classify pairs of hyperbolic elements in Sp(2,1) up to conjugation.   A hyperbolic element of Sp(2,1) is called `loxodromic' if it has no real eigenvalue. We show that the set of Sp(2,1) conjugation orbits of irreducible loxodromic pairs is a (\mathbb C {\mathbb P}^1)^4-bundle over a topological space that is locally a semi-analytic subspace of {\mathbb R}^{13}. We use the above classification to show that conjugation orbits of `geometric' representations of a closed surface group (of genus g \geq 2) into Sp(2,1) can be determined by a system of 42g-42 real parameters.   Further, we consider the groups Sp(1,1) and GL(2, {\mathbb H}). These groups also act by the orientation-preserving isometries of the four and five dimensional real hyperbolic spaces respectively. We classify conjugation orbits of pairs of hyperbolic elements in these groups. These classifications determine conjugation orbits of `geometric' surface group representations into these groups.
