We introduce the multiplexing of a crossing, replacing a classical crossing of a virtual link diagram with multiple crossings which is a mixture of classical and virtual. For integers m_{i} (i=1,\ldots,n) and an ordered n-component virtual link diagram D, a new virtual link diagram D(m_{1},\ldots,m_{n}) is obtained from D by the multiplexing of all crossings. For welded isotopic virtual link diagrams D and D', D(m_{1},\ldots,m_{n}) and D'(m_{1},\ldots,m_{n}) are welded isotopic. From the point of view of classical link theory, it seems very interesting that D(m_{1},\ldots,m_{n}) could not be welded isotopic to a classical link diagram even if D is a classical one, and new classical link invariants are expected from known welded link invariants via the multiplexing of crossings.
