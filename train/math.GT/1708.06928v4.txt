Let F_g be a closed orientable surface of genus g. A set \Omega = \{ \gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_s\} of pairwise non-homotopic simple closed curves on F_g is called a \emph{filling system} or simply a \emph{filling} of F_g, if F_g\setminus \Omega is a union of b topological discs for some b\geq 1. A filling system is called \emph{minimal}, if b=1. The \emph{size} of a filling is defined as the number of its elements. We prove that the maximum size of a filling of F_g with b complementary discs is 2g+b-1. Next, we show that for g\geq 2, b\geq 1\text{ with }(g,b)\neq (2,1) (resp. (g,b)=(2,1)) and for each 2\leq s\leq 2g+b-1 (resp. 3\leq s\leq 2g+b-1), there exists a filling of F_g of size s with b complementary discs.   Furthermore, we study geometric intersection number of curves in a minimal filling. For g\geq 2, we show that for a minimal filling \Omega of size s, the \emph{geometric intersection numbers} satisfy \max \left\lbrace i(\gamma_i, \gamma_j)| i\neq j\right\rbrace\leq 2g-s+1, and for each such s there exists a minimal filling \Omega=\left\lbrace \gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_s \right\rbrace such that \max\left\lbrace i(\gamma_i, \gamma_j) | i\neq j\right\rbrace = 2g-s+1.
