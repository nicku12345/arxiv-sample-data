We survey some tools and techniques for determining geometric properties of a link complement from a link diagram. In particular, we survey the tools used to estimate geometric invariants in terms of basic diagrammatic link invariants. We focus on determining when a link is hyperbolic, estimating its volume, and bounding its cusp shape and cusp area. We give sample applications and state some open questions and conjectures.
