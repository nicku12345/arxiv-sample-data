For the product S_1\times S_2 of any two connected compact hyperbolic surfaces S_1 and S_2, we give a finite bound \mathcal{B} such that for any self-homeomorphism f of S_1\times S_2 and any fixed point class F of f, the index |ind(f, F)|\leq \mathcal{B}, which is an affirmative answer for a special case of a question asked by Boju Jiang. Moreover, we also give bounds for the Lefschetz number L(f) and the Nielsen number N(f) of the homeomorphism f.
