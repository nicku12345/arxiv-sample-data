We show that the bar version of the \mathrm{Pin}(2)-monopole Floer homology of a three-manifold Y equipped with a self-conjugate spin^c structure \mathfrak{s} is determined by the triple cup product of Y together with the Rokhlin invariants of the spin structures inducing \mathfrak{s}. This is a manifestation of mod 2 index theory, and can be interpreted as a three-dimensional counterpart of Atiyah's classic results regarding spin structures on Riemann surfaces.
