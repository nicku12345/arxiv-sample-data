In this paper we give a close-to-sharp answer to the basic questions: When is there a continuous way to add a point to a configuration of n ordered points on a surface S of finite type so that all the points are still distinct? When this is possible, what are all the ways to do it? More precisely, let PConf_n(S) be the space of ordered n-tuple of distinct points in S. Let f_n(S): \text{PConf}_{n+1}(S) \to \text{PConf}_n(S) be the map given by f_n(x_0,x_1,\ldots ,x_n):=(x_1,\ldots ,x_n). We classify all continuous sections of f_n up to homotopy by proving the following.   1. If S=\mathbb{R}^2 and n>3, any section of f_{n}(S) is either "adding a point at infinity" or "adding a point near x_k". (We define these two terms in Section 2.1; whether we can define "adding a point near x_k" or "adding a point at infinity" depends in a delicate way on properties of S. )   2. If S=S^2 a 2-sphere and n>4, any section of f_{n}(S) is "adding a point near x_k"; if S=S^2 and n=2, the bundle f_n(S) does not have a section. (We define this term in Section 3.2)   3. If S=S_g a surface of genus g>1 and for n>1, we give an easy proof that the bundle f_{n}(S) does not have a section.
