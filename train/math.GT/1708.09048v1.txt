In this paper we show how to lift Lagrangian immersions in \mathbb{C} P^{n-1} to produce Lagrangian cones in \mathbb{C} ^n, and use this process to produce several families of examples of Lagrangian cones and special Lagrangian cones. Moreover we show how to produce Lagrangian cones, isotopic to the Harvey-Lawson and trivial cones, whose projections to \mathbb{C} P^{n-1} are immersions with few transverse double points.
