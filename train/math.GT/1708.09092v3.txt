We introduce an Alexander polynomial for MOY graphs. For a framed trivalent MOY graph \mathbb{G}, we refine the construction and obtain a framed ambient isotopy invariant \Delta_{(\mathbb{G},c)}(t). The invariant \Delta_{(\mathbb{G}, c)}(t) satisfies a series of relations, which we call MOY-type relations, and conversely these relations determine \Delta_{(\mathbb{G}, c)}(t). Using them we provide a graphical definition of the Alexander polynomial of a link. Finally, we discuss some properties and applications of our invariants.
