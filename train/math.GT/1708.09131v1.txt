The Kauffman-Vogel polynomials are three variable polynomial invariants of 4-valent rigid vertex graphs. A one-variable specialization of the Kauffman-Vogel polynomials for unoriented 4-valent rigid vertex graphs was given by using the Kauffman bracket and the Jones-Wenzl idempotent colored with 2. Bataineh, Elhamdadi and Hajij generalized it to any color with even positive integers. We give another generalization of the one-variable Kauffman-Vogel polynomial for oriented and unoriented 4-valent rigid vertex graphs by using the A_2 bracket and the A_2 clasps. These polynomial invariants are considered as the \mathfrak{sl}_3 colored Jones polynomials for singular knots and links.
