We continue our study of the realization problem for prism manifolds. Every prism manifold can be parametrized by a pair of relatively prime integers p>1 and q. We determine a complete list of prism manifolds P(p, q) that can be realized by positive integral surgeries on knots in S^3 when q>p. The methodology undertaken to obtain the classification is similar to that of the case q<0 in an earlier paper.
