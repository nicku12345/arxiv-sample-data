For g>3, we give two proofs of the fact that the \emph{Birman exact sequence} for the Torelli group \[ 1\to \pi_1(S_g)\to {\cal I}_{g,1}\to {\cal I}_g\to 1 \] does not split. This result was claimed by G. Mess in \cite{mess1990unit}, but his proof has a critical and unrepairable error which will be discussed in the introduction. Let {\cal UI}_{g,n}\xrightarrow{Tu'_{g,n}} {\cal BI}_{g,n} (resp. {\cal UPI}_{g,n}\xrightarrow{Tu_{g,n}}{\cal BPI}_{g,n}) denote the universal surface bundle over the Torelli space fixing n points as a set (resp. pointwise). We also deduce that Tu'_{g,n} has no sections when n>1 and that Tu_{g,n} has precisely n distinct sections for n\ge 0 up to homotopy.
