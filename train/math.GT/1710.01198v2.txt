Certain fibered hyperbolic 3-manifolds admit a \mathit{\text{layered veering triangulation}}, which can be constructed algorithmically given the stable lamination of the monodromy. These triangulations were introduced by Agol in 2011, and have been further studied by several others in the years since. We obtain experimental results which shed light on the combinatorial structure of veering triangulations, and its relation to certain topological invariants of the underlying manifold.
