We construct the first examples of asymmetric L-space knots in S^3. More specifically, we exhibit a construction of hyperbolic knots in S^3 with both (i) a surgery that may be realized as a surgery on a strongly invertible link such that the result of the surgery is the double branched cover of an alternating link and (ii) trivial isometry group. In particular, this produces L-space knots in S^3 which are not strongly invertible. The construction also immediately extends to produce asymmetric L-space knots in any lens space, including S^1 \times S^2.
