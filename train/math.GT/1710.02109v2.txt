We establish a link between the holomorphic derivatives of Thurston's hyperbolic gluing equations on an ideally triangulated finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold and the cohomology of the sheaf of infinitesimal isometries. Moreover, we provide a geometric reformulation of the non-abelian Reidemeister torsion corresponding to the adjoint of the monodromy representation of the hyperbolic structure. These results are then applied to the study of the `1-loop Conjecture' of Dimofte-Garoufalidis, which we generalize to arbitrary 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We rigorously verify the generalized conjecture in the case of the sister manifold of the figure-eight knot complement.
