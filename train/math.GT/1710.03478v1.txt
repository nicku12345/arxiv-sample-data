Let S be a closed connected oriented surface of genus g>0. We study a Poisson subalgebra W_1(g) of C^{\infty}(\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_1(S), \mathrm{GL}(1, \mathbb{R}))/\mathrm{GL}(1, \mathbb{R})), the smooth functions on the moduli space of flat \mathrm{GL}(1, \mathbb{R})-bundles over S. There is a surjective Lie algebra homomorphism from the Goldman Lie algebra onto W_1(g). We classify all cobrackets on W_1(g) up to coboundary, that is, we compute H^1(W_1(g), W_1(g)\wedge W_1(g))\cong \mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}^{2g}, \mathbb{R}). As a result, there is no cohomology class corresponding to the Turaev cobracket on W_1(g).
