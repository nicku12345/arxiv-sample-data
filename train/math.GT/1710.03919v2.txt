It was shown that any \mathbb{Z}-colorable link has a diagram which admits a non-trivial \mathbb{Z}-coloring with at most four colors. In this paper, we consider minimal numbers of colors for non-trivial \mathbb{Z}-colorings on minimal diagrams of \mathbb{Z}-colorable links. We show, for any positive integer N, there exists a minimal diagram of a \mathbb{Z}-colorable link such that any \mathbb{Z}-coloring on the diagram has at least N colors. On the other hand, it is shown that certain \mathbb{Z}-colorable torus links have minimal diagrams admitting \mathbb{Z}-colorings with only four colors.
