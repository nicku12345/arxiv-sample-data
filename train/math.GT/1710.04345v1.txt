Let X be a bundle over S^1 with fiber a 3--manifold M and with monodromy \varphi. Gay and Kirby showed that if \varphi fixes a genus g Heegaard splitting of M then X has a genus 6g+1 trisection. Genus 3g+1 trisections have been found in certain special cases, such as the case where \varphi is trivial, and it is known that trisections of genus lower than 3g+1 cannot exist in general. We generalize these results to prove that there exists a trisection of genus 3g+1 whenever \varphi fixes a genus g Heegaard surface of M. This means that \varphi can be nontrivial, and can preserve or switch the two handlebodies of the Heegaard splitting. We additionally describe an algorithm to draw a diagram for such a trisection given a Heegaard diagram for M and a description of \varphi.
