Determining unknotting numbers is a large and widely studied problem. We consider the more general question of the unknotting number of a spatial graph. We show the unknotting number of spatial graphs is subadditive. Let g be an embedding of a planar graph G, then we show u(g) \geq \max\{u(s) | s is a non-overlapping set of constituents of g\}.   Focusing on \theta-curves, we determine the exact unknotting numbers of the \theta-curves in the Litherland-Moriuchi Table. Additionally, we demonstrate unknotting crossing changes for all of the curves. In doing this we introduce new methods for obstructing unknotting number 1 in \theta-curves.
