Let M be a compact smooth Riemannian n-manifold with boundary. We combine Gromov's amenable localization technique with the Poincar\'{e} duality to study the {\sf traversally generic} geodesic flows on SM, the space of the spherical tangent bundle. Such flows generate stratifications of SM, governed by rich universal combinatorics. The stratification reflects the ways in which the flow trajectories are tangent to the boundary \partial(SM). Specifically, we get lower estimates of the numbers of connected components of these flow-generated strata of any given codimension k in terms of the normed homology H_k(M; \mathbf R) and H_k(DM; \mathbf R), where DM = M\cup_{\partial M} M denotes the double of M. The norms here are the {\sf simplicial semi-norms} in homology. The more complex the metric on M is, the more numerous the strata of SM and S(DM) are. %So one may regard our estimates as analogues of the Morse inequalities for the geodesics on manifolds with boundary. It turns out that the normed homology spaces form obstructions to the existence of globally k-{\sf convex} traversally generic metrics on M. We also prove that knowing the geodesic scattering map on M makes it possible to reconstruct the stratified topological type of the space of geodesics, as well as the amenably localized Poincar\'{e} duality operators on SM.
