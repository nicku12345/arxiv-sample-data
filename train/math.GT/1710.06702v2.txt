In this article, we prove a generalization of a theorem of Lisca-Matic to Stein cobordisms and develop a method for distinguishing certain Stein cobordisms using rotation numbers. Using these results along with standard techniques from convex surface theory and classifications of tight contact structures on certain 3-manifolds due to Honda, we classify the tight contact structures on a certain class of plumbed 3-manifolds that bound non-simply connected 4-manifolds. Moreover, we give descriptions of the Stein fillings of the Stein fillable contact structures.
