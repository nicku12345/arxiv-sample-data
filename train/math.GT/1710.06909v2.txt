We present the results of Axel Seeliger's tabulation of symmetric union presentations for ribbon knots with crossing numbers 11 and 12 and exhibit possible examples for ribbon knots which are not representable as symmetric unions. In addition, we give a complete atlas of band diagrams for prime ribbon knots with 11 and 12 crossings.
