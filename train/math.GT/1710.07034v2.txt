We prove for any positive integer n there exist boundary-sum irreducible {\mathbb Z}_n-corks with Stein structure. Here `boundary-sum irreducible' means the manifold is indecomposable with respect to boundary-sum. We also verify that some of the finite order corks admit hyperbolic boundary by HIKMOT.
