Let M be a geometrically finite m-dimensional hyperbolic manifold, where m \geq 2, and let G be a finite group of its isometries. We provide a formula for the number of connected components of the locus of fixed points of any element of G in terms of its action. This formula extends Macbetah's one for the case of compact Riemann surfaces of genus at least two, which was initially used to obtain the character of the representation associated to the induced action of G on the first homology group, and later turned out to be extremely useful in many other contexts.
