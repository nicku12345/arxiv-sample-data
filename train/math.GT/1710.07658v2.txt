Let L be a oriented link such that \Sigma_n(L), the n-fold cyclic cover of S^3 branched over L, is an L-space for some n \geq 2. We show that if either L is a strongly quasipositive link other than one with Alexander polynomial a multiple of (t-1)^{2g(L) + (|L|-1)}, or L is a quasipositive link other than one with Alexander polynomial divisible by (t-1)^{2g_4(L) + (|L|-1)}, then there is an integer n(L), determined by the Alexander polynomial of L in the first case and the Alexander polynomial of L and the smooth 4-genus of L, g_4(L), in the second, such that n \leq n(L). If K is a strongly quasipositive knot with monic Alexander polynomial such as an L-space knot, we show that \Sigma_n(K) is not an L-space for n \geq 6, and that the Alexander polynomial of K is a non-trivial product of cyclotomic polynomials if \Sigma_n(K) is an L-space for some n = 2, 3, 4, 5. Our results allow us to calculate the smooth and topological 4-ball genera of, for instance, quasi-alternating quasipositive links. They also allow us to classify strongly quasipositive alternating links and 3-strand pretzel links.
