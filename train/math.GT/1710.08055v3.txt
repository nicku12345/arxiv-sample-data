We establish a structural understanding of the involutive Heegaard Floer homology for all linear combinations of almost-rational (AR) plumbed three-manifolds. We use this to show that the Neumann-Siebenmann invariant is a homology cobordism invariant for all linear combinations of AR plumbed homology spheres. As a corollary, we prove that if Y is a linear combination of AR plumbed homology spheres with \mu(Y) = 1, then Y is not torsion in the homology cobordism group. A general computation of the involutive Heegaard Floer correction terms for these spaces is also included.
