Let \mathbf{E} be a flat Lorentzian space of signature (2, 1). A Margulis space-time is a noncompact complete flat Lorentzian 3-manifold \mathbf{E}/\Gamma with a free holonomy group \Gamma of rank \mathbf{g}, \mathbf{g} \geq 2. We consider the case when \Gamma contains a parabolic element. We show that \mathbf{E}/\Gamma is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact handlebody of genus \mathbf{g} generalizing our earlier result. Also, we obtain a bordification of the Margulis space-time with parabolics by adding a real projective surface at infinity giving us a compactification as a manifold relative to parabolic end neighborhoods. Our method is to find the estimation of the translational parts of the affine transformation group and to use some 3-manifold topology.
