Let M be a 3-manifold with a finite set X(M) of conjugacy classes of representations \rho:\pi_1(M)\toSU_2. We study here the distribution of the values of the Chern-Simons function CS:X(M)\to \mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}. We observe in some examples that it resembles the distribution of quadratic residues. In particular for specific sequences of 3-manifolds, the invariants tends to become equidistributed on the circle with white noise fluctuations of order |X(M)|^{-1/2}. We prove that for a manifold with toric boundary the Chern-Simons invariants of the Dehn fillings M_{p/q} have the same behaviour when p and q go to infinity and compute fluctuations at first order.
