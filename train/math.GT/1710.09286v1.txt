We consider orientation-preserving actions of finite groups G on pairs (S^3, \Sigma), where \Sigma denotes a compact connected surface embedded in S^3. In a previous paper, we considered the case of closed, necessarily orientable surfaces, determined for each genus g>1 the maximum order of such a G for all embeddings of a surface of genus g, and classified the corresponding embeddings.   In the present paper we obtain analogous results for the case of bordered surfaces \Sigma (i.e. with non-empty boundary, orientable or not). Now the genus g gets replaced by the algebraic genus \alpha of \Sigma (the rank of its free fundamental group); for each \alpha > 1 we determine the maximum order m_\alpha of an action of G, classify the topological types of the corresponding surfaces (topological genus, number of boundary components, orientability) and their embeddings into S^3. For example, the maximal possibility 12(\alpha - 1) is obtained for the finitely many values \alpha = 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 25, 97, 121 and 241.
