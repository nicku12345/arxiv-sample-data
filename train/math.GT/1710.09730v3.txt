In the setting of finite type invariants for null-homologous knots in rational homology 3-spheres with respect to null Lagrangian-preserving surgeries, there are two candidates to be universal invariants, defined respectively by Kricker and Lescop. In a previous paper, the second author defined maps between spaces of Jacobi diagrams. Injectivity for these maps would imply that Kricker and Lescop invariants are indeed universal invariants; this would prove in particular that these two invariants are equivalent. In the present paper, we investigate the injectivity status of these maps for degree 2 invariants, in the case of knots whose Blanchfield modules are direct sums of isomorphic Blanchfield modules of Q-dimension two. We prove that they are always injective except in one case, for which we determine explicitly the kernel.
