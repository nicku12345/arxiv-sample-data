Let \Delta_{L,\rho_n}(t) be the twisted Alexander polynomial with respect to the representation given by the composition of the lift of the holonomy representation of a certain hyperbolic link L and the n-dimensional irreducible complex representation of \text{SL}(2,\mathbb C). We consider a sequence of \Delta_{L,\rho_n}(t) and extract the volume of the complement of L from the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence obtained by evaluating t=1 or t=-1.
