This note corrects the mistakes in the splicing formulas of the paper "Floer homology and splicing knot complements". The mistakes are the result of the incorrect assumption that for a knot K inside a homology sphere Y, the involution on the knot Floer homology of K which corresponds to moving the basepoints by one full twist around K is trivial. The correction implicitly involves considering the contribution from this (possibly non-trivial) involution in a number of places.
