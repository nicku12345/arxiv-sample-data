It is known that connected sums of positive torus knots are not concordant to L-space knots. Here we consider differences of torus knots. The main result states that the subgroup of the concordance group generated by two positive torus knots contains no nontrivial L-space knots other than the torus knots themselves. Generalizations to subgroups generated by more than two torus knots are also considered.
