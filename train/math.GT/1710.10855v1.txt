In the following text we prove that for all finite p\geq0 there exists a topological graph X such that \{p,p+1,p+2,\ldots\}\cup\{+\infty\} is the collection of all possible heights for transformation groups with phase space X. Moreover for all topological graph X with p as height of transformation group (Homeo(X),X), \{p,p+1,p+2,\ldots\}\cup\{+\infty\} again is the collection of all possible heights for transformation groups with phase space X.
