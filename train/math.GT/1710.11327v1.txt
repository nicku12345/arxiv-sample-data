We define and compare several natural ways to compute the bridge number of a knot diagram. We study bridge numbers of crossing number minimizing diagrams, as well as the behavior of diagrammatic bridge numbers under the connected sum operation. For each notion of diagrammatic bridge number considered, we find crossing number minimizing knot diagrams which fail to minimize bridge number. Furthermore, we construct a family of minimal crossing diagrams for which the difference between diagrammatic bridge number and the actual bridge number of the knot grows to infinity.
