Consider a dihedral cover f: Y\to X with X and Y four-manifolds and f branched along an oriented surface embedded in X with isolated cone singularities. We prove that only a slice knot can arise as the unique singularity on an irregular dihedral cover f: Y\to S^4 if Y is homotopy equivalent to \mathbb{CP}^2 and construct an explicit infinite family of such covers with Y diffeomorphic to \mathbb{CP}^2. An obstruction to a knot being homotopically ribbon arises in this setting, and we describe a class of potential counter-examples to the Slice-Ribbon Conjecture.   Our tools include lifting a trisection of a singularly embedded surface in a four-manifold X to obtain a trisection of the corresponding irregular dihedral branched cover of X, when such a cover exists. We also develop a combinatorial procedure to compute, using a formula by the second author, the contribution to the signature of the covering manifold which results from the presence of a singularity on the branching set.
