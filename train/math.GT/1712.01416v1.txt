Let \Sigma be a compact orientable surface of finite type with at least one boundary component. Let f \in \textup{Mod}(\Sigma) be a pseudo Anosov mapping class. We prove a conjecture of McMullen by showing that there exists a finite cover \widetilde{\Sigma} \to \Sigma and a lift \widetilde{f} of f such that \wt{f}_*: H_1(\wt{\Sigma}; \mathbb{Z}) \to H_1(\wt{\Sigma}; \mathbb{Z}) has an eigenvalue off the unit circle.
