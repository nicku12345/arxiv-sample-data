For a closed orientable connected 3-manifold M, its complexity \boldsymbol{T}(M) is defined to be the minimal number of tetrahedra in its triangulations. Under the assumption that M is prime (but not necessarily atoroidal), we establish a lower bound for the complexity \boldsymbol{T}(M) in terms of the \mathbb{Z}_{/2\mathbb{Z}}-coefficient Thurston norm for H^1(M;\mathbb{Z}_{/2\mathbb{Z}}): (1) for any rank-1 subgroup \{0,\varphi\} \leqslant H^1(M;\mathbb{Z}_{/2\mathbb{Z}}), we have \boldsymbol{T}(M) \geqslant 2+2||\varphi|| unless M is a lens space with \boldsymbol{T}(M)=1+2||\varphi||; (2) for any rank-2 subgroup \{0,\varphi_1,\varphi_2,\varphi_3\} \leqslant H^1(M;\mathbb{Z}_{/2\mathbb{Z}}), we have \boldsymbol{T}(M) \geqslant 2+||\varphi_1||+||\varphi_2||+||\varphi_3||. Under the extra assumption that M is atoroidal, these inequalities had already been shown by Jaco, Rubinstein, and Tillmann. Our work here shows that we do not need to require M to be atoroidal.
