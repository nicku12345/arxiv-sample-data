Let \nu be either the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o \tau-invariant or the Rasmussen s-invariant, suitably normalized. For a knot K, Livingston and Naik defined the invariant t_\nu(K) to be the minimum of k for which \nu of the k-twisted positive Whitehead double of K vanishes. They proved that t_\nu(K) is bounded above by -TB(-K), where TB is the maximal Thurston-Bennequin number. We use a blowing up process to find a crossing change formula and a new upper bound for t_\nu in terms of the unknotting number. As an application, we present infinitely many knots K such that the difference between Livingston-Naik's upper bound -TB(-K) and t_\nu(K) can be arbitrarily large.
