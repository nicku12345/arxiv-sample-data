Let S be a surface of genus g at least 2. A representation \rho:\pi_1S\longrightarrow \text{PSL}_2\Bbb R is said to be purely hyperbolic if its image consists only of hyperbolic elements other than the identity. We may wonder under which conditions such representations arise as holonomy of a hyperbolic cone-structure on S. In this work we will characterize them completely, giving necessary and sufficient conditions.
