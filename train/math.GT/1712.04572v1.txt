We consider closed topological 4-manifolds M with universal cover {S^2\times{S^2}} and Euler characteristic \chi(M) = 1. All such manifolds with \pi=\pi_1(M)\cong {\mathbb Z}/4 are homotopy equivalent. In this case, we show that there are four homeomorphism types, and propose a candidate for a smooth example which is not homeomorphic to the geometric quotient. If \pi\cong {\mathbb Z}/2 \times {\mathbb Z}/2, we show that there are three homotopy types (and between 6 and 24 homeomorphism types).
