In this work we establish the tightest lower bound up-to-date for the minimal crossing number of a satellite knot based on the minimal crossing number of the companion used to build the satellite. If M is the wrapping number of the pattern knot, we essentially show that c(Sat(P,C))>\frac{M^2}{2}c(C). The existence of this bound will be proven when the companion knot is adequate, and it will be further tuned in the case of the companion being alternating.
