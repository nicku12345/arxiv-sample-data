A virtual knot that has a homologically trivial representative \mathscr{K} in a thickened surface \Sigma \times [0,1] is said to be an almost classical (AC) knot. \mathscr{K} then bounds a Seifert surface F\subset \Sigma \times [0,1]. Seifert surfaces of AC knots are useful for computing concordance invariants and slice obstructions. However, Seifert surfaces in \Sigma \times [0,1] are difficult to construct. Here we introduce virtual Seifert surfaces of AC knots. These are planar figures representing F \subset \Sigma \times [0,1]. An algorithm for constructing a virtual Seifert surface from a Gauss diagram is given. This is applied to computing signatures and Alexander polynomials of AC knots. A canonical genus of AC knots is also studied. It is shown to be distinct from the virtual canonical genus of Stoimenow-Tchernov-Vdovina.
