We study the kernel of the evaluated Burau representation through the braid element \sigma_i \sigma_{i+1} \sigma_i. The element is significant as a part of the standard braid relation. We establish the form of this element's image raised to the n^{th} power. Interestingly, the cyclotomic polynomials arise and can be used to define the expression. The main result of this paper is that the Burau representation of the braid group of n strands for n \geq 3 is unfaithful at any primitive root of unity, excepting the first three.
