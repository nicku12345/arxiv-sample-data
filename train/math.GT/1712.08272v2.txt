We provide a unified framework for proving Reidemeister-invariance and functoriality for a wide range of link homology theories. These include Lee homology, Heegaard Floer homology of branched double covers, singular instanton homology, and \Szabo's geometric link homology theory. We follow Baldwin, Hedden, and Lobb (arXiv:1509.04691) in leveraging the relationships between these theories and Khovanov homology. We obtain stronger functoriality results by avoiding spectral sequences and instead showing that each theory factors through Bar-Natan's cobordism-theoretic link homology theory.
