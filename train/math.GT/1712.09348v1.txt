A virtual link diagram is called normal if the associated abstract link diagram is checkerboard colorable, and a virtual link is normal if it has a normal diagram as a representative. Normal virtual links have some properties similar to classical links.In this paper, we introduce a method of converting a virtual link diagram to a normal virtual link diagram. We show that the normal virtual link diagrams obtained by this method from two equivalent virtual link diagrams are equivalent. We discuss the relationship between this method and some invariants of virtual links.
