In this paper we study the common distance between points and the behavior of a constant length step discrete random walk on finite area hyperbolic surfaces. We show that if the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian is at least 1/4, then the distances on the surface are highly concentrated around the minimal possible value, and that the discrete random walk exhibits cutoff. This extends the results of Lubetzky and Peres ([20]) from the setting of Ramanujan graphs to the setting of hyperbolic surfaces. By utilizing density theorems of exceptional eigenvalues from [27], we are able to show that the results apply to congruence subgroups of SL_{2}\left(\mathbb{Z}\right) and other arithmetic lattices, without relying on the well known conjecture of Selberg ([28]).   Conceptually, we show the close relation between the cutoff phenomenon and temperedness of representations of algebraic groups over local fields, partly answering a question of Diaconis ([7]), who asked under what general phenomena cutoff exists.
