Extended strongly periodic links have been introduced by Przytycki and Sokolov as a symmetric surgery presentation of three-manifolds on which the finite cyclic group acts without fixed points. The purpose of this paper is to prove that the symmetry of these links is reflected by the first coefficients of the HOMFLYPT polynomial.
