Two criteria for a closed connected definite 4-manifold with infinite cyclic fundamental group to be TOP-split are given. One criterion extends a sufficient condition made in a previous paper. The result is equivalent to a purely algebraic result on the question asking when a positive definite Hermitian form over the ring of integral one-variable Laurent polynomials is represented by an integer matrix. As an application, an infinite family of orthogonally indecomposable unimodular odd definite symmetric Z-forms is produced.
