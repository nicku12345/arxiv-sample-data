We give lower bounds for the tunnel number of knots and handlebody-knots. We also give a lower bound for the cutting number, which is a "dual" notion to the tunnel number in the handlebody-knot theory. We provide necessary conditions for constituent handlebody-knots by using G-family of quandles colorings. The above two evaluations are obtained as the corollaries. Furthermore, we construct handlebody-knots with arbitrary tunnel number and cutting number.
