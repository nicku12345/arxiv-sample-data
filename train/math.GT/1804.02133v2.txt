In this paper we compute a presentation for the group of ring motions of the split union of a Hopf link with Euclidean components and a Euclidean circle. A key part of this work is the study of a short exact sequence of groups of ring motions of general ring links in \mathbb{R}^3. This sequence allowed us to build the main result from the previously known case of the ring group with one component, which a particular case of the ring groups studied by Brendle and Hatcher. This work is a first step towards the computation of a presentation for groups of motions of H-trivial links with an arbitrary number of components.
