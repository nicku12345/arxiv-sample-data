Parreau compactified the Hitchin component of a closed surface S of negative Euler characteristic in such a way that a boundary point corresponds to the projectivized length spectrum of an action of \pi_1(S) on an \mathbb R-Euclidean building. In this paper, we use the positivity properties of Hitchin representations introduced by Fock and Goncharov to explicitly describe the geometry of a preferred collection of apartments in the limiting building.
