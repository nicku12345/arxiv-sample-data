In a previous paper, we developed general techniques for constructing a variety of pseudo-collars, as defined by Guilbault and Tinsley, with roots in earlier work by Chapman and Siebenmann. As an application of our techniques, we exhibited an uncountable collection of pseudo-collars, all with the same boundary and similar fundamental group systems at infinity. Construction of that family was very specific; it relied on properties of Thompson's group V. In this paper, we provide a more general approach to constructing similar collections of examples. Instead of using Thompson's group V, we base our new examples on a broader and more common collection of groups, in particular, fundamental groups of certain hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
