There is a question asking whether a handle-irreducible summand of every stable-ribbon surface-link is a unique ribbon surface-link. This question for the case of a trivial surface-link is affirmatively answered. That is, a handle-irreducible summand of every stably trivial surface-link is only a trivial 2-link. By combining this result with an old result of F. Hosowaka and the author that every surface-knot with infinite cyclic fundamental group is a stably trivial surface-knot, it is concluded that every surface-knot with infinite cyclic fundamental group is a trivial (i.e., an unknotted) surface-knot.
