If A is an abelian group and \phi is an integer, let A(\phi) be the subgroup of A consisting of elements a \in A such that \phi \cdot a=0. We prove that if D is a diagram of a classical link L and 0=\phi_0,\phi_1,\dots,\phi_{n-1} are the invariant factors of an adjusted Goeritz matrix of D, then the group \mathcal{D}_{A}(D) of Dehn colorings of D with values in A is isomorphic to the direct product of A and A=A(\phi_{0}),A(\phi_1),\dots,A(\phi_{n-1}). It follows that the Dehn coloring groups of L are isomorphic to those of a connected sum of torus links T_{(2,\phi_1)} \text{ }\# \text{ } \cdots \text{ } \# \text{ } T_{(2,\phi_{n-1})}.
