We define and study a family of link invariants \mathit{HFK}_{n}(L). Although these homology theories are defined using holomorphic disc counts, they share many properties with sl_{n} homology. Using these theories, we give a framework that generalizes the conjectured spectral sequence from Khovanov homology to \delta-graded knot Floer homology. In particular, we conjecture that for all links L in S^3 and all n\ge 1, there is a spectral sequence from the sl_{n} homology of L to \mathit{HFK}_{n}(L).
