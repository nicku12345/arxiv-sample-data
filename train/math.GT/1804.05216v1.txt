This survey paper concerns mainly with some asymptotic topological properties of finitely presented discrete groups: quasi-simple filtration (QSF), geometric simple connectivity (GSC), topological inverse-representations, and the notion of easy groups. As we will explain, these properties are central in the theory of discrete groups seen from a topological viewpoint at infinity. Also, we shall outline the main steps of the achievements obtained in the last years around the very general question whether or not all finitely presented groups satisfy these conditions.
