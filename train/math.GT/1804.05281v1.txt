State surfaces are spanning surfaces of links that are obtained from link diagrams guided by the combinatorics underlying Kauffman's construction of the Jones polynomial via state models. Geometric properties of such surfaces are often dictated by simple link diagrammatic criteria, and the surfaces themselves carry important information about geometric structures of link complements. State surfaces also provide a tool for studying relations between Jones polynomials and topological invariants, such as the crosscap number or invariants coming from geometric structures on link complements (e.g. hyperbolic volume). This article is brief survey on some of the recent applications of state surfaces.
