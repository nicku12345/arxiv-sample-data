We compute the connected Heegaard Floer homology (defined by Hendricks, Hom, and Lidman) for a large class of 3-manifolds, including all linear combinations of Seifert fibered homology spheres. We show that for such manifolds, the connected Floer homology completely determines the local equivalence class of the associated \iota-complex. Some identities relating the rank of the connected Floer homology to the Rokhlin invariant and the Neumann-Siebenmann invariant are also derived. Our computations are based on combinatorial models inspired by the work of N\'emethi on lattice homology.
