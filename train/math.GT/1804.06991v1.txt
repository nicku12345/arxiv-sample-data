Let K be an unknot in 8-bridge position in the 3-sphere. We give an example of a pair of weak reducing disks D_1 and D_2 for K such that both disks obtained from D_i (i = 1, 2) by a surgery along any outermost disk in D_{3-i}, cut off by an outermost arc of D_i \cap D_{3-i} in D_{3-i}, are not weak reducing disks, i.e. the property of weak reducibility of compressing disks is not preserved by a disk surgery.
