We study the classification of slice disks of knots up to isotopy and diffeomorphism using an invariant in knot Floer homology. We compute the invariant of a slice disk obtained by deform-spinning, and show that it can be effectively used to distinguish non-isotopic slice disks with diffeomorphic complements.   Given a slice disk of a composite knot, we define a numerical stable diffeomorphism invariant called the rank. This can be used to show that a slice disk is not a boundary connected sum, and to give lower bounds on the complexity of certain hyperplane sections of the slice disk.
