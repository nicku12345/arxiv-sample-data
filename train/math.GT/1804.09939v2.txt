Let n be a positive integer. The aim of this paper is to study two local moves V(n) and V^{n} on welded links, which are generalizations of the crossing virtualization. We show that the V(n)-move is an unknotting operation on welded knots for any n, and give a classification of welded links up to V(n)-moves. On the other hand, we give a necessary condition for which two welded links are equivalent up to V^{n}-moves. This leads to show that the V^{n}-move is not an unknotting operation on welded knots except for n=1. We also discuss relations among V^{n}-moves, associated core groups and the multiplexing of crossings.
