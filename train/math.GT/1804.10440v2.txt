We study the quotient of the mapping class group \operatorname{Mod}_g^n of a surface of genus g with n punctures, by the subgroup \operatorname{Mod}_g^n[p] generated by the p-th powers of Dehn twists. Our first main result is that \operatorname{Mod}_g^1 /\operatorname{Mod}_g^1[p] contains an infinite normal subgroup of infinite index, and in particular is not commensurable to a higher-rank lattice, for all but finitely many explicit values of p. Next, we prove that \operatorname{Mod}_g^0/ \operatorname{Mod}_g^0[p] contains a K\"ahler subgroup of finite index, for every p\ge 2 coprime with six. Finally, we observe that the existence of finite-index subgroups of \operatorname{Mod}_g^0 with infinite abelianization is equivalent to the analogous problem for \operatorname{Mod}_g^0/ \operatorname{Mod}_g^0[p].
