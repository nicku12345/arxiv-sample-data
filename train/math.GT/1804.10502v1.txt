We prove two rigidity results for automorphism groups of the spaces ML(S) of measured laminations on a closed hyperbolic surface S and PML(S) of projective measured laminations on this surface. The results concern the homeomorphisms of ML(S) that preserve the geometric intersection between laminations and the homeomorphisms of PML(S) that preserve the zero sets of these intersection functions.
