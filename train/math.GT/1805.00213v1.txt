The lattice stick number s_L(L) of a link L is defined to be the minimal number of straight line segments required to construct a stick presentation of L in the cubic lattice. Hong, No and Oh found a general upper bound s_L(K) \leq 3 c(K) +2. A rational link can be represented by a lattice presentation with exactly 4 z-sticks.   An n-circuit is the disjoint union of n arcs in the lattice plane \mathbb{Z}^2. An n-circuit presentation is an embedding obtained from the n-circuit by connecting each n pair of vertices with one line segment above the circuit. By using a 2-circuit presentation, we can easily find the lattice presentation with exactly 4 z-sticks.   In this paper, we show that an upper bound for the lattice stick number of rational \dfrac{p}{q}-links realized with exactly 4 z-sticks is 2p+6. Furthermore it is 2p+5 if L is a 2-component link.
