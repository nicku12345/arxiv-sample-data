Given an S\cong \mathbb{R}P^2 smoothly embedded in a 4-manifold X^4 with Euler number 2 or -2, the Price twist is a surgery operation on \nu(S) yielding (up to) three different 4-manifolds: X^4,\tau_S(X^4),\Sigma_S(X^4). This is of particular interest when X^4=S^4, as then \Sigma_S(X^4) is a homotopy 4-sphere which is not obviously diffeomorphic to S^4. In this paper, we show how to produce a trisection description of each Price twist on S\subset X^4 by producing a relative trisection of X^4\setminus\nu(S). Moreover, we show how to produce a trisection description of general surface complements in 4-manifolds.
