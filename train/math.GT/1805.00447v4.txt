According to the work of Laitinen, Morimoto, Oliver and Pawa\l{}owski, a finite group G has a smooth effective one fixed point action on some sphere if and only if G is an Oliver group. For some finite Oliver groups G of order up to 216, and for G=A_5\times C_n for n=3,5,7, we present a strategy of excluding of smooth effective one fixed point G-actions on low-dimensional spheres.
