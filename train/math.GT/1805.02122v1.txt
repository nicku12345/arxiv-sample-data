For links with vanishing pairwise linking numbers, the link components bound pairwise disjoint surfaces in B^{4}. In this paper, we describe the set of genera of such surfaces in terms of the h-function, which is a link invariant from Heegaard Floer homology. In particular, we use the h-function to give lower bounds for the 4-genus of the link. For L-space links, the h-function is explicitly determined by Alexander polynomials of the link and sublinks. We show some L-space links where the lower bounds are sharp, and also describe all possible genera of disjoint surfaces bounded by such links.
