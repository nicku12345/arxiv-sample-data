We extend the notion of link colorings with values in an Alexander quandle to link colorings with values in a module M over the Laurent polynomial ring \Lambda_{\mu}=\mathbb{Z}[t_1^{\pm1},\dots,t_{\mu}^{\pm1}]. If D is a diagram of a link L with \mu components, then the colorings of D with values in M form a \Lambda_{\mu}-module \mathrm{Color}_A(D,M). Extending a result of Inoue [Kodai Math.\ J.\ 33 (2010), 116-122], we show that \mathrm{Color}_A(D,M) is isomorphic to the module of \Lambda_{\mu}-linear maps from the Alexander module of L to M. In particular, suppose M is a field and \varphi:\Lambda_{\mu} \to M is a homomorphism of rings with unity. Then \varphi defines a \Lambda_{\mu}-module structure on M, which we denote M_\varphi. We show that the dimension of \mathrm{Color}_A(D,M_\varphi) as a vector space over M is determined by the images under \varphi of the elementary ideals of L. This result applies in the special case of Fox tricolorings, which correspond to M=GF(3) and \varphi(t_i) \equiv-1. Examples show that even in this special case, the higher Alexander polynomials do not suffice to determine |\mathrm{Color}_A(D,M_\varphi)|; this observation corrects erroneous statements of Inoue [J. Knot Theory Ramifications 10 (2001), 813-821; op. cit.].
