We generalize a result of the author about the classification of 1-connected 7-manifolds and demonstrate its use by two concrete applications, one to 2-connected 7-manifolds (a new proof -- and slightly different formulation -- of an up to now unpublished Theorem by Crowley and Nordstroem and one to simply connected 7-manifolds with the cohomology ring of S^2 \times S^5 \sharp S^3 \times S^4. The answer is in terms of generalized Kreck-Stolz invariants, which in the case of 2-connected 7-manifolds is equivalent to a quadratic refinement of the linking form and a generalized Eells-Kuiper invariant.
