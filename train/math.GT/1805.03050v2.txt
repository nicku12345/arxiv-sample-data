We introduce a multivariable Casson-Lin type invariant for links in S^3. This invariant is defined as a signed count of irreducible \operatorname{SU}(2) representations of the link group with fixed meridional traces. For 2-component links with linking number one, the invariant is shown to be a sum of multivariable signatures. We also obtain some results concerning deformations of \operatorname{SU}(2) representations of link groups.
