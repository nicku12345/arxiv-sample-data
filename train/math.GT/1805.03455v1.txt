It is known by the author that there exist 20 families of Dehn surgeries in the Poincar\'e homology sphere yielding lens spaces. In this paper, we give the concrete knot diagrams of the families and extend them to families of lens space surgeries in Brieskorn homology spheres. We illustrate families of lens space surgeries in \Sigma(2,3,6n\pm1) and \Sigma(2,2s+1,2(2s+1)n\pm1) and so on. As other examples, we give lens space surgeries in graph homology spheres, which are obtained by splicing two Brieskorn homology spheres.
