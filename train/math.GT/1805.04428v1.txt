Traditionally, knot theorists have considered projections of knots where there are two strands meeting at every crossing. A triple crossing is a crossing where three strands meet at a single point, such that each strand bisects the crossing. In this paper we find a relationship between the triple crossing number and the double crossing braid index, namely \beta_2(L) \le c_3(L) + 1. We find an infinite family of knots that achieve equality, which allows us to determine both the double crossing braid index and the triple crossing number of these knots.
