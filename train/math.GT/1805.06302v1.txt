Trivalent 2-stratifolds are a generalization of 2-manifolds in that there are disjoint simple closed curves where three sheets meet. We develop operations on their associated labeled graphs that will effectively construct from a single vertex all graphs that represent 1-connected 2-stratifolds. We describe an implementation on Python of these operations and other previous results.
