We consider 3-manifolds admitting the action of an involution such that its space of orbits is homeomorphic to S^3. Such involutions are called hyperelliptic as the manifolds admitting such an action. We consider finite groups acting on 3-manifolds and containing hyperelliptic involutions whose fixed-point set has r>2 components. In particular we prove that a simple group containing such an involution is isomorphic to PSL(2,q) for some odd prime power q, or to one of four other small simple groups.
