We investigate the problem of the realization of a given graph as the Reeb graph \mathcal{R}(f) of a smooth function f\colon M\rightarrow \mathbb{R} with finitely many critical points, where M is a closed manifold. We show that for any n\geq2 and any graph \Gamma admitting the so called good orientation there exist an n-manifold M and a Morse function f\colon M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}  such that its Reeb graph \mathcal{R}(f) is isomorphic to \Gamma, extending previous results of Sharko and Masumoto-Saeki. We prove that Reeb graphs of simple Morse functions maximize the number of cycles. Furthermore, we provide a complete characterization of graphs which can arise as Reeb graphs of surfaces.
