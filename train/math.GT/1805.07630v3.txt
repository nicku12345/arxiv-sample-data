In this note, residual finiteness of quandles is defined and investigated. It is proved that free quandles and knot quandles of tame knots are residually finite and Hopfian. Residual finiteness of quandles arising from residually finite groups (conjugation, core and Alexander quandles) is established. Further, residual finiteness of automorphism groups of some residually finite quandles is also discussed.
