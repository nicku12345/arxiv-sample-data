This paper proves a deformation circle pattern theorem, which gives a complete description of those circle patterns with interstices in terms of the combinatorial type, the exterior intersections angles and the conformal structures of interstices. As results, the surface version of Rivin's theorem and the approximation property of packable surfaces are obtained.
