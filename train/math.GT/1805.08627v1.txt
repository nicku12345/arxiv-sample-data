In~\cite{Kim} the author generalized the Conway algebra and constructed the invariant valued in the generalized Conway algebra defined by applying two skein relations to crossings, which is called a generalized Conway type invariant. The generalized Conway type invariant is a generalization of Homflypt polynomial.   In this paper we show that an example of links, which have the same value of Homflypt polynomial, but have different values of the generalized Conway type invariant. We study a properties of Conway type invariant related to Vassiliev invariant. In section 3 we discuss about further researches.
