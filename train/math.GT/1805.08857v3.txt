Motivated by M. Scharlemann and A. Thompson's definition of thin position of 3-manifolds, we define the width of a handle decomposition a 4-manifold and introduce the notion of thin position of a compact smooth 4-manifold. We determine all manifolds having width equal to \{1,\dots, 1\}, and give a relation between the width of M and its double M\cup_{id_\partial} \overline M. In particular, we describe how to obtain genus 2g+2 and g+2 trisection diagrams for sphere bundles over orientable and non-orientable surfaces of genus g, respectively. By last, we study the problem of describing relative handlebodies as cyclic covers of 4-space branched along knotted surfaces from the width perspective.
