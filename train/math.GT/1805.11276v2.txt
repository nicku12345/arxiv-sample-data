We define a trisection of a closed, orientable three dimensional manifold into three handlebodies, and a notion of stabilization for these trisections. Several examples of trisections are described in detail. We define the trisection genus t(M) of a 3-manifold, and relate it to the Heegaard genus g(M), showing that t(M) \le g(M) \le 2t(M). We show moreover that the bound g(M) \le 2t(M) is tight. We define stabilizations of trisections and show that all trisections of a 3-manifold are stably equivalent, providing an analogue of the Reidemeister-Singer theorem for trisections. We conclude by showing that there exist complicated trisections of S^3.
