Given a braid presentation D of a hyperbolic knot, Hikami and Inoue consider a system of polynomial equations arising from a sequence of cluster mutations determined by D. They show that any solution gives rise to shape parameters and thus determines a boundary-parabolic \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})-representation of the knot group. They conjecture the existence of a solution corresponding to the geometric representation. In this paper, we show that a boundary-parabolic representation \rho arises from a solution if and only if the length of D modulo 2 equals the obstruction to lifting \rho to a boundary-parabolic \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})-representation (as an element in \mathbb{Z}_2). In particular, the Hikami-Inoue conjecture holds if and only if the length of D is odd. This can always be achieved by adding a kink to the braid if necessary. We also explicitly construct the solution corresponding to a boundary-parabolic representation given in the Wirtinger presentation of the knot group.
