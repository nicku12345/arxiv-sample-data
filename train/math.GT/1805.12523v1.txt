In this paper, we characterize non-hyperbolic 3-component links in the 3-sphere whose exteriors contain essential 3-punctured spheres with non-integral boundary slopes. We also show the existence of embeddings of some multibranched surfaces in the 3-sphere which satisfy some homological conditions to be embedded in the 3-sphere.
