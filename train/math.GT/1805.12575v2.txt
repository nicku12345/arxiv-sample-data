Suppose X and Y are finite complexes, with Y simply connected. Gromov conjectured that the number of mapping classes in [X,Y] which can be realized by L-Lipschitz maps grows asymptotically as L^\alpha, where \alpha is an integer determined by the rational homotopy type of Y and the rational cohomology of X. This conjecture was disproved in a recent paper of the author and Weinberger; we gave an example where the `predicted' growth is L^8 but the true growth is L^8\log L. Here we show, via a different mechanism, that the universe of possible such growth functions is quite large. In particular, for every rational number r \geq 4, there is a pair X,Y for which the growth of [X,Y] is essentially L^r.
