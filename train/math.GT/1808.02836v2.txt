Previous work of the authors studies minimal triangulations of closed 3-manifolds using a characterisation of low degree edges, embedded layered solid torus subcomplexes and 1-dimensional \mathbb{Z}_2-cohomology. The underlying blueprint is now used in the study of minimal ideal triangulations. As an application, it is shown that the monodromy ideal triangulations of the hyperbolic once-punctured torus bundles are minimal.
