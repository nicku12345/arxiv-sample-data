The mapping class group \mathrm{Mod}_{g, 1} of a surface with one marked point can be identified with an index two subgroup of \mathrm{Aut}(\pi_1 \Sigma_g). For a surface of genus g \geq 2, we show that any action of \mathrm{Mod}_{g, 1} on the circle is either semi-conjugate to its natural action on the Gromov boundary of \pi_1 \Sigma_g, or factors through a finite cyclic group. For g \geq 3, all finite actions are trivial. This answers a question of Farb.
