We succeed to generalize spun knots of classical 1-knots to the virtual 1-knot case by using the `spinning construction'. That, is, we prove the following: Let Q be a spun knot of a virtual 1-knot K by our method. The embedding type Q in S^4 depends only on K. Furthermore we prove the following: The submanifolds, Q and the embedded torus made from K, defined by Satoh's method, in S^4 are isotopic.   We succeed to generalize the above construction to the virtual 2-knot case. Note that Satoh's method says nothing about the virtual 2-knot case. Rourke's interpretation of Satoh's method is that one puts `fiber-circles' on each point of each virtual 1-knot diagram. If there is no virtual branch point in a virtual 2-knot diagram, our way gives such fiber-circles to each point of the virtual 2-knot diagram. We prove the following: If a virtual 2-knot diagram \alpha has a virtual branch point, \alpha cannot be covered by such fiber-circles.   We obtain a new equivalence relation, the \mathcal E-equivalence relation of the set of virtual 2-knot diagrams, by using our spinning construction. We prove that there are virtual 2-knot diagrams that are virtually nonequivalent but are \mathcal E-equivalent.   Although Rourke claimed that two virtual 1-knot diagrams \alpha and \beta are fiberwise equivalent if and only if \alpha and \beta are welded equivalent, we state that this claim is wrong. We prove that two virtual 1-knot diagrams \alpha and \beta are fiberwise equivalent if and only if \alpha and \beta are rotational welded equivalent.
