We give sharp upper bounds on the injectivity radii of complete hyperbolic surfaces of finite area with some geodesic boundary components. The given bounds are over all such surfaces with any fixed topology; in particular, boundary lengths are not fixed. This extends the first author's result to the with-boundary setting. In the second part of the paper we comment on another direction for extending this result, via the systole of loops function.
