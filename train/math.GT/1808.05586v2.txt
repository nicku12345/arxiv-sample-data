Every pseudo-Anosov mapping class \varphi defines an associated veering triangulation \tau_\varphi of a punctured mapping torus. We show that generically, \tau_\varphi is not geometric. Here, the word "generic" can be taken either with respect to random walks in mapping class groups or with respect to counting geodesics in moduli space. Tools in the proof include Teichm\"uller theory, the Ending Lamination Theorem, study of the Thurston norm, and rigorous computation.
