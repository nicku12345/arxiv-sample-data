We show that the knot quandle of the 3-, 4-, or 5-twist-spun trefoil is isomorphic to a quandle related to the 16-, 24-, or 600-cell respectively. We further show that the cardinality of the knot quandle of the m-twist-spun trefoil is finite if and only if 1 \leq m \leq 5. This phenomenon is attributable to the fact that the regular tessellation \{ 3, m \}, in the sense of the Schl\"{a}fli symbol, consists of infinite triangles if m is greater than or equal to 6.
