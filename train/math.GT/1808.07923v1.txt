A \mathcal{Z}-structure on a group G was introduced by Bestvina in order to extend the notion of a group boundary beyond the realm of CAT(0) and hyperbolic groups. A refinement of this notion, introduced by Farrell and Lafont, includes a G-equivariance requirement, and is known as an \mathcal{EZ}-structure. The general questions of which groups admit \mathcal{Z}- or \mathcal{EZ}-structures remain open. In this paper we add to the current knowledge by showing that all Baumslag-Solitar groups admit \mathcal{EZ}-structures and all generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups admit \mathcal{Z}-structures.
