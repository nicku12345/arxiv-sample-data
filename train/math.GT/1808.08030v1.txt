Real Bott manifolds is a class of flat manifolds with holonomy group \mathbb Z_2^k of diagonal type. In this paper we want to show how we can compute even Stiefel - Whitney classes on real Bott manifolds. This paper is an answer to the question of professor Masuda if is it possible to extend A. G\k{a}sior "Spin-structures on real Bott manifolds" (J. Korean Math. Soc. {\bf 54}, (2017), no. 2, 507 - 516) and compute any Stiefel-Whitney classes for real Bott manifolds. It also extends results of A. G\k{a}sior, A. Szczepa\'nski "Flat manifolds with holonomy group Z_2^k of diagonal type" (Osaka J. Math. {\bf 51} (2014), 1015 - 1025).
