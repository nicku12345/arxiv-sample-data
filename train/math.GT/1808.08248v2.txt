In this paper, we will show that the projection \text{Homeo}^+(D^2_n)\to B_n does not have a section; i.e. the braid group B_n cannot be geometrically realized as a group of homeomorphisms of a disk fixing the boundary point-wise and n marked points in the interior as a set. We also give a new proof of a result of Markovic that the mapping class group of a closed surface cannot be geometrically realized as a group of homeomorphisms.
