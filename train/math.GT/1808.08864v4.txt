We show that any simply connected topological closed 4-manifold punctured along any compact, totally disconnected tame subset \Lambda admits a continuum of smoothings which are not diffeomorphic to any leaf of a C^{1,0} codimension one foliation on a compact manifold. This includes the remarkable case of S^4 punctured along a tame Cantor set. This is the lowest reasonable regularity for this realization problem. These results come from a new criterion for nonleaves in C^{1,0} regularity. We also include a new criterion for nonleaves in the C^2-category.   Some of our smooth nonleaves are "exotic", i.e., homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to leaves of codimension one foliations on a compact manifold.
