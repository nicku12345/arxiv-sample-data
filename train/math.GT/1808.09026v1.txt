Using bordered Floer theory, we construct an invariant \widehat{\mathit{HFO}}(Y^{\text{orb}}) for 3-orbifolds Y^{\text{orb}} with singular set a knot that generalizes the hat flavor \widehat{\mathit{HF}}(Y) of Heegaard Floer homology for closed 3-manifolds Y. We show that for a large class of 3-orbifolds, \widehat{\mathit{HFO}} behaves like \widehat{\mathit{HF}} in that \widehat{\mathit{HFO}}, together with a relative \mathbb{Z}_2-grading, categorifies the order of H_1^{\text{orb}}. When Y^{\text{orb}} arises as Dehn surgery on an integer-framed knot in S^3, we use the \{-1,0,1\}-valued knot invariant \varepsilon to determine the relationship between \widehat{\mathit{HFO}}(Y^{\text{orb}}) and \widehat{\mathit{HF}}(Y) of the 3-manifold Y underlying Y^{\text{orb}}.
