For each rational homology 3-sphere Y which bounds simply connected definite 4-manifolds of both signs, we construct an infinite family of irreducible rational homology 3-spheres which are homology cobordant to Y but cannot bound any simply connected definite 4-manifold. As a corollary, for any coprime integers p,q, we obtain an infinite family of irreducible rational homology 3-spheres which are homology cobordant to the lens space L(p,q) but cannot obtained by a knot surgery.
