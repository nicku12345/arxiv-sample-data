For an oriented link L \subset S^3 = \Bd\!D^4, let \chi_s(L) be the greatest Euler characteristic \chi(F) of an oriented 2-manifold F (without closed components) smoothly embedded in D^4 with boundary L. A knot K is {\it slice} if \chi_s(K)=1. Realize D^4 in \C^2 as \{(z,w):|z|^2+|w|^2\le1\}. It has been conjectured that, if V is a nonsingular complex plane curve transverse to S^3, then \chi_s(V\cap S^3)=\chi(V\cap D^4). Kronheimer and Mrowka have proved this conjecture in the case that V\cap D^4 is the Milnor fiber of a singularity. I explain how this seemingly special case implies both the general case and the ``slice-Bennequin inequality'' for braids. As applications, I show that various knots are not slice (e.g., pretzel knots like \Pscr(-3,5,7); all knots obtained from a positive trefoil O\{2,3\} by iterated untwisted positive doubling). As a sidelight, I give an optimal counterexample to the ``topologically locally-flat Thom conjecture''.
