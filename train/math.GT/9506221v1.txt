In 1985 lectures at MSRI, A. Casson introduced an interesting integer valued invariant for any oriented integral homology 3-sphere Y via beautiful constructions on representation spaces (see [1] for an exposition). The Casson invariant \lambda(Y) is roughly defined by measuring the oriented number of irreducible representations of the fundamental group \pi_1(Y) in SU(2). Such an invariant generalized the Rohlin invariant and gives surprising corollaries in low dimensional topology.
