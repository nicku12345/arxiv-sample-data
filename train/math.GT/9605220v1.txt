An end sum is a non-compact analogue of a connected sum. Suppose we are given two connected, oriented n-manifolds M_1 and M_2. Recall that to form their connected sum one chooses an n-ball in each M_i, removes its interior, and then glues together the two S^{n-1} boundary components thus created by an orientation reversing homeomorphism. Now suppose that M_1 and M_2 are also open, i.e. non-compact with empty boundary. To form an end sum of M_1 and M_2 one chooses a halfspace H_i (a manifold \homeo\ to {\bold R}^{n-1} \times [0, \infty)) embedded in M_i, removes its interior, and then glues together the two resulting {\bold R}^{n-1} boundary components by an orientation reversing homeomorphism. In order for this space M to be an n-manifold one requires that each H_i be {\bf end-proper} in M_i in the sense that its intersection with each compact subset of M_i is compact. Note that one can regard H_i as a regular neighborhood of an end-proper ray (a 1-manifold \homeo\ to [0,\infty)) \ga_i in M_i.
