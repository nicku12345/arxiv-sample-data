Given any connected, open 3-manifold U having finitely many ends, a non-compact 3-manifold M is constructed having the following properties: the interior of M is homeomorphic to U; the boundary of M is the disjoint union of finitely many planes; M is not almost compact; M is eventually end-irreducible; there are no proper, incompressible embeddings of S^1 \times \bold R in M; every compact subset of M is contained in a larger compact subset whose complement is anannular; there is a compact subset of M whose complement is \bold P^2-irreducible.   If U is irreducible it also has the following two properties: every proper, non-trivial plane in M is boundary-parallel; every proper surface in M each component of which has non-empty boundary and is non-compact and simply connected lies in a collar on \partial M.   This construction can be chosen so that M admits no homeomorphisms which take one boundary plane to another or reverse orientation. For the given U there are uncountably many non-homeomorphic such M.   Two auxiliary results may be of independent interest. First, general conditions are given under which infinitely many ``trivial'' compact components of the intersection of two proper, non-compact surfaces in an irreducible 3-manifold can be removed by an ambient isotopy. Second, n component tangles in a 3-ball are constructed such that every non-empty union of components of the tangle has hyperbolic exterior.
