This paper introduces a rigorous computer-assisted procedure for analyzing hyperbolic 3-manifolds. This technique is used to complete the proof of several long-standing rigidity conjectures in 3-manifold theory as well as to provide a new lower bound for the volume of a closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold.   We prove the following result:   \it\noindent Let N be a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. Then \begin{enumerate} \item[(1)] If f\colon M \to N is a homotopy equivalence where M is a closed irreducible 3-manifold, then f is homotopic to a homeomorphism. \item[(2)] If f,g\colon M\to N are homotopic homeomorphisms, then f is isotopic to g. \item[(3)] The space of hyperbolic metrics on N is path connected. \end{enumerate}
