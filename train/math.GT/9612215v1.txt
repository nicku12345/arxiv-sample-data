An irreducible open 3-manifold W is {\bf R}^2-irreducible if every proper plane in W splits off a halfspace. In this paper it is shown that if such a W is the universal cover of a connected, {\bf P}^2-irreducible open 3-manifold M with finitely generated fundamental group, then either W is homeomorphic to {\bf R}^3 or the group is a free product of infinite cyclic groups and infinite closed surface groups. Given any such finitely generated group uncountably many M are constructed with that fundamental group such that their universal covers are {\bf R}^2-irreducible, are not homeomorphic to {\bf R}^3, and are pairwise non-homeomorphic. These results are related to the conjecture that closed, orientable, irreducible, aspherical 3-manifolds are covered by {\bf R}^3.
