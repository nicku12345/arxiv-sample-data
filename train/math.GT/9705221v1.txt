Suppose M is a hyperbolic 3-manifold which admits two Dehn fillings M(r_1) and M(r_2) such that M(r_1) contains an essential torus and M(r_2) contains an essential annulus. It is known that \Delta = \Delta(r_1, r_2) \leq 5. We will show that if \Delta = 5 then M is the Whitehead sister link exterior, and if \Delta = 4 then M is the exterior of either the Whitehead link or the 2-bridge link associated to the rational number 3/10. There are infinitely many examples with \Delta = 3.
