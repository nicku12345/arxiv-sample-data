The main theorem shows that if M is an irreducible compact connected orientable 3-manifold with non-empty boundary, then the classifying space BDiff(M rel dM) of the space of diffeomorphisms of M which restrict to the identity map on boundary(M) has the homotopy type of a finite aspherical CW-complex. This answers, for this class of manifolds, a question posed by M Kontsevich. The main theorem follows from a more precise result, which asserts that for these manifolds the mapping class group H(M rel dM) is built up as a sequence of extensions of free abelian groups and subgroups of finite index in relative mapping class groups of compact connected surfaces.
