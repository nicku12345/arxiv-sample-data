The rho-invariant is an invariant of odd-dimensional manifolds with finite fundamental group, and lies in the representations modulo the regular representations (after tensoring with Q). It is a fundamental invariant that occurs in classifying lens spaces, their homotopy analogues, and is intimately related to the eta-invariant for the signature operator. The goal of this note is to use some of the technology developed in studying the Novikov higher signature conjecture to define an analogous invariant for certain situations with infinite fundamental group.
