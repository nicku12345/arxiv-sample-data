This is the first in a series of papers showing that Haken manifolds have hyperbolic structures; this first was published, the second two have existed only in preprint form, and later preprints were never completed. This eprint is only an approximation to the published version, which is the definitive form for part I, and is provided for convenience only. All references and quotations should be taken from the published version, since the theorem numbering is different and not all corrections have been incorporated into the present version.   Parts II and III will be made available as eprints shortly.
