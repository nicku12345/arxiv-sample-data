Let M be a simple 3-manifold with a toral boundary component partial_0 M. If Dehn filling M along partial_0 M one way produces a toroidal manifold and Dehn filling M along partial_0 M another way produces a boundary-reducible manifold, then we show that the absolute value of the intersection number on partial_0 M of the two filling slopes is at most two. In the special case that the boundary-reducing filling is actually a solid torus and the intersection number between the filling slopes is two, more is said to describe the toroidal filling.
