We develop a method of calculation for the symplectic Floer homology of composite knots. The symplectic Floer homology of knots defined in \cite{li} naturally admits an integer graded lifting, and it formulates a filtration and induced spectral sequence. Such a spectral sequence converges to the symplectic homology of knots in \cite{li}. We show that there is another spectral sequence which converges to the \Z-graded symplectic Floer homology for composite knots represented by braids.
