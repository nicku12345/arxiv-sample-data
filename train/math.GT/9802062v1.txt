This note is a sequel to our earlier paper of the same title [dg-ga/9710001] and describes invariants of rational homology 3-spheres associated to acyclic orthogonal local systems. Our work is in the spirit of the Axelrod-Singer papers, generalizes some of their results, and furnishes a new setting for the purely topological implications of their work.
