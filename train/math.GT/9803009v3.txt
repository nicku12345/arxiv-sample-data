Non-isotopic Heegaard splittings of non-minimal genus were known previously only for very special 3-manifolds. We show in this paper that they are in fact a wide spread phenomenon in 3-manifold theory: We exhibit a large class of knots and manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery on these knots which admit such splittings. Many of the manifolds have irreducible Heegaard splittings of arbitrary large genus. All these splittings are horizontal and are isotopic, after one stabilization, to a multiple stabilization of certain canonical low genus vertical Heegaard splittings.
