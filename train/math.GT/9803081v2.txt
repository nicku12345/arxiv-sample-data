Starting from a divide, i.e. a generic immersion of finitely many copies of the interval [0,1] in the disk, we construct a classical link in the 3-sphere. We prove that the link's complement fibers over the circle, if the divide is connected. Moreover, we compute the monodromy diffeomorphism from the combinatorics of the divide. We added to this version of the paper the theorem about the gordian number of the link of a divide. The gordian number of the link of a divide equals the number of double points of the divide.
