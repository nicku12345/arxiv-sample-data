This is a review article on the Bennequin-Birman-Menasco machinery for studying embedded incompressible surfaces in 3-space via their `braid foliations'. Two cases are investigated: case (1) The surface has non-empty boundary; the boundary is a knot or link which is represented as a closed braid, Case (2) The surface is closed, but it lies in the complement of a knot or link which is represented as a closed braid. The main results in the area are established with full proofs, in a systematic fashion, with an eye toward making them accessible to the beginning reader. There are some new contributions, described in detail in the introduction.
