Let \Sigma be a hyperbolic link with m components in a 3-dimensional manifold X. In this paper, we will show that the moduli space of marked hyperbolic cone structures on the pair (X, \Sigma) with all cone angle less than 2\pi /3 is an m-dimensional open cube, parameterized naturally by the m cone angles. As a corollary, we will give a proof of a special case of Thurston's geometrization theorem for orbifolds.
