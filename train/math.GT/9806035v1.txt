The Gassner representation of the pure braid group to GL_n(Z[Z^n]) can be extended to give a representation of the concordance group of n-strand string links to GL_n(F), where F is the field of quotients of \zz[\zz^n],  F = Q(t_1,...,t_n); this was first observed by Le Dimet. Here we present simple new perspectives on its definition, its computation, and its applications to obtain both general results and interesting family of examples.
