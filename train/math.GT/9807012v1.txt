There is a positive constant c_1 such that for any diagram D representing the unknot, there is a sequence of at most 2^{c_1 n} Reidemeister moves that will convert it to a trivial knot diagram, n is the number of crossings in D. A similar result holds for elementary moves on a polygonal knot K embedded in the 1-skeleton of the interior of a compact, orientable, triangulated PL 3-manifold M. There is a positive constant c_2 such that for each t \geq 1, if M consists of t tetrahedra, and K is unknotted, then there is a sequence of at most 2^{c_2 t} elementary moves in M which transforms K to a triangle contained inside one tetrahedron of M. We obtain explicit values for c_1 and c_2.
