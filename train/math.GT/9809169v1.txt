We introduce and analyze the characteristic foliation induced by a contact structure on a branched surface, in particular a branched standard spine of a 3-manifold. We extend to (fairly general) singular foliations of branched surfaces the local existence and uniqueness results which hold for genuine surfaces. Moreover we show that global uniqueness holds when restricting to tight structures. We establish branched versions of the elimination lemma. We prove a smooth version of the Gillman-Rolfsen PL-embedding theorem, deducing that branched spines can be used to construct contact structures in a given homotopy class of plane fields.
