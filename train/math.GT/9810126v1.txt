A manifold M is simple if it contains no essential disk, sphere, annulus or torus. If M is simple and two Dehn fillings M(r_1), M(r_2) are nonsimple, then there is an upper bound on \Delta(r_1,r_2), the geometric intersection number between r_1 and r_2. There are 10 possibilities, depending on the types of M(r_i). In this paper it will be shown that if M(r_1) contains an essential disk and M(r_2) contains an essential annulus, then \Delta(r_1,r_2) is at most two. This completes the determination of the best possible upper bounds on \Delta(r_1, r_2) for all ten cases.
