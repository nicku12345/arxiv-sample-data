We give a brief overview of the current state of the study of the deformation theory of Kleinian groups. The topics covered include the definition of the deformation space of a Kleinian group and of several important subspaces; a discussion of the parametrization by topological data of the components of the closure of the deformation space; the relationship between algebraic and geometric limits of sequences of Kleinian groups; and the behavior of several geometrically and analytically interesting functions on the deformation space.
