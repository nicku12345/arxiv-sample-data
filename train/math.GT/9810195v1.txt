We examine the dependence of the deformation obtained by bending quasi-Fuchsian structures on the bending lamination. We show that when we consider bending quasi-Fuchsian structures on a closed surface, the conditions obtained by Epstein and Marden to relate weak convergence of arbitrary laminations to the convergence of bending cocycles are not necessary. Bending may not be continuous on the set of all measured laminations. However we show that if we restrict our attention to laminations with non negative real and imaginary parts then the deformation depends continuously on the lamination.
