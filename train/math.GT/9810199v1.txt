We consider complex Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates on the quasi-Fuchsian space of punctured tori. These coordinates arise from a generalisation of Kra's plumbing construction and are related to earthquakes on Teichmueller space. They also allow us to interpolate between two coordinate systems on Teichmueller space, namely the classical Fuchsian space with Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates and the Maskit embedding. We also show how they relate to the pleating coordinates of Keen and Series.
