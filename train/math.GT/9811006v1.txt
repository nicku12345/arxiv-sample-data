We define cylinder knots as billiard knots in a cylinder. We present a necessary condition for cylinder knots: after dividing cylinder knots by possible rotational symmetries we obtain ribbon knots. We obtain an upper bound for the number of cylinder knots with two fixed parameters (out of three). In addition we prove that rosette knots are cylinder knots.
