Let K be a hyperbolic knot in the 3-sphere. If r-surgery on K yields a lens space, then we show that the order of the fundamental group of the lens space is at most 12g-7, where g is the genus of K. If we specialize to genus one case, it will be proved that no lens space can be obtained from genus one, hyperbolic knots by Dehn surgery. Therefore, together with known facts, we have that a genus one knot K admits Dehn surgery yielding a lens space if and only if K is the trefoil.
