The topology of the orbit space, Y, for the action of the complex conjugation on a complex surface, X, defined over reals, is studied. I give a criterion for blow-up stable triviality of Y (which implies vanishing of its Seiberg-Witten invariants). The main result concerns the double planes branched along the complexification of reducible real curves with 2 non-singular components. In connection with it, I analize the real singularities of X which become smooth in Y (after taking quotient).
