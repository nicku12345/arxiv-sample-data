We show that there exist infinitely many commensurability classes of finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds whose fundamental group contains a subgroup which is locally free but not free. The main technical tool is the fact that a collection of hyperbolic 3-manifolds of bounded volume contains infinitely many commensurability classes. The result then by an application of Thurston's hyperbolization theorem for Haken 3-manifolds.
