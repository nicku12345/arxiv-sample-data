First order invariants of generic immersions of manifolds of dimension nm-1 into manifolds of dimension n(m+1)-1, m,n>1 are constructed using the geometry of self-intersections. The range of one of these invariants is related to Bernoulli numbers.   As by-products some geometrically defined invariants of regular homotopy are found.
