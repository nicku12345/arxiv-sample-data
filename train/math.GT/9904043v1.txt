Let L be an oriented link with an alternating diagram D. It is known that L is a fibered link if and only if the surface R obtained by applying Seifert's algorithm to D is a Hopf plumbing. Here, we call R a Hopf plumbing if R is obtained by successively plumbing finite number of Hopf bands to a disk.   In this paper, we discuss its extension so that we show the following theorem. Let R be a Seifert surface obtained by applying Seifert's algorithm to an almost alternating diagrams. Then R is a fiber surface if and only if R is a Hopf plumbing.   We also show that the above theorem can not be extended to 2-almost alternating diagrams, that is, we give examples of 2-almost alternating diagrams for knots whose Seifert surface obtained by Seifert's algorithm are fiber surfaces that are not Hopf plumbing. This is shown by using a criterion of Melvin-Morton.
