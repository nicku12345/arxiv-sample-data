We will develop various methods, some are of geometric nature and some are of algebraic nature, to detect the various achiralities of knots and links in S^3. For example, we show that the twisted Whitehead double of a knot is achiral if and only if the double is the unknot or the figure eight knot, and we show that all non-trivial links with \leq9 crossings are not achiral except the Borromean rings. A simple procedure for calculating the \eta-function is given in terms of a crossing change formula and its initial values.
