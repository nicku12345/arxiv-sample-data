State-sum invariants for knotted curves and surfaces using quandle cohomology were introduced by Laurel Langford and the authors in math.GT/9903135 In this paper we present methods to compute the invariants and sample computations. Computer calculations of cohomological dimensions for some quandles are presented. For classical knots, Burau representations together with Maple programs are used to evaluate the invariants for knot table. For knotted surfaces in 4-space, movie methods and surface braid theory are used. Relations between the invariants and symmetries of knots are discussed.
