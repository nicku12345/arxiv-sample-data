As it is well-known, all Vassiliev invariants of degree one of a knot K\subset R^3 are trivial. There are nontrivial Vassiliev invariants of degree one, when the ambient space is not R^3. Recently, T. Fiedler introduced such invariants of a knot in an R^1-fibration over a surface F. They take values in the free Z-module generated by all the free homotopy classes of loops in F. Here, we generalize them to the most refined Vassiliev invariant of degree one. The ranges of values of all these invariants are explicitly described.   We also construct a similar invariant of a two-component link in an \R^1-fibration. It generalizes the linking number.
