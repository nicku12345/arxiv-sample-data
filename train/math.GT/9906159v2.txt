Recall that a pseudofree group action on a space is one whose singular set consists only of isolated points. In this paper, we classify all of the finite groups which admit pseudofree actions on S^2 x S^2. The groups turn out to be exactly the expected ones: those which admit orthogonal pseudofree actions on S^2 x S^2 as a subset of R^3 x R^3. They are explicitly listed.   This paper can be viewed as a companion to a paper of Edmonds, math.GT/9809055.
