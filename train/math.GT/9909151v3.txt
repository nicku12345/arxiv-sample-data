This paper is part expository and part presentation of calculational results. The target space of the Kontsevich integral for knots is a space of diagrams; this space has various algebraic structures which are described here. These are utilized with Le's theorem on the behaviour of the Kontsevich integral under cabling and with the Melvin-Morton Theorem, to obtain, in the Kontsevich integral for torus knots, both an explicit expression up to degree five and the general coefficients of the wheel diagrams.
