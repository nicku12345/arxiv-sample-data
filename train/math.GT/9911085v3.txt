We show that the SL(2,C)-character variety of the (-2,3,n) pretzel knot consists of two (respectively three) algebraic curves when 3 does not divide n (respectively 3 divides n) and give an explicit calculation of the Culler-Shalen seminorms of these curves. Using this calculation, we describe the fundamental polygon and Newton polygon for these knots and give a list of Dehn surgeries yielding a manifold with finite or cyclic fundamental group. This constitutes a new proof of property P for these knots.
