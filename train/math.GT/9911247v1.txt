This paper concerns the Dehn surgery construction, especially those Dehn surgeries leaving the manifold unchanged. In particular, we describe an oriented 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold X with a pair of slopes r_1, r_2 such that the Dehn filled manifolds X(r_1), X(r_2) are oppositely oriented copies of the lens space L(49,18), and there is no homeomorphism h of X such that h(r_1)=h(r_2).
