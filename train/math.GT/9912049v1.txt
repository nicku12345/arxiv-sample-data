Let F be a proper essential immersed surface in a hyperbolic 3-manifold M with boundary disjoint from a torus boundary component T of M. Let \alpha be the set of coannular slopes of F on T. The main theorem of the paper shows that there is a constant K and a finite set of slopes \Lambda on T, such that if \beta is a slope on T with \Delta(\beta, \alpha_i) > K for all \alpha_i in \alpha, and \beta is not in \Lambda, then F remains incompressible after Dehn filling on T along the slope \beta. In certain sense, this means that F survives most Dehn fillings. The proof uses minimal surface theory, integral of differential forms, and properties of geometrically finite groups. As a consequence of our method, it will also be shown that Freedman tubings of immersed geometrically finite surfaces are essential if the tubes are long enough.
