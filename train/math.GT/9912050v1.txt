Steinhaus conjectured that every closed oriented C^1-curve has a pair of anti-parallel tangents. Porter disproved the conjecture by showing that there exist curves with no anti-parallel tangents. Colin Adams rised the question of whether there exists a nontrivial knot in \R^3 which has no parallel or antiparallel tangents. The main result of this paper solves this problem, showing that any (smooth or polygonal) link L in \R^3 is isotopic to a smooth link \hat L which has no parallel or antiparallel tangents.
