This is a review of the 5-volumes of Ramanujan's Notebooks, as worked over by Bruce C. Berndt over the last quarter of the XX-th Century. To illustrate how useful Ramanujan's insights could be for anyone who indulges in the wild pleasure of savoring Ramanujan's genius, the reviewer takes one formula of Ramanujan from the Notebooks, analyses it carefully, and arrives at the beginnings of what could be fairly called "Quantum Number Theory."
