The "quantum-event / prime ideal in a category/ noncommutative-point" alternative to "classical-event / commutative prime ideal/ point" is suggested.   Ideals in additive categories, prime spectra and representation of quivers are considered as mathematical tools appropriate to model quantum mechanics. The space-time framework is to be reconstructed from the spectrum of the path category of a quiver.   The interference experiment is considered as an example.
