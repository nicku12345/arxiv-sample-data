This paper surveys, in the first place, some basic facts from the classification theory of normal complex singularities, including details for the low dimensions 2 and 3. Next, it describes how the toric singularities are located within the class of rational singularities, and recalls their main properties. Finally, it focuses, in particular, on a toric version of Reid's desingularization strategy in dimension three
