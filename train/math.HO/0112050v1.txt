This paper presents a graded hierarchy or chain of binary operations on the reals and the complex numbers. The operations are related distributively in the sense that any one of them distributes over the next lower operation in the chain. For one particular operation we explore specific properties and derive results, including several useful formulas and identities. Next, the operation is extended to the complex numbers and a new kind of derivative is defined based on this binary operation. Some basic formulae analogous to standard classical ones are proven for this new derivative. Finally, the derivative is generalized to the point that the new derivative, the classical one, and countably many others are seen to be special cases.
