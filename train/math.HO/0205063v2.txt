We will try to sketch Professor F. Y. Wu's contributions in lattice statistical mechanics, solid state physics, graph theory, enumerative combinatorics and so many other domains of physics and mathematics. We will recall F. Y. Wu's most important and well-known classic results and we will also sketch his most recent researches dedicated to the connections of lattice statistical mechanical models with deep problems in pure mathematics. Since it is hard to provide an exhaustive list of all his contributions, to give some representation of F. Y. Wu's "mental connectivity" we will concentrate on the interrelations between the various results he has obtained in so many different domains of physics and mathematics. Along the way we will also try to understand Wu's motivations and his favorite concepts, tools and ideas.
