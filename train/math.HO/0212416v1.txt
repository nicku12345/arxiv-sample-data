The paper opens with an overview of the discussion of international comparisons (including goals) in mathematics education. Afterwards, the two most important recent international studies, the PISA Study and TIMSS-Repeat, are described. After a short description of the qualitative-quantitative debate, a qualitatively oriented small-scale study is described. The paper closes with reflection on the possibilities and limitations of such studies.
