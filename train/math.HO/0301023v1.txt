In this note we point out links between the Shimura - Taniyama conjecture and certain ideas in physics. Since all the seminal references are by strange coincidence Japanese we wish to call this the Japanese approach. The note elaborates on some inspired comments made by Barry Mazur in his popular article "Number theory as gadfly."
