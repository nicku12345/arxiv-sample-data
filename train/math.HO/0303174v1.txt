In this paper two conjectures are proposed based on which we can prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem(FLT) for all primes p \equiv -1 (\bmod~6). With Pollaczek's result {\bf [1]} and the conjectures the first case of FLT can be proved for all primes greater than 3. With a computer Conjecture1 was verified to be true for primes \leq 2437 and Conjecture2 for primes \leq 100003.
