A small and unsystematic selection of my favorite appearances of mathematicians and mathematics in German literature. It includes classic and romantic (Lessing, Goethe, Wezel, F. Schlegel, Kleist, Novalis, Grillparzer, Heine), modern (Wedekind, Doeblin, Morgenstern, Musil, Brecht, Eich), as well as post-modern authors (Hans-Magnus Enzensberger, Volker Braun, Botho Strauss).
