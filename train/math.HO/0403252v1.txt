I wrote this book in a "do-it-yourself" style so that I give only a draft of tensor theory, which includes formulating definitions and theorems and giving basic ideas and formulas. All other work such as proving consistence of definitions, deriving formulas, proving theorems or completing details to proofs is left to the reader in the form of numerous exercises. I hope that this style makes learning the subject really quick and more effective for understanding and memorizing.
