We use the Maple system to check the investigations of S. S. Gupta regarding the Smarandache consecutive and the reversed Smarandache sequences of triangular numbers [Smarandache Notions Journal, Vol. 14, 2004, pp. 366-368]. Furthermore, we extend previous investigations to the mirror and symmetric Smarandache sequences of triangular numbers.
