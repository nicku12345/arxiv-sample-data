In this survey paper, I first review the history of Bernoulli numbers, then examine the modern definition of Bernoulli numbers and the appearance of Bernoulli numbers in expansion of functions. I revisit some properties of Bernoulli numbers and the history of the computation of big Bernoulli numbers.
