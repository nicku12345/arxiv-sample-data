Translation from the Latin original "Utrum hic numerus 1000009 sit primus necne inquiritur" (1778). E699 in the Enestrom index. The idea of this paper is that if some number is a sum of two squares in two ways, then some other smaller number must be a square. We then check all the cases. If we find a case where this smaller number is a square then we can use this to find a factor of the original number, which is therefore composite. If we check all the cases and none of them are squares then the original number can be written as a sum of two squares in only one way, and hence is prime. Euler first examines the number 1000009 and then 1000081. Obviously 1000009=1000^2+3^2, and then he finds that 1000009=972^2+235^2, hence it is not prime. On the other hand, Euler finds that 1000081 can be written as a sum of squares in only one way, hence it is prime.
