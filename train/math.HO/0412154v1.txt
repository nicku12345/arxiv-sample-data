This is a translation into English from the original Latin of Leonhard Euler's Exercitatio analytica, Nova Acta Academiae Scientarum Imperialis Petropolitinae 8 (1794), 69-72; E664 in the Enestrom index. In it Euler uses the infinite product identity for sin to prove some properties of the series for the Riemann zeta function for even n.
