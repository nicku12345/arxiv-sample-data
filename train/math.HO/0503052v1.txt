This is an English translation from the Latin original of Leonhard Euler's ``Solutio facilior problematis Diophantei circa triangulum, in quo rectae ex angulis latera opposita bisecantes rationaliter exprimantur''. In this paper, Euler proves that there exist triangles with integer length sides such that the length of the bisectors of the sides to the opposite angles are integer valued, and he gives a general method for making a certain class of such triangles.
