In this paper, Euler gives the general trionomial coefficient as a sum of the binomial coefficients, the general quadrinomial coefficient as a sum of the binomial and trinomial coefficients, the general quintonomial coefficient as a sum of the binomial and quadrinomial coefficients, and gives a general determination of the coefficients of the expansion of any polynomial (1+x+x^2+...+x^m)^n as a sum of the coefficients of lower degree polynomial coefficients.
