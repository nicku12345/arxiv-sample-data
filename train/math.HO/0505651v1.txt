We describe the links between group theory and psychology, in particular through the works of Piaget. We show that groups appear universally in his description of children's intelligence, and that the notion of groupoid, which was little considered in psychology, may be fundamental. We study in particular the applicability of group theory concepts to the development of educative games.
