We give a brief review of a research made in the field of differential geometry in Estonia in the period from the beginning of the 19th century to the present time. The biographic data of mathematicians who made a valuable contribution to the development of differential geometry in Estonia in mentioned period are presented. The material presented in the introduction covers the period from the beginning of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century and it can be considered as a brief historical sketch of the development of differential geometry in Estonia in this period. The next sections give an idea of the modern trends of development of differential geometry in Estonia.
