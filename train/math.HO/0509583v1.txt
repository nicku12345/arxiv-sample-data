We briefly review a few aspects of the development of differential geometry which may be considered as being influenced by Einstein's general relativity. We focus on how Einstein's quest for a complete geometrization of matter and electromagnetism gave rise to an enormous amount of theoretical work both on physics and mathematics. In connection with this we also bring to light how recent investigation on theoretical physics has led to new results on some branches of modern differential geometry.
