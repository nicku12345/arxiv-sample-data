In 1966, Alan Sutcliffe published an introductory paper on "numbers which are multiplied when their digits are reversed". Two years later T. J. Kaczynski extended Sutcliffe's work to show that there exists a 3 digit number in base n with this property if and only if there exists a 2 digit base n number with this property. This paper attempts to generalize Kaczynski's proof to the case of 4 and 5 digit integers and explores some unexpected consequences of this generalization.
