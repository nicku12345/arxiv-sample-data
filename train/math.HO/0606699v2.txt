Through the pagination of an Arabian Algerian manuscript of the beginning of the 19th century, we rediscover the original shape, the "Ghubari" shape, of the numerals. Contrary to some assumptions, particularly those which claim that they are derived from Indian characters, this "Ghubari" shape, whose use has completely disappeared, shows that the ten modern numerals derive from ten Arabic letters. The symbol of a "Ghubari" numeral corresponds to the Arabic letter whose "Abjadi" numerical value is equal to this numeral. The assumption of the Indian origin of the numerals is denied by the shape of the numerals and by the right left sociological logic of the representation of the numerals and the algorithms of the basic operations. The numerals are born in Maghreb or in Spain. In Europe, the "Ghubari" numerals became the modern numerals: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and in the Middle East, borrowing two Hebrew letters, they gave the "Mashriki" numerals: &#1776; &#1777; &#1778; &#1779; &#1641; &#1640; &#1639; &#1638; &#1637; &#1636; .
