We review the life and scientific work of F.V Atkinson, mathematician. The article consists of a brief overview of his academic and professional life followed by an extensive compilation of his life's work, some unpublished. He is best remembered for his contributions to Number Theory (mean value theorems for the Riemann zeta function on the critical line), his work in operator theory (index theorems for abstract Fredholm operators), and his seminal work in many areas of differential equations (multiparameter spectral theory, Sturm-Liouville theory, asymptotics etc.)
