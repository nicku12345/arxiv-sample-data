WE trace the beginning of symbolic dynamics--the study of the shift dynamical system--as it arose from the use of coding to study recurrence and transitivity properties of geodesics. The normal citations for the first appearance of symbolic dynamics, Hadamard's 1898 paper and the 1938 and 1940 papers of Morse and Hedlund, don't truly represent the abstract point of view associated with the subject today. Based in part on the evidence of a 1941 letter from Hedlund to Morse, we place the beginning of symbolic dynamics in a 1944 paper by Hedlund.
