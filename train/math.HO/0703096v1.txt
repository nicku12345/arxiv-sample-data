We present in this chapter (Chapter II) the history of ideas which lead up to the development of modern knot theory. We are more detailed when pre-XX century history is reported. With more recent times we are more selective, stressing developments related to Jones type invariants of links. In the Appendix, A.Przybyszewska translation of Preface to P.Heegaard Dissertation (1898) is given.
