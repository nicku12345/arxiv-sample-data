Translation from the Latin of "Annotationes in locum quendam Cartesii ad circuli quadraturam spectantem" (1763).   The passage Euler is referring to is the "Excerpta" in part 6, p. 6 of Descartes' 1701 "Opuscula posthuma".   Before reading this paper I had not heard of the "quadratrix" before, and I recommend learning a bit about it before reading this. I found Thomas Heath, "A history of Greek mathematics", vol. I, chapter VII to be helpful, in particular pp. 226-230. The quadratrix is a "mechanical curve" that can be used to rectify the circle. The usual problem of squaring the circle is to construct a square with the same area (or perimeter) as a given circle, in a finite number of steps using compass and straightedge. Descartes worked in the reverse direction: from a given square he constructed the radius of a circle with the same perimeter, but in an infinite number of steps.   In this paper Euler reconstructs Descartes' argument and develops some consequences of it. Euler finds that \[ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} \tan \frac{1}{2^n}\phi = \frac{1}{\phi} - 2\cot 2\phi. \] Integrating this yields \[ \prod_{n=1}^\infty \sec \frac{1}{2^n} \phi = \frac{2\phi}{\sin 2\phi}. \]   I'd like to thank Davide Crippa from the University of Paris 7 for some helpful back and forth about this paper.   One of the only citations to this paper that I have found is in Pietro Ferroni, De calculo integralium exercitatio mathematica, Allegrini, Florence, 1792, pp. xxi--xxiii.
