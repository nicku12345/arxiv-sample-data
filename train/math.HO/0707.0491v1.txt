I want to write about what I know and remember about the activities of Leonid Vital'evich Kantorovich, an outstanding scientist of the 20th century; about his dramatic struggle for recognition of his mathematical economic theories; about the initial stage of the history of linear programming; about beautuful Kantorovich metric, about the creation of a new area of mathematical activity related to economic applications, which is called sometimes operation research, sometimes mathematical economics, sometimes linear and convex programming, or economic cybernetics, etc.; about its place in the modern mathematical landscape; and, finally, about several personal impressions of this distinguished scientist. The notes in no way pretend to exhaust these topics.
