Let X be a topological space. The homology of the iterated loop space H_*\Omega^n X is an algebra over the homology of the framed n-disks operad H_*f\mathcal{D}_n \cite{Getzler:BVAlg,Salvatore-Wahl:FrameddoBVa}. We determine completely this H_*f\mathcal{D}_n-algebra structure on   H_*(\Omega^n X;\mathbb{Q}). We show that the action of H_*(SO(n)) on the iterated loop space H_*\Omega^n X is related to the J-homomorphism and that the BV-operator vanishes on spherical classes only in characteristic other than 2.
