The origin of the numerals that we inherited from the arabo-Islamic civilization remained one enigma. The hypothesis of the Indian origin remained, with controversies, without serious rival. It was the dominant hypothesis since more of one century. Its partisans found to it and constructed a lot of arguments. The testimonies of the medieval authors have been interpreted to its advantage. The opposite opinions have been dismissed and ignored. An amalgam between the history of our modern numerals and the Indian mathematics history is made. Rational contradictions often passed under silence. A meticulous observation of the numerals permits to affirm that our numerals are in fact more or less modified Arabic letters. The "Ghubari" shape of the numerals shows that the symbol of a numeral corresponds to the Arabic letter whose numerical value is equal to this numeral. The numerals don't have a simple resemblance with some Arabic letters, but every number looks like the Arabic letter whose numerical value is equal to this numeral. The elements of the ''Abjadi'' calculation gives us a theoretical support, independent of the letters and numerals, witch explains our observation. Besides a re-lecture of the testimonies of the medieval authors, particularly the testimony of Al-Biruni, that is probably at the origin of all others testimonies speaking of the Indian origin of the numerals, is in agreement with the fact that our numerals are Arabic letters. We have there a second way concerning the origin of our modern numerals that is only to its beginnings. The deepened researches are necessary to understand the history of our numerals better. A rigorous re-lecture of the medieval testimonies with a new mind imposes itself.
