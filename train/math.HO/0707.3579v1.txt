The partisans of the hypothesis of the Indian origin of the numerals create confusion between the history of the Indian mathematics and the history of our modern numerals. To argue the thesis of the Indian origin of the numbers they confound between: the "intuitive zero " of Brahmagupta, that means ''nothing'' and which is the difference of two equal numbers, the "numeral zero" used in the representation of the numbers and the "mathematical zero" defined by the modern mathematicians. "Sifr" designate the "numeral zero" and "Shunya" designate the "intuitive zero". The word "Sifr" is not a traduction of the word "Shunya" and does not derive from the Indian word "Shunya", since the word "Sifr" and its derivatives existed in Arabic long before the appearance of zero itself The facts that the "intuitive zero" and the "mathematical zero" are represented currently by the "numerals zero" symbol "0" are only consequences of the representation of the numbers by the "Ghubari" numerals
