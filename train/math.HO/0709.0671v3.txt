This is an expanded version of our earlier paper. Let the nth partial sum of the Taylor series e = \sum_{r=0}^{\infty} 1/r! be A_n/n!, and let p_k/q_k be the kth convergent of the simple continued fraction for e. Using a recent measure of irrationality for e, we prove weak versions of our conjecture that only two of the partial sums are convergents to e. A related result about the denominators q_k and powers of factorials is proved. We also show a surprising connection between the A_n and the primes 2, 5, 13, 37, 463. In the Appendix, we give a conditional proof of the conjecture, assuming a second conjecture we make about the zeros of A_n and q_k modulo powers of 2. Tables supporting this Zeros Conjecture are presented and we discuss a 2-adic reformulation of it.
