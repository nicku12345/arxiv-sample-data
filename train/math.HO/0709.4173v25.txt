In this paper we present a simple method for deriving an alternative form of the functional equation for Riemann's Zeta function. The connections between some functional equations obtained implicitly by Leonhard Euler in his work "Remarques sur un beau rapport entre les series des puissances tant directes que reciproques" in Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences de Berlin 17, (1768), permit to define a special function, named A(s), which is fully symmetric and is similar to Riemann's "XI" function. To be complete we find several integral representations of the A(s) function and as a direct consequence of the second integral representation we obtain also an analytic continuation of the same function using an identity of Ramanujan.
