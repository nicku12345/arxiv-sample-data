This is a final report on finite Phan theory, a project that has been concerned with a revision and generalisation of Phan's presentation results of twisted Chevalley groups over finite fields with simply laced diagrams by unitary subgroups of rank one and two. Finite Phan theory has been initiated on request by Richard Lyons and Ronald Solomon in order to support their revision of the classification of the finite simple groups.
