The idea of convexity feeds generation, separation, calculus, and approximation. Generation appears as duality; separation, as optimality; calculus, as representation; and approximation, as stability. This is an overview of the origin, evolution, and trends of convexity. Study of convexity in the Sobolev Institute was initiated by Leonid Kantorovich (1912--1986) and Alexandr Alexandrov (1912--1999). This talk is a part of their memory.
