How far off the edge of the table can we reach by stacking n identical, homogeneous, frictionless blocks of length 1? A classical solution achieves an overhang of 1/2 H_n, where H_n ~ \ln n is the nth harmonic number. This solution is widely believed to be optimal. We show, however, that it is, in fact, exponentially far from optimality by constructing simple n-block stacks that achieve an overhang of c n^{1/3}, for some constant c>0.
