In this series of seven papers, predominantly by means of elementary analysis, we establish a number of identities related to the Riemann zeta function. Whilst this paper is mainly expository, some of the formulae reported in it are believed to be new, and the paper may also be of interest specifically due to the fact that most of the various identities have been derived by elementary methods.
