This is an article on mathematical publishing during the German occupation of France. Looking at the cases of four of them and especially at the case of Jacques Feldbau (one of the founders of the theory of fibre bundles), we investigate the way censorship struck the French mathematicians who declared jewish by the Statut des juifs of october 1940, and the strategies these mathematicians then developed. The way the Vichy laws have been discussed and applied at the Acad\'emie des sciences is investigated.
