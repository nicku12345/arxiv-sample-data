We compare the option pricing formulas of Louis Bachelier and Black-Merton-Scholes and observe -- theoretically as well as for Bachelier's original data -- that the prices coincide very well. We illustrate Louis Bachelier's efforts to obtain applicable formulas for option pricing in pre-computer time. Furthermore we explain -- by simple methods from chaos expansion -- why Bachelier's model yields good short-time approximations of prices and volatilities.
