For every odd integer N we give an explicit construction of a polynomial curve \cC(t) = (x(t), y (t)), where \deg x = 3, \deg y = N + 1 + 2\pent N4 that has exactly N crossing points \cC(t_i)= \cC(s_i) whose parameters satisfy s_1 < ... < s_{N} < t_1 < ... < t_{N}. Our proof makes use of the theory of Stieltjes series and Pad\'e approximants. This allows us an explicit polynomial parametrization of the torus knot K_{2,N}.
