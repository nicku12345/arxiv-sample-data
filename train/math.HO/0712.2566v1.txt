Throughout the whole year of 1874, C. Jordan and L. Kronecker were quarrelling over two theorems. On the one hand, Jordan had stated in 1870 a canonical form theorem for substitutions of linear groups; on the other hand, Karl Weierstrass had introduced in 1868 the elementary divisors of non singular pairs of bilinear forms (P,Q) in stating a key theorem of the theory of bilinear and quadratic forms. Although they would be considered equivalent as regard to modern mathematics, not only had these two theorems been stated independently and for different purposes, they had also been lying within the distinct frameworks of two theories until some connections came to light in 1872-1873, breeding the 1874 quarrel and hence revealing an opposition over two practices relating to distinctive cultural features. As we will be looking into the 1874 quarrel, our purpose will be to show how the complex identities of practices such as Jordan s canonical reduction and Kronecker s invariant computation highlight some cultural issues such as tacit knowledge and perceptions of history peculiar to individuals or communities as well as some local ways of thinking such as disciplinary ideals and internal philosophies of generality and simplicity.
