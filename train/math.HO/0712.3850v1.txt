It is easy to find a right-angled triangle with integer sides whose area is 6. There is no such triangle with area 5, but there is one with rational sides (a `\emph{Pythagorean triangle}').   For historical reasons, integers such as 6 or 5 that are (the squarefree part of) the area of some Pythagorean triangle are called `\emph{congruent numbers}'. These numbers actually are interesting for the following reason: Notice the sequence \frac14, 6\frac14, 12\frac14. It is an arithmetic progression with common difference 6, consisting of squares (\frac12)^2, (\frac52)^2, (\frac72)^2 of rational numbers. Indeed the common difference of three rational squares in AP is a congruent number and every congruent number is the common difference of three rational squares in arithmetic progression.   The triangle given by 9^{2}+40^{2}=41^{2} has area 180=5\cdot6^{2} and the numbers x-5, x and x+5 all are rational squares if x=11{97/144}. Recall one obtains all Pythagorean triangles with relatively prime integer sides by taking x=4uv, y=\pm(4u^{2}-v^{2}), z=4u^{2}+v^{2} where u and v are integers with 2u and v relatively prime.   Fermat proved that there is no AP of more than three squares of rationals.
