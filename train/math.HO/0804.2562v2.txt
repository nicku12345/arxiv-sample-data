Our goal is to present the basic results on one-dimensional Gibbs and equilibrium states viewed as special invariant measures on symbolic dynamical systems, and then to describe without technicalities a sample of results they allowed to obtain for certain differentiable dynamical systems. We hope that this contribution will illustrate the symbiotic relationship between ergodic theory and statistical mechanics, and also information theory.
