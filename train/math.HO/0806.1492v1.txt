This work is an introduction to modern mathematical physics. We begin with Maxwell laws and vector calculus, pass next to consider the action and the Feynman integral in quantum mechanics, next relativity and differential geometry to formulate the electromagnetic laws in intrinsic form. Next we see gravitation to study the covariant derivative. We end with the electromagnetic bundle U(1). It contains the know-how + the know-why. The text is written in Spanish. 340 pps.
