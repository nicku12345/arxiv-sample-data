In this paper I propose the idea to establish a clear distinction between the foundations of truth and the foundations of meaning in Mathematics. I explore on the most basic example, the mathematical line, the possibility that the foundations of its meaning are provided by a protomathematical object resulting from the identification by our perceptual system of the visual line and the vestibular line, a point of view suggested by recent results of neurophysiology.
