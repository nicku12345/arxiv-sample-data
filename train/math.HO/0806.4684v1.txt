In this paper we focus on the problem of the degree sequence for the following random graph process. At any time-step t, one of the following three substeps is executed: with probability \alpha_1, a new vertex x_t and m edges incident with x_t are added; or, with probability \alpha-\alpha_1, m edges are added; or finally, with probability 1-\a, m random edges are deleted. Note that in any case edges are added in the manner of preferential attachment. we prove that there exists a critical point \alpha_c satisfying: 1) if \alpha_1<\alpha_c, then the model has power law degree sequence; 2) if \alpha_1>\alpha_c, then the model has exponential degree sequence; and 3) if \alpha_1=\alpha_c, then the model has a degree sequence lying between the above two cases.
