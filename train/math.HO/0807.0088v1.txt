Green's famous essay (Nottingham, 1828), with which he introduced the potential function, was transcribed from its reprint in Crelle's Journal (1850-54), with several typographical corrections and a reference section added. Green starts with accounts of earlier work, and some introductory remarks motivating his notation and method. Then, he gives a textual summary of later formal calculations, beginning with the general results. Finally, Green applies the results to several problems concerning electricity and magnetism.
