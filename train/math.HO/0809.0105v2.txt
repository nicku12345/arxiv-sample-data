We start by presenting a theory of finite sets using the approach which is essentially that taken by Whitehead and Russell in Principia Mathematica}, and which does not involve the natural numbers (or any other infinite set). This theory is then applied to prove results about structures which, like the natural numbers, satisfy the principle of mathematical induction, but do not necessarily satisfy the remaining Peano axioms.
