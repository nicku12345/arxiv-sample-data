We study various proofs of the caracterization of constant functions, more precisely of the theorem: a derivable function, defined on a real interval, is constant if, and only if, its derivative is null. Our aim is to study the relationships of these proofs with the mathematical curriculum of secondary schools and the begining of undergraduate studies in France, from various point of views (epistemological, historical, didactical).
