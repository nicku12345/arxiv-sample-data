In this paper, we study the subconstituent algebras, also called as Terwilliger algebras, of association schemes that are obtained as the wreath product of one-class association schemes K_n=H(1, n) for n\ge 2. We find that the d-class association scheme K_{n_{1}}\wr K_{n_{2}} \wr ... \wr K_{n_{d}} formed by taking the wreath product of K_{n_{i}} has the triple-regularity property. We determine the dimension of the Terwilliger algebra for the association scheme K_{n_{1}}\wr K_{n_{2}}\wr ... \wr K_ {n_{d}}. We give a description of the structure of the Terwilliger algebra for the wreath power (K_n)^{\wr d} for n \geq 2 by studying its irreducible modules. In particular, we show that the Terwilliger algebra of (K_n)^{\wr d} is isomorphic to M_{d+1}(\mathbb{C})\oplus M_1(\mathbb{C})^{\oplus \frac12d(d+1)} for n\ge3, and M_{d+1}(\mathbb{C})\oplus M_1(\mathbb{C})^{\oplus \frac12d(d-1)} for n=2.
