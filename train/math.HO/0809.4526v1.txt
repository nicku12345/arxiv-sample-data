A simple but rigorous proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is given in geometric calculus, after the basis for this theory in geometric algebra has been explained. Various classical examples of this theorem, such as the Green's and Stokes' theorem are discussed, as well as the new theory of monogenic functions, which generalizes the concept of an analytic function of a complex variable to higher dimensions.
