A method is presented for evaluating authors on the basis of citations. It assigns to each author a citation score which depends upon the number of times he is cited, and upon the scores of the citers. The scores are found to be the components of an eigenvector of a normalized citation matrix. The same method can be applied to citation of journals by other journals, to evaluating teams in a league [1], etc.
