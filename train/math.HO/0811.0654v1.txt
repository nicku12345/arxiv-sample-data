Mahlburg (2005) brilliantly showed the importance of crank functions in partition congruences that were originally guessed by Dyson (1944). Ramanujan's partition functions are the centre of these works. Not only for the theory on cranks, but for many other researchers' in India Ramanujan's work inspired for their career in mathematics. This is an undergraduate expository article.
