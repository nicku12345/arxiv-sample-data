We consider issues related to the origins, sources and initial motivations of the theory of Hopf algebras. We consider the two main sources of primeval development: algebraic topology and algebraic group theory. Hopf algebras are named from the work of Heinz Hopf in the 1940's. In this note we trace the infancy of the subject back to papers from the 40's, 50's and 60's in the two areas mentioned above. Many times we just describe -- and/or transcribe parts of -- some of the relevant original papers on the subject.
