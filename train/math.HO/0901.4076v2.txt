This is a brief overview of researches of Dmitry Petrovich Zhelobenko (1934--2006). He is the best known for his book "Compact Lie groups and their representations" and for the classification of all irreducible representations of complex semisimple Lie groups. We tell also on other his works, especially on the spectral analysis of representations.
