The concept of a symplectic structure first appeared in the works of Lagrange on the so-called "method of variation of the constants". These works are presented, together with those of Poisson, who first defined the composition law called today the "Poisson bracket". The method of variation of the constants is presented using today's mathematical concepts and notations.
