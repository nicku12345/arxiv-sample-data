In the present paper, we study the evolution of the mathematical community in Brno (Br\"unn in German), the Moravian maintown, in the years between 1900 and 1930. In particular, we want to discuss how the Great War and its consequences (creation of Czechoslovakia and shift of power from the Germans to the Czechs) had an effect on this evolution.
