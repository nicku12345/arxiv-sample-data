New historical aspects of the classification, by Cayley and Cremona, of ruled quartic surfaces and the relation to string models and plaster models are presented. In a `modern' treatment of the classification of ruled quartic surfaces the classical one is corrected and completed. A conceptual proof is presented of a result of Rohn concerning curves in \mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1 of bi-degree (2,2). The string models of Series XIII (of some ruled quartic surfaces) are based on Rohn's result.
