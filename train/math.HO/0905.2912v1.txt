This paper argues that, contrary to the beliefs of many, the amount of mathematics information available for African researchers, including electronic scientific journals and databases, is indeed substantial. However, whereas information resources are served on a silver platter at the "northern" universities, researchers at universities in developing countries have to work hard for their treats.   The scientific information available for low-income countries is scattered among a large number of providers, websites, access methods, price models, and country- or institution-specific programmes. It is therefore quite hard for individual researchers to see the whole picture and establish what actually is available and what is not.   This paper presents a number of key information sources for mathematics. Some are aimed primarily at disciplines other than mathematics but nevertheless contain extremely important and high-ranking mathematics journals. Brief instructions are also given on how to register for and maintain access to various relevant and useful resources.
