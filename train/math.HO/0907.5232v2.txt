The nth Ramanujan prime is the smallest positive integer R_n such that if x \ge R_n, then there are at least n primes in the interval (x/2,x]. For example, Bertrand's postulate is R_1 = 2. Ramanujan proved that R_n exists and gave the first five values as 2, 11, 17, 29, 41. In this note, we use inequalities of Rosser and Schoenfeld to prove that 2n \log 2n < R_n < 4n \log 4n for all n, and we use the Prime Number Theorem to show that R_n is asymptotic to the 2nth prime. We also estimate the length of the longest string of consecutive Ramanujan primes among the first n primes, explain why there are more twin Ramanujan primes than expected, and make three conjectures (the first has since been proved by S. Laishram).
