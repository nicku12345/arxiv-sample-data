In this short paper, I introduce an elementary method for exactly evaluating the definite integrals \, \int_0^{\pi}{\ln{(\sin{\theta})}\,d\theta}, \int_0^{\pi/2}{\ln{(\sin{\theta})}\,d\theta}, \int_0^{\pi/2}{\ln{(\cos{\theta})}\,d\theta}, and \int_0^{\pi/2}{\ln{(\tan{\theta})}\,d\theta} \, in finite terms. The method consists in to manipulate the sums obtained from the logarithm of certain products of trigonometric functions at rational multiples of \pi, putting them in the form of Riemann sums. As this method does not involve any search for primitives, it represents a good alternative to more involved integration techniques. As a bonus, I show how to apply the method for easily evaluating \,\int_0^1{\ln{\Gamma(x)} \, d x}.
