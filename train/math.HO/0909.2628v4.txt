In 1972, the late B. E. Johnson introduced the notion of an amenable Banach algebra and asked whether the Banach algebra B(E) of all bounded linear operators on a Banach space E could ever be amenable if \dim E = \infty. Somewhat surprisingly, this question was answered positively only very recently as a by-product of the Argyros--Haydon result that solves the "scalar plus compact problem": there is an infinite-dimensional Banach space E, the dual of which is \ell^1, such that B(E) = K(E)+ \mathbb{C} \id_E. Still, B(\ell^2) is not amenable, and in the past decade,  B(\ell^p) was found to be non-amenable for p=1,2,\infty thanks to the work of C. J. Read, G. Pisier, and N. Ozawa. We survey those results, and then--based on joint work with M. Daws--outline a proof that establishes the non-amenability of B(\ell^p) for all p \in [1,\infty].
