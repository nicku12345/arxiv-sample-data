In a recent work, Dancs and He found new `Euler-type' formulas for \,\ln{2}\, and \,\zeta{(2\,n+1)}, \,n\, being a positive integer, each containing a series that apparently can not be evaluated in closed form, distinctly from \,\zeta{(2\,n)}, for which the Euler's formula allows us to write it as a rational multiple of \,\pi^{2n}. There in that work, however, the formulas are derived through certain series manipulations, by following Tsumura's strategy, which makes it \emph{curious} --- in the words of those authors themselves --- the appearance of the numbers \,\ln{2}\, and \,\zeta{(2\,n+1)}. In this short paper, I show how some known zeta-series can be used to derive the Dancs-He series in an alternative manner.
