Differential Calculus is a staple of the college mathematics major's diet. Eventually one becomes tired of the same routine, and wishes for a more diverse meal. The college math major may seek to generalize applications of the derivative that involve functions of more than one variable, and thus enjoy a course on Multivariate Calculus. We serve this article as a culinary guide to differentiating and integrating functions of more than one variable -- using differential forms which are the basis for de Rham Cohomology.
