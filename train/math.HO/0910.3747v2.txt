\'Etienne B\'ezout, member of the Acad\'emie Royale des Sciences, have to study some works and books sended at the Acad\'emy. In this article, we will look at this responsibility for Navy, before and after 1764, which is the year of B\'ezout's nomination at the charge of Examinateur des Gardes du Pavillon et de la Marine. Each year he must go to Brest, Rochefort and Toulon harbours to examine the Gardes de la Marine. This give to him titles and qualifications as expert in sailing. We will see his participation at an Academy polemic : Blondeau versus Bouguer/Lacaille on a navigation book. Almost in the same time, \'Etienne B\'ezout will be member of the Acad\'emie de Marine de Brest in 1769. We will see his work in this last Academy. At last, we will study his Trait\'e de navigation, written in 1769 and we will compare to Bouguer's Navigation book.
