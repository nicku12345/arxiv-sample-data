As rewards of reading two great papers of Hermite from 1873, we trace the historical origin of the integral Niven used in his well-known proof of the irrationality of \pi, uncover a rarely acknowledged simple proof by Hermite of the irrationality of \pi^2, give a new proof of the irrationality of r\tan r for nonzero rational r^2, and generalize it to a proof of the irrationality of certain ratios of Bessel functions.
