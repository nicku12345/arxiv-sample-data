Folklore tells us that there are no uninteresting natural numbers. But some natural numbers are more interesting then others. In this article we will explain why 3435 is one of the more interesting natural numbers around. We will show that 3435 is a Munchausen number in base 10, and we will explain what we mean by that. We will further show that for every base there are finitely many Munchausen numbers in that base.
