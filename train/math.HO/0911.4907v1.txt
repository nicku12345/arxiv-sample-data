Democracy functions of wavelet admissible bases are computed for weighted Orlicz Spaces in terms of its fundamental function. In particular, we prove that these bases are greedy if and only if the Orlicz space is a Lebesgue space. Also, sharp embeddings for the approximation spaces are given in terms of weighted discrete Lorentz spaces. For Lebesgue spaces the approximation spaces are identified with weighted Besov spaces.
