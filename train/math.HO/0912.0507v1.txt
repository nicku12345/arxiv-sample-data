Irving John ("Jack") Good (9 December 1916 - 5 April 2009) was one of my greatest heroes and influencers. On Oct. 25, 2009, I gave a twenty-three minute talk with the present title, and this article is an extended transcript of that talk. As with all my papers, the "accompanying" Maple package is much more important (mathematically, of course, I also talk about the human side of Jack in this article, and this is even more important than any math). In particular, I taught Jack's brilliant ideas to my computer, and now it can do even better than Jack.
