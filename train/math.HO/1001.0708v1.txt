A quite old problem has been recently revitalized by Leonard Mlodinow's book The Drunkard's Walk, where it is presented in a way that has definitely confused several people, that wonder why the prevalence of the name of one daughter among the population should change the probability that the other child is a girl too. I try here to discuss the problem from scratch, showing that the rarity of the name plays no role, unless the strange assumption of two identical names in the same family is taken into account. But also the name itself does not matter. What is really important is `identification', meant in an acceptation broader than usual, in the sense that a child is characterized by a set of attributes that make him/her uniquely identifiable (`that one') inside a family. The important point of how the information is acquired is also commented, suggesting an explanation of why several people tend to consider the informations "at least one boy" and "a well defined boy" (elder/youngest or of a given name) equivalent.
