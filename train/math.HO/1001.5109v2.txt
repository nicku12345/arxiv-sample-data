The Search for Certainty was published in 2009 by Krzysztof Burdzy. It examines the "philosophical duopoly" of von Mises and de Finetti at the foundation of probability and statistics and find this duopoly missing. This review exposes the weakness of the arguments presented in the book, it questions the relevance of introducing a new set of probability axioms from a methodological perspective, and it concludes at the lack of impact of this book on statistical foundations and practice.
