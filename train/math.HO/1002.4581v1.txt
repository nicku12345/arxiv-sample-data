At the end of 19th century Peano discerned vector spaces, differentiability, convex sets, limits of families of sets, tangent cones, and many other concepts, in a modern perfect form. He applied these notions to solve numerous problems. The theorem on necessary conditions of optimality (Regula) is one of these. The formal language of logic that he developed, enabled him to perceive mathematics with great precision and depth. Actually he built mathematics axiomatically based exclusively on logical and set-theoretic primitive terms and properties, which was a revolutionary turning point in the development of mathematics.
