SWiM is a semantic wiki for collaboratively building, editing and browsing mathematical knowledge represented in the domain-specific structural semantic markup language OMDoc. It motivates users to contribute to collections of mathematical knowledge by instantly sharing the benefits of knowledge-powered services with them. SWiM is currently being used for authoring content dictionaries, i. e. collections of uniquely identified mathematical symbols, and prepared for managing a large-scale proof formalisation effort.
