Many groups possess highly symmetric generating sets that are naturally endowed with an underlying combinatorial structure. Such generating sets can prove to be extremely useful both theoretically in providing new existence proofs for groups and practically by providing succinct means of representing group elements. We give a survey of results obtained in the study of these symmetric generating sets. In keeping with earlier surveys on this matter, we emphasize the sporadic simple groups. ADDENDUM: This is an updated version of a survey article originally accepted for inclusion in the proceedings of the 2009 `Groups St Andrews' conference. Since the article was accepted the author has become aware of other recent work in the subject that we incorporate to provide an updated version here (the most notable addition being the contents of Section 3.4.)
