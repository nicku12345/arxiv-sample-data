In the paper, we study the situation of the mathematical community in Brno, the maintown of Moravia, between 1900 and 1930. During this time, the First World War and, as one of its consequences, the creation of the new independent Czechoslovakia, created a major perturbation and was the occasion of a reorganization of the community. Its German and Czech sides were in particular constantly looking for a renewed cohabitation which proved difficult to establish along the sliding of political power from the Germans to the Czechs . We try to illustrate how before the war the main place for mathematics in Brno was the German Technical University whereas after the war it became the newly created Masaryk university.
