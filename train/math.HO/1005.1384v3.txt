In this short note we have produced different kind of magic squares using digital letter having only the algorisms: 0, 1, 2, 5, and 8. The interesting fact in considering these five digits is that the day 8th May 2010 also have these ones (08.05.2010). Moreover, the magic squares presented have some interesting properties, such as: they remains the same if we rotate them by 180 degree, or see in the mirror, or see on the other side of the paper, etc. Two palindrome semi-magic squares of order 3x3 are also given. Still, we have considered other dates having four digits.
