The Integral Image algorithm is often applied in tasks that require efficient integration over images, such as object detection. In this paper we discuss theoretical aspects of the algorithm's continuous version. We suggest to define the coefficients at the formulation of the algorithm by applying a novel kind of discrete derivative. Based on that operator we build a novel integration method over curves in the plane, and apply it in a theorem that extends the algorithm to general continuous domains.
