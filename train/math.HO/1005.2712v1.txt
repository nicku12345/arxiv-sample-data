We generalize Wallis's 1655 infinite product for \pi/2 to one for (\pi/K)\csc(\pi/K), as well as give new Wallis-type products for \pi/4, 2, \sqrt{2+\sqrt2}, 2\pi/3\sqrt3, and other constants. The proofs use a classical infinite product formula involving the gamma function. We also extend Catalan's 1873 infinite product of radicals for e to Catalan-type products for e/4,\sqrt{e}, and e^{3/2}/2. Here the proofs use Stirling's formula. Finally, we find an analog for e^{2/3}/\sqrt3 of Pippenger's 1980 infinite product for e/2, and we conjecture that they can be generalized to a product for a power of e^{1/K}.
