The following notes are intended to make a small digression on the topics mentioned in the title of the same, since these were not addressed in the past tribute by the Institute of Physics of the UdeA. We believe more than platitude try to justify the importance and effectiveness in the development of mathematics and physics during the eighteenth century and present such issues, therefore a brief description of the methods and problems attacked by Euler and his contemporaries using the heuristics. Note in advance that they constitute a strong impoverished attempt to honor the memory of who is considered the Shakespeare of Mathematics: Universal, rich in detail and inexhaustible.
