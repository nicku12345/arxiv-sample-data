We propose in this paper a theoretical approach of teachers' professional development, focusing on teachers' interactions with resources, digital resources in particular. Documents, entailing resources and schemes of utilization of these resources, are developed throughout documentational geneses occurring along teachers' documentation work (selecting resources, adapting, combining, refining them). The study of teachers' documentation systems permits to seize the changes brought by digital resources; it also constitutes a way to embrace teachers' professional change.
