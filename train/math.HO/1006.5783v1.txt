Technologies in mathematical education has been a theme present at CERME from the first edition. The available technologies have evolved a lot during these years. At CERME 5 conference, the conclusions of the technology Working Group (Kynigos et al. 2007), as well as Artigue's and Ruthven's interventions (Artigue 2007, Ruthven 2007), signal perspective evolutions towards more comprehensive studies, in several respects. Drawing on these previous works, CERME 6 WG7 intended to go further in the directions they have indicated.
