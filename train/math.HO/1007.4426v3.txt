We give an elementary introduction, through illustrative examples but without proofs, to one of the basic consequences of the Langlands programme, namely the law governing the primes modulo which a given irreducible integral polynomial splits completely. Some recent results, such as the modularity of elliptic curves over the rationals, or the proof of Serre's conjecture by Khare and Wintenberger, are also illustrated through examples.
