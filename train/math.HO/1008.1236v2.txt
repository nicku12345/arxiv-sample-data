Given a set of oriented hyperplanes \mathcal{P}=\{p_1, ..., p_k\} in \mathbb{R}^n, define v(P) for any point P\in\mathbb{R}^n as the sum of the signed distances from P to p_1,..., p_k. We give a simple geometric characterization of \mathcal{P} so that v is a constant. The characterization leads to a connection with the Fermat point of k points in \mathbb{R}^n. Finally, we discuss historically the full content of Viviani's theorem.
