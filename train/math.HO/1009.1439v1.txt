This is a translation of Euler's 1773 "Variae observationes circa angulos in progressione geometrica progredientes", E561 in the Enestr{\"o}m index.   I translated this paper as a result of my study of Euler's work on the infinite product \prod_{k=1}^\infty (1-z^k). If one instead considers the finite product \prod_{k=1}^n (1-z^k), one can study its behavior on the unit circle. The absolute value of \prod_{k=1}^n (1-e^{ik\theta}) is 2^n |\prod_{k=1}^n \sin k\theta/2|. My interest in the product \prod_{k=1}^n \sin k\theta/2 has inspired me to become acquainted with Euler's papers on trigonometric identities, in particular E447, E561, and E562. E561 says nothing about the product \prod_{k=1}^n \sin k\theta/2, but it has identities which I had not seen before. The identities have a form similar to Vi\`ete's infinite product \prod_{k=1}^\infty \cos \theta/2^k=\frac{\sin\theta}{\theta}.
