In this paper we study two operations, Pasting and Reversing, defined from a natural way to be applied over some rings such as the ring of polynomials and the ring of linear differential operators, which is a differential ring. We obtain some properties of these operations over these rings, in particular over the set of natural numbers, in where we rewrite some properties incoming from recreational mathematics.
