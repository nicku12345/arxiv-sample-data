In this short note we have produced for the first time in the history different kinds of universal bimagic squares. This we have made using only the digits 0,1 and 2. The universal bimagic squares of order 8x8 and 16x16 are with the digits 0 and 1. The universal bimagic square of order 9x9 is with the digits 0, 1 and 2. It is interesting to note that the day 0ctober 10 have only the digits 0 and 1 if we consider it as 10.10.10. If we consider the date as 10.10.2010, then this has the digits 0, 1 and 2.
