In this short note we have produced different kinds of bimagic squares using only the digits 0, 1, 2, 5 and 8. The universal bimagic squares presented are of order 8x8, 9x9, 16x16 and 25x25. In order to bring universal bimagic square of order 8x8, we used only the digits 2 and 5. For the order 9x9, we used only the digits 2, 5 and 8. For the universal bimagic square of order 16x16 we used the digits 1, 2, 5 and 8 and finally for the order 25x25, we used five digits 0, 1, 2, 5 and 8. In order to produce these universal bimagic squares we have used the digits in the digital form.
