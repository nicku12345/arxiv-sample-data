In this short note we have given an equation based on the date 11.09.2001 and presented some magic squares. The magic squares presented are of order 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 9x9, 16x16 and 25x25. While the magic square of higher order 9x9, 16x16 and 25x25 are bimagic. These magic squares are based on the digits, 1-6-9, 0-1-2, 0-1-2-9 and 0-1-2-6-9. The interesting fact in all these magic squares is that if we gave them a rotation of 180 degrees, they remain again the magic squares. In order to have this rotation, we have used the numbers in digital forms. Moreover, the day of submission of this work (20.10.2010) has only the digits 0, 1 and 2. Using only these three digits, we have presented magic squares of order 3x3 and 9x9.
