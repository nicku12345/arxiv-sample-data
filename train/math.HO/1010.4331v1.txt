This paper was published in French under the title \textit{Sur une m\'ethode d'approximation des racines carr\'ees dans l'Inde ant\'erieurement \`a la conqu\^ete d'Alexandre}, in the Bulletin de la S. M. F., volume 7 (1879), p. 98-102.   It argues that the process of approximating the irrational square root of an integer, now commonly known as Newton's method, was known in India since very ancient times.
