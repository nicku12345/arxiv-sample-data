We construct the quaternion algebra [10] "geometrically" by a three dimensional analogue of the classic two dimensional geometric description of the complex field. The algebraic description of the multiplication operation in three dimensions involves the addition of one term. The construction leads to novel methods for implementing and interpolating rotations and understanding their topology.
