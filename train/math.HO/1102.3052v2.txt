In this paper we have produced different kinds of bimagic squares based on bimagic squares of order 8x8, 16x16, 25x25, 49x49, etc. A different technique is applied to produce bimagic square of order 16x16, 25x25, 49x49, etc. The bimagic square of order 8x8 used is the already known in the literature. The work is neither based on any programming language nor on mathematical results. Just simple combinations are used to produce these bimagic squares. Moreover, in each case we have used consecutive numbers starting from 1
