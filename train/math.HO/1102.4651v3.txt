Computational science and engineering (CSE) has been misunderstood to advance with the construction of enormous computers. To the contrary, the historical record demonstrates that innovations in CSE come from improvements to the mathematics embodied by computer programs. Whether scientists and engineers become inventors who make these breakthroughs depends on circumstances and the interdisciplinary extent of their educations. The USA currently has the largest CSE professorate, but the data suggest this prominence is ephemeral.
