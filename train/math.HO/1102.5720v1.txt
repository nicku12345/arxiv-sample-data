Traditionally, mathematical knowledge is published in printed media such as books or journals. With the advent of the Internet, a new method of publication became available. To date, however, most online mathematical publications do not employ the full capabilities of the medium. We describe a project to modernize online mathematics presentation and build a community-focused environment in which the lines between "author" and "reader" are blurred, enhancing collaboration and improving publication quality.
