In this lecture notes we present the equations and the physics involved in the dynamic of incompressible fluids. We present the mathematical techniques needed in order to prove the existence and uniqueness result for the case where we consider Burgers equation. We also explain an useful numerical method when dealing with this kind of equations. These lecture notes were written for the 2010 JAE-Intro Summer School. This Summer School was organized by ICMAT-CSIC and takes place in Madrid.
