Expository notes on Clifford algebras and spinors with a detailed discussion of Majorana, Weyl, and Dirac spinors. The paper is meant as a review of background material, needed, in particular, in now fashionable theoretical speculations on neutrino masses. It has a more mathematical flavour than the over twenty-seven-year-old "Introduction to Majorana masses" by P.D. Mannheim and includes historical notes and biographical data on past participants in the story.
