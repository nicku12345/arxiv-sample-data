In version v1 (under a different title) I was trying to give a new proof of Wedderburn's Little Theorem (WLT), stating that a finite dision ring is commutative, but I failed. So I had to withdraw the paper (version v2). Firstly I became aware of a new theorem. So in the mean time in version v3 under a new title (see top of this page) I proved a useful property of the finite nonabelian groups stating that one of its maximally abelian subgroups is not an eigenheimer. In the present version v4 I prove finally WLT in a new section 2 entitled: A New Proof of Wedderburn's Little Theorem: A Finite Division Ring is Commutative.
