In this article we consider a consistent matrix equation AXB = C when a particular solution X_{0} is given and we represent a new form of the general solution which contains both reproductive and non-reproductive solutions (it depends on the form of particular solution X_{0}). We also analyse the solutions of some matrix systems using the concept of reproductivity and we give a new form of the condition for the consistency of the matrix equation AXB=C.
