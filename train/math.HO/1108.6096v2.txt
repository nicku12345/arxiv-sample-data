We study algebraic and transcendental powers of positive real numbers, including solutions of each of the equations x^x=y, x^y=y^x, x^x=y^y, x^y=y, and x^{x^y}=y. Applications to values of the iterated exponential functions are given. The main tools used are classical theorems of Hermite-Lindemann and Gelfond-Schneider, together with solutions of exponential Diophantine equations.
