We publish a letter from Lebesgue to Cartan and a letter from Montel to Cartan, dated 1933--1934, about Gaston Julia, Paul Montel, and an election at the Paris Academy of Sciences. We discuss the context and the mathematics.   The two letters have been discovered between the publication of the book "Fatou, Julia, Montel, le Grand prix des sciences math\'ematiques de 1918 et apr\`es" (Springer 2009) and the publication of the English translation (Springer 2011). They have been included in the translation. This paper is dedicated to the readers of the French version.
