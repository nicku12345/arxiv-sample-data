This paper shows an elementary and direct proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, via Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem on Minima and the Binomial Formula, that avoids: any root extraction other than the one used to define the modulus function over the complex plane, trigonometry, differentiation, integration, series, arguments by induction and arguments using epsilon's and delta's.
