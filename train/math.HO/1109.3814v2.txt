A mathematically and culturally natural modification of Evart Bruins' explanation of the genesis of the numbers on the Old Babylonian tablet Plimpton 322 gives an economical accounting for the "missing pairs" in his reconstruction. When the new scheme is used to predict the numbers that would follow those on Plimpton 322, the results add five new rows to those listed by Price and Friberg in their hypothetical extension of the content of Plimpton 322 to rows covering the edges and back.
