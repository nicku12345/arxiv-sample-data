In this shortnote, a series expansion technique introduced recently by Dancs and He for generating Euler-type formulae for odd zeta values \:\zeta{(2 k +1)}, \zeta{(s)} being the Riemann zeta function and k a positive integer, is modified in a manner to furnish the even zeta values  \zeta{(2k)}. As a result, I find an elementary proof of \sum_{n=1}^\infty{{1/{n^2}}} = {\pi^2/6}, as well as a recurrence formula for \zeta{(2k)} from which it follows that the ratio {\zeta{(2k)} / \pi^{2k}} is a rational number, without making use of Euler's formula and Bernoulli numbers.
