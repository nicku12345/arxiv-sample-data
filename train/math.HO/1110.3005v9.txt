Let \{a_n\}_1^\infty and \{\theta_n\}_0^\infty be the sequences of partial quotients and approximation coefficients for the continued fraction expansion of an irrational number. We will provide a function f such that a_{n+1} = f(\theta_{n\pm1},\theta_n). In tandem with a formula due to Dajani and Kraaikamp, we will write \theta_{n \pm 1} as a function of (\theta_{n \mp 1}, \theta_n), revealing an elegant symmetry in this classical sequence and allowing for its recovery from a pair of consecutive terms.
