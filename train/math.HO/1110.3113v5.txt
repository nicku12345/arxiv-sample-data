The Fermat quotient q_p(a):=(a^{p-1}-1)/p, for prime p\nmid a, and the Wilson quotient w_p:=((p-1)!+1)/p are integers. If p\mid w_p, then p is a Wilson prime. For odd p, Lerch proved that (\sum_{a=1}^{p-1} q_p(a) - w_p)/p is also an integer; we call it the Lerch quotient \ell_p. If p\mid\ell_p we say p is a Lerch prime. A simple Bernoulli-number test for Lerch primes is proven. There are four Lerch primes 3, 103, 839, 2237 up to 3\times10^6; we relate them to the known Wilson primes 5, 13, 563. Generalizations are suggested. Next, if p is a non-Wilson prime, then q_p(w_p) is an integer that we call the Fermat-Wilson quotient of p. The GCD of all q_p(w_p) is shown to be 24. If p\mid q_p(a), then p is a Wieferich prime base a; we give a survey of them. Taking a=w_p, if p\mid q_p(w_p) we say p is a Wieferich-non-Wilson prime. There are three up to 10^7, namely, 2, 3, 14771. Several open problems are discussed.
