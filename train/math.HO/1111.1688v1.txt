Annotated parallel text in Latin and English of the paper of Adam Adamandy Kocha\'nski "Solutio Theorematum Ab illustri Viro in Actis hujus Anni Mense Januario, pag. 28. propositorum", Acta Eruditorum, Lipsiae 1682, pp. 230-236, in which he presented solutions of two geometric problems proposed by an anonymous author in the same journal in January 1682. The Latin text of "Solutio theorematum" presented here closely follows the original text published in "Acta Eruditorum". Punctuation, capitalization, and mathematical notation have been preserved. Several misprints which appeared in the original are also reproduced unchanged, but with a footnote indicating correction. Every effort has been made to preserve the layout of original tables. The translation is as faithful as possible, often literal, and it is mainly intended to be of help to those who wish to study the original Latin text. In the appendix, all propositions from Euclid's "Elements" mentioned in the text are listed in both Latin and English.
