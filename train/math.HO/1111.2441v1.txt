This paper discusses the wartime activities of the astronomer Charles Nordmann from the Paris Observatory. Nordmann was briefly mobilized in 1914 before starting to work on sound-ranging. He also wrote a witness account of the war as well as a monthly scientific chronicle in the influential Revue des Deux Mondes. We argue that his work can be interpretation as the conscious demonstration that war was the business of scientists.
