We review remarkable results in several mathematical scenarios, including graph theory, division algebras, cross product formalism and matroid theory. Specifically, we mention the following subjects: (1) the Euler relation in graph theory, and its higher-dimensional generalization, (2) the dimensional theorem for division algebras and in particular the Hurwitz theorem for normed division algebras, (3) the vector cross product dimensional possibilities, (4) some theorems for graphs and matroids. Our main goal is to motivate a possible research work in these four topics, putting special interest in their possible links.
