This is a translation of an article presented by Leonhard Euler on 18 March 1776 (Opera Omnia I-XVIII, pp. 265-290) and of summaries for it by Sim\'eon Denis Poisson in 1820 and by Heinrich Burkhardt in 1916. An appendix lists in modern notation interesting definite integrals and series which Euler, after using partial fractions to prove his main formula, obtained formally by allowing the parameters n, p, zeta and theta to take particular, even pure imaginary, values : the Fourier cosine and two-sided Laplace transforms of the trigonometric and of the hyperbolic secant (also squared), and their partial fraction decomposition. The source archive provides, in Plain TeX, LaTeX and PDF formats, the corrected Latin text and a complete translation into French.
