This book is a regular textbook of analytical geometry covering vector algebra and its applications to describing straight lines, planes, and quadrics in two and three dimensions. The stress is made on vector algebra by using skew-angular coordinates and by introducing some notations and prerequisites for understanding tensors. The book is addressed to students specializing in mathematics, physics, engineering, and technologies and to students of other specialities where educational standards require learning this subject.
