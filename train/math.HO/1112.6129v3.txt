We find that second order quantification is problematic when a quantified concept variable is supposed to function predicatively. This issue is analyzed and it is shown that a constructive interpretation of the falling under relation suffices to resolve the difficulty. We are then able to present a formal system for reasoning about concepts. We prove that this system is consistent and we investigate the extent to which it is able to interpret set theoretic and number theoretic systems of a more standard type.
