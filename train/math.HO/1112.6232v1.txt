The earliest origins of mathematics in the Indian subcontinent is generally dated around 800-500 BCE when the {\em Sulbasutras} are thought to have been written. In this article we suggest that mathematical thinking in South Asia, in particular, geometry, may have had an even earlier beginning - in the third millenium BCE. We base our hypothesis on the analysis of design patterns, such as complex space-filling tiling, seen on artifacts of the Indus Valley Civilization (also referred to as the Mature Harappan Civilization, 2500-1900 BCE) which speaks of a deep understanding of sophisticated geometric principles.
