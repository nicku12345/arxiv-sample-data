In this article, we suggest the use of Mathematical Relationships as a possible way to decrease the students' disinterest in Mathematics. First we made a consideration of the environment of the classroom from the perspective of teachers and students and compare it with what is proposed in PCN's, sought to show that the application of mathematical concepts is already part of the daily lives of students, although they not relate to the material taught in schools, also brought some examples of operating environments, situations and movies that help in the preparation of generating themes for math classes, finally, we invite teachers to reflect on their roles as mediators in classroom.
