Euler presents a third proof of the Fermat theorem, the one that lets us call it the Euler-Fermat theorem. This seems to be the proof that Euler likes best. He also proves that the smallest power x^n that, when divided by a numer N, prime to x, and that leaves a remainder of 1, is equal to the number of parts of N that are prime to n, that is to say, the number of distinct aliquot parts of N. The translation is presnted from Euler's Latin original into German.
