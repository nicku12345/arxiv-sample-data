Eve (2003), studied seven means from geometrical point of view. These means are \textit{Harmonic, Geometric, Arithmetic, Heronian, Contra-harmonic, Root-mean square and Centroidal mean}. Some of these means are particular cases of Gini's (1938) mean of order r and s. In this paper we have established some proportionality relations having these means. Some inequalities among some of differences arising due to seven means inequalities are also established.
