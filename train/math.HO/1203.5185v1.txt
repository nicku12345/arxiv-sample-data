This paper is about an experiment with the goal of testing a primary teacher's resource. This is the next part of a research presented at EMF2009. This resource must help a teacher to practice a research and proof activity between peers with her pupils even she had never done this before. The paper presents the problems given by this project and describes the means to build the resource and the methodology of the experiment with some classmates. The results are given illustrating the complexity of the underlying process.
