We study the historical process that led to the worldwide adoption, throughout mathematical research papers and textbooks, of the denomination "Vandermonde determinant". The mathematical object can be related to two passages in Vandermonde's writings, of which one inspired Cauchy's definition of determinants. Influential citations of Cauchy and Jacobi may have initiated the naming process. It started during the second half of the 19\textsuperscript{th} century as a pedagogical practice in France. The spread in textbooks and research journals began during the first half of 20\textsuperscript{th} century, and only reached full acceptance after the 1960's. The naming process is still ongoing, in the sense that the volume of publications using the denomination grows significantly faster than the overall volume of the field.
