New (infinitely many) rational approximants to \zeta(3) proving its irrationality are given. The recurrence relations for the numerator and denominator of these approximants as well as their continued fraction expansions are obtained. A comparison of our approximants with Ap\'ery's approximants to \zeta(3) is shown.
