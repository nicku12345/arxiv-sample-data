Classical applications of Galois theory concern algebraic numbers and algebraic functions. Still, the night before his duel, Galois wrote that his last mathematical thoughts had been directed toward applying his "theory of ambiguity to transcendental functions and transcendental quantities". We outline some more or less recent ideas and results in this direction.
