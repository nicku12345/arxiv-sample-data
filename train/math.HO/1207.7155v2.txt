This is a philosophy-intense physics article, or, if you wish, a physics-intense philosophy article. Also, being a mathematician, I tend to view the physics, in particular the essence of quantum physics, in emphasizing the mathematical structure that serves as its language. However, I do express views on typically philosophical/epistemological matters. Since these points of view do not seem to me too widely expressed in the literature, while I find them quite compelling, I think this note has some interest.
