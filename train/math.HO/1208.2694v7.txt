Here we weave together interviews conducted by the author with three prominent figures in the world of Ramanujan's mathematics, George Andrews, Bruce Berndt and Ken Ono. The article describes Andrews's discovery of the "lost" notebook, Andrews and Berndt's effort of proving and editing Ramanujan's notes, and recent breakthroughs by Ono and others carrying certain important aspects of the Indian mathematician's work into the future. Also presented are historical details related to Ramanujan and his mathematics, perspectives on the impact of his work in contemporary mathematics, and a number of interesting personal anecdotes from Andrews, Berndt and Ono.
