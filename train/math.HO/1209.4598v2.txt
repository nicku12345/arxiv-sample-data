Pasting and Reversing operations have been used successfully over the set of integer numbers, simple permutations, rings and recently over a generalized vector product. In this paper, these operations are defined from a natural way to be applied over vector spaces. In particular we study Pasting and Reversing over vectors, matrices and we rewrite some properties for polynomials as vector space. Finally we study some properties of Reversing through linear transformations as for example an analysis of palindromic and antipalindromic vector subspaces.
