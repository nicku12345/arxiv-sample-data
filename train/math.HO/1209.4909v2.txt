This article describes the main mathematical researches performed, in England and in the Continent between 1742-1827, on the subject of hyperbola rectification, thereby adding some of our contributions. We start with the Maclaurin inventions on Calculus and their remarkable role in the early mid 1700s; next we focus a bit on his evaluation, 1742, of the hyperbolic excess, explaining the true motivation behind his research. To his geometrical-analytical treatment we attach ours, a purely analytical alternative. Our hyperbola inquiry is then switched to John Landen, an amateur mathematician, who probably was writing more to fix his priorities than to explain his remarkable findings. We follow him in the obscure proofs of his theorem on hyperbola rectification, explaining the links to Maclaurin and so on. With a chain of geometrical constructions, we attach our interpretation to Landen's treatment. Our modern analytical proof to his hyperbolic limit excess, by means of elliptic integrals of the first and second kind is also provided, and we demonstrate why the so called Landen transformation for the elliptic integrals cannot be ascribed to him. Next, the subject leaves England for the Continent: the character of Lagrange is introduced, even if our interest concerns only his 1785 memoir on irrational integrals, where the Arithmetic Geometric Mean, AGM, is established by him. Nevertheless, our objective is not the AGM, but to detect the real source of the so-called Landen transformation for elliptic integrals. In fact, Lagrange's paper encloses a differential identity stemming from the AGM: integrating it, we show how it could be possible to arrive at the well-known Legendre recursive computation of a first kind elliptic integral, which appeared in his Trait\'e, 1827, much after the Lagrange's paper.
