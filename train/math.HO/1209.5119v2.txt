For any particularly interesting theorem one proof is never enough. Instead, the first proof sets the challenge to find a more elegant method that illuminates subtle features of the math, is simpler to understand, or even avoids using controversial subjects. In this paper we consider a subject that has attracted the attention of many mathematicians: the uncountability of the real numbers in the unit interval. We present the most exhaustive collection of proofs of this fact that we know. These range from Cantor's three published proofs, including his famous diagonalization method, to more recent proofs that employ measure theory, game theory, algebra, and analysis.
