It is well-known to be impossible to trisect an arbitrary angle and duplicate an arbitrary cube by a ruler and a compass. On the other hand, it is known from the ancient times that these constructions can be performed when it is allowed to use several conic curves. In this paper, we prove that any point constructible from conics can be constructed using a ruler and a compass, together with a single fixed non-degenerate conic different from a circle.
