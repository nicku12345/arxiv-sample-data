In this paper, our aim is to discuss the outcome of a ten-year experimental workshop activity carried out by the Center `matematita' (http://www.matematita.it/) with classes of pre-university students of any age. We analyse the potential benefits of this way of teaching and learning mathematics, both from the point of view of students and teachers.
