We re-evaluate the great Leibniz-Newton calculus debate, exactly three hundred years after it culminated, in 1712. We reflect upon the concept of invention, and to what extent there were indeed two independent inventors of this new mathematical method. We are to a considerable extent agreeing with the mathematics historians Tom Whiteside in the 20th century and Augustus de Morgan in the 19th. By way of introduction we recall two apposite quotations: "After two and a half centuries the Newton-Leibniz disputes continue to inflame the passions. Only the very learned (or the very foolish) dare to enter this great killing ground of the history of ideas" from Stephen Shapin and "When de l'Hopital, in 1696, published at Paris a treatise so systematic, and so much resembling one of modern times, that it might be used even now, he could find nothing English to quote, except a slight treatise of Craig on quadratures, published in 1693" from Augustus de Morgan.
