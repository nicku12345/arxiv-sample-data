We illustrate Archimedes' method using models produced with 3D printers. This approach allowed us to create physical proofs of results known to Archimedes and illustrate ideas of a mathematician who is known both for his for his mechanical inventions as well as his breakthroughs in geometry and calculus. We use technology from the 21st century to trace intellectual achievements from the 3rd century BC. While we celebrate the 2300th birthday of Archimedes (287-212 BC) in 2013, we also live in an exciting time, where 3D printing is becoming popular and affordable.
