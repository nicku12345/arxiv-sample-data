In this article, we present a trick around Fibonacci numbers which can be found in several magic books. It consists in computing quickly the sum of the successive terms of a Fibonacci-like sequence. We give explanations and extensions of this trick to more general sequences. This study leads us to interesting connections between Fibonacci, Lucas sequences and Chebyshev polynomials.
