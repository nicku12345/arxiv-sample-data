We discuss some surprising phenomena from basic calculus related to oscillating functions and to the theorem on the differentiability of inverse functions. Among other things, we see that a continuously differentiable function with a strict minimum doesn't have to be decreasing to the left nor increasing to the right of the minimum, we present a function whose derivative is discontinuous at one point and has a strict minimum at this point (i.e. it oscillates only in one direction), we compare several definitions of inflection point, and we discuss a general version of the theorem on the derivative of inverse functions where continuity of the inverse function is assumed merely at one point.
