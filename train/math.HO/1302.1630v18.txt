The book is designed for a semester-long course in Foundations of Geometry and meant to be rigorous, conservative, elementary and minimalist.   List of topics:   Euclidean geometry: The Axioms / Half-planes / Congruent triangles / Perpendicular lines / Similar triangles / Parallel lines / Triangle geometry.   Inversive geometry: Inscribed angles / Inversion.   Non-Euclidean geometry: Neutral plane / Hyperbolic plane / Geometry of h-plane.   Additional topics: Affine geometry / Projective geometry / Spherical geometry / Projective model / Complex coordinates / Geometric constructions / Area.
