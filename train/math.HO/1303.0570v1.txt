Short information about the conference in 1960 in Jerusalem is presented together with an interesting photo where we can find several famous mathematicians participated in this conference. To recognize the people on the photo and collect their date of birth and death took me over five years. It was plan to have ready this note in 2010 on fifty years after conference. Unfortunately, this was not possible. Stil there are three persons which are not recognized. Maybe this publication will help to recognize them. In May 2012 I was trying to publish this article in Mathematical Intelligencer, but they would be willing to consider a longer, substantially revised, version. Also Notices AMS does not publish articles about conferences.
