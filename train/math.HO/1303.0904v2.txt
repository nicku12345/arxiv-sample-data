We answer the question: who first proved that C/d is a constant? We argue that Archimedes proved that the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is a constant independent of the circle and that the circumference constant equals the area constant (C/d=A/r^{2}). He stated neither result explicitly, but both are implied by his work. His proof required the addition of two axioms beyond those in Euclid's \emph{Elements}; this was the first step toward a rigorous theory of arc length. We also discuss how Archimedes's work coexisted with the 2000-year belief -- championed by scholars from Aristotle to Descartes -- that it is impossible to find the ratio of a curved line to a straight line.
