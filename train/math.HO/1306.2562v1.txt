We provide a theoretical framework for analysing and comparing different forms of organizing introductions to mathematical analysis at the secondary level, then illustrate it by two characteristic examples from certain periods of change in the 20th century, as they occurred in Denmark. We conclude by extracting from this a fundamental dilemma for the teaching of analysis at secondary level in view of the requirements and affordances provided by computer algebra systems on the one hand, and contemporary utilitarian school pedagogies on the other hand.
