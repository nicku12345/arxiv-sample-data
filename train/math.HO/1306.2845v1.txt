We present a lovely connection between the Fibonacci numbers and the sums of inverses of (0,1)- triangular matrices, namely, a number S is the sum of the entries of the inverse of an n \times n (n \geq 3) (0,1)- triangular matrix iff S is an integer between 2-F_{n-1} and 2+F_{n-1}. Corollaries include Fibonacci identities and a Fibonacci type result on determinants of family of (1,2)-matrices.
