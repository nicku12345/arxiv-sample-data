Robert de Montessus de Ballore proved in 1902 his famous theorem on the convergence of Pad\'e approximants of meromorphic functions. In this paper, we will first describe the genesis of the theorem, then investigate its circulation. A number of letters addressed to Robert de Montessus by different mathematicians will be quoted to help determining the scientific context and the steps that led to the result. In particular, excerpts of the correspondence with Henri Pad\'e in the years 1901-1902 played a leading role. The large number of authors who mentioned the theorem soon after its derivation, for instance N\"orlund and Perron among others, indicates a fast circulation due to factors that will be thoroughly explained.
