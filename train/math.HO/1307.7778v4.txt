This paper, based in part on joint work with Stanis{\l}aw Domoradzki, concerns Lucjan Emil B\"ottcher (1872-1937)-- a little-known Polish mathematician active in Lw\'ow. I outline B\"ottcher's scholarly path, focusing on his studies in Leipzig with Sophus Lie, his later academic career in Lw\'ow and the hindrances he faced in its advancement. I also describe very briefly his mathematical achievements. In view of later developments in holomorphic dynamics, I argue that, despite flaws in his work, B\"ottcher should be regarded not only as a contributor to the area but in fact as one of its founders.
