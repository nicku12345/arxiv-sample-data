In this primer, we will describe a number of projects that can be completed with a 3D printer, particularly by mathematics professors and their students. For many of the projects, we will utilize Mathematica to design objects that mathematicians may be interested in printing. Included in the projects that are described is a method to acquire data from an XBox Kinect.
