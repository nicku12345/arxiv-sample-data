Understanding learners' understanding is a key requirement for an efficient design of teaching situations and learning environments, be they digital or not. This keynote outlines the modeling framework cK\cent (conception, knowing, concept) created with the objective to respond to this requirement, with the additional ambition to build a bridge between research in mathematics education and research in educational technology. After an introduction of the rationale of cK\cent, some illustrations are presented. Then follow comments on cK\cent and learning. The conclusion evokes key research issues raised by the use of this modeling framework.
