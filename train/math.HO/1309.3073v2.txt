The classical platonist/formalist dilemma in philosophy of mathematics can be expressed in lay terms as a deceptively naive question: is new mathematics discovered or invented?   Using an example from my own mathematical life, I argue that there is also a third way: new mathematics can also be inherited -- and in the process briefly discuss a remarkable paper by W. Burnside of 1900.
