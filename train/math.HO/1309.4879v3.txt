Section 235 of Gauss' fundamental treatise "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae" establishes basic properties that compositions of binary quadratic forms must satisfy. Although this section is very technical, it contains truly important results. We review section 235 using a more invariant language and simplifying the arguments. We also make the statements slightly stronger by removing unnecessary assumptions.
