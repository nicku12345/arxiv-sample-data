We correct a 1957 combinatorial enumeration by the linguist J. Greenberg. The desired count, the Bell number B(25), supported using his Mass Comparison method for language classification. In 1987, he used this method to classify indigenous languages of the Americas into three families. Actually, the same combinatorics provides a back-of-the-envelope estimate for the number of families. This suggests that alternative classifications with over a hundred families possess the right order of magnitude.
