We detail the rules and mathematical structure of Al-Jabar, a game invented by the authors based on intuitive concepts of color-mixing and ideas from abstract algebra. Game-play consists of manipulating colored game pieces; we discuss how these colored pieces form a group structure and how this structure, along with an operation used to combine the pieces, is used to create a game of strategy. We also consider extensions of the game rules to other group structures.   Note: While this is an article for general readership originally published online by Gathering for Gardner in honor of Martin Gardner's birthday (Oct. 2011), Al-Jabar has been played in university abstract algebra courses as a teaching tool, as well as by game enthusiasts, since its release. Moreover, the algebraic game structure described has sparked further work by other mathematicians and game designers. Thus, we submit this article to the ArXiV as a resource for educators as well as those interested in mathematical games.
