Starting from a short review of the "classical" space problem in the sense of the 19th century (Helmholtz -- Lie -- Klein) it is discussed how the challenges posed by special and general relativity to the classical analysis were taken up by Hermann Weyl and Elie Cartan. Both mathematicians reconsidered the space problem from the point of view of transformations operating in the infinitesimal neighbourhoods of a manifold (spacetime). In a short outlook we survey further developments in mathematics and physics of the second half of the 20th century, in which core ideas of Weyl's and/or Cartan's analysis of the space problem were further investigated (mathematics) or incorporated into basic theories (physics).
