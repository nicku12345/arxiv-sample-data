Three versions of Luca Pacioli's 'De Dvina Proportione' remain: a manuscript held in Milan, another in Geneva and a printed version edited in Venice. A recent book, 'Antologia della Divina Proporzione', has all three in one volume, allowing an easy comparison of the different versions. The present paper proposes some observations about these drawings, generally said to be of Leonardo da Vinci's hand.
