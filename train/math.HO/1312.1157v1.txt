The Eisenstein integers form an alternative system of complex "whole numbers". In this note it is shown that the dimensions of the irreducible representions of SU(N) may be written in terms of such numbers.   This motet is dedicated to David R. Speiser who told me, once, that Mathematics must leave aside the guillemets.
