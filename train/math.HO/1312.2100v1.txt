The example of the calculus is used to explain how simple, practical math was made enormously complex by imposing on it the Western religiously-colored notion of mathematics as "perfect". We describe a pedagogical experiment to make math easy by teaching "calculus without limits" using the new realistic philosophy of zeroism, different from Platonic idealism or formalist metaphysics. Despite its demonstrated advantages, it is being resisted because of the existing colonial hangover.
