The unity of mathematics has its power to compactify experiences in a form capable of being transferred and modified or adapted to new mathematical situations. Yet, we believe that the phrase "Unity of Mathematics" expresses a dream, an ideal that doesn't exist. We shall point to diachronic and cross cultural disunities, to semantic, semiotic and philosophic ambiguities and to the non-acceptance of certain mathematical texts by some practitioners of the subject.
