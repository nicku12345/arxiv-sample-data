In this note, we present a compatibility test based on John Nash's game-theoretic notion of equilibrium strategy. The test must be taken separately by both partners, making it difficult for either partner alone to control the outcome. The mathematics behind the test including Nash's celebrated theorem and an example from the film, "A Beautiful Mind," are discussed as well as how to customize the test for more accurate results and how to modify the test to evaluate interpersonal relationships in other settings, not only romantic. To investigate the long-term dynamics of give and take in a relationship we introduce the "iterated dating dilemma" and apply the notion of "zero-determinant payoff strategy" introduced by Dyson and Press in 2012 for the iterated prisoner's dilemma.
