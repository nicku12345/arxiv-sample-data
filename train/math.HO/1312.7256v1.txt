The architecture has its basis in a dialectic search of new choices of representation. We deal with the form on the contemporary architecture under two approaches: expression and content. We examine how mathematical principles based on natural growth can be applied in architectural design in order to create a dynamic, rather than static, structure. The dynamic process of a cell and its growth provides the basic structure. We exemplify the impact of the new forms on the new society that already began.
