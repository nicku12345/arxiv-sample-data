Transcendental numbers play an important role in many areas of science. This paper contains a short survey on transcendental numbers and some relations among them. New inequalities for transcendental numbers are stated in Section 2 and proved in Section 4. Also, in relationship with these topics, we study the exponential function axioms related to the Yang-Baxter equation.
