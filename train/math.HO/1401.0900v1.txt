Classical tensors, the familiar mathematical objects denoted by symbols such as t_{i}, t^{ij} and t_{k}^{ij}, are usually interpreted either as 'coordinatizable objects' with coordinates changing in a specific way under a change of coordinate system or as elements of tensor spaces of the form V^{\otimes n}\otimes\left(V^{*}\right)^{\otimes m}. An alternative interpretation of classical tensors as linear tensor maps of the form V^{\otimes m}\rightarrow V^{\otimes n} is presented here. In this interpretation, tensor multiplication is seen as generalized function composition. Representations of classical tensors by means of arrays are also considered.
