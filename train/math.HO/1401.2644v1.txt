We discuss the main stages of development of the error calculation since the beginning of XIX-th century by insisting on what prefigures the use of Dirichlet forms and emphasizing the mathematical properties that make the use of Dirichlet forms more relevant and efficient. The purpose of the paper is mainly to clarify the concepts. We also indicate some possible future research.
