We give a purely mathematical interpretation and construction of sculptures rendered by one of the authors, known herein as Fels sculptures. We also show that the mathematical framework underlying Ferguson's sculpture, {\it The Ariadne Torus}, may be considered a special case of the more general constructions presented here. More general discussions are also presented about the creation of such sculptures whether they be virtual or in higher dimensional space.
