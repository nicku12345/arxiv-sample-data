Magic squares have been an enthralling topic in mathematics for centuries. They are formed by filling in all the cells of a square matrix with the numbers starting from one so that the sum of all rows, columns, and diagonals is the same. Magic squares have applications in entertainment, music and even cryptography. This paper focuses on a simple and easy method to construct doubly even magic squares.
