We analyze the main arguments that attempt to explain why there is no point in changing the envelope. Most people confuse estimation and calculation, conditional and unconditional probabilities, random and non-random variables, modelling and reality, chance and uncertainty (or credence), whatever X known and whatever X unknown, personal and interpersonal estimates. Such confusions suggest that there would be no point in swapping the envelope. Our analysis is that if the first envelope is opened, whatever the amount, it is rational and consistent to think that it is worth changing it. If the first envelope is not opened, it is rational and consistent to believe there is no point in swapping the envelope.
