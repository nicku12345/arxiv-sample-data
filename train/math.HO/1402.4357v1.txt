The h-index was introduced by the physicist J.E. Hirsch in 2005 as measure of a researcher's productivity. We consider the "combinatorial Fermi problem" of estimating h given the citation count. Using the Euler-Gauss identity for integer partitions, we compute confidence intervals. An asymptotic theorem about Durfee squares, due to E.R. Canfield-S. Corteel-C.D. Savage from 1998, is reinterpreted as the rule of thumb h=0.54 x (citations)^{1/2}. We compare these intervals and the rule of thumb to empirical data (primarily using mathematicians).
