This is a translation. I have added translations for (possibly) outdated definitions in an appendix at the end.   In this paper, we define distributive groups and show some properties of them. We then concern ourselves with the homogeinity of distributive groups, before showing how they can be generated from both associative and distributive groups. After that, we look at subgroups and define an index theorem for distributive groups before describing the structure of distributive groups. Finally, we present two addenda with several theorems that we proved while trying to prove that \left|(A.p).(A.q)\right|=\left|A\right|.
