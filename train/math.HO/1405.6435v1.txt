Infographics are a form of data visualization combining data, information, and statistics. Over the last ten years, infographics have become a popular method for displaying concise information, where infographics are a useful tool for classroom instruction. A high-quality infographic presents complex data in an aesthetically pleasing and simplistic format that allows student to understand more rapidly. Research within mathematics and climate science uses many elements of infographics. This work presents a series of electronic posters in an infographics style which explain hot topics in the mathematics of climate. These posters are designed to be used within standard undergraduate mathematical courses to provide students with concrete examples of how mathematics is incorporated within the climate sciences.
