On the 500th anniversary of Albrecht D\"urer's copperplate engraving Melencolia I, we invite readers to join in a time-honored "party game" that has attracted art historians and scientists for many years: guessing the nature and meaning of the composition's enigmatic stone polyhedron. Our main purpose is to demonstrate the usefulness of the cross ratio in the analysis of works in perspective. We show how the cross ratio works as a projectively invariant "shape parameter" of the polyhedron, and how it can be used in analyzing various theories of this figure.
