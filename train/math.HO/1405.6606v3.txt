These lectures were a part of the geometry course held during the Fall 2011 Mathematics Advanced Study Semesters (MASS) Program at Penn State (\url{http://www.math.psu.edu/mass/}).   The lectures are meant to be accessible to advanced undergraduate and early graduate students in mathematics. We have placed a great emphasis on clarity and exposition, and we have included many exercises. Hints and solutions for most of the exercises are provided in the end.   The lectures discuss piecewise distance preserving maps from a 2-dimensional polyhedral space into the plane. Roughly speaking, a polyhedral space is a space that is glued together out of triangles, for example the surface of a polyhedron. If one imagines such a polyhedral space as a paper model, then a piecewise distance preserving map into the plane is essentially a way to fold the model so that it lays flat on a table.   We only consider the 2-dimensional case to keep things easy to visualize. However, most of the results admit generalizations to higher dimensions. These results are discussed in the Final Remarks, where proper credit and references are given.
