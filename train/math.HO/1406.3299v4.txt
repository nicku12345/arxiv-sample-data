In this note, we shall give a brief survey of the results that are found in Ramanujan's Lost Notebook related to cranks. Recent work by B. C. Berndt, H. H. Chan, S. H. Chan and W. -C. Liaw have shown conclusively that cranks was the last mathematical object that Ramanujan studied. We shall closely follow the work of Berndt, Chan, Chan and Liaw and give a brief description of their work.
