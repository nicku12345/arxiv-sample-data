Given a dollar, how many ways are there to make change using pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters? What if you are given a different amount of money? What if you use different coin denominations? This is a well known problem and formulas are known. We present simpler proofs in several cases. We use recurrences to derive formulas if the coin denominations are {1,x,kx,rx}, and we use a simple proof using generating functions to derive a formula for any coin set.
