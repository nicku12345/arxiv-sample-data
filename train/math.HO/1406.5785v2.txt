In some of his final papers, V.I. Arnold studied pseudorandomness properties of finite deterministic sequences, which he measured in terms of their "stochasticity parameter". In the present paper we illustrate the background in probability theory and number theory of some of his considerations, and give answers to some of the questions raised in his papers.
