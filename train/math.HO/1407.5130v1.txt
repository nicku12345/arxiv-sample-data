This material is a rewriting and expansion of notes for beginning graduate students in seminars in combinatorics (Department of Mathematics, University of California San Diego). Solid skills in linear and multilinear algebra were required for these seminars. We focused on a review of linear algebra and a careful development of the general matrix canonical forms as a training ground for the necessary proof and notational skills.
