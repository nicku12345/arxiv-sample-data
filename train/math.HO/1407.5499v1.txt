This article is intended as a kind of precursor to the document Geometry for Post-primary School Mathematics, part of the Mathematics Syllabus for Junior Certicate issued by the Irish National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in the context of Project Maths.   Our purpose is to place that document in the context of an overview of plane geometry, touching on several important pedagogical and historical aspects, in the hope that this will prove useful for teachers.
