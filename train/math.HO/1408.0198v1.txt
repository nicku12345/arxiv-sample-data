The purpose of this short paper is to describe a project to manufacture a 3D-print of the big letters in the logo for JDRF (formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). The methods described in this paper involve processing the image of the logo through a Mathematica script, and the methods can be applied to most logos and other images that are sparse in the sense of not having many edges within the image. With the Mathematica script, a STereoLithography (.stl) file is created that can be used by a 3D printer. Finally, the object is created on a 3D printer. We assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of 3D printing.
