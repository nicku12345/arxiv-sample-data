This is the last of a trilogy of papers on triangle centers. A fairly obscure "conformal center of gravity" is computed for the class of all isosceles triangles. This calculation appears to be new. A byproduct is the logarithmic capacity or transfinite diameter of such, yielding results consistent with Haegi (1951).
