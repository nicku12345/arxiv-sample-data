Fluid-solid reactions exist in many chemical and metallurgical process industries. Several models describe these reactions such as volume reaction model, grain model, random pore model and nucleation model. These models give two nonlinear coupled partial differential equations (CPDE) that must be solved numerically. A new approximate solution technique (quantized method) has been introduced for some of these models in recent years. In this work, the various fluid-solid reaction models with their quantized and numerical solutions have been discussed.
