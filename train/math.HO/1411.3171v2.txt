This note is purely expository and is in Russian. We show how to prove interesting combinatorial results using the local Lovasz lemma. The note is accessible for students having basic knowledge of combinatorics; the notion of independence is defined and the Lovasz lemma is stated and proved. Our exposition follows `Probabilistic methods' of N. Alon and J. Spencer. The main difference is that we show how the proof could have been invented. The material is presented as a sequence of problems, which is peculiar not only to Zen monasteries but also to advanced mathematical education; most problems are presented with hints or solutions.
