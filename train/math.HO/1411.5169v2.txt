In 2001-2002, I happened to have proposed a new definite integral in the American Mthematical Monthly (AMM),which later came to be known in my name (Ahmed). In the meantime, this integral has been mentioned in mathematical encyclopedias and dictionaries and further it has also been cited and discussed in several books and journals. In particular, a google search with the key word "Ahmed's Integral" throws up more than 60 listings. Here I present the maiden solution for this integral.
