This study investigated the use of concept maps on advancing students conceptual understanding of the Euler Circuit concept. The participants were students at the college of Humanities and Social Sciences with a background in Art. A pre-treatment test was given to students during the eleventh week of the semester, while a post-treatment test was given during the fourteenth week. The study reports the findings from the responses of eighty three participants who took both the pre- and post-treatment test. The results of this study indicated that students, after using concept maps, had a richer conceptual understanding of the Euler circuit concept and were capable of constructing more representations of this concept.
