In the year 2000, Ahmed proposed a family of integrals in the American Mathematical Monthly which invoked a considerable response then. Here I would like to present another solution to this family of integrals. I propose to call this as Ahmed's Integral (II) in the light of the well known Ahmed's Integral.
