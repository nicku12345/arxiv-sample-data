The purpose of this manuscript is to gather together a large amount of source material pertaining to women in mathematics, from studies of girls in elementary school through data on females winning prizes for mathematical research. Along the way, we have also gathered a large amount of material from the psychology and sociology literature on implicit biases more generally, particularly pertaining to gender. This source material was then used to support the writing of the article "Addressing the underrepresentation of women in mathematics conferences". We have referred to primary research literature whenever possible, although we have also included well-written blog posts, organizational web sites, self-published articles by research organizations, and even a YouTube video. Each bibliography entry is accompanied by some remarks summarizing its content and representative quotes from the articles themselves. Much of the work in this bibliography contains a large number of further references to the relevant research literature.
