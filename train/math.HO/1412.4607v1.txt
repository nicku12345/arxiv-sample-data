We are interested in the "Journal de Math\'ematiques Pures et Appliqu\'ees" (JMPA) over the period 1917-1937. From the end of 1921, two mathematicians worked to its publication, Henri Villat as editor in chief and Robert Montessus Ballore as associate editor. Through unpublished letters, we descrive the operation of the JMPA.
