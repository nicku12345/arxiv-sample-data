In July 2012 the General Assembly of the United Nations resolved that 2014 should be the International Year of Crystallography, 100 years since the award of the Nobel Prize for the discovery of X-ray diffraction by crystals. On this special occasion, we address several topics in mathematical crystallography. Especially motivated by the recent development in systematic design of crystal structures by both mathematicians and crystallographers, we discuss interesting relationships among seemingly irrelevant subjects; say, standard crystal models, tight frames in the Euclidean space, rational points on Grassmannian, and quadratic Diophantine equations. Thus our view is quite a bit different from the traditional one in mathematical crystallography.   The central object in this article is what we call crystallographic tight frames, which are, in a loose sense, considered a generalization of root systems. We shall also pass a remark on the connections with tropical geometry, a relatively new area in mathematics, specifically with combinatorial analogues of Abel-Jacobi map and Abel's theorem.
