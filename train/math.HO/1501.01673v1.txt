This article seeks to encourage a mathematical dialog regarding a possible solution to Beals Conjecture. It breaks down one of the worlds most difficult math problems into laymans terms and encourages people to question some of the most fundamental rules of mathematics. More specifically; it reinforces basic algebra/critical thinking skills, makes use of properties attributed to the number one and reanalyzes the definition of a positive integer in order to provide a potential counterexample to Beals Conjecture.
