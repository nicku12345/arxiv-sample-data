In this work, we established symmetric representation of numbers where one can use any of 9 digits giving the same number. The representations of natural numbers from 0 to 1000 are given using only single digit in all the nine cases, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. This is done only using basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, potentiation and division.
