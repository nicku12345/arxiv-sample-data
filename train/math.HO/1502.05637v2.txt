Attempting to create a general framework for studying new results on transcendental numbers, this paper begins with a survey on transcendental numbers and transcendence, it then presents several properties of the transcendental numbers e and \pi, and then it gives the proofs of new inequalities and identities for transcendental numbers. Also, in relationship with these topics, we study some implications for the theory of the Yang-Baxter equations, and we propose some open problems.
