We consider a definition of mathematics as the art of thinking in terms of formalized systems, and the science of relations, structures and algorithms. We also touch upon the relation of mathematics to other sciences, in particular through modelling and scientific computing. We discuss mathematics as a martial art and a key to paradigm changes.
