Pulli kolam is a ubiquitous art form in south India. It involves drawing a line looped around a collection of dots (pullis) place on a plane such that three mandatory rules are followed: all line orbits should be closed, all dots are encircled and no two lines can overlap over a finite length. The mathematical foundation for this art form has attracted attention over the years. In this work, we propose a simple 5-step topological method by which one can systematically draw all possible kolams for any number of dots N arranged in any spatial configuration on a surface.
