The situation surrounding the Olympiads is paradoxical. On the one hand, considerable resources are spent on the Olympiads. On the other hand, there are widespread arguments about the harm of the Olympiads, often very strange ones. For example, there is a perception that success in the Olympiads has little to do with a scientific career. Sometimes it comes to curious assertions, such as that "there are no Olympiad winners among the eminent mathematical researchers," even though in truth the percentage of famous mathematicians among former Olympiad winners is much greater than among those who did not participate in such competitions
