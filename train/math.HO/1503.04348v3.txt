We present a detailed and elementary construction of the real numbers from the rational numbers a la Bourbaki. The real numbers are defined to be the set of all minimal Cauchy filters in \mathbb{Q} (where the Cauchy condition is defined in terms of the absolute value function on \mathbb{Q}) and are proven directly, without employing any of the techniques of uniform spaces, to form a complete ordered field. The construction can be seen as a variant of Bachmann's construction by means of nested rational intervals, allowing for a canonical choice of representatives.
