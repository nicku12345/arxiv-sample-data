A translation of Emmy Noether's paper "Der Endlichkeitsatz der Invarianten endlicher Gruppen" (Mathematische Annalen, vol. 77, 1920, pages 89--92). In Noether's words, the paper gives "an entirely elementary finiteness proof---using only the theory of symmetric functions---for the invariants of a finite group, which at once supplies an actual statement of a complete system of invariants while the usual proof using the Hilbert basis theorem is only an existence proof."
