An overview on several mathematics modules in the transition period of introducing a new curriculum for the Foundation programme in Engineering at the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus is discussed in this paper. In order to progress to Undergraduate programmes in Engineering, previously the students must complete three mathematics modules of 40 credit points in total, for which one of them was a year-long module with 20 credit points. Currently under the new curriculum, the students are required to complete five mathematics modules with 10 credit points each. The new curriculum gives positive impacts for both the lecturers and the students in terms of material organization, fully utilizing textbooks and a new arrangement for tutorial sessions. The new curriculum also provides the students with stronger mathematical background in critical thinking and problem solving skills to equip them to embark the Undergraduate programmes in Engineering.
