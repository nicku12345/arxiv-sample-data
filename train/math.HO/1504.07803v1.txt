This article discusses an experience of teaching Calculus classes for the freshmen students enrolled at Sungkyunkwan University, one of the private universities in South Korea. The teaching and learning approach is a balance combination between the teacher-oriented traditional style of lecturing and other activities that encourage students for active learning and classroom participation. Based on the initial observation during several semesters, some anecdotal evidences show that students' learning is improved after implementing this student-oriented active learning approach, albeit a longer period of time is definitely needed to transform general students' attitude from passive learners to active ones.
