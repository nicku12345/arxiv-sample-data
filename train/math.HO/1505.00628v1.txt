In this note we find the orthogonal matrices R,S\in M_3(\mathbb{R}) corresponding to the clockwise rotation r in \mathbb{R}^3 around the axis generated by a unit vector u=(a,b,c)^t through an angle \alpha\in [0,2\pi), and to the symmetry s in \mathbb{R}^3 on the plane perpendicular to u. Matrix S depends on a,b,c and matrix R depends on a,b,c, \cos \alpha and \sin \alpha. We show SR=RS. The matrix R is due to Alperin.
