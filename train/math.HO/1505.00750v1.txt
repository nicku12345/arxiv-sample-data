The first 2x2x2 twisty cube was created as a demonstration tool by Erno Rubik in 1974 to help his students understand the complexity of space and the movements in 3D. He fabricated a novel 3x3x3 mechanism where the 26 cubies were turning, and twisting independently, without falling apart. The cube was dressed in sophisticated colors which made it a unique puzzle. Even without instruction is the aim of the game was self-explanatory. Its educational value in VSI (Visual-Spatial Intelligence), developing strategy, memorization and logistics, improve concentration and persistence in problem solving is high in every age group. A logical puzzle has outreach far beyond. Those aspects are briefly covered in this article.
