Leonhard Euler was working for the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences (Russia) and Prussian Academy of Sciences during various periods of his life. It is not a popular knowledge about Euler's contacts with Polish scientists of his era and Poland in general. The aim of this work is to shed some light on this relationship--mainly with the researchers from the city of Gda\'nsk (formerly Danzig). As a matter of fact, the famous K\"onigsberg Bridges Problem, arguably the beginning of the graph theory and topology, originated in Gda\'nsk.
