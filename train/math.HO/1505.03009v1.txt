Here we present the transcription of the handwritten notes, carefully taken by an anonymous student, of the last lecture course taught by Guido Castelnuovo in 1922-23. The title of the course is "Curve algebriche piane e sghembe" ("Plane and space algebraic curves"): indeed, the language of both the original text and our brief introduction is Italian. The manuscript belongs to the legacy of Alfredo Franchetta (1916-2011) and the typesetting is due to Natascia Zangani. This edition is our modest contribution to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Guido Castelnuovo (1865-1952).
