The purpose of this short paper is to describe a project to manufacture a 3D-print of a pendant that includes a logo. The methods described in this paper involve processing the image of the logo through a Mathematica script. These methods can be applied to many logos and other images. With the Mathematica script, a STereoLithography (.stl) file is created that can be used by a 3D printer. Finally, the object is created on a 3D printer. We assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of 3D printing.
