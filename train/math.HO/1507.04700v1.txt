I have developed a pedagogy and textbook for teaching logic centered on what I call "logical worldviews". A logical worldview examines the close connection between philosophical commitments and the logical principles and method for a particular historial logical system. The class examines multiple historical logical worldviews to show how philosophical positions have over time yielded corresponding changes in the development of logic. Such an approach has great benefits to teaching logic to undergraduates.
