Fracterms are introduced as a proxy for fractions. A precise definition of fracterms is formulated and on that basis reasonably precise definitions of various classes of fracterms are given. In the context of the meadow of rational numbers viewing fractions as fracterms provides an adequate theory of fractions. A very different view on fractions is that fractions are values, i.e. rational numbers. Fracterms are used to provide a range of intermediate definitions between these two definitions of fractions
