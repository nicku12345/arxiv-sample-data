This short note is the result of a French "Hippocampe internship" that aims at introducing the world of research to young undergraduate French students. The problem studied is the following: imagine yourself locked in a cage barred with n different locks. You are given a keyring with N \geq n keys containing the n keys that open the locks. In average, how many trials are required to open all locks and get out? The article studies 3 different strategies and compare them. Implementation of the strategies are also proposed as illustrations of the theoretical results.
