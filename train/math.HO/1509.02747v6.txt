These notes aim to give a gentle account to one approach to the theory of finite sets without making use of the natural numbers. They were written to be used as the basis for a student seminar. There are no real prerequisites except for a certain familiarity with the kind of mathematics seen in the first couple of years of a university mathematics course. The definition of being finite employed in these notes is usually called Kuratowski-finiteness and it is essentially that employed by Whitehead and Russell in Principia Mathematica.   This is a revised and extended version of a paper with the same title from November 2015
