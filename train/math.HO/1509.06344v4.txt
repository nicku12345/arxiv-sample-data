We present and discuss several old and new methods for mapping a circular disc to a square. In particular, we present analytical expressions for mapping each point (u,v) inside the circular disc to a point (x,y) inside a square region. Ideally, we want the mapping to be smooth and invertible. In addition, we put emphasis on mappings with desirable properties. These include conformal, equiareal, and radially-constrained mappings. Finally, we present applications to logo design, panoramic photography, and hyperbolic art.
