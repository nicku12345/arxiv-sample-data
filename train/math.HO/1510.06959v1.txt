In his treatise addressed to Dositheus of Pelusium, Archimedes of Syracuse obtained the result of which he was the most proud: a sphere has two-thirds the volume of its circumscribing cylinder. At his request a sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on his tomb near Syracuse. Usually, it is admitted that to find this formula, Archimedes used a half polygon inscribed in a semicircle; then he performed rotations of these two figures to obtain a set of trunks in a sphere. This set of trunks allowed him to determine the volume. In our opinion, Archimedes was so clever that he found the proof with shorter demonstration. Archimedes did not need to know \pi to prove the result and the Pythagorean theorem was probably the key to the proof.
