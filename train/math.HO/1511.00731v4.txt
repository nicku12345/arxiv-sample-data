A triangulation of a surface with fixed topological type is called irreducible if no edge can be contracted to a vertex while remaining in the category of simplicial complexes and preserving the topology of the surface. A complete list of combinatorial structures of irreducible triangulations is made by hand for the once-punctured torus, consisting of exactly 297 non-isomorphic triangulations.
