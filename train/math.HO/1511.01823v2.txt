It is well known that \sum_{p\le n} 1/p =\ln(\ln(n)) + O(1) where p goes over the primes. We give several known proofs of this.   We first present a a proof that \ge \ln(\ln(n)) + O(1). This is based on Euler's proof that \sum_p 1/p diverges. We then present three proofs that \sum_{p\le n} 1/p \le \ln(\ln(n)) + O(1) The first one, due to Mertens, does not use the prime number theorem. The second and third one do use the prime number theorem and hence are shorter.
