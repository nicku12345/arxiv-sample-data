In this study, we continue to present profiles of some distinguished graduates in mathematics of the Jagiellonian University from the years 1918-1939. We discuss their professional paths and scholarly achievements, instances of scientific collaboration, connections with other academic centers in Poland and worldwide, involvement in mathematical education and teacher training, as well as their later roles in Polish scientific and academic life. We also try to understand in what way they were shaped by their studies and how much of Krak\'ow scientific traditions they continued. We find strong support for the claim that there was a distinct, diverse and deep mathematical stream in Krak\'ow between the wars, rooted in classical disciplines like differential equations and geometry, but also open to new trends in mathematics. Part II concerns people who graduated after the university reform, getting the newly introduced master's degree in mathematics, in 1928-39.
