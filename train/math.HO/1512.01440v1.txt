A three-polar, cf. T. Gregor, J. Halu\v{s}ka, Lexicographical ordering and field operations in the complex plane. Stud. Mat. 41(2014), 123--133., HSV-RGB Colour space \triangle was introduced and studied. It was equipped with operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and (partially) division. Achromatic Grey Hues form an ideal \mathfrak{S}. Factorizing \triangle by the ideal \mathfrak{S}, we obtain a field \triangle | \mathfrak{S}. An element (i.e an individual Colour) in \triangle | \mathfrak{S} is a triplet of three triangular coefficients. The set of all triangular coefficients is a subset of a semi-field of parabolic-complex functions. For the parabolic-complex number set, cf.~A. A. Harkin--J. B. Harkin, Geometry of general complex numbers. Mathematics magazine, 77(2004), 118--129.
