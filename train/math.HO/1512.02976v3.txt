We will verify that the fair copy "Ueber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Gr\"osse" found in Riemann's Nachlass is not in Riemann's hand. Further, we will show that this paper was written by Alfred Clebsch and that it was used after Clebsch's death with high probability as a setting copy for chapter VII of Riemann's Collected Works published in 1876.
