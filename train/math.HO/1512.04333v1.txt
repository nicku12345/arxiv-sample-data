Dice odds in the board game RISK were first investigated by Tan, fixed by Osbourne, and extended by Blatt. We generalized dice odds further, varying the number of sides and the number of dice used in a single battle. We show that the attacker needs two more than 86% of the defending armies to have an over 50% chance to conquer an enemy territory. By normal approximation, we show that the conquer odds transition rapidly from low chance to high chance of conquering around the 86%+2 threshold.
