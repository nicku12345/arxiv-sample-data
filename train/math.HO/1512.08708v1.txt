The inverse problem of Galois Theory was developed in the early 1800 s as an approach to understand polynomials and their roots. The inverse Galois problem states whether any finite group can be realized as a Galois group over Q (field of rational numbers). There has been considerable progress in this as yet unsolved problem. Here, we shall discuss some of the most significant results on this problem. This paper also presents a nice variety of significant methods in connection with the problem such as the Hilbert irreducibility theorem, Noether s problem, and rigidity method and so on.
