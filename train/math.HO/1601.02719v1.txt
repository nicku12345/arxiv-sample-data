We know that a continuous function on a closed interval satisfies the Intermediate Value Property. Likewise, the derivative function of a differentiable function on a closed interval satisfies the IVP property which is known as the Darboux theorem in any real analysis course. Most of the proofs found in the literature use the Extreme Value Property of a continuous function. In this paper, I am going to present a simple and elegant proof of the Darboux theorem using the Intermediate Value Theorem and the Rolles theorem
