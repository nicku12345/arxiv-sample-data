In the first article in the series examining mathematics on coins, we discuss two great scientists who are not only featured on many coins, but also contributed to both theory and practice of coinage. The first one is Nicolaus Copernicus, author of the treaty \emph{Monetae cudendae ratio} in which he proposed the law governing competition between money and proposed reform of coinage in the Royal Prussia. The second one is Sir Isaac Newton, warden and Master of the Royal Mint, and overseer of the Great Recoinage of 1696.
