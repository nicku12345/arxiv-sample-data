These pedagogical lecture notes address to the students in theoretical physics for helping them to understand the mechanisms of the linear operators defined on finite-dimensional vector spaces equipped with definite or indefinite inner products. The importance of the Dirac conjugation is pointed out presenting its general theory and a version of the Riesz theorem for the indefinite inner product spaces, based on the Dirac-Riesz map that combines the action of the Riesz map with that of the metric operator. The matrix representations of the linear operators on vector spaces with definite or indefinite inner products is also presented.
