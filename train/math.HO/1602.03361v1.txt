Papert's (1980) work with Turtle Geometry offered an early and provocative vision of how digital technologies could be used with young learners. Since then, research on digital technology use has focused on the middle and high school levels. Given the increasing diversity of digital technologies, and their varied underlying pedagogical goals and design choices, Clements' (2002) claim that there is no single effect of the computer on mathematics achievement is as true now as it was a decade ago. However, many advances have been made in better articulating the range of design choices that are possible, their potential effect on the cognitive and affective dimensions on mathematics learning, and their varying demands on the teacher. The aim of this chapter is to summarise the research literature on the use of digital technologies in the teaching and learning of mathematics at the k-2 level. In particular, we focus on literature that contributes to our understanding of how the use of digital technologies affects and changes the teaching and learning of mathematics - that is, how different affordances and design choices impact on the way teachers and learners interact and express themselves mathematically. By digital technologies we refer to a range of tools including multi-purpose computer-based software programs, web-based applets, virtual manipulatives, programming languages, CD-ROMs, games, calculators, touchscreen applications and interactive whiteboards. The distinction between these various types is not always evident and, indeed, one goal of this chapter is to provide useful distinguishing features of these various technologies in order to help educators better evaluate and choose amongst them.
