The aim of this paper is to present a didactical sequence that fosters the development of meanings related to fractions, conceived as numbers that can be placed on the number line. The sequence was carried out in various elementary school classes, containing students certified to have mathematical learning disabilities (MLD). Thus, our didactical aim is to make accessible meaning related to fractions to all students of the class, including MLD students, by means of a common didactical sequence, that is, a sequence proposed to the entire class. Our research is based on a range of different perspectives, from mathematics education to neuroscience and cognitive psychology. We discuss how such perspectives can be combined and provide the theoretical bases to design an outline of the didactical sequence, which allows us to implement and strengthen inclusive education.
