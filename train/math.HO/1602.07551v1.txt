My purpose is to examine some concepts of mathematical logic, which have been studied by Carlo Cellucci. Today the aim of classical mathematical logic is not to guarantee the certainty of mathematics, but I will argue that logic can help us to explain mathematical activity; the point is to discuss what and in which sense logic can "explain". For example, let's consider the basic concept of an axiomatic system: an axiomatic system can be very useful to organize, to present, and to clarify mathematical knowledge. And, more importantly, logic is a science with its own results: so, axiomatic systems are interesting also because we know several revealing theorems about them. Similarly, I will discuss other topics such as mathematical definitions, and some relationships between mathematical logic and computer science. I will also consider these subjects from an educational point of view: can logical concepts be useful in teaching and learning elementary mathematics?
