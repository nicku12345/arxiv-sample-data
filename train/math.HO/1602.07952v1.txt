The celebration of the Centennial of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction offered the occasion to look back at the history of ICMI and outline the evolution of mathematics education until it achieved its present status as an academic discipline. The years after WWII up to the late 1960s were crucial in this evolution for both the settlement of some institutional aspects, mainly concerning the relationship with mathematicians, and the establishment of new trends of the activities. In this paper we outline, on the basis of unpublished documents, the role of two important figures in those years: Heinrich Behnke and Hans Freudenthal.
