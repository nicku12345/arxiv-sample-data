Using the standard Coxeter presentation for the symmetric group S_n, two reduced expressions for the same group element are said to be commutation equivalent if we can obtain one expression from the other by applying a finite sequence of commutations. The resulting equivalence classes of reduced expressions are called commutation classes. How many commutation classes are there for the longest element in S_n?
