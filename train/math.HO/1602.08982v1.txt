At the beginning of the 900s Guido Castelnuovo turned his attention toward methodological, didactical, historical and applicative issues. He was an active member of the ICMI (International Commission on Mathematical Instruction) and of the Mathesis, an Italian association of mathematics teachers. He also was the author of the mathematics curricula for the new Modern Lycee and he taught the first University courses devoted to preservice training of mathematics teachers. His course on Precision and Application Mathematics, inspired by Felix Klein, shows Castelnuovo's point of view on mathematics and presents a higher point of view on the programmes of the Modern Lycee.
