We report on a workshop for grade eleven high school students, which took place in the framework of a university open day. During the workshop the participants first discovered the key properties of the intuitive concept of distance from real life examples. After this preparation, the formal definition of a metric space was introduced and discussed in small groups by means of problem-oriented exercise sessions.
