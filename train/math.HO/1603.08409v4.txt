Sphericons and D-forms are 3D objects created and described by artists, which have separately received attention in the mathematical literature in the last 15 or so years. The attempt to classify a seamed, crocheted form geometrically led to the observation, which appears not to have been previously made explicit, that these objects are related. General results concerning (N,k)-icons and seam-, D- and pita-forms are given. Instructions to crochet D-forms are given in the Appendix.
