This is a companion to a paper by the authors entitled "G\"odel's natural deduction", which presented and made comments about the natural deduction system in G\"odel's unpublished notes for the elementary logic course he gave at the University of Notre Dame in 1939. In that earlier paper, which was itself a companion to a paper that examined the links between some philosophical views ascribed to G\"odel and general proof theory, one can find a brief summary of G\"odel's notes for the Notre Dame course. In order to put the earlier paper in proper perspective, a more complete summary of these interesting notes, with comments concerning them, is given here.
