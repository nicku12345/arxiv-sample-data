This is an examination, a commentary, of links between some philosophical views ascribed to G\"odel and general proof theory. In these views deduction is of central concern not only in predicate logic, but in set theory too, understood from an infinitistic ideal perspective. It is inquired whether this centrality of deduction could also be kept in the intensional logic of concepts whose building G\"odel seems to have taken as the main task of logic for the future.
