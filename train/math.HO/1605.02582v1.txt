In this paper, we analyze processes of conjecture generation in the context of open problems proposed in a dynamic geometry environment, when a particular dragging modality, maintaining dragging, is used. This involves dragging points while maintaining certain properties, controlling the movement of the figures. Our results suggest that the pragmatic need of physically controlling the simultaneous movements of the different parts of figures can foster the production of two chains of successive properties, hinged together by an invariant that we will call pivot invariant. Moreover, we show how the production of these chains is tied to the production of conjectures and to the processes of argumentation through which they are generated.
