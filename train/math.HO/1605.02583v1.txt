In this paper we propose a hypothesis about how different uses of maintaining dragging, either as a physical tool in a dynamic geometry environment or as a psychological tool for generating conjectures can influence subsequent processes of proving. Through two examples we support the hypothesis that using maintaining dragging as a physical tool may foster cognitive rupture between the conjecturing phase and the proof, while using it as a psychological tool may foster cognitive unity between them.
