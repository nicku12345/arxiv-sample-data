As many will agree, it feels good to complement a cup of tea by a donut or two. This sweet relationship is also a guiding principle of non-commutative geometry known as Serre Theorem. We explain the algebra behind this theorem and prove that elliptic curves are complementary to the so-called non-commutative tori.
