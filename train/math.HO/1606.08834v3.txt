We describe a case study of a problem-solving section, using the "Harkness" discussion method, of an honors multivariable calculus course. Students in the problem-solving section had equivalent outcomes on exams, reported higher ratings in self-assessments of skills, and took more math classes in the following year, compared to students in the lecture-based sections.
