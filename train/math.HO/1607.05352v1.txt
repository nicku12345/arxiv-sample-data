In 1866, Charles Ludwidge Dodgson published a paper concerning a method for evaluating determinants called the condensation method. His paper documented a new method to calculate determinants that was based on Jacobi's Theorem. The condensation method is presented and proven here, and is demonstrated by a series of examples. The condensation method can be applied to a number of situations, including calculating eigenvalues, solving a system of linear equations, and even determining the different energy levels of a molecular system. The method is much more efficient than cofactor expansions, particularly for large matrices; for a 5 x 5 matrix, the condensation method requires about half as many calculations. Zeros appearing in the interior of a matrix can cause problems, but a way around the issue can usually be found. Overall, Dodgson's condensation method is an interesting and simple way to find determinants. This paper presents an elementary proof of Dodgson's method.
