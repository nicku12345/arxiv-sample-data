We describe an algebraic proof of the well-known topological fact that \pi_1(SO(n)) \cong Z/2Z. The fundamental group of SO(n) appears in our approach as the center of a certain finite group defined by generators and relations. The latter is a factor group of the braid group B_n, obtained by imposing one additional relation and turns out to be a nontrivial central extension by Z/2Z of the corresponding group of rotational symmetries of the hyperoctahedron in dimension n.
