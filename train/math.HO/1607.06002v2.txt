The close relationship among the polynomial functions and Fibonacci numerical sequences is shown in this paper. These numerical sequences are defined by the recurrence equation x_{k + n} = \displaystyle\sum_{j = 0}^{n-1}\alpha_j x_{k + j}, where n is the polynomial degree and \alpha's, the polynomial coefficients. The arithmetic trapezoid resulting from the recurrence equations is also shown. This trapezoid is nothing but a generalization of Pascal's Triangle. Trapezoid is a convenient name because the form it appears does not have the `upper end` of a usual triangle. This study shows that each polynomial generates infinite sequences, and that each sequence generates only a single arithmetic trapezoid.
