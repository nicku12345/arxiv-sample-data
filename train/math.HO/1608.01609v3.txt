Peg solitaire is an old puzzle with a 300 year history. We consider two ways a computer can be utilized to find interesting peg solitaire puzzles. It is common for a peg solitaire puzzle to begin from a symmetric board position, we have computed solvable symmetric board positions for four board shapes. A new idea is to search for board positions which have a unique starting jump leading to a solution. We show many challenging puzzles uncovered by this search technique. Clever solvers can take advantage of the uniqueness property to help solve these puzzles.
