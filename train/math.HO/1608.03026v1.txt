A visual type theory is a cognitive tool that has much in common with language, and may be regarded as an exceptional form of spatial text adjunct. A mathematical visual type theory, called NPM, has been under development that can be viewed as an early-stage project in mathematical knowledge management and mathematical user interface development. We discuss in greater detail the notion of a visual type theory, report on progress towards a usable mathematical visual type theory, and discuss the outlook for future work on this project.
