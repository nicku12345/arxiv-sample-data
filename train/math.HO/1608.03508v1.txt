A catalogue of African Doctorates in Mathematics has been compiled and published in 2007 by the late Professor Paulus Gerdes. In this paper, we revise and update the list of mathematicians from Burkina-Faso. Starting from a short description of Burkina-Faso, we brieffly mention the education system and the mathematics programme in Burkina-Faso from the pre-school level to university level. A list of mathematicians native of Burkina Faso is given.
