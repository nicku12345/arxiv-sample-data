During his life Weyl approached the problem of space (PoS) from various sides. Two aspects stand out as permanent features of his different approaches: the {\em unique determination of an affine connection} (i.e., without torsion in the terminology of Cartan) and the question {\em which type of group} characterizes physical space. The first feature came up in 1919 (commentaries to Riemann's inaugural lecture) and played a crucial role in Weyl's work on the PoS in the early 1920s. He defended the central role of affine connections even in the light of Cartan's more general framework of connections with torsion. In later years, after the rise of the Dirac field, it could have become problematic, but Weyl saw the challenge posed to Einstein gravity by spin coupling primarily in the possibility to allow for non-metric affine connections. Only after Weyl's death Cartan's approach to infinitesimal homogeneity and torsion became revitalized in gravity theories.
