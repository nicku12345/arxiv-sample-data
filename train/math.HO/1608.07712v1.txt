In a previous paper we defined the circumconic of a triangle ABC with respect to a point P as the conic \tilde C=T_{P'}^{-1}(N_{P'}), where N_{P'} is the 9-point conic for the quadrangle ABCP' with respect to the line at infinity, P' is the isotomic conjugate of P with respect to ABC, and T_{P'} is the affine map taking ABC to the cevian triangle for P'. In this paper we determine the locus of points for which a certain affine map \textsf{M} taking the circumconic \tilde C to the inconic \mathcal{I}, defined to be the unique conic tangent to the sides of ABC at the traces of the point P on those sides, is a half-turn. This locus turns out to be an elliptic curve minus six points, which can be constructed geometrically using a family of affine maps defined for points on three open arcs of a circle.
