We describe some motivations lurking behind the making of a Math exhibition. In particular, we refer to MadeInMath and its two set-ups in Triennale di Milano and Museo della Scienza in Trento (MUSE), where the life and works of Italian mathematicians played an important role, like Guido Castelnuovo, Federigo Enriques and Vito Volterra.
