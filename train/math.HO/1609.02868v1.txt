The present text is a collection of notes about differential geometry prepared to some extent as part of tutorials about topics and applications related to tensor calculus. They can be regarded as continuation to the previous notes on tensor calculus as they are based on the materials and conventions given in those documents. They can be used as a reference for a first course on the subject or as part of a course on tensor calculus.
