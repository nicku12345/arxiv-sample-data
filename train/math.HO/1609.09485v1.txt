In the article "The Tale of Two Queens and Two Towering Figures" published in CNJ in 2012 (CNJ vol. 57 No. 5, pp. 304-315), we discussed the contributions of Copernicus and Newton to coin minting and monetary reforms, as well as the commemoration of their achievements on contemporary coins. In the current article we will examine more explicit aspects of the relationship between mathematical sciences and numismatics, namely the presence of mathematical formulae on coins. We will survey examples of coins depicting mathematical formulae, ranging from some universally recognizable ones to more advanced symbolic expressions which are known only to specialists.
