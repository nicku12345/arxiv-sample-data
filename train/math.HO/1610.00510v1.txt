The circumcircle of a planar convex polygon P is a circle C that passes through all vertices of P. If such a C exists, then P is said to be cyclic. Fix C to have unit radius. While any two angles of a uniform cyclic triangle are negatively correlated, any two sides are independent. In contrast, for a uniform cyclic quadrilateral, any two sides are negatively correlated, whereas any two adjacent angles are uncorrelated yet dependent.
