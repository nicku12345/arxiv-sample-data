These notes are the second part of the tensor calculus documents which started with the previous set of introductory. In the present text, we continue the discussion of selected topics of the subject at a higher level expanding, when necessary, some topics and developing further concepts and techniques. Unlike the previous notes which are largely based on a Cartesian approach, the present notes are essentially based on assuming an underlying general curvilinear coordinate system.
