One can notice that quite often difference between so-called "standard students" and "gifted" ones is not because that first are less smart, but they have different "orientation", they consider subject as a collections of rules which should not be broken. The first aim is to overcame this dogmatic point of view on this subject, and only after that possible to judge a person to be talented one or not. This is the first stage of math education, the material needs just to serve it.   The technology of overcoming this wrong relation to subject is discoursed in spirit of the I.S.Rubanov paper "Method of Mathematical induction" (see chapter 9, http://www.ams.org/books/mawrld/007/). Giftness problems and staging of math (and scientific) education are discoursed.
