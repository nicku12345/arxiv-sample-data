Two perpendicular segments which divide a given triangle into 4 regions of equal area is called a quadrisection of the triangle. Leonhard Euler proved in 1779 that every scalene triangle has a quadrisection with its triangular part on the middle leg. We provide a complete description of the quadrisections of a triangle. For example, there is only one isosceles triangle which has exactly two quadrisections.
