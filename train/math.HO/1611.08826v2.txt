The election methods introduced in 1894--1895 by Phragm\'en and Thiele, and their somewhat later versions for ordered (ranked) ballots, are discussed in detail. The paper includes definitions and examples and discussion of whether the methods satisfy some properties, including monotonicity, consistency and various proportionality criteria. The relation with STV is also discussed. The paper also contains historical information on the methods.
