This article provides a survey on some main results and recent developments in the mathematical theory of water waves. More precisely, we briefly discuss the mathematical modeling of water waves and then we give an overview of local and global well-posedness results for the model equations. Moreover, we present reduced models in various parameter regimes for the approximate description of the motion of typical wave profiles and discuss the mathematically rigorous justification of the validity of these models.
