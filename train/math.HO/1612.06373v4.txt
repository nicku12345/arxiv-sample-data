This is neither an elementary introduction to singularity theory nor a specialized treatise containing many new theorems. The purpose of this little book is to invite the reader on a mathematical promenade. We pay a visit to Hipparchus, Newton and Gauss, but also to many contemporary mathematicians. We play with a bit of algebra, topology, geometry, complex analysis and computer science. Hopefully, some motivated undergraduates and some more advanced mathematicians will enjoy some of these panoramas.
