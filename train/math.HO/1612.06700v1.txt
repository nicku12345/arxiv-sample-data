The following result, a consequence of Dumas criterion for irreducibility of polynomials over integers, is generally proved using the notion of Newton diagram: Let f(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients and k be a positive integer relatively prime to the degree of f(x). Suppose that there exists a prime number p such that the leading coefficient of f(x) is not divisible by p, all the remaining coefficients are divisible by p^k, and the constant term of f(x) is not divisible by p^{k+1}. Then f(x) is irreducible over \mathbb{Z}. For k=1, this is precisely the Eisenstein criterion. The aim of this article is to give an alternate proof, accessible to the undergraduate students, of this result for k\in \{2,3,4\} using basic divisibility properties of integers.
