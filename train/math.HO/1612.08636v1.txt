In real Hilbert spaces, this paper generalizes the orthogonal groups \mathrm{O}(n) in two ways. One way is by finite multiplications of a family of operators from reflections which results in a group denoted as \Theta(\kappa), the other is by considering the automorphism group of the Hilbert space denoted as O(\kappa). We also try to research the algebraic relationship between the two generalizations and their relationship to the stable~orthogonal~group~\mathrm{O}=\varinjlim\mathrm{O}(n) in terms of topology. In this paper we mainly show that : (a) \Theta(\kappa) is a topological and normal subgroup of O(\kappa); (b) O^{(n)}(\kappa) \to O^{(n+1)}(\kappa) \stackrel{\pi}{\to} S^{\kappa} is a fibre bundle where O^{(n)}(\kappa) is a subgroup of O(\kappa) and S^{\kappa} is a generalized sphere.
