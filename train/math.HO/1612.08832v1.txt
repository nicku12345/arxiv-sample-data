In this paper we discuss how teaching of mathematics for middle school and high school students can be improved dramatically when motivation of concepts and ideas is done through the classical problems and the history of mathematics. This method improves intuition of students, awakens their curiosity, avoids memorizing useless formulas, and put concepts in a historical prospective. To illustrate we show how diagonalizing quadratic forms, elliptic integrals, discriminants of high degree polynomials, and geometric constructions can be introduced successfully in high school level.
