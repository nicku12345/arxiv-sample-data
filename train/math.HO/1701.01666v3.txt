We present a self-contained proof of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for two-dimensional surfaces embedded in R^3 using just classical vector calculus. The exposition should be accessible to advanced undergraduate and non-expert graduate students. It may be viewed as an illustration and exercise in multivariate calculus and a motivation to go deeper into the fields of geometry and topology.
