An expansion upon Donald Kunth's quarter-imaginary base system is introduced to handle any imaginary number base where its real part is zero and the absolute value of its imaginary part is greater than one. A brief overview on number bases is given as well as conversion to both positive and negative bases. Additionally gives examples for addition, subtraction, multiplication for imaginary bases and adds a division method for imaginary bases as well as mentions possible uses.
