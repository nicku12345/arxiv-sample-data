Between 17th and 19th centuries, mathematically orientated votive tablets appeared in Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples all over Japan. Known as sangaku, they contained problems of a largely geometrical nature. In the 17th century, the Japanese mathematician Seki Takakazu developed a form of algebra known as tenzan jutsu. I compare one mathematical problem from the 1810 Japanese text Sanp\=o Tenzan Shinan solved using tenzan jutsu to a similar problem found on the Kijimadaira Tenman-g\=u shrine sangaku to show how sangaku problems can be solved using the traditional Japanese methods.
