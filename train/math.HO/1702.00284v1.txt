Musical intervals in multiple of semitones under 12-note equal temperament, or more specifically pitch-class subsets of assigned cardinality (n-chords) are conceived as positive integer points within an Euclidean n-space. The number of distinct n-chords is inferred from combinatorics with the extension to n=0, involving an Euclidean 0-space. The number of repeating n-chords, or points which are turned into themselves during a circular permutation, T_n, of their coordinates, is inferred from algebraic considerations. Finally, the total number of n-chords and the number of T_n set classes are determined. Palindrome and pseudo palindrome n-chords are defined and included among repeating n-chords, with regard to an equivalence relation, T_n/T_nI, where reflection is added to circular permutation. To this respect, the number of T_n set classes is inferred concerning palindrome and pseudo palindrome n-chords and the remaining n-chords. The above results are reproduced within the framework of a geometrical interpretation, where positive integer points related to n-chords of cardinality, n, belong to a regular inclined n-hedron, \Psi_{12}^n, the vertexes lying on the coordinate axes of a Cartesian orthogonal reference frame at a distance, x_i=12, 1\le i\le n, from the origin. Considering \Psi_{12}^n as special cases of lattice polytopes, the number of related nonnegative integer points is also determined for completeness. A comparison is performed with the results inferred from group theory.
