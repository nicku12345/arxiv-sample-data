The following work shows how the first digit probability of a group of numbers in certain situations that are close to real-life ones can be explained using basic continuous real-valued functions. For instance, the first digits probability of the numbers representing the change in human growth can be understood better by looking at the square root function in a particular way. Also, examples explaining the first digit probability of other real-valued functions and how they are related to specific real-life situations were brought to the reader's attention. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of a group of certain discrete functions was performed by approximating the functions to the above mentioned continuous ones, taking limits, and other methods.
