Exploiting Markoff's Theory for rational approximations of real numbers, we explicitly link how hard it is to approximate a given number to an idealized notion of growth capacity for plants which we express as a modular invariant function depending on this number. Assuming that our growth capacity is biologically relevant, this allows us to explain in a satisfying mathematical way why the golden ratio occurs in nature.
