Given integers \ell > m >0, we define monic polynomials X_n, Y_n, and Z_n with the property that \mu is a zero of X_n if and only if the triple (\mu,\mu+m,\mu+\ell) satisfies x^n + y^n = z^n. It is shown that the irreducibility of these polynomials implies Fermat's last theorem. It is also shown, in a precise asymptotic sense, that for a vast majority of cases, these polynomials are irreducible via Eisenstein's criterion. We conclude by offering a conjecture on powerful numbers.
