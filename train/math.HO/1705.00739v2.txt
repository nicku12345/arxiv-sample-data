This article describes the authors' teaching experience in flipping the class of a basic undergraduate mathematics course Introductory Linear Algebra. We utilize a full-featured free electronic textbook, online lecture notes, an intranet learning management system (LMS) {\sl icampus}, the video-sharing website {\sl YouTube} and a Computer Algebra System (CAS) {\sl SageMath} in our flipped classroom approach. Prior coming to the class, the students are assigned to complete a portion of reading assignments from the free e-book and to watch recorded video lectures from {\sl YouTube} that cover the relevant materials. Announcements are made through the LMS {\sl icampus}, as well as disseminating teaching materials, assigning tasks, and fostering online communication outside the class hours. We dedicated in-class activities with problem-solving sessions, question and answer, discussion and providing instant feedback to the students. Hence, both out-of-class and in-class sessions are filled with active learning and interactive engagement. From the students' feedback and opinion, we discovered that some of them preferred the traditional classroom rather than the flipped classroom pedagogy. A possible reason is either they are used to the traditional lecture style where receiving information occurs inside the classroom or the flipped classroom approach that we implement does not satisfy students' learning styles. Nevertheless, several students enjoyed problem-solving activities where they have an opportunity to communicate with the instructors whenever they encounter some difficulty.
