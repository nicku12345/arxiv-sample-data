In this joint introduction to an Asterisque volume, we give a short discussion of the historical developments in the study of nonlinear covering groups, touching on their structure theory, representation theory and the theory of automorphic forms. This serves as a historical motivation and sets the scene for the papers in the volume. Our discussion is necessarily subjective and will undoubtedly leave out the contributions of many authors, to whom we apologize in earnest.
