The paper is devoted to the contribution in the Probability Theory of the well-known Soviet mathematician Alexander Yakovlevich Khintchine (1894-1959).   Several of his results are described, in particular those fundamental results on the infinitely divisible distributions. Attention is paid also to his interaction with Paul Levy. The content of the paper is related to our joint book The Legacy of A.Ya. Khintchine's Work in Probability Theory, published in 2010 by Cambridge Scientific Publishers.
