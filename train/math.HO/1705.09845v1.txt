First, we give a formula for the foci of an ellipse, E_0, as a function of the coefficients of an equation of E_0(see Theorem <ref>T2</ref>). To prove Theorem <ref>T2</ref>, we use two interesting formulas proven in <cite>B</cite> and in <cite>S</cite>. Our second result(see Theorem <ref>T3</ref>), is a more precise formula for the rotation angle of E_0 as a function of the coefficients of an equation of E_0.
