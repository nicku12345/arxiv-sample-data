The need for modification of the Huygens-Fresnel superposition principle arises even in the description of the free fields of massive particles and, more extensively, in nonlinear field theories. A wide range of formulations and superposition schemes for secondary waves are captured by Kirchhoff's integral theorem. We discuss various versions of this theorem as well as its connection with the superposition principle and the method of Green's functions. A superposition scheme inherent in linear field theories, which is not based on Kirchhoff's integral theorem but instead relies on the completeness condition, is also discussed.
