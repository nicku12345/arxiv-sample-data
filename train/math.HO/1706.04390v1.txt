We discuss the practical problems arising when constructing any (new or old) scales on slide rules, i.e. realizing the theory in the practice. This might help anyone in planning and realizing (mainly the magnitude and labeling of) new scales on slide rules in the future. In Sections 1-7 we deal with technical problems, Section 8 is devoted to the relationship among different scales. In the last Section we provide an interesting fact as a surprise to those readers who wish to skip this long article.
