We explore the perspective of a bug living on the two-dimensional surface of a polyhedron. Images of various kinds of effects like lensing and cloaking are shown via color pictures of three viewpoints: the first person perspective of the bug, a map of the bug's viewpoint, and a look at the bug on the embedded polyhedron from a three-dimensional exterior viewer. The pictures were constructed by computing the exponential map of a polyhedron by cutting and rotating faces into the tangent plane of the bug.
