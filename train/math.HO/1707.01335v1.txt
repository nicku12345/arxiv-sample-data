This paper focuses on the documentation work in the mathematics teaching. We show up the individual and collective components of this documentation. We present a new theoretical framework, the documentational approach which seems adapted for studying this issue. We applied it on a particular project of the French teachers association S\'esamath: the collective design of an online mathematics textbook. We present a methodology for observing both this collective project and the case of Ana\"is, a teacher involved in this project. We study her professional interest in S\'esamath, her didactical interactions with the other project members, and their effects on her professional knowledge.
