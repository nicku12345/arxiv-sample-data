These notes were written from a series of lectures given in March 2010 at the Universidad Complutense of Madrid and then in Barcelona for the centennial anniversary of the Spanish Mathematical Society (RSME). Our aim is to give an introduction to the Riemann Hypothesis and a panoramic view of the world of zeta and L-functions. We first review Riemann's foundational article and discuss the mathematical background of the time and his possible motivations for making his famous conjecture. We discuss some of the most relevant developments after Riemann that have contributed to a better understanding of the conjecture.
