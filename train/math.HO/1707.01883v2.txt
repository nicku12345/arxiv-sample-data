The present is a companion paper to "A contemporary look at Hermann Hankel's 1861 pioneering work on Lagrangian fluid dynamics" by Frisch, Grimberg and Villone (2017). Here we present the English translation of the 1861 prize manuscript from G\"ottingen University "Zur allgemeinen Theorie der Bewegung der Fl\"ussigkeiten" (On the general theory of the motion of the fluids) of Hermann Hankel (1839-1873), which was originally submitted in Latin and then translated into German by the Author for publication. We also provide the English translation of two important reports on the manuscript, one written by Bernhard Riemann and the other by Wilhelm Eduard Weber, during the assessment process for the prize. Finally we give a short biography of Hermann Hankel with his complete bibliography.
