We briefly review some of Ramanujan's contributions to mathematics, including his 1/\pi series, his work on modular forms, and his work on partitions. We briefly review his life, including his collaboration with Hardy. Finally, we give a brief summary of what any prospective mathematician should know about Ramanujan's work in number theory, including the rich relationship between his work on partitions and his work on modular forms. The title of this paper is a reference to a direct quote from Ramanujan himself: an equation means nothing to me unless it expresses a thought of God.
