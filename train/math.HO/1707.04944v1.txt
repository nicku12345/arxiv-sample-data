The link between the equation b(b+a)-a^2=0 concerning the side b and the diagonal a of a regular pentagon and the {\it Cassini identity} F_{i}F_{i+2}-F_{i+1}^2=(-1)^{i}, concerning three consecutive Fibonacci numbers, is very strong. In this paper we present our thesis that the two mentioned equations were "almost simultaneously" discovered by the {\it Pythagorean School}.
