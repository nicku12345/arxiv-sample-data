We discuss first experiences with a new variant of self-assessment in higher mathematics education. In our setting, the students of the course have to mark a part of their homework assignments themselves and they receive the corresponding credit without that any later changes are carried out by the teacher. In this way we seek to correct the imbalance between student-centered learning arrangements and assessment concepts that keep the privilege to grade (or mark) completely with the teacher. We present results in the form of student feedback from a course on functional analysis for 3rd and 4th year students. Moreover we analyze marking results from two courses on real analysis. Here, we compare tasks marked by the teacher and tasks marked by the students.
