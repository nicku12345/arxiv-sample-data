An infinite continued composition is an expression of the form \begin{equation*} \lim_{n\to\infty}t_0\circ t_1 \circ t_2 \circ \cdots \circ t_n(c)\;, \end{equation*} where the t_i are maps from a set D to itself, the initial value c is a point in D, and the order of operations proceeds from right to left.   This document is a bibliography, in chronological order through the year 2016, of selected continued compositions whose primary sources have typically been obscure. In particular, we include continued square roots: \begin{equation*} a_0+\sqrt{a_1+\sqrt{a_2+\sqrt{\ldots}}}\;, \end{equation*} as well as continued powers, continued cotangents, continued logarithms, and f-expansions. However, we do not include continued fractions, continued exponentials, or forms such as infinite sums and products in which the t_i are linear functions, because the literature on these forms is extensive.
