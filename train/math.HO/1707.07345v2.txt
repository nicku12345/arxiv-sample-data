We illustrate how one can use basic combinatorial theory and computer programming technique (Python) to analyze the combinatorial game: Mahjong. The results confirm some folklore concerning the game, and expose some unexpected results. Related results and possible future research in connection to artificial intelligence are mentioned. Readers interested in the subject may further develop the techniques to deepen the study of the game, or study other combinatorial games.
