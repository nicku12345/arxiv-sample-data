Euler's inequality R\geq 2r can be investigated in a novel way by using implicit loci in GeoGebra. Some unavoidable side effects of the implicit locus computation introduce unexpected algebraic curves. By using a mixture of symbolic and numerical methods a possible approach is sketched up to investigate the situation. By exploiting fast GPU computations, a web application written in CindyJS helps in understanding the situation even better.
