Periods are numbers represented as integrals of rational functions over algebraic domains. A survey of their elementary properties is provided. Examples of periods includes Feynman Integrals from Quantum Physics and Multiple Zeta Values from Number Theory.   But what about finite characteristic, via the global-to-local principle? We include some considerations regarding periods and Jacobi sums, the analog of Veneziano amplitudes in String Theory.
