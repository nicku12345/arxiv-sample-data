Finite fields form an important chapter in abstract algebra, and mathematics in general. We aim to provide a geometric and intuitive model for finite fields, involving algebraic numbers, in order to make them accessible and interesting to a much larger audience.   Such lattice models of finite fields provide a good basis for later developing the theory in a more concrete way, including Frobenius elements, all the way to Artin reciprocity law.   Examples are provided, intended for an undergraduate audience in the first place.
