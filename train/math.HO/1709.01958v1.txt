In this survey, we relate frame theory and quantum information theory, focusing on quantum 2-designs. These are arrangements of weighted subspaces which are in a specific sense optimal for quantum state tomography. After a brief introduction, we discuss the role of POVMs in quantum theory, developing the importance of quantum 2-designs. In the final section, we collect many if not most known examples of quantum-2 designs to date.
