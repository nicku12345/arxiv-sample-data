This book is a critical edition of a treatise of astronomy by the syrian scholar Ibn al-Shatir (1304-1375). The arabic text has been established on the basis of several manuscript copies, and it has been translated into french; a bilingual index is also provided. This treatise is one of the latest and one of the most elaborate medieval work on theoretical astronomy; it is famous today for having provided the first viable lunar model in terms of the distance Moon--Earth. Although demonstrations have been consigned to another manuscript which is now lost, we reconstruct the physical models in our mathematical commentary, and we attempt at a better historical understanding of the nascent concepts of space transformations, solid reference frames, trajectory, etc. Predictions of the models are to be compared to observations and to other contemporary models, as well as theoretical premises; in turn, when records of observations are missing, those have to be recalculated by modern means. Part of our commentary is devoted to the latitudinal movement of the five planets: Ibn al-Shatir's work on this problem belongs to a tradition initiated by Ibn al-Haytham three centuries before. Ibn al-Shatir addresses a clever criticism to the work of his predecessor Nasir al-Din al-Tusi on this problem, thus revealing a better understanding of affine rotations in space. Many other criticisms by Ibn al-Shatir, especially to the astronomers working at Maragha during the XIIIth century, also contribute to a better knowledge of their own work.
