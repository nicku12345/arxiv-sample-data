This study concerns the use of e-learning in the mathematics education system, shedding the light on its advantages and disadvantages, analyzing its applicability either partially or totally, and discussing the ways of improvement. From mathematical perspectives, theories are developed to test the courses tendency to online transformation. This leads to a new trend of learning, the offline-online-offline learning (fnf-learning), it merges e-learning mode with the traditional orientation of education. The derivation of the new trend is based on the learning approaches and study levels, this makes the new trend applicable and flexible for all mathematical courses. Moreover, for this approach of learning, a mathematical formula is suggested to measure the size of the portion of learning that can be transformed online, also theorems concerning this approach are formulated.
