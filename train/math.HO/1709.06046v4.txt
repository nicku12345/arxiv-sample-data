In 1957 Leo Moser published a problem in American Mathematical Monthly asking whether knowing the set of all pairwise sums of five numbers one could determine the original numbers. Problem was quickly generalized as "Is it always possible to restore a collection of n numbers from the collection of its s-sums?"; it turned out to be a very interesting and nontrivial question in additive number theory and combinatorics. On its sixtieth anniversary we present here a survey of all the known research, results and techniques used in various attempts to solve this problem. Some new findings and open questions are presented as well.
