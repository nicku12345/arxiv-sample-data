As David Berlinski writes (1997), the existence and nature of mathematics is a more compelling and far deeper problem than any of the problems raised by mathematics itself. Here we analyze the essence of mathematics making the main emphasis on mathematics as an advanced system of knowledge. This knowledge consists of structures and represents structures, existence of which depends on observers in a nonstandard way. Structural nature of mathematics explains its reasonable effectiveness.
