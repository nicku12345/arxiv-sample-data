We study ancient Khmer ephemerides described in 1910 by the French engineer Faraut, in order to determine whether they rely on observations carried out in Cambodia. These ephemerides were found to be of Indian origin and have been adapted for another longitude, most likely in Burma. A method for estimating the date and place where the ephemerides were developed or adapted is described and applied.
