How can I decompose a nonstationary signal? What are the advantages of using the most recent methods available in the literature versus using classical methods like (short time) Fourier transform or wavelet transform? This paper tries to address these and other questions providing the reader with a brief and self contained survey on what and how to tackle the decomposition of nonstationary signals.
