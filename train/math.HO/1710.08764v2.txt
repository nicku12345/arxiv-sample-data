The Poincare-Hopf Theorem is one of the most used in other areas of science. There are applications of the Poincare-Hopf Theorem in physics, chemistry, biology and even in economics, psychology, etc ... The Poincare-Hopf Theorem connects an invariant of combinatorial, the character of Euler-Poincare to an invariant of differential geometry, index of vector fields. The results that connect two very different areas of mathematics can be considered as the most beautiful, useful and fruitful.
