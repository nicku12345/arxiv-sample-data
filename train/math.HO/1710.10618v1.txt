This study focuses on the social structure and interpersonal dynamics of an afterschool math club for middle schoolers. Using social network analysis, two networks were formed and analyzed: The network of friendship relationships and the network of working relationships. The interconnections and correlations between friendship relationships, working relationships, and student opinion surveys are studied. A core working group of talented students emerged from the network of working relations. This group acted a central go-between for other members in the club. This core working group expanded into largest friendship group in the friendship network. Although there were working isolates, they were not found to be socially isolated. Students who were less popular tended to report a greater favorable impact from club participation. Implications for the study of the social structure of afterschool STEM clubs and classrooms are discussed.
