In this article I reflect upon the problems connected with writing women in mathematics into Wikipedia. I discuss some of the current projects and efforts aimed at increasing the visibility of women in mathematics on Wikipedia. I present the rules for creating a biography on Wikipedia and relate my personal experiences in creating such articles. I hope to provide the reader with the background and resources to start editing existing Wikipedia articles and the confidence to create new articles. I would also like to encourage existing editors to look out for and protect new articles about women mathematicians and submit new articles.
