Innovating mathematics by research approaches in Indonesia from middle schools to undergraduates are explained here where geometry is typical example to be innovated. Topics in plane geometry to be platonic solids and non platonic solids such as cylinder and spheres are innovated to be new surfaces and media. Topics in calculus and complex functions particularly parametric curves are used to be new curves for curves stitching, motifs in several kinds of souvenirs and accessories. Additionally, local culture is introduced through batik painting activity using algebraic surfaces drawn with Surfer. Leonardo Dome and Leonardo Bridge with Rinus Reolofs like are introduced to attract students for mathematical sports activities.
