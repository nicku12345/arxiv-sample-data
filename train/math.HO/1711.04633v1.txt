Innovation on motifs of batiks are shown here. Mathematical approach such as parametric plane curves and algebraic surfaces are introduced to be the novelty of this research. The specific parametric plane curve used in this paper is the modified hypocycloid curve with the MATLAB program. The quadric surface is the particular algebraic surface employed in the Surfer program and varied into several surfaces. Furthermore, the gender issue on painting of batiks is examined by introducing Surfer Batik Workshop for 24 junior students. Though statistically the used number does not representative enough, more colors are used by girls than boys, the interest of painting motifs of batiksis greater in girls due to the present attitude of participants.
