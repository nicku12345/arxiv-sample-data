These are lecture notes for the course "Analysis and X-ray tomography" given at the University of Jyv\"askyl\"a (Fall 2017), Rice University (Spring 2019), and Tampere University (Spring 2021). The course is a broad overview of various tools in analysis that can be used to study X-ray tomography. The focus is on tools and ideas, not so much on technical details and minimal assumptions. Only very basic functional analysis is assumed as background. Exercise problems are included.
