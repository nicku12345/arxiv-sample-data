The unique and beautiful character of certain mathematical results and proofs is often considered one of the most gratifying aspects of engaging with mathematics. We study whether this perception of mathematical arguments having an intrinsic 'character' is subjective or universal -- this was done by having test subjects with varying degrees of mathematical experience match mathematical arguments with paintings and music: 'does this proof feel more like Bach or Schubert?' The results suggest that such a universal connection indeed exists.
