When doubly-affine matrices such as Latin and magic squares with a single non-zero eigenvalue are powered up they become constant matrices after a few steps. The process of compounding squares of orders m and n can then be used to generate an infinite series of such squares of orders mn. The Cayley-Hamilton theorem is used to understand this property, where their characteristic polynomials have just two terms.
