We briefly recall the history of the Nijenhuis torsion of (1,1)-tensors on manifolds and of the lesser-known Haantjes torsion. We then show how the Haantjes manifolds of Magri and the symplectic-Haantjes structures of Tempesta and Tondo generalize the classical approach to integrable systems in the bi-hamiltonian and symplectic-Nijenhuis formalisms, the sequence of powers of the recursion operator being replaced by a family of commuting Haantjes operators.
