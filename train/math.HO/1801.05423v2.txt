We describe our adventures in creating a new first-year course in Experimental Mathematics that uses active learning. We used a state-of-the-art facility, called The Western Active Learning Space, and got the students to "drive the spaceship" (at least a little bit). This paper describes some of our techniques for pedagogy, some of the vignettes of experimental mathematics that we used, and some of the outcomes. EYSC was a student in the simultaneously-taught senior sister course "Open Problems in Experimental Mathematics" the first time it was taught and an unofficial co-instructor the second time. Jon Borwein attended the Project Presentation Day (the second time) and gave thoughtful feedback to each student. This paper is dedicated to his memory.
