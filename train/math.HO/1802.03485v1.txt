A popular scientific contribution should not contradict any established facts and ought to be understandable. I complied with both these requirements and am offering a sufficiently full introduction to probability theory. Furthermore, I enlivened my text with much information about the history of probability and commentaries on the occurring notions which do not belong to that theory. Indeed, a student is not a container to be filled but a torch to be kindled. I hope therefore that my piece will essentially benefit beginners, be also methodically useful to advanced readers, and even attract some inquisitive people to probability.
