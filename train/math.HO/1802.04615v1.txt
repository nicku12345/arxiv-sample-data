This elementary treatment first summarizes extreme values of a Bernoulli random walk on the one-dimensional integer lattice over a finite discrete time interval. Both the symmetric (unbiased) and asymmetric (biased) cases are discussed. Asymptotic results are given as the time interval length approaches infinity. Focus then shifts to such walks reflected at the origin -- in both strong and weak senses -- and related unsolved problems are meticulously examined.
