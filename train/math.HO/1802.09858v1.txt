Kummer's test from 1835 states that the positive series \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n is convergent if and only if there is a sequence \{ B_n\}_1^\infty of positive numbers such that   B_n\cdot \frac{a_n }{a_{n+1}} -B_{n+1}\geq 1 , for all sufficiently large n. We present an exact analysis and a short and unified proof of Kummer's test. The test has been applied to differential equations and studied in mathematical philosophy.
