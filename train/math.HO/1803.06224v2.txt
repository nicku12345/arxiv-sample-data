This paper considers an extension of origami geometry to the case of "folding" a three dimensional (3D) space along a plane. First, all possible incidence constraints between given points, lines and planes are analyzed by using the geometry of reflections. Next, a set of 3D elementary fold operations is defined, which satisfy specific combinations of constraints with a finite number of solutions. The set consists of 47 valid fold operations, and solutions to some of them are explored to determine their number and conditions of existence.
