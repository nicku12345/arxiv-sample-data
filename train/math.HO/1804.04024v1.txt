Morley's Theorem about angle trisectors can be viewed as the statement that a certain diagram `exists', meaning that triangles of prescribed shapes meet in a prescribed pattern. This diagram is the case n=3 of a class of diagrams we call `Conway's doughnuts'. These diagrams can be proven to exist using John Smillie's holonomy method, recently championed by Eric Braude: `Guess the shapes; check the holonomy.' For n = 2, 3, 4 the existence of the doughnut happens to be easy to prove because the hole is absent or triangular.
