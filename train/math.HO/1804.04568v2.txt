It is shown that an aspect of the process of individuation may be thought of as a fuzzy set. The process of individuation has been interpreted as a two-valued problem in the history of philosophy. In this work, I intend to show that such a process in its psychosocial aspect is better understood in terms of a fuzzy set, characterized by a continuum membership function. According to this perspective, species and their members present different degrees of individuation. Such degrees are measured from the membership function of the psychosocial process of individuation. Thus, a social analysis is suggested by using this approach in human societies.
