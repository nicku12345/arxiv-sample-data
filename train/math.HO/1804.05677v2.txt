This article takes at heart Boolos' intentions when presenting `The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever.' We stress the fact that Boolos instructs us to solve the puzzle by asking three yes-no questions. It is a requirement that all the gods, including Random -whose behavior is determined by the outcome of flipping a coin in its head-, are always obliged to answer. Moreover, Boolos' solution implies that the meaning of `Da' and `Ja' is irrelevant to solve the puzzle, and, at the same time, that all of this would be in virtue of the irreducible fundamentality of `the Law of the Excluded Middle.' The purpose of this paper is, then, twofold. First, we prove that Boolos' original puzzle cannot be solved, in an absolute deterministic way, in less than three yes-no \textit{admissible} questions. This does not mean that one could identify the gods' identities in less than three questions, which chances, second, we compute as well.
