Modern mathematics is known for its rigorous proofs and tight analysis. Math is the paradigm of objectivity for most. We identify the source of that objectivity as our knowledge of the physical world given through our senses. We show in detail, for the core of modern mathematics, how modern mathematical formalism encapsulates deep realities about extension into a system of symbols and axiomatic rules. In particular, we proceed from the foundations in our senses to the natural numbers through integers, rational numbers, and real numbers, including introducing the concept of a field. An appendix shows how the formalism of complex numbers arises.
