The Root Test and the Ratio Test for series \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n are usually discussed and proved independently in Calculus courses. This can create in students an impression that if one of these two tests is inconclusive because the radius \rho is 1, then there is a chance that the second test can be useful. We suggest a new approach to the presentation of these two tests, which eliminates this confusion. Suppose that \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{|a_n|}{|a_{n+1}|} exists and is equal to \rho. We show that this implies that   \lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}=\rho, and the limit of the root can be used for verification of the convergence of the series. This proof explains the relation between the two Tests and shows that the radius of convergence of a functional series (and power series in particular) can be calculated with either of the two methods.
