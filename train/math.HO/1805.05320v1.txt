In our previous paper, Real Polynomials with a Complex Twist [see http://archives.math.utk.edu/ICTCM/VOL28/A040/paper.pdf], we used advancements in computer graphics that allow us to easily illustrate more complete graphs of polynomial functions that are still accessible to students of many different levels. In this paper we examine the 3D graphical representations of selected transcendental functions over subsets of the complex plane for which the functions are real-valued. We visualize and find connections between circular trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions.
