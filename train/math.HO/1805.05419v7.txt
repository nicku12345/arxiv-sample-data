This text summarizes and expands the content of a general audience talk given at the University of Mainz. Motivated by recent developments in type theory and category theory, it presents a history of ideas around the concepts of truth, proof, identity, and equivalence as well as their relation to human thought. We describe a few ideas of Aristoteles, Leibniz, Kant and Frege and then pass to the results of G\"odel and Tarski about incompleteness and the difference between truth and deducibility. The main focus of this text, however, is the development of type theory in the work of Per Martin-L\"of and further developments including homotopy type theory, i.e., the univalent foundations program. This results in particular in the notion of identity types and gives mathematics the possibility to handle equivalences and isomorphisms in a conceptual way.
