Walter Richard Talbot was the fourth African American to earn a PhD in Mathematics. His doctoral degree is from the University of Pittsburgh in 1934 in geometric group theory. A contemporary research program was the determination of fundamental domains of finite group actions on complex vector spaces. His thesis is not widely available, and this note gives a brief synopsis of the main results of his thesis, expressed using modern mathematical methods and language, and placed in general context.
