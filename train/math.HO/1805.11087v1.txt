This paper develops a unified voice-leading model for the genus of mystic and Wozzeck chords. These voice-leading regions are constructed by perturbing symmetric partitions of the octave, and new Neo-Riemannian transformations between nearly symmetric hexachords are defined. The behaviors of these transformations are shown within visual representations of the voice-leading regions for the mystic-Wozzeck genus.
