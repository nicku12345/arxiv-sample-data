Certain triangle inequalities involving the circumradius, inradius, and side lengths of a triangle are generalized to spherical and hyperbolic geometry. Examples include strengthenings of Euler's inequality, R\geq2r. An extension of Euler's inequality to a simplex in n-dimensional space is also generalized to spherical geometry.
