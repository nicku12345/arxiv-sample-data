Suppose there are n harmonic pencils of lines given in the plane. We are interested in the question whether certain triples of these lines are concurrent or if triples of intersection points of these lines are collinear, provided that we impose suitable conditions on the initial harmonic pencils. Such conditions can be that certain of the given lines coincide, are concurrent or that certain intersection points are collinear. The study of these questions for n=2, 3, 4 sheds light on some well known affine configurations and provides new results in the projective setting. As applications, we will formulate generalizations or stronger versions of the theorems of Pappus, Desargues, Ceva and Menelaos. Notably, the generalized theorems of Ceva and Menelaos suggest a new way to generalize the terms collinearity and concurrency.
