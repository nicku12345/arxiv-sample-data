The book is a unique phenomenon in Russian geometry education. It was first published in 1892; there have been more than 40 revised editions, and dozens of millions of copies (by these parameters it is trailing only Euclid's Elements).   Our edition is based on 41st edition (the stable edition of Nil Aleksandrovich Glagolev; it's been in public domain since 2015). At a few places we reverted changes to the earlier editions; we also made more accurate historical remarks.
