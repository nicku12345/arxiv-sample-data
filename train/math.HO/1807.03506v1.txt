This article is an abridged and commented translation into Spanish of the 1815 memoir where Gauss introduced the quadrature rules now associated with his name. Gauss' work does not resemble at all the stardard text-book treatment of Gaussian quadrature. The original memoir is an example of mathematical virtuosity, based on a superb use of series, where the problem is reformulated as a problem in functional approximation that is solved by means of continued fractions.
