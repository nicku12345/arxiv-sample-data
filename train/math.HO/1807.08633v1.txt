In this book, there are five chapters: The Laplace Transform, Systems of Homogeneous Linear Differential Equations (HLDE), Methods of First and Higher Orders Differential Equations, Extended Methods of First and Higher Orders Differential Equations, and Applications of Differential Equations. In addition, there are exercises at the end of each chapter above to let students practice additional sets of problems other than examples, and they can also check their solutions to some of these exercises by looking at "Answers to Odd-Numbered Exercises" section at the end of this book. This book is a very useful for college students who studied Calculus II, and other students who want to review some concepts of differential equations before studying courses such as partial differential equations, applied mathematics, and electric circuits II.
