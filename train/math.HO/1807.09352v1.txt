It has also exercises at the end of each chapter above to let students practice additional sets of problems other than examples, and they can also check their solutions to some of these exercises by looking at Answers to Odd-Numbered Exercises section at the end of this book. This book is very useful for college students who studied Calculus I, and other students who want to review some linear algebra concepts before studying a second course in linear algebra.
