The theory uses methods and language of linear algebra to study nonlinear spaces. These techniques can be used particularly to describe analytic geometry of non-linear elliptic, hyperbolic, De Sitter and Anti de Sitter spaces. The main innovation of elaborated theory is space parameterization by introduction of space signature. This parameterization allows studying of different homogeneous spaces in one global framework. When the parameters are used as variables in definitions, axioms, equations, theorems, proofs, all these have exactly the same form that describes the reality of all homogeneous spaces simultaneously. When it is necessary to describe some space particularities or to see the difference between two concrete spaces, the concrete values can be put in parameters of each definition, axiom, equation, theorem and proof.
