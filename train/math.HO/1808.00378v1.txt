In this paper I analyze the problems which led to the introduction of graphs as tools for studying surface singularities. I explain how such graphs were initially only described using words, but that several questions made it necessary to draw them, leading to the elaboration of a special calculus with graphs. This is a non-technical paper intended to be readable both by mathematicians and philosophers or historians of mathematics.
