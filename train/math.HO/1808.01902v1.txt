One source of beauty in mathematics is totally unexpected connections between two fundamentally different objects. For instance, is it not surprising that the time period of a real simple pendulum is linked with a function arising out of finding the number of ways in which a positive integer could be decomposed as a sum of two squares? Why should inherent properties and interrelations among counting numbers should appear in the laws of nature that govern the motion of a simple pendulum? In this article we will see some such surprising and beautiful results coming from combinatorics, number theory and physics.
