Text of a (pre-dinner) lecture at the Bielefeld workshop "Discrete Categories in Representation Theory", April 20 - 21, 2018. This workshop was organized in order to celebrate the 60th birthday of Dieter Vossieck: his famous paper "The algebras with discrete derived category" has to be seen as the starting point of a development which is discussed in this workshop. Dieter Vossieck has published only few papers, but his influence is much larger. We outline some of these contributions.
