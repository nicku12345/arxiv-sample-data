This paper focuses on two mathematical topics, namely continuous probability distributions (CPD) and integral calculus (IC). These two sectors that are linked by a formula are quite compartmented in teaching classes in France. The main objective is to study whether French students can mobilize the sector of IC to solve tasks in CPD and vice versa at the transition from high school to higher education. Applying the theoretical framework of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD), we describe a reference epistemological model (REM) and use it to elaborate a questionnaire in order to test the capacity of students to bridge CPD and IC at the onset of university. The analysis of the data essentially confirms the compartmentalisation of CPD and IC.
