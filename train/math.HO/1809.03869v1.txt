The intransitive cycle of superiority is characterized by such binary relations between A, B, and C that A is superior to B, B is superior to C, and C is superior to A (i.e., A>B>C>A - in contrast with transitive relations A>B>C). The first part of the article presents a brief review of studies of intransitive cycles in various disciplines (mathematics, biology, sociology, logical games, decision theory, etc.), and their reflections in educational materials. The second part of the article introduces the issue of intransitivity in elementary physics. We present principles of building mechanical intransitive devices in correspondence with the structure of the Condorcet paradox, and describe five intransitive devices: intransitive gears; levers; pulleys, wheels, and axles; wedges; inclined planes. Each of the mechanisms are constructed as compositions of simple machines and show paradoxical intransitivity of relations such as "to rotate faster than", "to lift", "to be stronger than" in some geometrical constructions. The article is an invitation to develop teaching materials and problems advancing the understanding of transitivity and intransitivity in various areas, including physics education.
