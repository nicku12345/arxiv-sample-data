In this study, the new algebraic properties related to bivariate Fibonacci polynomials has been given. We present the partial derivatives of these polynomials in the form of convolution of bivariate Fibonacci polynomials. Also, we define a new recurrence relation for the r-th partial derivative sequence of bivariate Fibonacci polynomials.
