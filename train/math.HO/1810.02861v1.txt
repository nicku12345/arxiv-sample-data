We give an introduction to the study of algebraic hypersurfaces, focusing on the problem of when two hypersurfaces are isomorphic or close to being isomorphic. Working with hypersurfaces and emphasizing examples makes it possible to discuss these questions without any previous knowledge of algebraic geometry. At the end we formulate the main recent results and state the most important open questions.
