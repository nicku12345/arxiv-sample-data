\'Elie Cartan's "g\'en\'eralisation de la notion de courbure" (1922) arose from a creative evaluation of the geometrical structures underlying both, Einstein's theory of gravity and the Cosserat brothers generalized theory of elasticity. In both theories groups operating in the infinitesimal played a crucial role. To judge from his publications in 1922--24, Cartan developed his concept of generalized spaces with the dual context of general relativity and non-standard elasticity in mind. In this context it seemed natural to express the translational curvature of his new spaces by a rotational quantity (via a kind of Grassmann dualization). So Cartan called his translational curvature "torsion" and coupled it to a hypothetical rotational momentum of matter several years before spin was encountered in quantum mechanics.
