The Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus has a responsibility for delivering mathematics modules for engineering students. Due to the significantly large number of students, two methods of teaching delivery--parallel teaching and block teaching--have been implemented. This article discusses some pros and cons between these two methods, particularly for the Foundation programme and the first year of the Undergraduate programme in Engineering. Whether parallel teaching or block teaching is implemented, feedback comments from the students indicate that some areas need to be paid attention to.
