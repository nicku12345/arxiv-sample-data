Magic squares have been well explored here on Earth [1], but there appears to have been little-to-no examination of \textit{lunar} magic squares. Some kinds of magic squares exist on the moon (i.e. under lunar arithmetic) but not on Earth (i.e. under traditional arithmetic). Other types of magic squares are difficult to construct here on Earth but are plentiful in the lunar terrain. Examples of such are given here.
