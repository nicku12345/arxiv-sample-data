In this note for the joint meeting of DMV and GDM we illustrate with examples the role of computer algebra in university mathematics education. We discuss its potential in teaching algebra, but also computer algebra as a subject in its own right, its value in the context of practical programming projects and its role as a research topic in student papers.
