Probability theory as a physical theory is, in a sense, the most general physics theory available, more encompassing than relativity theory and quantum mechanics, which comply with probability theory. Taking this simple fact seriously, I argue that probability theory points towards superdeterminism, a principle that underlies, notably, 't Hooft's Cellular Automaton Interpretation of quantum mechanics. Specifically, I argue that superdeterminism offers a solution for 1) Kolmogorov's problem of probabilistic dependence; 2) the interpretation of the Central Limit Theorem; and 3) Bell's theorem. Superdeterminism's competitor, indeterminism ('no hidden variables'), remains entirely silent regarding 1) and 2), and leaves 3) as an obstacle rather than a solution for the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. This suggests that, if one wishes to stick to the standard position in physics and adopt the principles with the highest explanatory power, one should adopt superdeterminism and reject indeterminism. Throughout the article precise questions to mathematicians are formulated to advance this research.
