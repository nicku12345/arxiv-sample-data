We discuss the optimal presentations of mathematical objects under well defined symbol libraries. We shall examine what light our chosen symbol libraries and syntax shed upon the objects they represent. A major part of this work will focus on discrete sets, particularly the natural numbers, with results that describe the presentation of the natural numbers under specific symbol libraries and what those presentations may reveal about the properties of the natural numbers themselves. We shall present bounds and constraints on the length and shape of presentations, connect already existing problems in other fields of mathematics to questions relevant to these presentations and otherwise illuminate why such a study can produce exciting results.
