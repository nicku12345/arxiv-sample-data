The first half of the 20th century in the history of Russian mathematics is striking with a combination of dramaticism, sometimes a tragedy, and outstanding achievements.   The paper is devoted to St. Petersburg-Leningrad Mathematical School. It is based on a chapter in the multi-author monograph "Mathematical Petersburg. History, science, sights" (SPb: Educational projects, 2018, 336 pp. in Russian).
