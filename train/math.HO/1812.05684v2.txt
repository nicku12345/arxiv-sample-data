In number theory, the Erdos-Straus conjecture states that for all n >=2, the rational number 4/n can be expressed as the sum of three unit fractions. Paul Erdos and Ernst G. Straus formulated the conjecture in 1948. The restriction that the three unit fractions be positive is essential to the difficulty of the problem, for if negative values were allowed the problem could always be solved. This paper presents an explicit solutions to this conjecture for all n >=2 excepting some n such that n=1(mod8).
