It is proven that the only integer solutions (a,b) such that a+b and ab are palindromic are (2,5\cdot 10^k-3), (3,24) and (9,9), and in a similar fashion, b-a and ab are only palindromic at (a,b)=(3,147\cdot 10^{4(k+1)}+5247\sum_{i=0}^k10^{4i}), (3,161\,247\cdot 10^{4k+7}+5247\sum_{i=0}^k10^{4i+3}+387), (3,147) and (3,161\,247\,387) for k=0,1,2,\cdots. Note a\le b without loss of generality.
