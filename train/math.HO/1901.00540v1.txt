We present a new approach of proving certain Carath\'{e}odory-type theorems using the Perron-Frobenius Theorem, a classical result in matrix theory describing the largest eigenvalue of a matrix with positive entries.   One of the problems left open in this note is whether our approach may be extended to prove similar results in the area, in particular the Colourful Carath\'{e}odory Theorem.
