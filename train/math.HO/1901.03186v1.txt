This paper explores the interactions between knot theory and quantum computing. On one side, knot theory has been used to create models of quantum computing, and on the other, it is a source of computational problems. Knot theory is often used to introduce topological idea to people without a formal mathematical background, and we are building on this tradition to discuss some of the deeper ideas of quantum computing.
