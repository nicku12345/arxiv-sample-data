This is a collection of definitions, notations and proofs for the Bernoulli numbers B_n appearing in formulas for the sum of integer powers, some of which can be found scattered in the large related historical literature in French, English and German. We provide elementary proofs for the original convention with {\mathcal B}_1=1/2 and also for the current convention with B_1=-1/2, using only the binomial theorem and the concise Blissard symbolic (umbral) notation.
