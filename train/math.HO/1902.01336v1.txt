Free translation of the original abstract in Spanish:   Some of the most relevant milestones due to, or instigated by, mathematicians concerning the creation, development and advances of Cosmology as a scientific discipline are presented and discussed. In particular, the close relationship between Cosmology and Mathematics, derived from the geometrization of the former performed by Einstein after his General theory of Relativity, is described in detail with a thorough analysis of the contributions and collaborations by distinguished XX-th century mathematicians.
