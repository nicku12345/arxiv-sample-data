In spite of its title, the book mostly treats probability theory: the law of large numbers (regarded as a principle); formal definition of a random variable and law of distribution; the misnamed Cauchy distribution; functions now named after Dirac; difference between objective and subjective probabilities; approximation of the Bernoulli theorem for rare events (but not yet the Poisson distribution); investigation of the significance of empirical discrepancies. Following Laplace, he actually attributed probability to applied mathematics.   Poisson calculated the optimal number of jurors and of their majority for conviction/exoneration of the accused and in general studied the conditions enabling to minimize miscarriage of justice. He replaced guilty and innocent by convictable or not.
