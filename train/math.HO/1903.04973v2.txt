Kirchhoff's Matrix-Tree Theorem asserts that the number of spanning trees in a finite graph can be computed from the determinant of any of its reduced Laplacian matrices. In many cases, even for well-studied families of graphs, this can be computationally or algebraically taxing. We show how two well-known results from linear algebra, the Matrix Determinant Lemma and the Schur complement, can be used to elegantly count the spanning trees in several significant families of graphs.
