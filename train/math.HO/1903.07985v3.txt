This paper examines the constricted use of group theory in the studies of pairwise comparisons. The presented approach is based on the application of the famous Levi Theorems of 1942 and 1943 for orderable groups. The theoretical foundation for multiplicative (ratio) pairwise comparisons has been provided. Counterexamples have been provided to support the theory.   In our opinion, the scientific community must be made aware of the limitations of using the group theory in pairwise comparisons. Groups, which are not torsion free, cannot be used for ratios by Levi's theorems.
