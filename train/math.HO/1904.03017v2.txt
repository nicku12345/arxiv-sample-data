Starting from the first Hardy-Littlewood conjecture some topics will be covered: an empirical approach to the distribution of the twin primes in classes mod(10) and a simplified proof of the Bruns theorem . Finally, it will be explored an approach based on numerical analysis: Monte Carlo Method and Low discrepancy Sequences will be used to prove the convergence of the conjecture to the expected values.
