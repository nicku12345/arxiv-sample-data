We formulate and prove a criterion for reducibility of a quadratic polynomial over the integers. The main theorem was suggested by the teaching experience with the concrete material called "the polynomial box". Through the corollaries we relate our theorem and the use of concrete material with some well know factoring methods for quadratic polynomial with integer coeficients.
