The selection of topics in this text has formed the core of a one semester course in applied mathematics at the Arctic University of Norway that has been running continuously since the 1970s. The class has, during its existence, drawn participants from both applied mathematics and physics, and also to some extent from pure mathematics, analysis in particular. The material in these lecture notes can be covered by one semester's worth of five lecture hours a week. The work requirements for the students consists of seven obligatory projects whose content are taken from exercises and computational projects included in the text.
