It is usually considered that the structuralist tendency in mathematics began in the twentieth century, at some point after the works on set theory and obtained its spreading through the works made by the Bourbaki group. In the present paper we argument the presence of this stylistic inclination in Richard Dedekind (1831-1916) when he made this dissertation for the habilitation as privatdozent at the University of Goettingen in 1854. Our main objective is to show how evolved the structuralist style in Dedekind's works, and to argument why we consider him significant to the architecture of arithmetical continuum.
