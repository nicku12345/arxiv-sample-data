In the present article we study the decisive contributions of three members of the German mathematical school to the separation of the concept of number from the physical concept of magnitude, during the second half of the XIXth century. Besides we analyze the importance of the arithmetization of analysis to later axiomatization of real numbers, process that those three mathematicians promoted in the principal works we review.
