These few pages briefly present the way in which Activity Theory has been adopted for several years now by French researchers in didactics of mathematics and has been adapted to study the learning of school mathematics in relation with the teaching that students receive, as well as teachers practices. Common general features of the methodology that each one afterwards worked on and continues to develop according to his own research objects, make it possible to specify some principles deriving from well-known learningTheories. Some results are outlined, as well as difficulties and perspectives.
