This paper introduces ordered skew fields that result from the construction of a skew field over an ordered line in a Desargues affine plane. A special case of a finite ordered skew field in the construction of a skew field over an ordered line in a Desargues affine plane in Euclidean space, is also considered. Two main results are given in this paper: (1) every skew field constructed over a skew field over an ordered line in a Desargues affine plane is an ordered skew field and (2) every finite skew field constructed over a skew field over an ordered line in a Desargues affine plane in \mathbb{R}^2 is a finite ordered skew field.
