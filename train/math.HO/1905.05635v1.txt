For-profit editors such as Elsevier and Springer have been subject to sustained criticism from academics and university libraries, including calls to boycott, and discontinued subscriptions. Mathematicians have played a particularly active role in this critique, and have endeavored to imagine new publication practices and create new journals. This motivates the monitoring of the share of articles published by different editors. I used data from MathSciNet over the period 2000-2017, and focused on the 100 journals with highest citations per article. Within this category, the share of articles published by Elsevier and Springer has steadily increased over this period, from about a third to almost half of the total.
