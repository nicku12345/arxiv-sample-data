This is a collection of teaching materials used in several Russian universities, schools, and mathematical circles. Most problems are chosen in such a way that in the course of the solution and discussion a reader learns important mathematical ideas and theories. The materials can be used by pupils and students for self-study, and by teachers.   This is an abridged pre-copyedit version of the published book submitted with the permission of the publisher. Each included individual material is self-contained and ready-for-use. Solutions to problems are not included intentionally. This collection consolidates updates of several arXiv submissions, e.g., arXiv:1305.2598.
