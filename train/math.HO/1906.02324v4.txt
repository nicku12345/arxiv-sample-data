The phrase " 2+2=5 " is a clich\'e or a slogan used in political speeches, propaganda, or literature, most notably in the novel " 1984 " by George Orwell. More recently, we came across a You-Tube short film comedy, Alternative Math, produced by IdeaMan Studios (see \cite{Danny}). It is a hilarious exaggeration of a teacher who is dragged through the mud for teaching that  2+2=4  and not  22 , as Danny, a young student, kept on insisting. In the movie, Danny and the whole community sincerely believe  1+1=11  and  2+2=22 . Jokes aside, we ask the question whether a polynomially defined group law "\oplus" defined over the field of rationals such that  1\oplus1=u  and  2 \oplus2=v  can simultaneously be satisfied for arbitrary integers u and  v . Answer to this question takes us through a fascinating journey from Brahmagupta all the way to the modern works of Louis Joel Mordell and Ramanujan!
