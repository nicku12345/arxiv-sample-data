The development of the trigonometric functions in introductory texts usually follows geometric constructions using right triangles or the unit circle. While these methods are satisfactory at the elementary level, advanced mathematics demands a more rigorous approach. Our purpose here is to revisit elementary trigonometry from an entirely analytic perspective. We will give a comprehensive treatment of the sine and cosine functions and will show how to derive the familiar theorems of trigonometry without reference to geometric definitions or constructions.
