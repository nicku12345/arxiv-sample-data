This paper studies certain trajectories of the Collatz function. I show that if for each odd number n, n\sim 3n+2 then every positive integer n \in \mathbb{N}\setminus 2^{\mathbb{N}} has the representation n=\left(2^{a_{k+1}}-\sum_{i=0}^{k}{2^{a_i}3^{k-i}}\right)/ 3^{k+1} where 0\le a_0 \le a_1 \le \cdot \cdot \cdot \le a_{k+1}. As a consequence, in order to prove Collatz Conjecture I illustrate that it is sufficient to prove n\sim 3n+2 for any odd n\in \mathbb{N}\setminus 2^{\mathbb{N}} . This is the main result of the paper.
