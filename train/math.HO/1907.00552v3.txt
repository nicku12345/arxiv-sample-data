The performance of students in Mathematics and its allied fields has been a topic of great interest for mathematical educationalists worldwide. In this paper, we study the student performance in one of the most math heavy fields-Engineering. An analysis of the performance of students using a sample from calculus courses across all fields within Engineering at the University of Sharjah, UAE reveled a trend of girls performing better than the boys. To be able to apply corrective strategies to handle this issue, a survey was carried out focusing on micro issues which we as educationalist could deal with at the college level and the university level. The results of the survey pinpointed out clear reasons for this grade disparity among the genders, thus allowing us to propose some immediate and practical solutions to deal with this scenario.
