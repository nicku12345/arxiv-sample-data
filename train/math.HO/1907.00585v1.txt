Math placement is a crucial step between admission and full engagement with the university for students in STEM majors. Students' placement experiences influence not only their mathematical entry point on their degree pathway, but their perceptions of their relationship with the university. Application of behavioral economics theory, particularly choice architecture, to placement communication can increase student engagement with the placement process, reducing enrollment in preparatory courses while maintaining positive outcomes in more advanced courses. Targeted communication with students facilitates successful placement and enhances self-efficacy and sense of belonging. Math placement is a pigeonholing process and inherently involves an array of sub-instructions and information relevant only to subgroups; optimizing content flow improves retention of key information and minimizes exposure to intimidating or alienating information.
