In this short note we prove two elegant generalized continued fraction formulae e= 2+\cfrac{1}{1+\cfrac{1}{2+\cfrac{2}{3+\cfrac{3}{4+\ddots}}}} and e= 3+\cfrac{-1}{4+\cfrac{-2}{5+\cfrac{-3}{6+\cfrac{-4}{7+\ddots}}}} using elementary methods. The first formula is well-known, and the second one is newly-discovered in arXiv:1907.00205 [cs.LG]. We then explore the possibility of automatic verification of such formulae using computer algebra systems (CAS's).
