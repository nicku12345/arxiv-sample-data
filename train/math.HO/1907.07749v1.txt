Those of us who teach Mathematics for Liberal Arts (MLA) courses often underestimate the mathematical abilities of the students enrolled in our courses. Despite the fact that many of these students suffer from math anxiety and will admit to hating mathematics, when we give them space to explore mathematics and bring their existing knowledge to the problem, they can make some amazing mathematical discoveries. Inquiry-based learning (IBL) is perfect structure to provide these type of opportunities. In this paper, we will examine one inquiry-based investigation in which MLA students were given the space to look for patterns which resulted in some original discoveries.
