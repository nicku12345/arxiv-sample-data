This article discusses the process of creating, implementing and experiencing Flipped Learning in a Multivariable Calculus course for second year engineering students. We describe the construction of the teaching material, consisting of short videos for pre-class preparation and aligned worksheets for in-class dynamics, and the activities that were conducted. We discuss difficulties and key aspects to be considered while creating this material and during implementation of Flipped Learning. We present how students reacted to pre-class preparation and how in-class dynamics developed during implementation. We show results on students performance and perception when enrolling in a flipped classroom section. We present comparative results on students performance of a section taught with Flipped Learning vs a parallel section thought in the traditional expository way. We could conclude that flipped courses show similar results in passing percentage than traditionally taught courses, that student's perceptions are generally mixed, and we perceived that students repeating the course preferably do not choose flipped classes. Finally, we discussed the methodological evolution of this course converging to a mixed methodology throughout a four year period, observing that the instructors evaluation decreases in classes that were flipped. Mixed methodologies on the other hand, increased the learning experience of students resulting in an increased instructors evaluation score and higher students enrollment in the course.
