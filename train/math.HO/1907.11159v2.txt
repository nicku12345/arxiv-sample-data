The Rascal Triangle was introduced by three middle school students in 2010, and in this paper we describe number triangles that are generalizations of the Rascal Triangle and show that these Generalized Rascal Triangles are characterized by arithmetic sequences on all diagonals as well as a Rascal-like multiplication and addition rules.
