Mathematicians have traditionally been a select group of academics that produce high-impact ideas allowing substantial results in several fields of science. Throughout the past 35 years, undergraduates enrolling in mathematics or statistics have represented a nearly constant rate of approximately 1% of bachelor degrees awarded in the United States. Even within STEM majors, mathematics or statistics only constitute about 6% of undergraduate degrees awarded nationally. However, the need for STEM professionals continues to grow and the list of needed occupational skills rests heavily in foundational concepts of mathematical modeling curricula, where the interplay of measurements, computer simulation and underlying theoretical frameworks takes center stage. It is not viable to expect a majority of these STEM undergraduates would pursue a double-major that includes mathematics. Here we present our solution, some early results of implementation, and a plan for nationwide adoption.
