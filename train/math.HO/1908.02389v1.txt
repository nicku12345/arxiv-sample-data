We describe the evolution of a personal non-lecture active learning pedagogy developed in numerous courses at all university levels. A distinguishing feature is its tight integration of pre-class preparation, involving student reading/writing/questions and problem work, with in-class active learning building on this preparation, and post-class follow-on homework. We discuss challenges, rewards, and buy-in for both students and instructors.
