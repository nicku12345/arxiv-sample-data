Here, we study the genesis and evolution of geometric ideas and techniques in investigations of movable singularities of algebraic ordinary differential equations. This leads us to the work of Mihailo Petrovic on algebraic differential equations and in particular his geometric ideas captured in his polygon method from the last years of the XIXth century, which have been left completely unnoticed by the experts. This concept, also developed in a bit a different direction and independently by Henry Fine, generalizes the famous Newton-Puiseux polygonal method and applies to algebraic ODEs rather than algebraic equations. Although remarkable, the Petrovic legacy has been practically neglected in the modern literature, while the situation is less severe in the case of results of Fine. Thus, we study the development of the ideas of Petrovic and Fine and their places in contemporary mathematics.
