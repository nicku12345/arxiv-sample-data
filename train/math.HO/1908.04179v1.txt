Let X_{t} denote a stationary first-order autoregressive process. Consider five contiguous observations (in time t) of the series (e.g., X_{1}, ..., X_{5}). Let M denote the maximum of these. Let \rho be the lag-one serial correlation, which satisfies |\rho| < 1. For what value of \rho is \mathbb{E}(M) maximized? How does \mathbb{V}(M) behave for increasing \rho? Answers to these questions lie in Afonja (1972), suitably decoded.
