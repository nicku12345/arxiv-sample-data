At MOVES 2019, Barry Cipra casually introduced a new "Sol Lewitt" puzzle to fellow conference goers. Several brainstorming sessions ensued with Barry, Peter Winkler , Donna Dietz, and other attendees. This paper is to document the puzzle and some insights so others can enjoy and build on this lovely puzzle. (Look for it in an upcoming book by Peter!)
