We provide elementary proofs of several results concerning the possible outcomes arising from a fixed profile within the class of positional voting systems. Our arguments enable a simple and explicit construction of paradoxical profiles, and we also demonstrate how to choose weights that realize desirable results from a given profile. The analysis ultimately boils down to thinking about positional voting systems in terms of doubly stochastic matrices.
