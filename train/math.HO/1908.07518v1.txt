Some time ago Wastlund reformulated the Basel problem in terms of a physical system using the proportionality of the apparent brightness of a star to the inverse square of its distance. Inspired by this approach, we give another physical interpretation which, in our opinion, is simpler, natural enough, and very Eulerian in its spirit.
