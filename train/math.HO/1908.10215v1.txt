When I did my thesis defense presentation eleven years ago, I chose to present the subject of Ramsey theory from the moment calculus perspective. I don't think I did too well there (although I passed). Time has passed and this is the chance to redeem myself. Here we relate Ramsey numbers, R(k,k), with the method of moment calculus by checking the distribution of numbers of monochromatic complete subgraph of k vertices in the random graphs. We also review Delaporte distribution's connection that was mentioned in the paper by Robertson, Cipolli and Dascalu.
