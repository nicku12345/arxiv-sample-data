Let X_{t} denote a stationary first-order autoregressive process. Consider n contiguous observations (in time t) of the series (e.g., X_{1}, ..., X_{n}). Let its mean be zero and its lag-one serial correlation be \rho, which satisfies |\rho| < 1. Rice (1945) proved that (n-1) \arccos(\rho)/\pi is the expected number of sign changes. A corresponding formula for higher-order moments was proposed by Nyberg, Lizana & Ambj\"ornsson (2018), based on an independent interval approximation. We focus on the variance only, for small n, and see a promising fit between theory and model.
