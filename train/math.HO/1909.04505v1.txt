This note offers a probabilistic proof of Girard's angle excess formula for the area of a spherical triangle, based on the observation that an unbounded 3-dimensional convex cone, with single vertex at the origin, has only three kinds of 2-dimensional orthogonal projections: a 2-dimensional convex cone with one vertex, a 2-dimensional half-plane (this is an outcome of probability zero), and a 2-dimensional plane.
