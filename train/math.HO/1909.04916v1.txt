The method of variation of parameter (VOP) for solving linear ordinary differential equation is revisited in this article. Historically, Lagrange and Euler explained the method of variation of parameter in the context of perturbation method. In this article, we explain the construction of particular solutions of a linear ordinary differential equation in the light of linearly independent functions in a more systematic way. In addition, we have shown that if the time variation of the constants contribute substantially to the velocity then also the solution remains invariant. VOP method for system of n linear ODE is discussed. Duhamels principle has also been studied in reference to a system of n linear ODE for completeness of this review. Finally, applications of VOP method for constructing Green's function is reported.
