A summary of an experimental course on algebraic curves is given that was held for young learners at age 11. The course was a part of Epsilon camp, a program designed for very gifted students who have already demonstrated high interest in studying mathematics. Prerequisites for the course were mastery of Algebra I and at least one preliminary year in a prior Epsilon camp. The summary gives an overview of the flow of teaching, the achieved results and some evaluation of the given feedback.
