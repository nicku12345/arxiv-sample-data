This is an English translation of Henri Joris' article "Le chasseur perdu dans la for\^et (Un probl\`eme de g\'eom\'etrie plane)" that appeared in Elemente\ der\ Mathematik v. 35 (1980) n. 1, 1--14. Given a point P and a line L in the plane, what is the shortest search path to find L, given its distance but not its direction from P? The shortest search path was described by Isbell (1957), but a complete and detailed proof was not published until Joris (1980). I am thankful to Natalya Pluzhnikov for her dedicated work and to the Swiss Mathematical Society for permission to post this translation on the arXiv.
