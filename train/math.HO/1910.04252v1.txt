The method used by senior geodetic engineer Jean-Georges Affholder to determine what can be termed as the 'centre of gravity' of physical Europe in 1989 and 2004 relies on mathematical formulae which, in their only published version, happen to be flawed with typographical errors that do not reflect Mr. Affholder's actual mathematical exactness. This short epistemological paper summarizes the major steps of Affholder's method, provides a corrected version of the general formulae, and briefly recalls some particulars of the specific determination of the centre of gravity of physical Europe.
