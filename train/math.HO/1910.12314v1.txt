We present a study of the implementation of the Electronic Preparatory Test for beginning undergraduates reading mathematics. The Test comprises two elements: diagnostic and self-learning. The diagnostic element identifies gaps in the background knowledge, whilst the self-learning element guides students through an upcoming material. The Test lends itself to an early identification of weak and strong students coming from a wide range of background, allowing follow-ups to be made on a topic-specific basis. The results from the Tests, collected over three years, correlate positively with end-of-year examination results. We show that such a Preparatory Test can be a better predictor of success in the first-year examination in comparison with university entry qualifications alone.
