The aim of this study is to construct and compose an instructional design in combinatorial learning, especially in concept in concept of counting. The learning design that is composed is expected to optimize combinatorial thinking skills of students. This research was conducted at the first author's workplace, in combinatorial and graph consisting of 12 students. This study consists of three phases. The first phase is preliminary research, the author analyze the needs and context of learning activities, study of literature, and develop a framework of thinking. The second phases is development, the author validates the instructional design for further improvment, application in class, and improvement based on learning activities in class. The third phase is assessment, the authors provide evaluation questions to students to find out the result of the application of the design related to the optimization of combinatorial thinking. As a result, an instructional design in counting begins with review concept of finite sets, small group discusiion, class discussion, self-reflection and evaluation
