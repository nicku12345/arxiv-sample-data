This chapter proposes a view from inside the DAD, starting from determining some essential resources missing of DAD, to proposing 10 programs of research/development for developing it. It could be considered as a follow-up of Chapter 1, where Ghislaine Gueudet situates the current state of DAD in looking back to its origin: chapter 12 proposes a possible future of this approach in analyzing its current state. It determines the missing resources of DAD in questioning current and past PhD students who have anchored their research in DAD. What did/do they learn in using DAD as a main theoretical resource; to which extent did/do they estimate that they have enriched DAD by their own work? Which are, according to them, the still missing resources of DAD? Which of these resources should be developed by DAD from itself, and/or in co-working with other theoretical framework? From this inquiry, this chapter proposes ten perspectives of research, aiming to develop some theoretical blind points of DAD, or to develop some methodological tools, or to deepen the cultural/social aspects of DAD in questioning the naming systems used by teachers when interacting with resources. This chapter echoes actually different perspectives of research already present, as promising germs, in previous chapters of the book.
