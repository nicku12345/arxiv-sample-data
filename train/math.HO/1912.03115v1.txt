We give a general overview of the influence of William Thurston on the French mathematical school and we show how some of the major problems he solved are rooted in the French mathematical tradition. At the same time, we survey some of Thurston's major results and their impact. The final version of this paper will appear in the Surveys of the European Mathematical Society.
