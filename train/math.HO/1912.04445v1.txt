Tilings are around us everywhere, and our curiosity draws us to study their properties. A tiling is a way of arranging pieces on a board, such that there is no space left uncovered, nor any space covered by more than one tile. In particular, we study fault-free tilings of boards with dominoes. To be fault-free every line that intersects the tiling must also intersect the interior of at least one of the tiles. Fault-free rectangular boards have been well studied, however we look at boards that are cylinders, tori, and M\"obius strips. Using dominoes we study the various shapes of boards and see how the tileability changes. We have complete results for cylinders, tori, and M\"obius strips.
