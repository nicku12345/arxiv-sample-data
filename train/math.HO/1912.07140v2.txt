Surprisingly Richard Thompson's groups have recently appeared in Jones' subfactor theory. Vaughan Jones is famous for linking theories that are a priori completely disconnected; for instance, his celebrated polynomial for links emanating from subfactor theory. This note is about a new beautiful story in mathematics which results from a fortunate accident in the land of quantum field theory.
