This paper discusses an effort to encourage student-instructor interactive engagement through active learning activities during class time. We do not only encouraged the Kingos to speak out when an opportunity arises but also required them to record their active participation in a student journal throughout the semester. In principle, any activities which constitute active learning can and should be recorded in the 'Student Journal'. These include, but not limited to, reading definition, theorem, problem, etc.; responding to questions and inquiries; asking questions; pointing out some mistakes during class time. Despite an incentive for this participation, our experience teaching of different mathematics courses in several consecutive semesters indicates that many Kingos resist in speaking out publicly, submitting an empty journal at the end of the semester. Students' feedback on teaching evaluation at the end of the semester reveals that many dislike and against the idea of active participation and recording it in a journal. This paper discusses the reason behind this resistance and provides some potential remedies to alleviate the situation.
