The multi-layered nature of societal developments poses a challenge in the teaching and learning of history of mathematics. As an attempt to tackle this challenge we experimented with the use of Knowledge-Maps. The focus of our interest lies on the use of these Maps to support meaningful learning (Ausubel, 2000) as well as on their role as facilitating tools in oral exams. In this article we seek to relay practical experiences we have made with Knowledge-Maps in our teaching and to report findings of an exploratory study we conducted in a seminar about history of mathematics.
