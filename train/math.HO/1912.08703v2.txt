A summary of an experimental course on fractals is given that was held for young learners at age 12. The course was a part of Epsilon camp, a program designed for very gifted students who have already demonstrated high interest in studying mathematics. Prerequisites for the course were mastery of Algebra I, experience and fluency in skills like exponentials and square roots, solving equations. Also, at least two preliminary years were required in a prior Epsilon camp. The summary gives an overview of the flow of teaching, the achieved results and some evaluation of the given feedback.
