This book concentrates on functional analysis. The text is written so that it can be followed on the basis of high school mathematics. The book introduces the set theoretical foundations of mathematics, the basic theories of linear algebra and topology, and the theory of topological vector spaces. Distributions, measure theory, and some common spaces of complex-valued functions of real variables are handled, too.
