Mathematicians tend to use the phrase "arbitrarily close" to mean something along the lines of "every neighborhood of a point intersects a set". Taking the latter phrase as a technical definition for arbitrarily close leads to an alternative, or at least parallel, development of classical concepts in analysis such as closure and limits in the context of metric spaces as well as continuity, differentiation, and integration in the setting of real valued functions on the real line. In particular, a definition of integration in terms of arbitrarily close is presented here. The corresponding integral is distinct from and yet equivalent to the classical integrals of Riemann and Darboux.
