Mathematics can help analyze the arts and inspire new artwork. Mathematics can also help make transformations from one artistic medium to another, considering exceptions and choices, as well as artists' individual and unique contributions. We propose a method based on diagrammatic thinking and quantum formalism. We exploit decompositions of complex forms into a set of simple shapes, discretization of complex images, and Dirac notation, imagining a world of "prototypes" that can be connected to obtain a fine or coarse-graining approximation of a given visual image. Visual prototypes are exchanged with auditory ones, and the information (position, size) characterizing visual prototypes is connected with the information (onset, duration, loudness, pitch range) characterizing auditory prototypes. The topic is contextualized within a philosophical debate (discreteness and comparison of apparently unrelated objects), it develops through mathematical formalism, and it leads to programming, to spark interdisciplinary thinking and ignite creativity within STEAM.
