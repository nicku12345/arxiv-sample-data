An opinion piece by Abigail Thompson in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society has engendered a lot of discussion, including three open letters with over 1400 signatures. We analyze the professional profiles of signatories of these three letters, and, in particular, their citation records. We find that when restricting to R1 math professors, the means of their citations and citations per year are ordered \mu(A) < \mu(B) < \mu(C). The significance of these findings are validated using a one-sided permutation test.
