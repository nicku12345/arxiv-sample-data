The Compositional Integral is defined, formally constructed, and discussed. A direct generalization of Riemann's construction of the integral; it is intended as an alternative way of looking at First Order Differential Equations. This brief notice aims to: familiarize the reader with a different approach to integration, fabricate a notation for a modified integral, and express a startling use for infinitely nested compositions. Taking inspiration from Euler's Method for approximating First Order Differential Equations, we affiliate the method with Riemann Sums; and look at it from a different, modern angle.
