Metastability appears when a thermodynamic system, such as supercooled water (which is liquid below freezing temperature), lands on the "wrong" side of a phase transition, and remains for a very long time in a state different from its equilibrium state. There exist numerous mathematical models describing this phenomenon, including lattice models with stochastic dynamics. In this text, we will be interested in metastability in parabolic stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). Some of these equations are ill-posed, and only thanks to very recent progress in the theory of so-called singular SPDEs does one how to construct solutions, via a renormalisation procedure. The study of metastability in these systems reveals unexpected links with the theory of spectral determinants, including Fredholm and Carleman--Fredholm determinants.
