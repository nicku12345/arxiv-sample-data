The formal definition of limit is one mathematical idea that gives difficulties to most students. Therefore, it is necessary to provide engaging activity in order to construct the students' understanding about the definition. This study aims to shed light on designing activities with dynamic geometry software to facilitate the students in discovering the formal definition of limit. Forty-eight students participated in the study. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from the students' responses in and attitudes toward the activities. The students' responses were gathered directly by using the dynamic geometry software whereas an online questionnaire was used to collect the students' attitudes. The results of the study then presented in this paper. Further, a set of suggestions in designing and implementing dynamic geometry environments to foster students' understanding about formal definition of limit was also proposed.
