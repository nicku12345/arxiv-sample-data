This paper is based on a talk given at the 14-th International Workshop on Differential Geometry and Its Applications, hosted by the Petroleum Gas University from Ploiesti, between July 9-th and July 11-th, 2019. After presenting some historical facts, we will consider some geometry problems related to unification approaches. Jordan algebras and Lie algebras are the main non-associative structures. Attempts to unify non-associative algebras and associative algebras led to UJLA structures. Another algebraic structure which unifies non-associative algebras and associative algebras is the Yang-Baxter equation. We will review topics relared to the Yang-Baxter equation and Yang-Baxter systems, with the goal to unify constructions from Differential Geometry.
