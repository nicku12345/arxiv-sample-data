We introduce a kind of converse of Pompeiu's theorem. Fix an equilateral triangle \triangle A_0B_0C_0, then for any triangle \triangle ABC there is a unique point P inside the circumcircle \Gamma_0 of \triangle A_0B_0C_0 such that a triangle with edge lengths PA_0, PB_0, and PC_0 is similar to \triangle ABC. It follows that an open disc inside \Gamma_0 can be considered as a moduli space of similarity classes of triangles. We show that it is essentially equivalent to another moduli space based on a shape function of triangles which has been used in preceding studies.
