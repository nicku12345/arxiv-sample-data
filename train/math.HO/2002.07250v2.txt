We elaborate Legendre's original proof of his discovery of the first singular modulus in the history of mathematics, as well as its appearance in Ramanujan's formula for the arc length of an ellipse with said singular modulus as eccentricity, and its appearance in the three-body choreography of Bernoulli's lemniscate.
