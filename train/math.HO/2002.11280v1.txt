This is a book on elementary mathematics suitable to use in courses for first-year students of science and engineering. Students often find the formal approach to math courses rather discouraging, and demand 'rel-life applications' in order to grasp the need for these courses. The text has plenty of such applications, treated with the free software Maxima (a CAS) and Geogebra (a DGS). Its level is more or less that of a 'Pre-Calculus' course, but the contents and style of presentation are different in that they are determined by the applications in each chapter.
