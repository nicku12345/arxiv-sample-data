In this paper we reformulate Miquel-Steiner's theorem and we obtain Miquel-Steiner's point locus for an arbitrary triangle. We prove that this locus is related to conjugate circles and Brocard's circle. In addition, we obtain Miquel-Steiner's point locus in a case when cevians are perpendicular to each other, in a case when cevians form similar triangles. In addition, we prove that if Miquel-Steiner's point belongs to line, then cevinans intersection point belongs to line which is parallel to isogonal. Finally, we obtain few result for cases when Miquel-Steiner's point coincides with triangle centres.
