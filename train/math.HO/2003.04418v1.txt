The statement of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem brings up an unexpected form of reflexivity (major concept of philosophy of mathematics), so that geometry contemplates itself in it. It is therefore the revolutionary and multifaceted concept of Gaussian curvature that triggers a new conceptuality above Euclidean geometry. Here, the equality between integral of total curvature and Euler characteristic indicates that a concept of topological nature is equal to a number which expresses a concept of geometric nature. This further demonstrates that mathematics develops through the intervention of different disciplines on top of each other, as observation tools, formal structuring, new unifying points of view.
