In 1903, noted puzzle-maker Henry Dudeney published The Spider and the Fly puzzle, which asks for the shortest path along the surfaces of a square prism between two points (source and target) located on the square faces, and surprisingly showed that the shortest path traverses five faces. Dudeney's source and target points had very symmetrical locations; in this article, we allow the source and target points to be anywhere in the interior of opposite faces, but now require the square prism to be a cube. In this context, we find that, depending on source and target locations, a shortest path can traverse either three or four faces, and we investigate the conditions that lead to four-face solutions and estimate the probability of getting a four-face shortest path. We utilize a combination of numerical calculations, elementary geometry, and transformations we call corner moves of cube unfolding diagrams,
