The Secret Santa ritual, where in a group of people every member presents a gift to a randomly assigned partner, poses a combinatorial problem when considering the probabilities involved in the formation of pairs, where two persons exchange gifts mutually. We give different possible derivations for such probabilities by counting fixed-point-free permutations with certain numbers of 2-cycles.
