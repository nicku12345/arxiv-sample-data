We discuss parallels between students and teachers in the process of pedagogical reform. Reform aims for students to develop their own process for becoming independent learners, and to gain personal ownership. Likewise teachers can develop their own personally owned reform process if they have the encouragement and freedom to take individual initiative. We argue that tools, such as text materials, technology, etc., are merely objects that should be kept in perspective as secondary within an overarching ever ongoing process. And we discuss how melding teacher freedom with collaboration can foster far-reaching change.
