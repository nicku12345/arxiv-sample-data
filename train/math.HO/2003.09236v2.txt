A mapping between circles on a 3-sphere and points on a 2-sphere is well known by topologists as the Hopf fibration. While the 2-sphere is embedded in a 3-space, to visualize the 3-sphere, the 4-dimensional Euclidean space is needed. Visualizations using computer graphics based on their analytic representations became popular in the last decades. Instead, for purely synthetic constructions, we apply the recently introduced method of visualization of the 4-space by its double orthogonal projection onto two mutually perpendicular 3-spaces to investigate the Hopf fibration as a four-dimensional relation without analogy in lower dimensions. In this paper, the double orthogonal projection method is used for direct synthetic construction of the fibers of a 3-sphere from the corresponding points on a 2-sphere. The fibers of great circles on the 2-sphere create nested tori visualized in a stereographic projection into the modeling 3-space. The step-by-step construction is supplemented by dynamic 3D models showing simultaneously the 3-sphere, 2-sphere, and stereographic images of the fibers and mutual interrelations. Each step of the synthetic construction is supported by its analytic representation to highlight connections between both interpretations.
