An Inventory Sequence (S_0, S_1, S_2, ...) is the iteration of the map f defined roughly by taking an integer to its numericized description (e.g. f(1381)=211318 since "1381" has two 1's, one 3, and one 8). Our work analyzes the iteration under the infinite base. Any starting value of positive digits is known to be ultimately periodic [1] (e.g. S_0=1381 reaches the 1-cycle f(3122331418)=3122331418). Parametrizations of all possible cycles are also known [2,3]. We answer Bronstein and Fraenkel's open question of 26 years showing the pre-period of any such starting value is no more than 2M+60 where M=\max S_1. And oddly the period of the cycle can be determined after only O(\log\log M) iterations.
