This article aims to be a self-contained account of the history of the B. B. Newman Spelling Theorem, including the historical context in which it arose. First, an account of B. B. Newman and how he came to prove his Spelling Theorem is given, together with a description of the author's efforts to track this information down. Following this, a high-level description of combinatorial group theory is given. This is then tied in with a description of the history of the word problem, a fundamental problem in the area. After a description of some of the theory of one-relator groups, an important part of combinatorial group theory, the natural division line into the torsion and torsion-free case for such groups is described. This culminates in a statement of and general discussion about the B. B. Newman Spelling Theorem and its importance.
