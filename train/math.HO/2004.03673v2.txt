The Lean mathematical library mathlib is developed by a community of users with very different backgrounds and levels of experience. To lower the barrier of entry for contributors and to lessen the burden of reviewing contributions, we have developed a number of tools for the library which check proof developments for subtle mistakes in the code and generate documentation suited for our varied audience.
