This article explores the parallels between improvisational theater (Improv) and teaching in an Active Learning environment. It presents the notions of Active Teaching as a natural complement to Active Learning, and discusses how unexpected situations give rise to valuable Teaching Moments. These Teaching Moments can be strategically utilized following the rules of Improv. This article presents some examples of this in the Mathematics classroom, as well as the implementation of an Improv Seminar in the Mathematics Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
