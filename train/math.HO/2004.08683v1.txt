Fold-and-cut theorem claims the possibility to cut out from a sheet a set of straight-line drawing using only one cut of scissors, without producing any other cut in the sheet and separating all the figures at the same time, just by folding flat the paper before the last cut. This fascinating and magic result, proved by E.Demaine and alii, allows a wide exploration of mathematical issues. We present in this paper several different approaches about the use of this result, as problem based learning, direct investigation, manipulative exploration and use of ICT, most of them based on learning by doing strategy. Most of the lessons we present have been tested on a group fo 170 students of primary and middle school and around 30 adults, who showed to be mostly satisfied with the experience.
