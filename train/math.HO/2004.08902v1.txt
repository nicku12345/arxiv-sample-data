As a generalization of planar Fibonacci spirals that are based on the recurrence relation F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}, we draw assembled spirals stemming from analytic solutions of the recurrence relation G_n=a\, G_{n-1}+b\, G_{n-2}+c\, d\,^n, with positive real initial values G_0 and G_1 and coefficients a, b, c, and d. The principal coordinates given in closed-form correspond to finite sums of alternating even- or alternating odd-indexed terms G_{n}. For rectangular spirals made of straight line segments (a.k.a. spirangles), the even-indexed and the odd-indexed directional corner points asymptotically lie on mutually orthogonal oblique lines. We calculate the points of intersection and show them in the case of inwinding spirals to coincide with the point of convergence. In the case of outwinding spirals, an n-dependent quadruple of points of intersection may form. For arched spirals, interpolation between principal coordinates is performed by means of arcs of quarter-ellipses. A three-dimensional representation is exhibited, too. The continuation of the discrete sequence \{G_n\} to the complex-valued function G(t) with real argument t\inR, exhibiting spiral graphs and oscillating curves in the Gaussian plane, subsumes the values G_n for t\inN_0 as the zeros. Besides, we provide a matrix representation of G_n in terms of transformed Horadam numbers, retrieve the Shannon product difference identity as applied to G_n, and suggest a substitution method for finding a variety of other identities and summations related to G_n.
