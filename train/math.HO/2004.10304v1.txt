This paper explores two preservice mathematics teachers' understanding of mode. Participants' initial understanding and understanding following use of an interactive virtual manipulative is examined. Findings suggest that participants initially operated with less-effective definitions of mode. Preservice teachers' developed understanding following a learning trajectory is discussed.
