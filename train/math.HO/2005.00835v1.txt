We present (1) a new model for Peirce's full continuum (Vargas 2012-2015), based on an iterated sheaf of real numbers over all ordinal numbers, (2) a new model for Peirce's existential graphs (Oostra 2010), based on a new geometrical symbol for intuitionistic implication, and (3) two new mathematical gestures that synthetically capture Vargas' and Oostra's constructions (Hugueth 2017).
