We present a detailed proof of the prime number theorem suitable for a typical undergraduate- or graduate-level complex analysis course. Our presentation is particularly useful for any instructor who seeks to use the prime number theorem for a series of capstone lectures, a scaffold for a series of guided exercises, or as a framework for an inquiry-based course. We require almost no knowledge of number theory, for our aim is to make a complete proof of the prime number theorem widely accessible to complex analysis instructors. In particular, we highlight the potential pitfalls and subtleties that may catch the instructor unawares when using more terse sources.
