We discuss a practical method for assessing mathematical proof online. We examine the use of faded worked examples and reading comprehension questions to understand proof. By breaking down a given proof, we formulate a checklist that can be used to generate comprehension questions which can be assessed automatically online. We then provide some preliminary results of deploying such questions.
