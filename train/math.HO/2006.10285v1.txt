The K\=aty\=ayana \'Sulvasutra has been much less studied or discussed from a modern perspective, even though the first English translation of two adhy\=ayas (chapters) from it, by Thibaut, appeared as far back as 1882. Part of the reason for this seems to be that the general approach to the \'Sulvasutra studies has been focussed on "the mathematical knowledge found in them"; as the other earlier \'Sulvasutras, especially Baudh\=ayana and \=Apastamba substantially cover the ground in this respect the other two \'Sulvasutras, M\=anava and K\=aty\=ayana, received much less attention, the latter especially so.   On the other hand the broader purpose of historical mathematical studies extends far beyond cataloguing what was known in various cultures, rather to understand the ethos of the respective times from a mathematical point of view, in their own setting, in order to evolve a more complete picture of the mathematical developments, ups as well as downs, over history.   Viewed from this angle, a closer look at the K\=aty\=ayana \'Sulvasutra assumes significance. Coming at the tail-end of the \'Sulvasutra period, after which the \'Sulvasutra tradition died down due to various historical reasons that are really only partly understood, makes it special in certain ways. What it omits to mention from the body of knowledge found in the earlier \'Sulvasutras would also be of relevance to analyse in this context, as much as what it chooses to record. Other aspects such as the difference in language, style, would also reflect on the context. It is the purpose here to explore this direction of inquiry.
