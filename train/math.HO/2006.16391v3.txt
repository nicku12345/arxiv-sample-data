In this article we propose to give an account of the history of the Chilean collective of women mathematicians. We will begin by describing the context of the mathematical community in Chile and the process of forming the Collective, together with the first objectives we set ourselves. Then we will continue with an analysis of some reasons that support the need to create a group formed by mathematical women and also the fact of choosing horizontality and autonomy as structural pillars of our organization. On the other hand, we will refer to the main activities that we have carried out and we will provide an overview of the mathematical women's organizations that exist in Latin America. Finally, we will conclude by talking about the research project to which some of the members of the collective are dedicated nowadays (in particular the authors of this article).
