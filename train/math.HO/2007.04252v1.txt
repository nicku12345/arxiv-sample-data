The usual modelling of the syllogisms of the Organon by a calculus of classes does not include relations. Aristotle may however have envisioned them in the first two books as the category of relatives, where he allowed them to compose with themselves. Composition is the main operation in combinatory logic, which therefore offers itself for a new kind of modelling. The resulting calculus includes also composition of predicates by logical connectives.
