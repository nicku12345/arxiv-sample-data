We provide an overview of the mathematical work of K.S.S. Nambooripad, with a focus on his contributions to the theory of regular semigroups. In particular, we outline Nambooripad's seminal contributions to the structure theory of regular semigroups via his theory of {\em inductive groupoids}, and also via his theory of {\em cross connections}. We also provide information about outgrowths of his work in the algebraic theory of semigroups and its connections with several other fields of mathematics, in particular with the theory of operator algebras.
