This article describes the efforts of the SFSU-Colombia Combinatorics Initiative to build a research and learning community between California and Colombia. It seeks to broaden and deepen representation in mathematics, based on four underlying principles:   1. Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.   2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.   3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.   4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
