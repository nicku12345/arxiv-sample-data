Euler's rotation theorem states that any reconfiguration of a rigid body with one of its points fixed is equivalent to a single rotation about an axis passing through the fixed point. The theorem forms the basis for Chasles' theorem which states that it is always possible to represent the general displacement of a rigid body by a translation and a rotation about an axis. Though there are many ways to achieve this, the direction of the rotation axis and angle of rotation are independent of the translation vector. The theorem is important in the study of rigid body dynamics. There are various proofs available for these theorems, both geometric and algebraic. A novel geometric proof of Euler rotation theorem is presented here which makes use of two successive rotations about two mutually perpendicular axis to go from one configuration of the rigid body to the other with one of its points fixed.
