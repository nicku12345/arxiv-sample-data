In mathematical aspect, we introduce quantum algorithm and the mathematical structure of quantum computer. Quantum algorithm is expressed by linear algebra on a finite dimensional complex inner product space. The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics had been established in around 1930, by von Neumann. The formulation uses functional analysis, linear algebra and probability theory. The knowledge of the mathematical formulation of QM is enough quantum mechanical knowledge for approaching to quantum algorithm and it might be efficient way for mathematicians that starting with mathematical formulations of QM. We explain the mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics briefly, quantum bits, quantum gates, quantum discrete Fourier transformation, Deutsch's algorithm and Shor's algorithm.
