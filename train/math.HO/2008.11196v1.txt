We introduce a methodology to analyze citation metrics across fields of Mathematics. We use this methodology to collect and analyze the MathSciNet profiles of Full Professors of Mathematics at all 131 R1, research oriented US universities. The data recorded was citations, field, and time since first publication. We perform basic analysis and provide a ranking of US math departments, based on age corrected and field adjusted citations.
