We analyze recent criticisms of the use of hyperreal probabilities as expressed by Pruss, Easwaran, Parker, and Williamson. We show that the alleged arbitrariness of hyperreal fields can be avoided by working in the Kanovei-Shelah model or in saturated models. We argue that some of the objections to hyperreal probabilities arise from hidden biases that favor Archimedean models. We discuss the advantage of the hyperreals over transferless fields with infinitesimals. In the second part we will analyze two underdetermination theorems by Pruss and show that they hinge upon parasitic external hyperreal-valued measures, whereas internal hyperfinite measures are not underdetermined.
