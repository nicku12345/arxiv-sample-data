Using the definition of quasiperiodic function as a motivation, we introduce the idea of quasiperiodic music and detail the composition process of a quasiperiodic music piece, Raindrops in A minor. We also discuss connections between quasiperiodic music and other works of music theory and composition that make use of aperiodic order or periodic order with large periods, such as Lindenmayer systems, Vuza canons, Messiaen's Quatuor pour la Fin du Temps, and the phase music of Steve Reich.
