The Bernoulli function \operatorname{B}(s, v) = - s\, \zeta(1-s, v) interpolates the Bernoulli numbers but can be introduced independently of the zeta function. The point of departure is a modification of the Stieltjes constants based on an integral representation given by J. Jansen. The functional equation of \operatorname{B}(s, v) and its relation to the Riemann \zeta and \xi function is explored. Classical results of Hadamard, Worpitzky, and Hasse are recast in terms of \operatorname{B}(s, v). The extended Bernoulli function defines the Bernoulli numbers for odd indices harmonizing with rational numbers studied by Euler in 1735 and which are the bridge to the Euler and Andr\'{e} numbers. Interpolating functions for both the signed and the unsigned case are given. The Swiss knife polynomials let the integer sequences of the Euler-Bernoulli family calculate easily.
