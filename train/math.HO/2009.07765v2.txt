The problem of the longest head run was introduced and solved by Abraham de Moivre in the second edition of his book Doctrine of Chances (de Moivre, 1738). The closed-form solution as a finite sum involving binomial coefficients was provided in Uspensky (1937). Since then, the problem and its variations and extensions have found broad interest and diverse applications. Surprisingly, a very simple closed form can be obtained, which we present in this note.
