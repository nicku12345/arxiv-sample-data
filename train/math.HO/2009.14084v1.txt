In this manuscript a joint project between young researchers from all around the world, the Intercultural Science-Art Project, is presented, in which all participants interpreted their own research with art. Art is meant in the most inclusive way possible, including drawings and digital works, but also songs and confectionary art. This project has two main goals. On the one hand it creates tools for young scientists to communicate their research to society by artistic means. On the other hand it tries to bring together different cultures and to strengthen ties between them.
