This is an English translation of "The Resolvent Problem" by Tschebotarow/Chebotarev. In this article, Chebotarev summarizes the history of the resolvent problem from compass and ruler constructions to Klein and Hilbert' formlutions of the problems. He also describes his work on the problem up until that time. The ideas of resolvent degree and essential dimension arose out of the resolvent problems Chebotarev describes here.
