The flipped classroom technique has recently been a focus of attention for many math instructors and pedagogical researchers. Although research on the subject has greatly increased in recent years, it is still debated whether the flipped classroom technique can significantly increase the overall success of students in undergraduate math courses. While there have been meta-analyses that consider the efficacy of the technique across university disciplines and within other STEM fields, there has not yet been a systematic review within undergraduate math education. By analyzing the existing research and compiling the quantitative and qualitative data, this paper examines the efficacy of the flipped classroom technique in undergraduate math courses, ranging from introductory calculus to transition-to-proof courses, in regards to students' performance in the classes, perceptions of the technique, and associated self-efficacy. This paper also introduces the current use of the technique and covers successful implementation methods. Additionally, it highlights the flipped classroom technique's potential for improving retention of members of underrepresented groups in math by increasing their sense of belonging as well as discusses the efficacy of the method in early proof-based courses in regards to students' acquisition of sociomathematical norms.
