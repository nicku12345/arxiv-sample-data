We proposed a purely 3-D geometrical solution to Mathematics Magazine Problem 2065. Let \mathcal{Q} be a cube centered at the origin of \mathbb{R}^3. Choose a unit vector (a,b,c) uniformly at random on the surface of the unit sphere a^2+b^2+c^2=1, and let \Pi be the plane ax+by+cz=0 through the origin and normal to (a,b,c). What is the probability that the intersection of \Pi with \mathcal{Q} is a hexagon?
