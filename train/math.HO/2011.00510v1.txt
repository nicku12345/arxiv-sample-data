Previous virtual-reality simulations of curved space, which typically present honeycombs or other periodic structures, have proven effective in letting mathematicians experience curved space directly. By contrast, for students and other non-mathematicians, a game like Non-Euclidean Billiards is more effective because it gives students not just something to see, but also something to do in the curved space. However, such simulations encounter a geometrical problem: they must track the player's hands as well as her head, and in curved space the effects of holonomy would quickly lead to violations of body coherence. This is, what the player sees with her eyes would disagree with what she feels with her hands. The present article presents a solution to the body coherence problem, as well as several other questions that arise in interactive VR simulations in curved space.
