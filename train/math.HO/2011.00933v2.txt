Let (\mathcal{M},g_0) be a compact Riemannian manifold-with-boundary. We present a new proof of the classical Gaffney's inequality for differential forms in boundary value spaces over \mathcal{M}, via the variational approach \`{a} la Kozono--Yanagisawa [L^r-variational inequality for vector fields and the Helmholtz--Weyl decomposition in bounded domains, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 58 (2009), 1853--1920] combined with global computations based on the Bochner's technique.
