"No two rainbows are the same. Neither are two packs of Skittles. Enjoy an odd mix!". Using an interpretation via spatial random walks, we quantify the probability that two randomly selected packs of Skittles candy are identical and determine the expected number of packs one has to purchase until the first match. We believe this problem to be appealing for middle and high school students as well as undergraduate students at University.
