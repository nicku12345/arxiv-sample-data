How were surfaces evaluated before the invention of the sexagesimal place value notation in Mesopotamia? This chapter examines a group of five tablets containing tables for surfaces of squares and rectangles dated to the Early Dynastic period (ca. 2600-2350 BCE) and unearthed in southern Mesopotamia. In order to capture the methods used by ancient scribes to quantify surfaces, special attention is paid to the layout and organization of the tables, as well as to the way in which measurement values are written down. It is argued that these methods vary according to the dimensions of the squares or rectangles concerned: the quantification of small surfaces does not use the same mathematical tools as the quantification of large parcels of land. The chapter shows a reciprocal influence between the metrological systems adopted by the ancient scribes and the methods of calculation of surface they implemented. Some methods may reflect ancient land-surveying practices, and others may testify the emergence of new mathematical concepts applied to all kinds of surfaces, large or small. Ultimately, several different conceptualizations of the notion of surface emerge from the examination of these tables.
