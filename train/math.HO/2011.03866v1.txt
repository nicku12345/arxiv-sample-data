We present an integrable nonholonomic case of rolling without sliding of a gyroscopic ball over a sphere. This case was introduced and studied in detail by Vasilije Demchenko in his 1923 doctoral dissertation defended at the University of Belgrade, with Anton Bilimovic as the advisor. These results are absolutely unknown to modern researchers. The study is based on the C. Neumann coordinates and the Voronec principle. By using involved technique of elliptic functions, a detailed study of motion is performed. Several special classes of trajectories are distinguished, including regular and pseudo-regular precessions. So-called remarkable trajectories, introduced by Paul Painleve and Anton Bilimovic, are described in the present case. The historic context as well as the place of the results in contemporary mechanics are outlined.
