The article describes the features of the evolution of the cloud-based systems in the context of mathematics and science teachers training. The notion of the systems of computer mathematics (SCM) is considered as the special kind of learning software. The lists of the special mathematical operations, functions and methods used within the structure of modern SCM are examined. Web-SCM properties are considered as general and specific. The cloud-based SCM are taken as the special stage of Web-SCM development. The criteria for an appropriate cloud service selection to support the process of mathematics disciplines learning are revealed. The key features of the CoCalc cloud service use are considered in concern to the proposed selection criteria: the available computing capacities, the diversity of tools for training and its control, the possibility of increasing the computing capability, the openness of the program code, the availability of tools for joint editing. The results of the experimental testing of CoCalc use in the process of mathematics teachers training are described. Besides, the discussion covering the issues of integration and compatibility with the other tools and services used for mathematics learning (on the example of Octave) is presented. The main trends of the CoCalc cloud service introduction into the training process and the prospects for further research are revealed.
