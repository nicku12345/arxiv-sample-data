Traveling to different destinations is a big part of our lives. How do we know the best way to navigate from one place to another? Perhaps we could test all of the different ways of traveling between two places, but another method is using mathematics and computation to find a shortest path. We discuss how to find a shortest path and introduce Dijkstra's algorithm to minimize the total cost of a path, where the cost may be the travel distance or travel time. We also discuss how shortest paths can be used in the real world to save time and increase traveling efficiency.
