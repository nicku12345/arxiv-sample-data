Mathematics is a compulsory subject in Nigerian secondary schools, and the subject plays an important role in the scientific and technological growth and development of the nation. A shortfall in the knowledge of the students in Mathematics means that the goal may not be realized, hence the need to improve teaching methods for solving the problem of poor performance in the subject. This study evaluated the effect of the activity-based teaching method on the students' achievement in secondary school Mathematics. The design of the study was a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest research design using intact classes. Finding revealed that there was a significant difference in the Mathematics performance between the posttest mean scores of the students who were exposed to activity-based teaching methods (experimental) and those that were taught with lecture method (control) groups after controlling for the effect of the pre-test on Mathematics scores. The paper recommends among others that secondary school Mathematics teachers should be trained and retrained to update their knowledge in the use of activity-based teaching for making the teaching and learning of Mathematics more interesting and rewarding.
