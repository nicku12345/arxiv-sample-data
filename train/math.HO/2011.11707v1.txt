Buildings are mathematical objects tying a variety of subjects in algebra and geometry together in a very direct sense. They form a natural bridge to visualising more complex principles in group theory. As such they provide a beautiful opportunity to talk about the inner workings of mathematics to a broader audience, but the visualisations could also serve as a didactic tool in teaching group and building theory, and we believe they can even inspire future research.   We present an algorithmic method to visualise these geometric objects. The main accomplishment is the use of existing theory to produce three dimensional, interactive models of Bruhat-Tits buildings. The final product, an interactive web application called The Buildings Gallery, can be found at https://buildings.gallery.
