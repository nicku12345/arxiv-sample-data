We address Steel's Programme to identify a 'preferred' universe of set theory (and the best theory extending ZFC), in the context of the multiverse axioms MV and of the 'core hypothesis'. In the first part, we examine the evidential framework for MV, in particular the use of large cardinals, and of 'worlds' obtained through forcing, to represent and bind together alternative extensions of ZFC. In the second part, we address the existence and the possible features of the core of MV_T (where T is ZFC+Large Cardinals). In the last part, we discuss the hypothesis that the core is Ultimate-L, and examine whether and how the Core Universist might use salient facts about the core provable in MV_T to settle on V=Ultimate-L as the best (and ultimate) extension of ZFC. To this end, we take into account several strategies, and assess their prospects in the light of MV's evidential framework.
