The use of the symbol \lor for disjunction in formal logic is ubiquitous. Where did it come from? Some sources say it was introduced by Peano; others suggest it that it originates as an abbreviation of the Latin word for "or", vel. The origin of the symbol can be traced to Russell's first investigations into formal logic. Because of Principia, Russell's notation was influential in mathematical logic (through the work of the Hilbert school) as well as philosophy (the logical empiricists in the 1920s and 1930s, especially Carnap and early Quine).
