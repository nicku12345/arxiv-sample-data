The chaos game representation (CGR) is an interesting method to visualize one-dimensional sequences. In this paper, we show how to construct a chaos game representation. The applications mentioned here are biological, in which CGR was able to uncover patterns in DNA or proteins that were previously unknown. We also show how CGR might be introduced in the classroom, either in a modelling course or in a dynamical systems course. Some sequences that are tested are taken from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, and others are taken from sequences that arose mainly from a course in experimental mathematics.
