These notes are designed for those who either plan to work in differential geometry, or at least want to have a good reason not to do it. They should be more than sufficient for a semester-long course. We discuss smooth curves and surfaces -- the main gate to differential geometry. We focus on the techniques that are absolutely essential for further study, keeping it problem-centered, elementary, visual, and virtually rigorous.
