The purpose of the present work is to provide short and supple teaching notes for a 30 hours introductory course on elementary \textit{Enumerative Algebraic Combinatorics}. We fully adopt the \textit{Rota way} (see, e.g. \cite{KY}). The themes are organized into a suitable sequence that allows us to derive any result from the preceding ones by elementary processes. Definitions of \textit{combinatorial coefficients} are just by their \textit{combinatorial meaning}. The derivation techniques of formulae/results are founded upon constructions and two general and elementary principles/methods:   - The \textit{bad element} method (for \textit{recursive} formulae). As the reader should recognize, the bad element method might be regarded as a combinatorial companion of the idea of \textit{conditional probability}.   - The \textit{overcounting} principle (for \textit{close form} formulae).   Therefore, \textit{no computation} is required in \textit{proofs}: \textit{computation formulae are byproducts of combinatorial constructions}. We tried to provide a self-contained presentation: the only prerequisite is standard high school mathematics. We limited ourselves to the \textit{combinatorial point of view}: we invite the reader to draw the (obvious) \textit{probabilistic interpretations}.
