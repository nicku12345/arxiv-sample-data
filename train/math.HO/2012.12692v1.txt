Several continued fraction expansions for e have been produced by an automated conjecture generator (ACG) called \emph{The Ramanujan Machine}. Some of these were already known, some have recently been proved and some remain unproven. While an ACG can produce interesting putative results, it gives very limited insight into their significance. In this paper, we derive an elegant continued fraction expansion, equivalent to a result from the Ramanujan Machine, using the sequence of ratios of factorials to subfactorials or derangement numbers.
