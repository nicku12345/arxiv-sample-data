We systematically investigate properties of various triangle centers (such as orthocenter or incenter) located on the four faces of a tetrahedron. For each of six types of tetrahedra, we examine over 100 centers located on the four faces of the tetrahedron. Using a computer, we determine when any of 16 conditions occur (such as the four centers being coplanar). A typical result is: The lines from each vertex of a circumscriptible tetrahedron to the Gergonne points of the opposite face are concurrent.
