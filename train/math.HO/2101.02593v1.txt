If P is a point inside triangle ABC, then the cevians through P extended to the circumcircle of triangle ABC create a figure containing a number of curvilinear triangles. Each curvilinear triangle is bounded by an arc of the circumcircle and two line segments lying along the sides or cevians of the original triangle. We give theorems about the relationships between the radii of circles inscribed in various sets of these curvilinear triangles.
