These are the first 50 issues of This Week's Finds of Mathematical Physics, from January 19, 1993 to March 12, 1995. These issues focus on quantum gravity, topological quantum field theory, knot theory, and applications of n-categories to these subjects. However, there are also digressions into Lie algebras, elliptic curves, linear logic and other subjects. They were typeset in 2020 by Tim Hosgood. If you see typos or other problems please report them. (I already know the cover page looks weird).
