Paul Lorenzen, mathematician and philosopher of the 20th century, mentions October 1947 as the date of a crisis in his mathematical and philosophical investigations. An autograph dated 15 October 1947 documents this crisis. This article proposes a traduction and a commentary of it and sketches the circumstances of its writing on the base of his correspondence with Paul Bernays. A lettter from Lorenzen to Carl Friedrich Gethmann dated 14 January 1988 carves out the story of this crisis by showing how he soaks up the indications of his correspondents and transmutes them into an absolutely original research.
