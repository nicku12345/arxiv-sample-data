C.S. Seshadri passed away in July 2020. The first part of this article contains some reminiscences from the early 1980s, when as a graduate student in the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, I had the good fortune to learn from him. The second part is on the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem and my encounter with it.
