The rules of a popular dice game are extended to a "hyper-die" with n\in\mathbb{N} equally probable faces, numbered from 1 to n. We derive recursive and explicit expressions for the probability mass function and the cumulative distribution function of the gain G_n for arbitrary values of n.   The expected value of the gain, \mathbb{E}\,[\,G_n\,], exists for all n. A numerical study suggests that, in the limit of n \to \infty, the expectation of the scaled gain \mathbb{E}\,[\,H_n\,]=\mathbb{E}\,[\,G_n/\sqrt{n}\,] converges to a constant which is empirically conjectured to be equal to \sqrt{\pi/\,2}.   In order to prove this conjecture, we derive an analytic expression of the expected gain \mathbb{E}\,[\,G_n\,] and show that its asymptotic behaviour for n\to\infty implies indeed convergence of \mathbb{E}\,[\,H_n\,] to \sqrt{\pi/\,2}.   An analytic expression of the variance of the gain G_n is derived by a similar technique. Its asymptotic behaviour for n\to\infty implies that the variance of H_n converges to 2\!-\!\pi/\,2.   Finally, it is proved that H_n converges weakly to the Rayleigh distribution with scale parameter 1, mean \sqrt{\pi/\,2} and variance 2\!-\!\pi/\,2.
