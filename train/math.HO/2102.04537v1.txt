Robust preparation of future secondary mathematics teachers requires attention to the acquisition of mathematical knowledge for teaching. Many future teachers learn mathematics content primarily through mathematics major courses that are taught by mathematicians who do not specialize in teacher preparation. How can mathematics education researchers assist mathematicians in making explicit connections between the content of undergraduate mathematics courses and the content of secondary mathematics? We present an articulation of five types of connections that can be used in secondary mathematics teacher preparation and give examples of question prompts that mathematicians can use as applications of teaching secondary mathematics in undergraduate mathematics courses.
