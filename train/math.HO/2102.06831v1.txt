We carry out a thorough bibliometric analysis of recent publications in mathematics based on the database Web of Science. The individual relations between various features and the citations are provided, and the importance of the features is investigated with decision trees. The evolution of the features over a period of 10 years is also studied. National and international collaborations are scrutinized, but personal information are fully disregarded.
