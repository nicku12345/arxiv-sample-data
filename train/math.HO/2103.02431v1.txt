The Tijdeman-Zagier conjecture states no integer solution exists for A^X+B^Y=C^Z with positive integer bases and integer exponents greater than 2 unless gcd(A,B,C)>1. Any set of values that satisfy the conjecture correspond to a lattice point on a Cartesian graph which subtends a line in multi-dimensional space with the origin. Properties of the slopes of these lines in each plane are established as a function of coprimality of terms, such as irrationality, which enable us to explicitly prove the conjecture by contradiction.
