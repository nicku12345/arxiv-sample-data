This study aims to improve mathematics learning results in the second grade of elementary school, especially the matter of fractions. The background of the research is the low learning outcomes achieved by students due to the learning carried out does not pay attention to the level of student development. This research was classroom action research. The research subjects were 23 students. The data collection instrument used the observation sheet and documentation. Quantitative data analysis techniques with descriptive statistics were used in this study to compare conditions before and after the action was carried out. The results showed an increase in mathematics learning outcomes in the subject of fractions. Student motivation shown in the implementation of learning in the second cycle reached 3.91 (high category) with N-Gain reaching 46.49%. The level of completeness has reached 100%. The average value obtained by students in the second cycle was 80.2 and N-Gain reached 34.16%. This increase was due to the learning carried out using fractional blocks. These results illustrate that the use of fractional blocks can improve mathematics learning outcomes, especially in the subject of fractions.
