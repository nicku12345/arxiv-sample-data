The authors discuss the role of controversy in mathematics as a preface to two opposing articles on computational complexity theory: "Some basic information on information-based complexity theory" by Beresford Parlett [math.NA/9201266] and "Perspectives on information-based complexity" by J. F. Traub and Henryk Wo\'zniakowski [math.NA/9201269].
