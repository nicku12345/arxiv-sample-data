Since the subject of noncommutative geometry is now entering maturity, we felt there is need for presentation of the material at an undergraduate course level. Our review is a zero order approximation to this project. Thus, the present paper attempts to offer some motivations and mathematical prerequisites for a deeper study or at least to serve as support in glancing at recent results in theoretical physics.
