An important class of differential interactive games, namely, one of the laced interactive games is considered. A posteriori analysis of such games (including the virtual a posteriori decomposition of a collective control) is discussed. Approximations of the laced interactive games by the ordinary differential games, the frozen feedback approximation and the retarded control approximation, are constructed. Applications are briefly specified.
