We give a hierarchial set of axioms for mathematical origami. The hierachy gives the fields of Pythagorean numbers, first discussed by Hilbert, the field of Euclidean constructible numbers which are obtained by the usual constructions of straightedge and compass, and the Origami numbers, which is also the field generated from the intersections of conics or equivalently the marked ruler.
