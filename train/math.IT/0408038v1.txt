Fundamental results concerning the dynamics of abelian group codes (behaviors) and their duals are developed. Duals of sequence spaces over locally compact abelian groups may be defined via Pontryagin duality; dual group codes are orthogonal subgroups of dual sequence spaces. The dual of a complete code or system is finite, and the dual of a Laurent code or system is (anti-)Laurent. If C and C^\perp are dual codes, then the state spaces of C act as the character groups of the state spaces of C^\perp. The controllability properties of C are the observability properties of C^\perp. In particular, C is (strongly) controllable if and only if C^\perp is (strongly) observable, and the controller memory of C is the observer memory of C^\perp. The controller granules of C act as the character groups of the observer granules of C^\perp. Examples of minimal observer-form encoder and syndrome-former constructions are given. Finally, every observer granule of C is an "end-around" controller granule of C.
