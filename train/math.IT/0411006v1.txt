In this paper, we present two low complexity algorithms that achieve capacity for the noiseless (d,k) constrained channel when k=2d+1, or when k-d+1 is not prime. The first algorithm, called symbol sliding, is a generalized version of the bit flipping algorithm introduced by Aviran et al. [1]. In addition to achieving capacity for (d,2d+1) constraints, it comes close to capacity in other cases. The second algorithm is based on interleaving, and is a generalized version of the bit stuffing algorithm introduced by Bender and Wolf [2]. This method uses fewer than k-d biased bit streams to achieve capacity for (d,k) constraints with k-d+1 not prime. In particular, the encoder for (d,d+2^m-1) constraints, 1\le m<\infty, requires only m biased bit streams.
