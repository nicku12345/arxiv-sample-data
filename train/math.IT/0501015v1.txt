In this work we have considered formal power series and partial differential equations, and their relationship with Coding Theory. We have obtained the nature of solutions for the partial differential equations for Cycle Poisson Case. The coefficients for this case have been simulated, and the high tendency of growth is shown. In the light of Complex Analysis, the Hadamard Multiplication's Theorem is presented as a new approach to divide the power sums relating to the error probability, each part of which can be analyzed later.
