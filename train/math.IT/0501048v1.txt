Communications in dispersive direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) channels suffer from intersymbol and multiple-access interference, which can significantly impair performance. Joint maximum \textit{a posteriori} probability (MAP) equalization and multiuser detection with error control decoding can be used to mitigate this interference and to achieve the optimal bit error rate. Unfortunately, such optimal detection typically requires prohibitive computational complexity. This problem is addressed in this paper through the development of a reduced state trellis search detection algorithm, based on decision feedback from channel decoders. The performance of this algorithm is analyzed in the large-system limit. This analysis and simulations show that this low-complexity algorithm can obtain near-optimal performance under moderate signal-to-noise ratio and attains larger system load capacity than parallel interference cancellation.
