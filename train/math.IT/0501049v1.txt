In this paper, the performance of a binary phase shift keyed random time-hopping impulse radio system with pulse-based polarity randomization is analyzed. Transmission over frequency-selective channels is considered and the effects of inter-frame interference and multiple access interference on the performance of a generic Rake receiver are investigated for both synchronous and asynchronous systems. Closed form (approximate) expressions for the probability of error that are valid for various Rake combining schemes are derived. The asynchronous system is modelled as a chip-synchronous system with uniformly distributed timing jitter for the transmitted pulses of interfering users. This model allows the analytical technique developed for the synchronous case to be extended to the asynchronous case. An approximate closed-form expression for the probability of bit error, expressed in terms of the autocorrelation function of the transmitted pulse, is derived for the asynchronous case. Then, transmission over an additive white Gaussian noise channel is studied as a special case, and the effects of multiple-access interference is investigated for both synchronous and asynchronous systems. The analysis shows that the chip-synchronous assumption can result in over-estimating the error probability, and the degree of over-estimation mainly depends on the autocorrelation function of the ultra-wideband pulse and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio of the system. Simulations studies support the approximate analysis.
