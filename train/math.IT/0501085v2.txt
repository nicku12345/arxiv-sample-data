A new design method for high rate, fully diverse ('spherical') space frequency codes for MIMO-OFDM systems is proposed, which works for arbitrary numbers of antennas and subcarriers. The construction exploits a differential geometric connection between spherical codes and space time codes. The former are well studied e.g. in the context of optimal sequence design in CDMA systems, while the latter serve as basic building blocks for space frequency codes. In addition a decoding algorithm with moderate complexity is presented. This is achieved by a lattice based construction of spherical codes, which permits lattice decoding algorithms and thus offers a substantial reduction of complexity.
