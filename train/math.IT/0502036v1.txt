An algorithm of improving the performance of iterative decoding on perpendicular magnetic recording is presented. This algorithm follows on the authors' previous works on the parallel and serial concatenated turbo codes and low-density parity-check codes. The application of this algorithm with signal-to-noise ratio mismatch technique shows promising results in the presence of media noise. We also show that, compare to the standard iterative decoding algorithm, an improvement of within one order of magnitude can be achieved.
