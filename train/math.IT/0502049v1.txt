Generalisations of the bent property of a boolean function are presented, by proposing spectral analysis with respect to a well-chosen set of local unitary transforms. Quadratic boolean functions are related to simple graphs and it is shown that the orbit generated by successive Local Complementations on a graph can be found within the transform spectra under investigation. The flat spectra of a quadratic boolean function are related to modified versions of its associated adjacency matrix.
