In the first part of this paper [16], some results on how to compute the flat spectra of Boolean constructions w.r.t. the transforms {I,H}^n, {H,N}^n and {I,H,N}^n were presented, and the relevance of Local Complementation to the quadratic case was indicated. In this second part, the results are applied to develop recursive formulae for the numbers of flat spectra of some structural quadratics. Observations are made as to the generalised Bent properties of boolean functions of algebraic degree greater than two, and the number of flat spectra w.r.t. {I,H,N}^n are computed for some of them.
