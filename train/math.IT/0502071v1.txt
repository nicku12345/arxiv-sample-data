The performance of second order statistics (SOS) based semi-blind channel estimation in long-code DS-CDMA systems is analyzed. The covariance matrix of SOS estimates is obtained in the large system limit, and is used to analyze the large-sample performance of two SOS based semi-blind channel estimation algorithms. A notion of blind estimation efficiency is also defined and is examined via simulation results.
