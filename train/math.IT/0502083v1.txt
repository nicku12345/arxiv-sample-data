Spectral properties and performance of multi-pulse impulse radio ultra-wideband systems with pulse-based polarity randomization are analyzed. Instead of a single type of pulse transmitted in each frame, multiple types of pulses are considered, which is shown to reduce the effects of multiple-access interference. First, the spectral properties of a multi-pulse impulse radio system is investigated. It is shown that the power spectral density is the average of spectral contents of different pulse shapes. Then, approximate closed-form expressions for bit error probability of a multi-pulse impulse radio system are derived for RAKE receivers in asynchronous multiuser environments. The theoretical and simulation results indicate that impulse radio systems that are more robust against multiple-access interference than a "classical" impulse radio system can be designed with multiple types of ultra-wideband pulses.
