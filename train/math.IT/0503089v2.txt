Second order asymptotics of fixed-length source coding and intrinsic randomness is discussed with a constant error constraint. There was a difference between optimal rates of fixed-length source coding and intrinsic randomness, which never occurred in the first order asymptotics. In addition, the relation between uniform distribution and compressed data is discussed based on this fact. These results are valid for general information sources as well as independent and identical distributions. A universal code attaining the second order optimal rate is also constructed.
