We address the problem of constructing a fast lossless code in the case when the source alphabet is large. The main idea of the new scheme may be described as follows. We group letters with small probabilities in subsets (acting as super letters) and use time consuming coding for these subsets only, whereas letters in the subsets have the same code length and therefore can be coded fast. The described scheme can be applied to sources with known and unknown statistics.
