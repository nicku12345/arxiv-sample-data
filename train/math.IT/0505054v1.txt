A closed form formula of the partition weight enumerator of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes is derived for an arbitrary number of partitions. Using this result, some properties of MDS codes are discussed. The results are extended for the average binary image of MDS codes in finite fields of characteristic two. As an application, we study the multiuser error probability of Reed Solomon codes.
