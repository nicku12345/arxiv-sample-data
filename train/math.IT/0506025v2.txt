We show how any dynamic instantaneous compression algorithm can be converted to an asymmetric communication protocol, with which a server with high bandwidth can help clients with low bandwidth send it messages. Unlike previous authors, we do not assume the server knows the messages' distribution, and our protocols are the first to use only one round of communication for each message.
