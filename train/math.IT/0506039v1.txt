This paper provides details about experiments in realistic, urban, and frequency flat channels with space-time coding that specifically examines the impact of the number of receive antennas and the design criteria for code selection on the performance. Also the performance characteristics are examined of the coded modulations in the presence of finite size array geometries. This paper gives some insight into which of the theories are most useful in realistic deployments.
