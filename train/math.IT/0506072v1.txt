In this paper, we characterize the decoding region of algebraic soft decoding (ASD) of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes over erasure channels and binary symmetric channel (BSC). Optimal multiplicity assignment strategies (MAS) are investigated and tight bounds are derived to show the ASD can significantly outperform conventional Berlekamp Massey (BM) decoding over these channels for a wide code rate range. The analysis technique can also be extended to other channel models, e.g., RS coded modulation over erasure channels.
