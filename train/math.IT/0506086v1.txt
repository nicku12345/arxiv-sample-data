The problem of decentralized detection in a sensor network subjected to a total average power constraint and all nodes sharing a common bandwidth is investigated. The bandwidth constraint is taken into account by assuming non-orthogonal communication between sensors and the data fusion center via direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA). In the case of large sensor systems and random spreading, the asymptotic decentralized detection performance is derived assuming independent and identically distributed (iid) sensor observations via random matrix theory. The results show that, even under both power and bandwidth constraints, it is better to combine many not-so-good local decisions rather than relying on one (or a few) very-good local decisions.
