We present analytical expressions for optimal entropy-constrained multiple-description lattice vector quantizers which, under high-resolutions assumptions, minimize the expected distortion for given packet-loss probabilities. We consider the asymmetric case where packet-loss probabilities and side entropies are allowed to be unequal and find optimal quantizers for any number of descriptions in any dimension. We show that the normalized second moments of the side-quantizers are given by that of an L-dimensional sphere independent of the choice of lattices. Furthermore, we show that the optimal bit-distribution among the descriptions is not unique. In fact, within certain limits, bits can be arbitrarily distributed.
