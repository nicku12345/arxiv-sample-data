Capacity gain from transmitter and receiver cooperation are compared in a relay network where the cooperating nodes are close together. When all nodes have equal average transmit power along with full channel state information (CSI), it is proved that transmitter cooperation outperforms receiver cooperation, whereas the opposite is true when power is optimally allocated among the nodes but only receiver phase CSI is available. In addition, when the nodes have equal average power with receiver phase CSI only, cooperation is shown to offer no capacity improvement over a non-cooperative scheme with the same average network power. When the system is under optimal power allocation with full CSI, the decode-and-forward transmitter cooperation rate is close to its cut-set capacity upper bound, and outperforms compress-and-forward receiver cooperation. Moreover, it is shown that full CSI is essential in transmitter cooperation, while optimal power allocation is essential in receiver cooperation.
