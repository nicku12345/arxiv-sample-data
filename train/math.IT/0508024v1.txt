In this paper new codes for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) with tightly controlled peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) are proposed. We identify a new family of sequences occuring in complementary sets and show that such sequences form subsets of a new generalization of the Reed--Muller codes. Contrarily to previous constructions we present a compact description of such codes, which makes them suitable even for larger block lengths. We also show that some previous constructions just occur as special cases in our construction.
