The cutoff rate R_0(W) of a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) W is often used as a figure of merit, alongside the channel capacity C(W). Given a channel W consisting of two possibly correlated subchannels W_1, W_2, the capacity function always satisfies C(W_1)+C(W_2) \le C(W), while there are examples for which R_0(W_1)+R_0(W_2) > R_0(W). This fact that cutoff rate can be ``created'' by channel splitting was noticed by Massey in his study of an optical modulation system modeled as a M'ary erasure channel. This paper demonstrates that similar gains in cutoff rate can be achieved for general DMC's by methods of channel combining and splitting. Relation of the proposed method to Pinsker's early work on cutoff rate improvement and to Imai-Hirakawa multi-level coding are also discussed.
