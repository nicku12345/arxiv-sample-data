Just as the Hamming weight spectrum of a linear block code sheds light on the performance of a maximum likelihood decoder, the pseudo-weight spectrum provides insight into the performance of a linear programming decoder. Using properties of polyhedral cones, we find the pseudo-weight spectrum of some short codes. We also present two general lower bounds on the minimum pseudo-weight. The first bound is based on the column weight of the parity-check matrix. The second bound is computed by solving an optimization problem. In some cases, this bound is more tractable to compute than previously known bounds and thus can be applied to longer codes.
