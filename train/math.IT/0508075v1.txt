Network or graph structures are ubiquitous in the study of complex systems. Often, we are interested in complexity trends of these system as it evolves under some dynamic. An example might be looking at the complexity of a food web as species enter an ecosystem via migration or speciation, and leave via extinction.   In this paper, a complexity measure of networks is proposed based on the {\em complexity is information content} paradigm. To apply this paradigm to any object, one must fix two things: a representation language, in which strings of symbols from some alphabet describe, or stand for the objects being considered; and a means of determining when two such descriptions refer to the same object. With these two things set, the information content of an object can be computed in principle from the number of equivalent descriptions describing a particular object.   I propose a simple representation language for undirected graphs that can be encoded as a bitstring, and equivalence is a topological equivalence. I also present an algorithm for computing the complexity of an arbitrary undirected network.
