Adaptive (variable-length) codes associate variable-length codewords to symbols being encoded depending on the previous symbols in the input data string. This class of codes has been presented in [Dragos Trinca, cs.DS/0505007] as a new class of non-standard variable-length codes. Generalized adaptive codes (GA codes, for short) have been also presented in [Dragos Trinca, cs.DS/0505007] not only as a new class of non-standard variable-length codes, but also as a natural generalization of adaptive codes of any order. This paper is intended to continue developing the theory of variable-length codes by establishing several interesting connections between adaptive codes and other classes of codes. The connections are discussed not only from a theoretical point of view (by proving new results), but also from an applicative one (by proposing several applications). First, we prove that adaptive Huffman encodings and Lempel-Ziv encodings are particular cases of encodings by GA codes. Second, we show that any (n,1,m) convolutional code satisfying certain conditions can be modelled as an adaptive code of order m. Third, we describe a cryptographic scheme based on the connection between adaptive codes and convolutional codes, and present an insightful analysis of this scheme. Finally, we conclude by generalizing adaptive codes to (p,q)-adaptive codes, and discussing connections between adaptive codes and time-varying codes.
