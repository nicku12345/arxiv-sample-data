We extend Shannon's result on the capacity of channels with state information to multiple user channels. More specifically, we characterize the capacity (region) of degraded broadcast channels and physically degraded relay channels where the channel state information is causally available at the transmitters. We also obtain inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for multiple access channels with causal state information at the transmitters.
