A method for constructing sets of sequences with zero-correlation zone (ZCZ sequences) and sequence sets with low cross correlation is proposed. The method is to use families of short sequences and complete orthogonal sequence sets to derive families of long sequences with desired correlation properties. It is a unification of works of Matsufuji and Torii \emph{et al.}, and there are more choices of parameters of sets for our method. In particular, ZCZ sequence sets generated by the method can achieve a related ZCZ bound. Furthermore, the proposed method can be utilized to derive new ZCZ sets with both longer ZCZ and larger set size from known ZCZ sets. These sequence sets are applicable in broadband satellite IP networks.
