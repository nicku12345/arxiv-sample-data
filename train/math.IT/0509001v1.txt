In this paper, we complement Verd\'{u}'s work on spectral efficiency in the wideband regime by investigating the fundamental tradeoff between rate and bandwidth when a constraint is imposed on the error exponent. Specifically, we consider both AWGN and Rayleigh-fading channels. For the AWGN channel model, the optimal values of R_z(0) and \dot{R_z}(0) are calculated, where R_z(1/B) is the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a channel with bandwidth B/2 when the error-exponent is constrained to be greater than or equal to z. Based on this calculation, we say that a sequence of input distributions is near optimal if both R_z(0) and \dot{R_z}(0) are achieved. We show that QPSK, a widely-used signaling scheme, is near-optimal within a large class of input distributions for the AWGN channel. Similar results are also established for a fading channel where full CSI is available at the receiver.
