In this work, we extend the non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAF) cooperative diversity scheme to the MIMO channel. A family of space-time block codes for a half-duplex MIMO NAF fading cooperative channel with N relays is constructed. The code construction is based on the non-vanishing determinant criterion (NVD) and is shown to achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the channel. We provide a general explicit algebraic construction, followed by some examples. In particular, in the single relay case, it is proved that the Golden code and the 4x4 Perfect code are optimal for the single-antenna and two-antenna case, respectively. Simulation results reveal that a significant gain (up to 10dB) can be obtained with the proposed codes, especially in the single-antenna case.
