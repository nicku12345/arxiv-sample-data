Non-data-aided (NDA) parameter estimation is considered for binary-phase-shift-keying transmission in an additive white Gaussian noise channel. Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for signal amplitude, noise variance, channel reliability constant and bit-error rate are derived and it is shown how these parameters relate to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). An alternative derivation of the iterative maximum likelihood (ML) SNR estimator is presented together with a novel, low complexity NDA SNR estimator. The performance of the proposed estimator is compared to previously suggested estimators and the CRLB. The results show that the proposed estimator performs close to the iterative ML estimator at significantly lower computational complexity.
