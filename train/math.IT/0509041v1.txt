This paper investigates an efficient and practical information reconciliation method in the case where two parties have access to correlated continuous random variables. We show that reconciliation is a special case of channel coding and that existing coded modulation techniques can be adapted for reconciliation. We describe an explicit reconciliation method based on LDPC codes in the case of correlated Gaussian variables. We believe that the proposed method can improve the efficiency of quantum key distribution protocols based on continuous-spectrum quantum states.
