The paper introduces ensembles of accumulate-repeat-accumulate (ARA) codes which asymptotically achieve capacity on the binary erasure channel (BEC) with {\em bounded complexity} per information bit. It also introduces symmetry properties which play a central role in the construction of capacity-achieving ensembles for the BEC. The results here improve on the tradeoff between performance and complexity provided by the first capacity-achieving ensembles of irregular repeat-accumulate (IRA) codes with bounded complexity per information bit; these IRA ensembles were previously constructed by Pfister, Sason and Urbanke. The superiority of ARA codes with moderate to large block length is exemplified by computer simulations which compare their performance with those of previously reported capacity-achieving ensembles of LDPC and IRA codes. The ARA codes also have the advantage of being systematic.
