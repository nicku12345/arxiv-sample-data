We introduce a new family of concatenated codes with an outer low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and an inner low-density generator matrix (LDGM) code, and prove that these codes can achieve capacity under any memoryless binary-input output-symmetric (MBIOS) channel using maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding with bounded graphical complexity, i.e., the number of edges per information bit in their graphical representation is bounded. In particular, we also show that these codes can achieve capacity on the binary erasure channel (BEC) under belief propagation (BP) decoding with bounded decoding complexity per information bit per iteration for all erasure probabilities in (0, 1). By deriving and analyzing the average weight distribution (AWD) and the corresponding asymptotic growth rate of these codes with a rate-1 inner LDGM code, we also show that these codes achieve the Gilbert-Varshamov bound with asymptotically high probability. This result can be attributed to the presence of the inner rate-1 LDGM code, which is demonstrated to help eliminate high weight codewords in the LDPC code while maintaining a vanishingly small amount of low weight codewords.
