In this work, the geometric relation between space time block code design for the coherent channel and its non-coherent counterpart is exploited to get an analogue of the information theoretic inequality I(X;S)\le I((X,H);S) in terms of diversity. It provides a lower bound on the performance of non-coherent codes when used in coherent scenarios. This leads in turn to a code design decomposition result splitting coherent code design into two complexity reduced sub tasks. Moreover a geometrical criterion for high performance space time code design is derived.
