We explore the available degrees of freedom for various multiuser MIMO communication scenarios such as the multiple access, broadcast, interference, relay, X and Z channels. For the two user MIMO interference channel, we find a general inner bound and a genie-aided outer bound that give us the exact number of degrees of freedom in many cases. We also study a share-and-transmit scheme for transmitter cooperation. For the share-and-transmit scheme, we show how the gains of transmitter cooperation are entirely offset by the cost of enabling that cooperation so that the available degrees of freedom are not increased.
