This paper introduces a new trellis pruning method which uses nonlinear convolutional coding for peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction of filtered QPSK and 16-QAM modulations. The Nyquist filter is viewed as a convolutional encoder that controls the analog waveforms of the filter output directly. Pruning some edges of the encoder trellis can effectively reduce the PAPR. The only tradeoff is a slightly lower channel capacity and increased complexity. The paper presents simulation results of the pruning action and the resulting PAPR, and also discusses the decoding algorithm and the capacity of the filtered and pruned QPSK and 16-QAM modulations on the AWGN channel. Simulation results show that the pruning method reduces the PAPR significantly without much damage to capacity.
