A simple scheme for communication over MIMO broadcast channels is introduced which adopts the lattice reduction technique to improve the naive channel inversion method. Lattice basis reduction helps us to reduce the average transmitted energy by modifying the region which includes the constellation points. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs well, and as compared to the more complex methods (such as the perturbation method) has a negligible loss. Moreover, the proposed method is extended to the case of different rates for different users. The asymptotic behavior of the symbol error rate of the proposed method and the perturbation technique, and also the outage probability for the case of fixed-rate users is analyzed. It is shown that the proposed method, based on LLL lattice reduction, achieves the optimum asymptotic slope of symbol-error-rate (called the precoding diversity). Also, the outage probability for the case of fixed sum-rate is analyzed.
