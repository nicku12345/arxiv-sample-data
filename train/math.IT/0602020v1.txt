The structure and size of the interleaver used in a turbo code critically affect the distance spectrum and the covariance property of a component decoder's information input and soft output. This paper introduces a new class of interleavers, the inter-block permutation (IBP) interleavers, that can be build on any existing "good" block-wise interleaver by simply adding an IBP stage. The IBP interleavers reduce the above-mentioned correlation and increase the effective interleaving size. The increased effective interleaving size improves the distance spectrum while the reduced covariance enhances the iterative decoder's performance. Moreover, the structure of the IBP(-interleaved) turbo codes (IBPTC) is naturally fit for high rate applications that necessitate parallel decoding.   We present some useful bounds and constraints associated with the IBPTC that can be used as design guidelines. The corresponding codeword weight upper bounds for weight-2 and weight-4 input sequences are derived. Based on some of the design guidelines, we propose a simple IBP algorithm and show that the associated IBPTC yields 0.3 to 1.2 dB performance gain, or equivalently, an IBPTC renders the same performance with a much reduced interleaving delay. The EXIT and covariance behaviors provide another numerical proof of the superiority of the proposed IBPTC.
