It is well known that Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems have high spectral efficiency, especially when channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is available. When CSIT is obtained by feedback, it is practical to assume that the channel state feedback rate is finite and the CSIT is not perfect. For such a system, we consider beamforming and power on/off strategy for its simplicity and near optimality, where power on/off means that a beamforming vector (beam) is either turned on with a constant power or turned off. The main contribution of this paper is to accurately evaluate the information rate as a function of the channel state feedback rate. Name a beam turned on as an on-beam and the minimum number of the transmit and receive antennas as the dimension of a MIMO system. We prove that the ratio of the optimal number of on-beams and the system dimension converges to a constant for a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the numbers of transmit and receive antennas approach infinity simultaneously and when beamforming is perfect. Asymptotic formulas are derived to evaluate this ratio and the corresponding information rate per dimension. The asymptotic results can be accurately applied to finite dimensional systems and suggest a power on/off strategy with a constant number of on-beams. For this suboptimal strategy, we take a novel approach to introduce power efficiency factor, which is a function of the feedback rate, to quantify the effect of imperfect beamforming. By combining power efficiency factor and the asymptotic formulas for perfect beamforming case, the information rate of the power on/off strategy with a constant number of on-beams is accurately characterized.
