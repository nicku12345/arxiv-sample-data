This article considers the question of the teleportation protocol from an engineering perspective. The protocol ideally requires an authority that ensures that the two communicating parties have a perfectly entangled pair of particles available to them. But this cannot be unconditionally established to the satisfaction of the parties due to the fact that an unknown quantum state cannot be copied. This supports the view that quantum information cannot be treated on the same basis as classical information.
