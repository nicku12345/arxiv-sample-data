A multiple antenna broadcast channel with perfect channel state information at the receivers is considered. If each receiver quantizes its channel knowledge to a finite number of bits which are fed back to the transmitter, the large capacity benefits of the downlink channel can be realized. However, the required number of feedback bits per mobile must be scaled with both the number of transmit antennas and the system SNR, and thus can be quite large in even moderately sized systems. It is shown that a small number of antennas can be used at each receiver to improve the quality of the channel estimate provided to the transmitter. As a result, the required feedback rate per mobile can be significantly decreased.
