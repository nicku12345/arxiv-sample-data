We determine the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices for coherent block-fading correlated MIMO Rician channels. In contrast with the Rayleigh and uncorrelated Rician cases, no closed-form expressions for the eigenvectors of the optimum input covariance matrix are available. Both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues have to be evaluated by using numerical techniques. As the corresponding optimization algorithms are not very attractive, we evaluate the limit of the average mutual information when the number of transmit and receive antennas converge to infinity at the same rate. If the channel is semi-correlated, we propose an attractive optimization algorithm of the large system approximant, and establish some convergence results. Simulation results show that our approach provide reliable results even for a quite moderate number of transmit and receive antennas.
