It is well known that the presence of double scattering degrades the performance of a MIMO channel, in terms of both the multiplexing gain and the diversity gain. In this paper, a closed-form expression of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of double scattering MIMO channels is obtained. It is shown that, for a channel with nT transmit antennas, nR receive antennas and nS scatterers, the DMT only depends on the ordered version of the triple (nT,nS,nR), for arbitrary nT, nS and nR. The condition under which the double scattering channel has the same DMT as the single scattering channel is also established.
