We consider the problem of adaptive modulation for wideband DS-CDMA Rayleigh fading channels with imperfect channel state information (CSI). We assume a multidimensional signal subspace spanned by a collection of random spreading codes (multicoding) and study the effects of both the subspace dimension and the probability distribution of the transmitted symbols on the mutual information between the channel input and output in the presence of uncertainty regarding the true state of the channel. We develop approximations for the mutual information as well as both upper and lower bounds on the mutual information that are stated explicitly in terms of the dimension of the signal constellation, the number of resolvable fading paths on the channel, the current estimate of channel state, and the mean-squared-error of the channel estimate. We analyze these approximations and bounds in order to quantify the impact of signal dimension and symbol distribution on system performance.
