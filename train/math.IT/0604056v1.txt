In this note, a new method for deriving the volume of hypersphere is proposed by using probability theory. The explicit expression of the multiple times convolution of the probability density functions we should use is very complicated. But in here, we don't need its whole explicit expression. We just need the only a part of information and this fact make it possible to derive the general expression of the voulume of hypersphere. We also comments about the paradox in the hypersphere which was introduced by R.W.Hamming.
