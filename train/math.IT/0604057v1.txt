This paper introduces a new class of efficient inter connection networks called as M-graphs for large multi-processor systems.The concept of M-matrix and M-graph is an extension of Mn-matrices and Mn-graphs.We analyze these M-graphs regarding their suitability for large multi-processor systems. An(p,N) M-graph consists of N nodes, where p is the degree of each node.The topology is found to be having many attractive features prominent among them is the capability of maximal fault-tolerance, high density and constant diameter.It is found that these combinatorial structures exibit some properties like symmetry,and an inter-relation with the nodes, and degree of the concerned graph, which can be utilized for the purposes of inter connected networks.But many of the properties of these mathematical and graphical structures still remained unexplored and the present aim of the paper is to study and analyze some of the properties of these M-graphs and explore their application in networks and multi-processor systems.
