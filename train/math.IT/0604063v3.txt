In this paper, we present a concatenated coding scheme for a high rate 2\times 2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system over slow fading channels. The inner code is the Golden code \cite{Golden05} and the outer code is a trellis code. Set partitioning of the Golden code is designed specifically to increase the minimum determinant. The branches of the outer trellis code are labeled with these partitions. Viterbi algorithm is applied for trellis decoding. In order to compute the branch metrics a lattice sphere decoder is used. The general framework for code optimization is given. The performance of the proposed concatenated scheme is evaluated by simulation. It is shown that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over uncoded Golden code.
