This note considers Kak's observer-reference model of quantum information, where it is shown that qubits carry information that is sqrt n / ln n times classical information, where n is the number of components in the measurement system, to analyze information processing in quantum gates. The obverse side of this exponential nature of quantum information is that the computational complexity of implementing unconditionally reliable quantum gates is also exponential.
