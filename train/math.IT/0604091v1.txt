We consider a distributed source coding system in which several observations are communicated to the decoder using limited transmission rate. The observations must be separately coded. We introduce a robust distributed coding scheme which flexibly trades off between system robustness and compression efficiency. The optimality of this coding scheme is proved for various special cases.
