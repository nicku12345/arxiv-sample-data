This paper is motivated by a sensor network on a correlated field where nearby sensors share information, and can thus assist rather than interfere with one another. We consider a special class of two-user Gaussian interference channels (IFCs) where one of the two transmitters knows both the messages to be conveyed to the two receivers. Both achievability and converse arguments are provided for a channel with Gaussian inputs and Gaussian noise when the interference is weaker than the direct link (a so called weak IFC). In general, this region serves as an outer bound on the capacity of weak IFCs with no shared knowledge between transmitters.
