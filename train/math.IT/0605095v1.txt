We present a novel differential space-time modulation (DSTM) scheme that is single-symbol decodable and can provide full transmit diversity. It is the first known singlesymbol- decodable DSTM scheme not based on Orthogonal STBC (O-STBC), and it is constructed based on the recently proposed Minimum-Decoding-Complexity Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code (MDC-QOSTBC). We derive the code design criteria and present systematic methodology to find the solution sets. The proposed DSTM scheme can provide higher code rate than DSTM schemes based on O-STBC. Its decoding complexity is also considerably lower than DSTM schemes based on Sp(2) and double-symbol-decodable QOSTBC, with negligible or slight trade-off in decoding error probability performance.
