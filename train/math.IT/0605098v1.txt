A game-theoretic analysis is used to study the effects of receiver choice on the energy efficiency of multi-hop networks in which the nodes communicate using Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA). A Nash equilibrium of the game in which the network nodes can choose their receivers as well as their transmit powers to maximize the total number of bits they transmit per unit of energy is derived. The energy efficiencies resulting from the use of different linear multiuser receivers in this context are compared, looking at both the non-cooperative game and the Pareto optimal solution. For analytical ease, particular attention is paid to asymptotically large networks. Significant gains in energy efficiency are observed when multiuser receivers, particularly the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver, are used instead of conventional matched filter receivers.
