In this paper, the multiple access channel (MAC) with channel state is analyzed in a scenario where a) the channel state is known non-causally to the transmitters and b) there is perfect causal feedback from the receiver to the transmitters. An achievable region and an outer bound are found for a discrete memoryless MAC that extend existing results, bringing together ideas from the two separate domains of MAC with state and MAC with feedback. Although this achievable region does not match the outer bound in general, special cases where they meet are identified.   In the case of a Gaussian MAC, a specialized achievable region is found by using a combination of dirty paper coding and a generalization of the Schalkwijk-Kailath, Ozarow and Merhav-Weissman schemes, and this region is found to be capacity achieving. Specifically, it is shown that additive Gaussian interference that is known non-causally to the transmitter causes no loss in capacity for the Gaussian MAC with feedback.
