In this paper multi-user detection techniques, such as Parallel and Serial Interference Cancellations (PIC & SIC), General Minimum Mean Square Error (GMMSE) and polynomial MMSE, for the downlink of a broadband Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MCCDMA) system are investigated. The Bit Error Rate (BER) and Frame Error Rate (FER) results are evaluated, and compared with single-user detection (MMSEC, EGC) approaches, as well. The performance evaluation takes into account the system load, channel coding and modulation schemes.
