We consider Slepian-Wolf code design based on LDPC (low-density parity-check) coset codes for memoryless source-side information pairs. A density evolution formula, equipped with a concentration theorem, is derived for Slepian- Wolf coding based on LDPC coset codes. As a consequence, an intimate connection between Slepian-Wolf coding and channel coding is established. Specifically we show that, under density evolution, design of binary LDPC coset codes for Slepian-Wolf coding of an arbitrary memoryless source-side information pair reduces to design of binary LDPC codes for binary-input output-symmetric channels without loss of optimality. With this connection, many classic results in channel coding can be easily translated into the Slepian-Wolf setting.
