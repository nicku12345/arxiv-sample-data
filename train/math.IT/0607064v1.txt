We explain how to optimize finite-length LDPC codes for transmission over the binary erasure channel. Our approach relies on an analytic approximation of the erasure probability. This is in turn based on a finite-length scaling result to model large scale erasures and a union bound involving minimal stopping sets to take into account small error events. We show that the performances of optimized ensembles as observed in simulations are well described by our approximation. Although we only address the case of transmission over the binary erasure channel, our method should be applicable to a more general setting.
