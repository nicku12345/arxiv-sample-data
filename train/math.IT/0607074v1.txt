Two product array codes are used to construct the (24, 12, 8) binary Golay code through the direct sum operation. This construction provides a systematic way to find proper (8, 4, 4) linear block component codes for generating the Golay code, and it generates and extends previously existing methods that use a similar construction framework. The code constructed is simple to decode.
