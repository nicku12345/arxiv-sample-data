The problem of cooperative fusion in the presence of Byzantine sensors is considered. An information theoretic formulation is used to characterize the Shannon capacity of sensor fusion. It is shown that when less than half of the sensors are Byzantine, the effect of Byzantine attack can be entirely mitigated, and the fusion capacity is identical to that when all sensors are honest. But when at least half of the sensors are Byzantine, they can completely defeat the sensor fusion so that no information can be transmitted reliably. A capacity achieving transmit-then-verify strategy is proposed for the case that less than half of the sensors are Byzantine, and its error probability and coding rate is analyzed by using a Markov decision process modeling of the transmission protocol.
