New approach for analysis and decoding MIMO signaling is developed for usual model of nongaussion noise consists of background and impulsive noise named epsilon - noise. It is shown that non-gaussion noise performance significantly worse than gaussion ones. Stimulation results strengthen out theory. Robust in statistical sense detection rule is suggested for such kind of noise features much best robust detector performance than detector designed for Gaussian noise in impulsive environment and modest margin in background noise. Proposed algorithms performance are comparable with developed potential bound. Proposed tool, is crucial issue for MIMO communication system design, since real noise environment has impulsive character that contradict with wide used Gaussian approach, so real MIMO performance much different for Gaussian a non-Gaussian noise model.
