In this paper we address the problem of closed-form spectral evaluation of CPM. We show that the multi-h CPM signal can be conveniently generated by a PTI SM. The output is governed by a Markov chain with the unusual peculiarity of being cyclostationary and reducible; this holds also in the single-h context. Judicious reinterpretation of the result leads to a formalization through a stationary and irreducible Markov chain, whose spectral evaluation is known in closed-form from the literature. Two are the major outcomes of this paper. First, unlike the literature, we obtain a PSD in true closed-form. Second, we give novel insights into the CPM format.
