We propose a new low-density parity-check code construction scheme based on 2-lifts. The proposed codes have an advantage of admitting efficient hardware implementations. With the motivation of designing codes with low error floors, we present an analysis of the low-weight stopping set distributions of the proposed codes. Based on this analysis, we propose design criteria for designing codes with low error floors. Numerical results show that the resulting codes have low error probabilities over binary erasure channels.
