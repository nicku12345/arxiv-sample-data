We introduce a general framework for treating channels with memory and feedback. First, we generalize Massey's concept of directed information and use it to characterize the feedback capacity of general channels. Second, we present coding results for Markov channels. This requires determining appropriate sufficient statistics at the encoder and decoder. Third, a dynamic programming framework for computing the capacity of Markov channels is presented. Fourth, it is shown that the average cost optimality equation (ACOE) can be viewed as an implicit single-letter characterization of the capacity. Fifth, scenarios with simple sufficient statistics are described.
