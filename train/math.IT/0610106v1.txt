We consider communication over Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) memoryless channels with deadlines. In particular, an upper bound L is imposed on the maximum number of ARQ transmission rounds. In this setup, it is shown that incremental redundancy ARQ outperforms Forney's memoryless decoding in terms of the achievable error exponents.
