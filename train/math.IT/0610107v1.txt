In this paper, we consider the discrete memoryless interference channel with common information, in which two senders need deliver not only private messages but also certain common messages to their corresponding receivers. We derive an achievable rate region for such a channel by exploiting a random coding strategy, namely cascaded superposition coding. We reveal that the derived achievable rate region generalizes some important existing results for the interference channels with or without common information. Furthermore, we specialize to a class of deterministic interference channels with common information, and show that the derived achievable rate region is indeed the capacity region for this class of channels.
