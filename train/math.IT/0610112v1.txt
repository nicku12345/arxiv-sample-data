A general lossless joint source-channel coding scheme based on linear codes is proposed and then analyzed in this paper. It is shown that a linear code with good joint spectrum can be used to establish limit-approaching joint source-channel coding schemes for arbitrary sources and channels, where the joint spectrum of the code is a generalization of the input-output weight distribution.
