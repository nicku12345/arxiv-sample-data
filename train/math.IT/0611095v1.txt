We investigate the optimal performance of dense sensor networks by studying the joint source-channel coding problem. The overall goal of the sensor network is to take measurements from an underlying random process, code and transmit those measurement samples to a collector node in a cooperative multiple access channel with potential feedback, and reconstruct the entire random process at the collector node. We provide lower and upper bounds for the minimum achievable expected distortion when the underlying random process is Gaussian. When the Gaussian random process satisfies some general conditions, we evaluate the lower and upper bounds explicitly, and show that they are of the same order for a wide range of power constraints. Thus, for these random processes, under these power constraints, we express the minimum achievable expected distortion as a function of the power constraint. Further, we show that the achievability scheme that achieves the lower bound on the distortion is a separation-based scheme that is composed of multi-terminal rate-distortion coding and amplify-and-forward channel coding. Therefore, we conclude that separation is order-optimal for the dense Gaussian sensor network scenario under consideration, when the underlying random process satisfies some general conditions.
