A method for estimating the performance of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes decoded by hard-decision iterative decoding algorithms on binary symmetric channels (BSC) is proposed. Based on the enumeration of the smallest weight error patterns that can not be all corrected by the decoder, this method estimates both the frame error rate (FER) and the bit error rate (BER) of a given LDPC code with very good precision for all crossover probabilities of practical interest. Through a number of examples, we show that the proposed method can be effectively applied to both regular and irregular LDPC codes and to a variety of hard-decision iterative decoding algorithms. Compared with the conventional Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed method has a much smaller computational complexity, particularly for lower error rates.
