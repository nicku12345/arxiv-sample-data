The intersection problem for additive (extended and non-extended) perfect codes, i.e. which are the possibilities for the number of codewords in the intersection of two additive codes C1 and C2 of the same length, is investigated. Lower and upper bounds for the intersection number are computed and, for any value between these bounds, codes which have this given intersection value are constructed.   For all these codes the abelian group structure of the intersection is characterized. The parameters of this abelian group structure corresponding to the intersection codes are computed and lower and upper bounds for these parameters are established. Finally, constructions of codes the intersection of which fits any parameters between these bounds are given.
