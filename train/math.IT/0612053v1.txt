The belief propagation algorithm has been recognized in the information theory community as a soft-decision iterative decoding algorithm. It is the most powerful algorithm found so far for attacking hard optimization problems in channel decoding. Quantum mechanics is the foundation of modern physics with the time-independent Schrodinger equation being one of the most important equations. This paper shows that the equation can be derived from a generalized belief propagation algorithm. Such a connection on a mathematical basis might shed new insights into the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum computing.
