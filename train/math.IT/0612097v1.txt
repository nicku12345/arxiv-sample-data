Variable-length block-coding schemes are investigated for discrete memoryless channels with ideal feedback under cost constraints. Upper and lower bounds are found for the minimum achievable probability of decoding error P_{e,\min} as a function of constraints R, \AV, and \bar \tau on the transmission rate, average cost, and average block length respectively. For given R and \AV, the lower and upper bounds to the exponent -(\ln P_{e,\min})/\bar \tau are asymptotically equal as \bar \tau \to \infty. The resulting reliability function, \lim_{\bar \tau\to \infty} (-\ln P_{e,\min})/\bar \tau, as a function of R and \AV, is concave in the pair (R, \AV) and generalizes the linear reliability function of Burnashev to include cost constraints. The results are generalized to a class of discrete-time memoryless channels with arbitrary alphabets, including additive Gaussian noise channels with amplitude and power constraints.
