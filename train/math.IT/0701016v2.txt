A unification of thermodynamics and information theory is proposed. It is argued that similarly to the randomness due to collisions in thermal systems, the quenched randomness that exists in data files in informatics systems contributes to entropy. Therefore, it is possible to define equilibrium and to calculate temperature for informatics systems. The obtained temperature yields correctly the Shannon information balance in informatics systems and is consistent with the Clausius inequality and the Carnot cycle.
