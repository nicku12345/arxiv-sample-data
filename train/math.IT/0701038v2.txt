In this article we obtain estimates on the approximate eigenstructure of channels with a spreading function supported only on a set of finite measure |U|.Because in typical application like wireless communication the spreading function is a random process corresponding to a random Hilbert--Schmidt channel operator \BH we measure this approximation in terms of the ratio of the p--norm of the deviation from variants of the Weyl symbol calculus to the a--norm of the spreading function itself. This generalizes recent results obtained for the case p=2 and a=1. We provide a general approach to this topic and consider then operators with |U|<\infty in more detail. We show the relation to pulse shaping and weighted norms of ambiguity functions. Finally we derive several necessary conditions on |U|, such that the approximation error is below certain levels.
