We study the ergodic capacity of a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel with correlated scattering, which finds application in the area of UWB. Under an average power constraint, we consider a single-user, single-antenna transmission. Coherent reception is assumed with full CSI at the receiver and no CSI at the transmitter. We distinguish between a continuous- and a discrete-time channel, modeled either as random process or random vector with generic covariance. As a practically relevant example, we examine an exponentially attenuated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in detail. Finally, we give numerical results, discuss the relation between the continuous- and the discrete-time channel model and show the significant impact of correlated scattering.
