In this paper, we obtain the scaling laws of the sum-rate capacity of a MIMO X-channel, a 2 independent sender, 2 independent receiver channel with messages from each transmitter to each receiver, at high signal to noise ratios (SNR). The X-channel has sparked recent interest in the context of cooperative networks and it encompasses the interference, multiple access, and broadcast channels as special cases. Here, we consider the case with partially cooperative transmitters in which only partial and asymmetric side-information is available at one of the transmitters. It is proved that when there are M antennas at all four nodes, the sum-rate scales like 2Mlog(SNR) which is in sharp contrast to [\lfloor 4M/3 \rfloor,4M/3]log(SNR) for non-cooperative X-channels \cite{maddah-ali,jafar_degrees}. This further proves that, in terms of sum-rate scaling at high SNR, partial side-information at one of the transmitters and full side-information at both transmitters are equivalent in the MIMO X-channel.
