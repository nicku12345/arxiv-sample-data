A K-user memoryless interference channel is considered where each receiver sequentially decodes the data of a subset of transmitters before it decodes the data of the designated transmitter. Therefore, the data rate of each transmitter depends on (i) the subset of receivers which decode the data of that transmitter, (ii) the decoding order, employed at each of these receivers. In this paper, a greedy algorithm is developed to find the users which are decoded at each receiver and the corresponding decoding order such that the minimum rate of the users is maximized. It is proven that the proposed algorithm is optimal.
