List decoding for arbitrarily varying channels (AVCs) under state constraints is investigated. It is shown that rates within \epsilon of the randomized coding capacity of AVCs with input-dependent state can be achieved under maximal error with list decoding using lists of size O(1/\epsilon). Under average error an achievable rate region and converse bound are given for lists of size L. These bounds are based on two different notions of symmetrizability and do not coincide in general. An example is given that shows that for list size L the capacity may be positive but strictly smaller than the randomized coding capacity. This behavior is different than the situation without state constraints.
