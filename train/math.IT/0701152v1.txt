In this paper, an n-user Gaussian interference channel, where the power of the transmitters are subject to some upper-bounds is studied. We obtain a closed-form expression for the rate region of such a channel based on the Perron-Frobenius theorem. While the boundary of the rate region for the case of unconstrained power is a well-established result, this is the first result for the case of constrained power. We extend this result to the time-varying channels and obtain a closed-form solution for the rate region of such channels.
