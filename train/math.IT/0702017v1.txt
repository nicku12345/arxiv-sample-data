In a recent paper [1] an improved analysis concerning the analysis of List Decoding was presented. The event that the correct codeword is excluded from the list is central. For the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel an important quantity is the in [1] called effective Euclidean distance. This was earlier considered in [2] under the name Vector Euclidean Distance, where also a simple mathematical expression for this quantity was easily derived for any list size. In [1], a geometrical analysis gives this when the list size is 1, 2 or 3.
