It is well known that Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) obtained from Orthogonal Designs (ODs) are single-symbol-decodable (SSD) and from Quasi-Orthogonal Designs (QODs) are double-symbol decodable. However, there are SSD codes that are not obtainable from ODs and DSD codes that are not obtainable from QODs. In this paper a method of constructing g-symbol decodable (g-SD) STBCs using representations of Clifford algebras are presented which when specialized to g=1,2 gives SSD and DSD codes respectively. For the number of transmit antennas 2^a the rate (in complex symbols per channel use) of the g-SD codes presented in this paper is \frac{a+1-g}{2^{a-g}}. The maximum rate of the DSD STBCs from QODs reported in the literature is \frac{a}{2^{a-1}} which is smaller than the rate \frac{a-1}{2^{a-2}} of the DSD codes of this paper, for 2^a transmit antennas. In particular, the reported DSD codes for 8 and 16 transmit antennas offer rates 1 and 3/4 respectively whereas the known STBCs from QODs offer only 3/4 and 1/2 respectively. The construction of this paper is applicable for any number of transmit antennas.
