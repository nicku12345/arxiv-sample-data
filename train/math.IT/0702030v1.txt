This paper addresses the following question, which is of interest in the design and deployment of a multiuser decentralized network. Given a total system bandwidth of W Hz and a fixed data rate constraint of R bps for each transmission, how many frequency slots N of size W/N should the band be partitioned into to maximize the number of simultaneous transmissions in the network? In an interference-limited ad-hoc network, dividing the available spectrum results in two competing effects: on the positive side, it reduces the number of users on each band and therefore decreases the interference level which leads to an increased SINR, while on the negative side the SINR requirement for each transmission is increased because the same information rate must be achieved over a smaller bandwidth. Exploring this tradeoff between bandwidth and SINR and determining the optimum value of N in terms of the system parameters is the focus of the paper. Using stochastic geometry, we analytically derive the optimal SINR threshold (which directly corresponds to the optimal spectral efficiency) on this tradeoff curve and show that it is a function of only the path loss exponent. Furthermore, the optimal SINR point lies between the low-SINR (power-limited) and high-SINR (bandwidth-limited) regimes. In order to operate at this optimal point, the number of frequency bands (i.e., the reuse factor) should be increased until the threshold SINR, which is an increasing function of the reuse factor, is equal to the optimal value.
