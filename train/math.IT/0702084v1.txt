We analyze the performance of coherent impulsive-radio (IR) ultra-wideband (UWB) channel in presence of the interference generated by concurrent transmissions of the systems with the same impulsive radio. We derive a novel algorithm, using Monte-Carlo method, to calculate a lower bound on the rate that can be achieved using maximum-likelihood estimator. Using this bound we show that such a channel is very robust to interference, in contrast to the nearest-neighbor detector.
