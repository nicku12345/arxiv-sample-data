An identity between two versions of the Chernoff bound on the probability a certain large deviations event, is established. This identity has an interpretation in statistical physics, namely, an isothermal equilibrium of a composite system that consists of multiple subsystems of particles. Several information--theoretic application examples, where the analysis of this large deviations probability naturally arises, are then described from the viewpoint of this statistical mechanical interpretation. This results in several relationships between information theory and statistical physics, which we hope, the reader will find insightful.
