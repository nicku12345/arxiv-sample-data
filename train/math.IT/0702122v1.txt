The downlink of a multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC) is considered, where each receiver is equipped with a single antenna and the transmitter performs nonlinear Dirty-Paper Coding (DPC). We present an efficient algorithm that finds the optimum transmit filters and power allocation as well as the optimum precoding order(s) possibly affording time-sharing between individual DPC orders. Subsequently necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of an arbitrary precoding order are derived. Based on these we propose a suboptimal algorithm showing excellent performance and having low complexity.
