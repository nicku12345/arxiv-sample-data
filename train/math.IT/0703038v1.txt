In this paper a scheduling policy is presented which minimizes the average delay of the users. The scheduling scheme is investigated both by analysis and simulations carried out in the context of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) broadcast channels (BC). First the delay optimality is obtained for a static scenario providing solutions for specific subproblems, then the analysis is carried over to the dynamic scheme. Furthermore auxiliary tools are given for proving throughput optimality. Finally simulations show the superior performance of the presented scheme.
