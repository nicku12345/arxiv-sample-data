We describe a method of constructing a sequence of phase coded waveforms with perfect autocorrelation in the presence of Doppler shift. The constituent waveforms are Golay complementary pairs which have perfect autocorrelation at zero Doppler but are sensitive to nonzero Doppler shifts. We extend this construction to multiple dimensions, in particular to radar polarimetry, where the two dimensions are realized by orthogonal polarizations. Here we determine a sequence of two-by-two Alamouti matrices where the entries involve Golay pairs and for which the sum of the matrix-valued ambiguity functions vanish at small Doppler shifts. The Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence plays a key role in the construction of Doppler resilient sequences of Golay pairs.
