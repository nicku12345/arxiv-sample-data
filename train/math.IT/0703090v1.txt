Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier modulation scheme that provides efficient bandwidth utilization and robustness against time dispersive channels. This paper deals with the basic system model for OFDM based systems and with self-interference, or the corruption of desired signal by itself in OFDM systems. A simple transceiver based on OFDM modulation is presented. Important impairments in OFDM systems are mathematically analyzed
