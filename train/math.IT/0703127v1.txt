The existing ARQ schemes (including a hybrid ARQ) have a throughput depending on packet error probability. In this paper we describe a strategy for delay tolerant applications which provide a constant throughput until the algorithm robustness criterion is not failed. The algorithm robustness criterion is applied to find the optimum size of the retransmission block in the assumption of the small changes of coding rate within the rate compatible codes family.
