A conjugate code pair is defined as a pair of linear codes either of which contains the dual of the other. A conjugate code pair represents the essential structure of the corresponding Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) quantum error-correcting code. It is known that conjugate code pairs are applicable to quantum cryptography. In this work, a polynomial construction of conjugate code pairs is presented. The constructed pairs achieve the highest known achievable rate on additive channels, and are decodable with algorithms of polynomial complexity.
