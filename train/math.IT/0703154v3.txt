This paper studies on-chip communication with non-ideal heat sinks. A channel model is proposed where the variance of the additive noise depends on the weighted sum of the past channel input powers. It is shown that, depending on the weights, the capacity can be either bounded or unbounded in the input power. A necessary condition and a sufficient condition for the capacity to be bounded are presented.
