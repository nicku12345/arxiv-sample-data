Low density lattice codes (LDLC) are novel lattice codes that can be decoded efficiently and approach the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. In LDLC a codeword x is generated directly at the n-dimensional Euclidean space as a linear transformation of a corresponding integer message vector b, i.e., x = Gb, where H, the inverse of G, is restricted to be sparse. The fact that H is sparse is utilized to develop a linear-time iterative decoding scheme which attains, as demonstrated by simulations, good error performance within ~0.5dB from capacity at block length of n = 100,000 symbols. The paper also discusses convergence results and implementation considerations.
