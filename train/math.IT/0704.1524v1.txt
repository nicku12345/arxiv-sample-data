This paper presents new low-complexity lattice-decoding algorithms for noncoherent block detection of QAM and PAM signals over complex-valued fading channels. The algorithms are optimal in terms of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). The computational complexity is polynomial in the block length; making GLRT-optimal noncoherent detection feasible for implementation. We also provide even lower complexity suboptimal algorithms. Simulations show that the suboptimal algorithms have performance indistinguishable from the optimal algorithms. Finally, we consider block based transmission, and propose to use noncoherent detection as an alternative to pilot assisted transmission (PAT). The new technique is shown to outperform PAT.
