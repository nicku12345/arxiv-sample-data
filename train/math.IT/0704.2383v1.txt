This paper is focused on the cross-layer design problem of joint multiuser detection and power control for energy-efficiency optimization in a wireless data network through a game-theoretic approach. Building on work of Meshkati, et al., wherein the tools of game-theory are used in order to achieve energy-efficiency in a simple synchronous code division multiple access system, system asynchronism, the use of bandlimited chip-pulses, and the multipath distortion induced by the wireless channel are explicitly incorporated into the analysis. Several non-cooperative games are proposed wherein users may vary their transmit power and their uplink receiver in order to maximize their utility, which is defined here as the ratio of data throughput to transmit power. In particular, the case in which a linear multiuser detector is adopted at the receiver is considered first, and then, the more challenging case in which non-linear decision feedback multiuser detectors are employed is considered. The proposed games are shown to admit a unique Nash equilibrium point, while simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed solutions, as well as that the use of a decision-feedback multiuser receiver brings remarkable performance improvements.
