In this paper non-group permutation modulated sequences for the Gaussian channel are considered. Without the restriction to group codes rather than subsets of group codes, arbitrary rates are achievable. The code construction utilizes the known optimal group constellations to ensure at least the same performance but exploit the Gray code ordering structure of multiset permutations as a selection criterion at the decoder. The decoder achieves near maximum likelihood performance at low computational cost and low additional memory requirements at the receiver.
