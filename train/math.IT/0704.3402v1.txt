We establish the optimal diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff of coherent time, frequency and time-frequency selective-fading MIMO channels and provide a code design criterion for DM-tradeoff optimality. Our results are based on the analysis of the "Jensen channel" associated to a given selective-fading MIMO channel. While the original problem seems analytically intractable due to the mutual information being a sum of correlated random variables, the Jensen channel is equivalent to the original channel in the sense of the DM-tradeoff and lends itself nicely to analytical treatment. Finally, as a consequence of our results, we find that the classical rank criterion for space-time code design (in selective-fading MIMO channels) ensures optimality in the sense of the DM-tradeoff.
