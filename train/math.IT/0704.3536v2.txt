We introduce the concept of \delta-sequence. A \delta-sequence \Delta generates a well-ordered semigroup S in \mathbb{Z}^2 or \mathbb{R}. We show how to construct (and compute parameters) for the dual code of any evaluation code associated with a weight function defined by \Delta from the polynomial ring in two indeterminates to a semigroup S as above. We prove that this is a simple procedure which can be understood by considering a particular class of valuations of function fields of surfaces, called plane valuations at infinity. We also give algorithms to construct an unlimited number of \delta-sequences of the different existing types, and so this paper provides the tools to know and use a new large set of codes.
