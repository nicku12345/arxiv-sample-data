A multiple input multiple output (MIMO) two-way relay channel is considered, where two sources want to exchange messages with each other using multiple relay nodes, and both the sources and relay nodes are equipped with multiple antennas. Both the sources are assumed to have equal number of antennas and have perfect channel state information (CSI) for all the channels of the MIMO two-way relay channel, whereas, each relay node is either assumed to have CSI for its transmit and receive channel (the coherent case) or no CSI for any of the channels (the non-coherent case). The main results in this paper are on the scaling behavior of the capacity region of the MIMO two-way relay channel with increasing number of relay nodes. In the coherent case, the capacity region of the MIMO two-way relay channel is shown to scale linearly with the number of antennas at source nodes and logarithmically with the number of relay nodes. In the non-coherent case, the capacity region is shown to scale linearly with the number of antennas at the source nodes and logarithmically with the signal to noise ratio.
