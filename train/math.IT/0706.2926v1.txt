We discuss how the loop calculus approach of [Chertkov, Chernyak '06], enhanced by the pseudo-codeword search algorithm of [Chertkov, Stepanov '06] and the facet-guessing idea from [Dimakis, Wainwright '06], improves decoding of graph based codes in the error-floor domain. The utility of the new, Linear Programming based, decoding is demonstrated via analysis and simulations of the model [155,64,20] code.
