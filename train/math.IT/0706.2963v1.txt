Classically, communication systems are designed assuming perfect channel state information at the receiver and/or transmitter. However, in many practical situations, only an estimate of the channel is available that differs from the true channel. We address this channel mismatch scenario by using the notion of estimation-induced outage capacity, for which we provide an associated coding theorem and its strong converse, assuming a discrete memoryless channel. We illustrate our ideas via numerical simulations for transmissions over Ricean fading channels under a quality of service (QoS) constraint using rate-limited feedback channel and maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimation. Our results provide intuitive insights on the impact of the channel estimate and the channel characteristics (SNR, Ricean K-factor, training sequence length, feedback rate, etc.) on the mean outage capacity.
