In this correspondence, we propose a tight lower bound to the outage probability of discrete-input Nakagami-m block-fading channels. The approach permits an efficient method for numerical evaluation of the bound, providing an additional tool for system design. The optimal rate-diversity trade-off for the Nakagami-m block-fading channel is also derived and a tight upper bound is obtained for the optimal coding gain constant.
