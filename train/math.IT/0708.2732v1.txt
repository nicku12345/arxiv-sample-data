A generalized multiple access channel (GMAC) with one confidential message set is studied, where two users (users 1 and 2) attempt to transmit common information to a destination, and user 1 also has confidential information intended for the destination. Moreover, user 1 wishes to keep its confidential information as secret as possible from user 2. A deterministic GMAC is first studied, and the capacity-equivocation region and the secrecy capacity region are obtained. Two main classes of the GMAC are then studied: the binary GMAC and the Gaussian GMAC. For both channels, the capacity-equivocation region and the secrecy capacity region are established.
