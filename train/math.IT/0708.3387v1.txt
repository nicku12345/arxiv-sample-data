Very recently, we proposed the row-monomial distributed orthogonal space-time block codes (DOSTBCs) and showed that the row-monomial DOSTBCs achieved approximately twice higher bandwidth efficiency than the repetitionbased cooperative strategy [1]. However, we imposed two limitations on the row-monomial DOSTBCs. The first one was that the associated matrices of the codes must be row-monomial. The other was the assumption that the relays did not have any channel state information (CSI) of the channels from the source to the relays, although this CSI could be readily obtained at the relays without any additional pilot signals or any feedback overhead. In this paper, we first remove the row-monomial limitation; but keep the CSI limitation. In this case, we derive an upper bound of the data-rate of the DOSTBC and it is larger than that of the row-monomial DOSTBCs in [1]. Secondly, we abandon the CSI limitation; but keep the row-monomial limitation. Specifically, we propose the row-monomial DOSTBCs with channel phase information (DOSTBCs-CPI) and derive an upper bound of the data-rate of those codes. The rowmonomial DOSTBCs-CPI have higher data-rate than the DOSTBCs and the row-monomial DOSTBCs. Furthermore, we find the actual row-monomial DOSTBCs-CPI which achieve the upper bound of the data-rate.
