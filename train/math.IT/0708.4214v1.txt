Distributed Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes (DOSTBCs) achieving full diversity order and single-symbol ML decodability have been introduced recently for cooperative networks and an upper-bound on the maximal rate of such codes along with code constructions has been presented. In this report, we introduce a new class of Distributed STBCs called Semi-orthogonal Precoded Distributed Single-Symbol Decodable STBCs (S-PDSSDC) wherein, the source performs co-ordinate interleaving of information symbols appropriately before transmitting it to all the relays. It is shown that DOSTBCs are a special case of S-PDSSDCs. A special class of S-PDSSDCs having diagonal covariance matrix at the destination is studied and an upper bound on the maximal rate of such codes is derived. The bounds obtained are approximately twice larger than that of the DOSTBCs. A systematic construction of S-PDSSDCs is presented when the number of relays K \geq 4. The constructed codes are shown to achieve the upper-bound on the rate when K is of the form 0 modulo 4 or 3 modulo 4. For the rest of the values of K, the constructed codes are shown to have rates higher than that of DOSTBCs. It is also shown that S-PDSSDCs cannot be constructed with any form of linear processing at the relays when the source doesn't perform co-ordinate interleaving of the information symbols.
