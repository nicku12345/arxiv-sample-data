In this work, we consider a partially cooperative relay broadcast channel (PC-RBC) controlled by random parameters. We provide rate regions for two different situations: 1) when side information (SI) S^n on the random parameters is non-causally known at both the source and the relay and, 2) when side information S^n is non-causally known at the source only. These achievable regions are derived for the general discrete memoryless case first and then extended to the case when the channel is degraded Gaussian and the SI is additive i.i.d. Gaussian. In this case, the source uses generalized dirty paper coding (GDPC), i.e., DPC combined with partial state cancellation, when only the source is informed, and DPC alone when both the source and the relay are informed. It appears that, even though it can not completely eliminate the effect of the SI (in contrast to the case of source and relay being informed), GDPC is particularly useful when only the source is informed.
