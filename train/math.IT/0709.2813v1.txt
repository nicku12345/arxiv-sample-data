The main goal of coding theory is to devise efficient systems to exploit the full capacity of a communication channel, thus achieving an arbitrarily small error probability. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes are a family of block codes--characterised by admitting a sparse parity check matrix--with good correction capabilities. In the present paper the orbits of subspaces of a finite projective space under the action of a Singer cycle are investigated.
