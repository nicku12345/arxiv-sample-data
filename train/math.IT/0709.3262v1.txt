In this paper, a tutorial software to learn Information Theory basics in a practical way is reported. The software, called IT-tutor-UV, makes use of a modern existing Spanish corpus for the modeling of the source. Both the source and the channel coding are also included in this educational tool as part of the learning experience. Entropy values of the Spanish language obtained with the IT-tutor-UV are discussed and compared to others that were previously calculated under limited conditions.
