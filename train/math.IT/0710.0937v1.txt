This report is devoted to introduction in multichannel algorithm based on generalized numeration notations (GPN). The internal, external and mixed account are entered. The concept of the GPN and its classification as decomposition of an integer on composed of integers is discussed. Realization of multichannel algorithm on the basis of GPN is introduced. In particular, some properties of Fibonacci multichannel algorithm are discussed.
