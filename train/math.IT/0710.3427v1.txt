In this paper, we investigate the error correction capability of column-weight-three LDPC codes when decoded using the Gallager A algorithm. We prove that the necessary condition for a code to correct k \geq 5 errors is to avoid cycles of length up to 2k in its Tanner graph. As a consequence of this result, we show that given any \alpha>0, \exists N  such that \forall n>N, no code in the ensemble of column-weight-three codes can correct all \alpha n or fewer errors. We extend these results to the bit flipping algorithm.
