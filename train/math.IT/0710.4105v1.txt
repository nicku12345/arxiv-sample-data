Recently, the secrecy capacity of the multi-antenna wiretap channel was characterized by Khisti and Wornell [1] using a Sato-like argument. This note presents an alternative characterization using a channel enhancement argument. This characterization relies on an extremal entropy inequality recently proved in the context of multi-antenna broadcast channels, and is directly built on the physical intuition regarding to the optimal transmission strategy in this communication scenario.
