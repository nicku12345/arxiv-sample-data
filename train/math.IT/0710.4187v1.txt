This paper deals with a universal coding problem for a certain kind of multiterminal source coding system that we call the complementary delivery coding system. In this system, messages from two correlated sources are jointly encoded, and each decoder has access to one of the two messages to enable it to reproduce the other message. Both fixed-to-fixed length and fixed-to-variable length lossless coding schemes are considered. Explicit constructions of universal codes and bounds of the error probabilities are clarified via type-theoretical and graph-theoretical analyses.
