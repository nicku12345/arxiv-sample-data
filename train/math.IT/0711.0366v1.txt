In this paper, we study the number of measurements required to recover a sparse signal in {\mathbb C}^M with L non-zero coefficients from compressed samples in the presence of noise. For a number of different recovery criteria, we prove that O(L) (an asymptotically linear multiple of L) measurements are necessary and sufficient if L grows linearly as a function of M. This improves on the existing literature that is mostly focused on variants of a specific recovery algorithm based on convex programming, for which O(L\log(M-L)) measurements are required. We also show that O(L\log(M-L)) measurements are required in the sublinear regime (L = o(M)).
