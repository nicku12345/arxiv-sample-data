A pattern of a sequence is a sequence of integer indices with each index describing the order of first occurrence of the respective symbol in the original sequence. In a recent paper, tight general bounds on the block entropy of patterns of sequences generated by independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sources were derived. In this paper, precise approximations are provided for the pattern block entropies for patterns of sequences generated by i.i.d. uniform and monotonic distributions, including distributions over the integers, and the geometric distribution. Numerical bounds on the pattern block entropies of these distributions are provided even for very short blocks. Tight bounds are obtained even for distributions that have infinite i.i.d. entropy rates. The approximations are obtained using general bounds and their derivation techniques. Conditional index entropy is also studied for distributions over smaller alphabets.
