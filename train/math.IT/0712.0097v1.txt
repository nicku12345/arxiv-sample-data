The efficiency of a code is estimated by its redundancy R, while the complexity of a code is estimated by its average delay \bar N. In this work we construct word-based codes, for which R \lesssim \bar N^{-5/3}. Therefore, word-based codes can attain the same redundancy as block-codes while being much less complex.   We also consider uniform on the output codes, the benefit of which is the lack of a running synchronization error. For such codes \bar N^{-1} \lesssim R \lesssim \bar N^{-1}, except for a case when all input symbols are equiprobable, when R \leqslant \bar N^{-2} for infinitely many \bar N.
