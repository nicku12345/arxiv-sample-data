Based on cyclic and consta-cyclic simplex codes, a new explicit construction of a family of two-weight codes is presented. These two-weight codes obtained are in the form of 2-generator quasi-cyclic, or quasi-twisted structure. Based on this construction, new optimal binary quasi-cyclic [195, 8, 96], [210, 8, 104] and [240, 8, 120] codes, and good QC ternary [208, 6, 135] and [221, 6, 144] codes are thus obtained. It is also shown that many codes among the family meet the Griesmer bound and thereful are optimal.
