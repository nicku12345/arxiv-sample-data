Computation of the undetected error probability for error correcting codes over the Z-channel is an important issue, explored only in part in previous literature. In this paper we consider the case of Varshamov-Tenengol'ts codes, by presenting some analytical, numerical, and heuristic methods for unveiling this additional feature. Possible comparisons with Hamming codes are also shown and discussed.
