Given a general source with countably infinite source alphabet and a general channel with arbitrary abstract channel input/channel output alphabets, we study the joint source-channel coding problem from the information-spectrum point of view. First, we generalize Feinstein's lemma (direct part) and Verdu-Han's lemma (converse part) so as to be applicable to the general joint source-channel coding problem. Based on these lemmas, we establish a sufficient condition as well as a necessary condition for the source to be reliably transmissible over the channel with asymptotically vanishing probability of error. It is shown that our sufficient condition is equivalent to the sufficient condition derived by Vembu, Verdu and Steinberg, whereas our necessary condition is shown to be stronger than or equivalent to the necessary condition derived by them. It turns out, as a direct consequence, that separation principle in a relevantly generalized sense holds for a wide class of sources and channels, as was shown in a quite dfifferent manner by Vembu, Verdu and Steinberg. It should also be remarked that a nice duality is found between our necessary and sufficient conditions, whereas we cannot fully enjoy such a duality between the necessary condition and the sufficient condition by Vembu, Verdu and Steinberg. In addition, we demonstrate a sufficient condition as well as a necessary condition for the epsilon-transmissibility. Finally, the separation theorem of the traditional standard form is shown to hold for the class of sources and channels that satisfy the semi-strong converse property.
