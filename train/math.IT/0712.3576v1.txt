In this paper we present several strategies for multiple relay networks which are constrained by a half-duplex operation, i. e., each node either transmits or receives on a particular resource. Using the discrete memoryless multiple relay channel we present achievable rates for a multilevel partial decode-and-forward approach which generalizes previous results presented by Kramer and Khojastepour et al.. Furthermore, we derive a compress-and-forward approach using a regular encoding scheme which simplifies the encoding and decoding scheme and improves the achievable rates in general. Finally, we give achievable rates for a mixed strategy used in a four-terminal network with alternately transmitting relay nodes.
