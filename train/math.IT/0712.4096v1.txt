In this paper we present several constructions to generate codes for correcting a multidimensional cluster-error. The goal is to correct a cluster-error whose shape can be a box-error, a Lee sphere error, or an error with an arbitrary shape. Our codes have very low redundancy, close to optimal, and large range of parameters of arrays and clusters. Our main results are summarized as follows: 1) A construction of two-dimensional codes capable to correct a rectangular-error with considerably more flexible parameters from previously known constructions. Another advantage of this construction is that it is easily generalized for D dimensions. 2) A novel method based on D colorings of the D-dimensional space for constructing D-dimensional codes correcting D-dimensional cluster-error of various shapes. This method is applied efficiently to correct a D-dimensional cluster error of parameters not covered efficiently by previous onstructions. 3) A transformation of the D-dimensional space into another D-dimensional space such that a D-dimensional Lee sphere is transformed into a shape located in a D-dimensional box of a relatively small size. We use the previous constructions to correct a D-dimensional error whose shape is a D-dimensional Lee sphere. 4) Applying the coloring method to correct more efficiently a two-dimensional error whose shape is a Lee sphere. The D-dimensional case is also discussed. 5) A construction of one-dimensional codes capable to correct a burst-error of length b in which the number of erroneous positions is relatively small compared to b. This construction is generalized for D-dimensional codes. 6) Applying the constructions correcting a Lee sphere error and a cluster-error with small number of erroneous positions, to correct an arbitrary cluster-error.
