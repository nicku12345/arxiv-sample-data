The combination of source coding with decoder side-information (Wyner-Ziv problem) and channel coding with encoder side-information (Gel'fand-Pinsker problem) can be optimally solved using the separation principle. In this work we show an alternative scheme for the quadratic-Gaussian case, which merges source and channel coding. This scheme achieves the optimal performance by a applying modulo-lattice modulation to the analog source. Thus it saves the complexity of quantization and channel decoding, and remains with the task of "shaping" only. Furthermore, for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the scheme approaches the optimal performance using an SNR-independent encoder, thus it is robust to unknown SNR at the encoder.
