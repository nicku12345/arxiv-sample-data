We consider communication over the binary erasure channel (BEC) using low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and belief propagation (BP) decoding. The bit error probability for infinite block length is known by density evolution and it is well known that a difference between the bit error probability at finite iteration number for finite block length n and for infinite block length is asymptotically \alpha/n, where \alpha is a specific constant depending on the degree distribution, the iteration number and the erasure probability. Our main result is to derive an efficient algorithm for calculating \alpha for regular ensembles. The approximation using \alpha is accurate for (2,r)-regular ensembles even in small block length.
