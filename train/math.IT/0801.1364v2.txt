The lattice A_n^* is an important lattice because of its covering properties in low dimensions. Clarkson \cite{Clarkson1999:Anstar} described an algorithm to compute the nearest lattice point in A_n^* that requires O(n\log{n}) arithmetic operations. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm. While the complexity is still O(n\log{n}), it is significantly simpler to describe and verify. In practice, we find that the new algorithm also runs faster.
