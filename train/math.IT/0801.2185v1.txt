Recent outer bounds on the capacity region of Gaussian interference channels are generalized to m-user channels with m>2 and asymmetric powers and crosstalk coefficients. The bounds are again shown to give the sum-rate capacity for Gaussian interference channels with low powers and crosstalk coefficients. The capacity is achieved by using single-user detection at each receiver, i.e., treating the interference as noise incurs no loss in performance.
