Spectrum sensing is an essential functionality that enables cognitive radios to detect spectral holes and opportunistically use under-utilized frequency bands without causing harmful interference to primary networks. Since individual cognitive radios might not be able to reliably detect weak primary signals due to channel fading/shadowing, this paper proposes a cooperative wideband spectrum sensing scheme, referred to as spatial-spectral joint detection, which is based on a linear combination of the local statistics from spatially distributed multiple cognitive radios. The cooperative sensing problem is formulated into an optimization problem, for which suboptimal but efficient solutions can be obtained through mathematical transformation under practical conditions.
