We introduce the two user finite state compound Gaussian interference channel and characterize its capacity region to within one bit. The main contributions involve both novel inner and outer bounds. The inner bound is multilevel superposition coding, but the decoding of the levels is opportunistic, depending on the channel state. The genie aided outer bound is motivated by the typical error events of the achievable scheme.
