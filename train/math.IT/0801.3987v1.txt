A permutation array(permutation code, PA) of length n and distance d, denoted by (n,d) PA, is a set of permutations C from some fixed set of n elements such that the Hamming distance between distinct members \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in C is at least d. In this correspondence, we present two constructions of PA from fractional polynomials over finite field, and a construction of (n,d) PA from permutation group with degree n and minimal degree d. All these new constructions produces some new lower bounds for PA.
