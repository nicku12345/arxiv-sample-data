The capacity region of the Finite-State Multiple Access Channel (FS-MAC) with feedback that may be an arbitrary time-invariant function of the channel output samples is considered. We provided a sequence of inner and outer bounds for this region. These bounds are shown to coincide, and hence yield the capacity region, of FS-MACs where the state process is stationary and ergodic and not affected by the inputs, and for indecomposable FS-MAC when feedback is not allowed.   Though the capacity region is `multi-letter' in general, our results yield explicit conclusions when applied to specific scenarios of interest.
