We propose Dijkstra's algorithm with bounded list size after QR decomposition for decreasing the computational complexity of near maximum-likelihood (ML) detection of signals over multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels. After that, we compare the performances of proposed algorithm, QR decomposition M-algorithm (QRD-MLD), and its improvement. When the list size is set to achieve the almost same symbol error rate (SER) as the QRD-MLD, the proposed algorithm has smaller average computational complexity.
