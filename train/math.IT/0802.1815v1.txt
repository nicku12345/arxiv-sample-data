By employing the residue polynomials, a construction of constant-composition codes is given. This construction generalizes the one proposed by Xing[16]. It turns out that when d=3 this construction gives a lower bound of constant-composition codes improving the one in [10]. Moreover, for d>3, we give a lower bound on maximal size of constant-composition codes. In particular, our bound for d=5 gives the best possible size of constant-composition codes up to magnitude.
