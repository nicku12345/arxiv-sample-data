It is known that the frame error rate of turbo codes on quasi-static fading channels can be accurately approximated using the convergence threshold of the corresponding iterative decoder. This paper considers quasi-static fading channels and demonstrates that non-iterative schemes can also be characterized by a similar threshold based on which their frame error rate can be readily estimated. In particular, we show that this threshold is a function of the probability of successful frame detection in additive white Gaussian noise, normalized by the squared instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio. We apply our approach to uncoded binary phase shift keying, convolutional coding and turbo coding and demonstrate that the approximated frame error rate is within 0.4 dB of the simulation results. Finally, we introduce performance evaluation plots to explore the impact of the frame size on the performance of the schemes under investigation.
