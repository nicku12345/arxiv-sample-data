The frequency selectivity of wireless communication channels can be characterized by the delay spread Ds of the channel impulse response. If the delay spread is small compared to the bandwidth W of the input signal, that is, Ds*W approximately equal to 1, the channel appears to be flat fading. For Ds*W >> 1, the channel appears to be frequency selective, which is usually the case for wideband signals. In the first case, small scale synchronization with a precision much higher than the sampling time T = 1/W is crucial. In this paper, it is shown by analytical means that this is different in the wideband regime. Here synchronization with a precision of T is sufficient and small scale synchronization cannot further increase the captured energy at the receiver. Simulation results show that this effect already occurs for W > 50MHz for the IEEE 802.15.4a channel model.
