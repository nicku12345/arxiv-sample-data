The Ingleton-LP bound is an outer bound for the multicast capacity region, assuming the use of linear network codes. Computation of the bound is performed on a polyhedral cone obtained by taking the intersection of half-spaces induced by the basic (Shannon-type) inequalities and Ingleton inequalities. This paper simplifies the characterization of this cone, by obtaining the unique minimal set of Ingleton inequalities. As a result, the effort required for computation of the Ingleton-LP bound can be greatly reduced.
