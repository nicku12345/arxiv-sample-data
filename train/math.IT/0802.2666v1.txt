In this paper, we give a distributed joint source channel coding scheme for arbitrary correlated sources for arbitrary point in the Slepian-Wolf rate region, and arbitrary link capacities using LDPC codes. We consider the Slepian-Wolf setting of two sources and one destination, with one of the sources derived from the other source by some correlation model known at the decoder. Distributed encoding and separate decoding is used for the two sources. We also give a distributed source coding scheme when the source correlation has memory to achieve any point in the Slepian-Wolf rate achievable region. In this setting, we perform separate encoding but joint decoding.
