In this paper, for an even integer n\geq 4 and any positive integer k with {\rm gcd}(n/2,k)={\rm gcd}(n/2-k,2k)=d being odd, a class of p-ary codes \mathcal{C}^k is defined and their weight distribution is completely determined, where p is an odd prime. As an application, a class of nonbinary sequence families is constructed from these codes, and the correlation distribution is also determined.
