We present an achievable rate for general Gaussian relay networks. We show that the achievable rate is within a constant number of bits from the information-theoretic cut-set upper bound on the capacity of these networks. This constant depends on the topology of the network, but not the values of the channel gains. Therefore, we uniformly characterize the capacity of Gaussian relay networks within a constant number of bits, for all channel parameters.
