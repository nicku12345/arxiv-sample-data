Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are an important class of codes with many applications. Two algebraic methods for constructing regular LDPC codes are derived -- one based on nonprimitive narrow-sense BCH codes and the other directly based on cyclotomic cosets. The constructed codes have high rates and are free of cycles of length four; consequently, they can be decoded using standard iterative decoding algorithms. The exact dimension and bounds for the minimum distance and stopping distance are derived. These constructed codes can be used to derive quantum error-correcting codes.
