In this paper we present a novel method for decoding multiple input - multiple output (MIMO) transmission, which combines sphere decoding (SD) and zero forcing (ZF) techniques to provide near optimal low complexity and high performance constant time modified sphere decoding algorithm. This algorithm was designed especially for large number of transmit antennas, and allows efficient implementation in hardware. We do this by limiting the number of overall SD iterations. Moreover, we make sure that matrices with high condition number are more likely to undergo SD.
