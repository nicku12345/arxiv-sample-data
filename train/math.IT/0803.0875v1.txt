We consider a cognitive radio scenario where a primary and a secondary user wish to communicate with their corresponding receivers simultaneously over frequency selective channels. Under realistic assumptions that the secondary transmitter has no side information about the primary's message and each transmitter knows only its local channels, we propose a Vandermonde precoder that cancels the interference from the secondary user by exploiting the redundancy of a cyclic prefix. Our numerical examples show that VFDM, with an appropriate design of the input covariance, enables the secondary user to achieve a considerable rate while generating zero interference to the primary user.
