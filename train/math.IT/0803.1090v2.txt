In this paper we propose a very simple but powerful self-correction method for the Min-Sum decoding of LPDC codes. Unlike other correction methods known in the literature, our method does not try to correct the check node processing approximation, but it modifies the variable node processing by erasing unreliable messages. However, this positively affects check node messages, which become symmetric Gaussian distributed, and we show that this is sufficient to ensure a quasi-optimal decoding performance. Monte-Carlo simulations show that the proposed Self-Corrected Min-Sum decoding performs very close to the Sum-Product decoding, while preserving the main features of the Min-Sum decoding, that is low complexity and independence with respect to noise variance estimation errors.
