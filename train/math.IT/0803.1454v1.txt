We consider multiple access communication on a binary input additive white Gaussian noise channel using randomly spread code division. For a general class of symmetric distributions for spreading coefficients, in the limit of a large number of users, we prove an upper bound on the capacity, which matches a formula that Tanaka obtained by using the replica method. We also show concentration of various relevant quantities including mutual information, capacity and free energy. The mathematical methods are quite general and allow us to discuss extensions to other multiuser scenarios.
