In this paper, we consider linear precoding with SINR constraints for the downlink of a multiuser MISO (multiple-input single-output) communication system in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). The base station is equipped with multiple transmit antennas and each user terminal is equipped with a single receive antenna. We propose a robust design of linear precoder which transmits minimum power to provide the required SINR at the user terminals when the true channel state lies in a region of a given size around the channel state available at the transmitter. We show that this design problem can be formulated as a Second Order Cone Program (SOCP) which can be solved efficiently. We compare the performance of the proposed design with some of the robust designs reported in the literature. Simulation results show that the proposed robust design provides better performance with reduced complexity.
