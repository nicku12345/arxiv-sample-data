Like other pseudorandom sequences, decimal sequences may be used in designing a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system. They appear to be ideally suited for this since the cross-correlation of d-sequences taken over the LCM of their periods is zero. But a practical system will not, in most likelihood, satisfy the condition that the number of chips per bit is equal to the LCM for all sequences that are assigned to different users. It is essential, therefore, to determine the partial cross-correlation properties of d-sequences. This paper has performed experiments on d-sequences and found that the partial cross-correlation is less than for PN sequences, indicating that d-sequences can be effective for use in CDMA.
