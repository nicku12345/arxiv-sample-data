A scenario in which a single source communicates with a single destination via a distributed MIMO transceiver is considered. The source operates each of the transmit antennas via finite-capacity links, and likewise the destination is connected to the receiving antennas through capacity-constrained channels. Targeting a nomadic communication scenario, in which the distributed MIMO transceiver is designed to serve different standards or services, transmitters and receivers are assumed to be oblivious to the encoding functions shared by source and destination. Adopting a Gaussian symmetric interference network as the channel model (as for regularly placed transmitters and receivers), achievable rates are investigated and compared with an upper bound. It is concluded that in certain asymptotic and non-asymptotic regimes obliviousness of transmitters and receivers does not cause any loss of optimality.
