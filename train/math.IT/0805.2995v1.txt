Secure distributed data compression in the presence of an eavesdropper is explored. Two correlated sources that need to be reliably transmitted to a legitimate receiver are available at separate encoders. Noise-free, limited rate links from the encoders to the legitimate receiver, one of which can also be perfectly observed by the eavesdropper, are considered. The eavesdropper also has its own correlated observation. Inner and outer bounds on the achievable compression-equivocation rate region are given. Several different scenarios involving the side information at the transmitters as well as multiple receivers/eavesdroppers are also considered.
