The studies of the dynamics of topical dataflow of new information in the framework of a logistic model were suggested. The condition of topic balance, when the number of publications on all topics is proportional to the information space and time, was presented. General time dependence of the publication intensity in the Internet, devoted to particular topics, was observed; unlike an exponent model, it has a saturation area. Some limitations of a logistic model were identified opening the way for further research.
