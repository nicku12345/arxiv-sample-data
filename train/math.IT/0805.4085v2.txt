One of the approaches to the solution of the navigation problem in current information flows is ranking the documents according to their popularity level. The definition of local and global news popularity which is based on the number of similar-in-content documents, published within local and global time interval, was suggested. Mutual behavior of the documents of local and global popularity levels was studied. The algorithm of detecting the documents which received great popularity before new topics appeared was suggested.
