An erasure channel with a fixed alphabet size q, where q \gg 1, is studied. It is proved that over any erasure channel (with or without memory), Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes achieve the minimum probability of error (assuming maximum likelihood decoding). Assuming a memoryless erasure channel, the error exponent of MDS codes are compared with that of random codes and linear random codes. It is shown that the envelopes of all these exponents are identical for rates above the critical rate. Noting the optimality of MDS codes, it is concluded that both random codes and linear random codes are exponentially optimal, whether the block sizes is larger or smaller than the alphabet size.
