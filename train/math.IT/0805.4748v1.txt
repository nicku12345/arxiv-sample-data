Quasi-twisted (QT) codes are a generalization of quasi-cyclic (QC) codes. Based on consta-cyclic simplex codes, a new explicit construction of a family of 2-generator quasi-twisted (QT) two-weight codes is presented. It is also shown that many codes in the family meet the Griesmer bound and therefore are length-optimal. New distance-optimal binary QC [195, 8, 96], [210, 8, 104] and [240, 8, 120] codes, and good ternary QC [208, 6, 135] and [221, 6, 144] codes are also obtained by the construction.
