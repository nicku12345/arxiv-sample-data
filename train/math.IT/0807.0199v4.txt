In the context of space-time block codes (STBCs), the theory of generalized quaternion and biquaternion algebras (i.e., tensor products of two quaternion algebras) over arbitrary base fields is presented, as well as quadratic form theoretic criteria to check if such algebras are division algebras. For base fields relevant to STBCs, these criteria are exploited, via Springer's theorem, to construct several explicit infinite families of (bi-)quaternion division algebras. These are used to obtain new 2\x 2 and 4\x 4 STBCs.
