Interest in selection relaying is growing. The recent developments in this area have largely focused on information theoretic analyses such as outage performance. Some of these analyses are accurate only at high SNR regimes. In this paper error rate analyses that are sufficiently accurate over a wide range of SNR regimes are provided. The motivations for this work are that practical systems operate at far lower SNR values than those supported by the high SNR analysis. To enable designers to make informed decisions regarding network design and deployment, it is imperative that system performance is evaluated with a reasonable degree of accuracy over practical SNR regimes. Simulations have been used to corroborate the analytical results, as close agreement between the two is observed.
