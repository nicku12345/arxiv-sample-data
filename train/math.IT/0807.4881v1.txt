In this paper, we propose a scheme called "beam-nulling" for MIMO adaptation. In the beam-nulling scheme, the eigenvector of the weakest subchannel is fed back and then signals are sent over a generated subspace orthogonal to the weakest subchannel. Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the capacity of beam-nulling is closed to the optimal water-filling at medium SNR. Additionally, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of MMSE receiver is derived for beam-nulling. Then the paper presents the associated average bit-error rate (BER) of beam-nulling numerically which is verified by simulation. Simulation results are also provided to compare beam-nulling with beamforming. To improve performance further, beam-nulling is concatenated with linear dispersion code. Simulation results are also provided to compare the concatenated beam-nulling scheme with the beamforming scheme at the same data rate. Additionally, the existing beamforming and new proposed beam-nulling can be extended if more than one eigenvector is available at the transmitter. The new extended schemes are called multi-dimensional (MD) beamforming and MD beam-nulling. Theoretical analysis and numerical results in terms of capacity are also provided to evaluate the new extended schemes. Simulation results show that the MD scheme with LDC can outperform the MD scheme with STBC significantly when the data rate is high.
