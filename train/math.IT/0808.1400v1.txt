Space-time block codes (STBCs) from non-square complex orthogonal designs are bandwidth efficient when compared with those from square real/complex orthogonal designs. Though there exists rate-1 ROD for any number of transmit antennas, rate-1 complex orthogonal designs (COD) does not exist for more than 2 transmit antennas. Liang (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2003) and Lu et al (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2005) have constructed a class of maximal rate non-square CODs where the rate is {1/2}+\frac{1}{n} if number of transmit antennas n is even and {1/2}+\frac{1}{n+1} if n is odd. In this paper, we present a simple construction for maximal rate non-square CODs obtained from square CODs which resembles the construction of rate-1 non-square RODs from square RODs. These designs are shown to be amenable for construction of a class of generalized CODs (called Coordinate-Interleaved Scaled CODs) with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) having the same parameters as the maximal rate codes. Simulation results indicate that these codes perform better than the existing maximal rate codes under peak power constraint while performing the same under average power constraint.
