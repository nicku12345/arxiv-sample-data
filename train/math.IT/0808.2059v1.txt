A multi-hop relay channel with multiple antenna terminals in a quasi-static slow fading environment is considered. For both full-duplex and half-duplex relays the fundamental diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) is analyzed. It is shown that, while decode-and-forward (DF) relaying achieves the optimal DMT in the full-duplex relay scenario, the dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF) protocol is needed to achieve the optimal DMT if the relay is constrained to half-duplex operation. For the latter case, static protocols are considered as well, and the corresponding achievable DMT performance is characterized.
