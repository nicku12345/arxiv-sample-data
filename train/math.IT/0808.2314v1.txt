This paper studies a symmetric K user Gaussian interference channel with K transmitters and K receivers. A "very strong" interference regime is derived for this channel setup. A "very strong" interference regime is one where the capacity region of the interference channel is the same as the capacity region of the channel with no interference. In this regime, the interference can be perfectly canceled by all the receivers without incurring any rate penalties. A "very strong" interference condition for an example symmetric K user deterministic interference channel is also presented.
