A new class of analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters using a flaky quantiser, called the \beta-encoder, has been shown to have exponential bit rate accuracy while possessing a self-correction property for fluctuations of the amplifier factor \beta and the quantiser threshold \nu. The probabilistic behavior of such a flaky quantiser is explained as the deterministic dynamics of the multi-valued R\'enyi map. That is, a sample x is always confined to a contracted subinterval while successive approximations of x are performed using \beta-expansion even if \nu may vary at each iteration. This viewpoint enables us to get the decoded sample, which is equal to the midpoint of the subinterval, and its associated characteristic equation for recovering \beta which improves the quantisation error by more than 3{dB} when \beta>1.5. The invariant subinterval under the R\'enyi map shows that \nu should be set to around the midpoint of its associated greedy and lazy values. %in terms of its quantisation MSE (mean square error). Furthermore, a new A/D converter is introduced called the negative \beta-encoder, which further improves the quantisation error of the \beta-encoder. A two-state Markov chain describing the \beta-encoder suggests that a negative eigenvalue of its associated transition probability matrix reduces the quantisation error.
