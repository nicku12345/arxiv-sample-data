Cooperative communications have emerged as a significant concept to improve reliability and throughput in wireless systems. On the other hand, WLANs based on random access mechanism have become popular due to ease of deployment and low cost. Since cooperation introduces extra transmissions among the cooperating nodes and therefore increases the number of packet collisions, it is not clear whether there is any benefit from using physical layer cooperation under random access. In this paper, we develop new low complexity cooperative protocols for random access that outperform the conventional non cooperative scheme for a large range of signal-to-noise ratios.
