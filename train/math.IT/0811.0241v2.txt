This paper proposes a joint transmitter-receiver design to minimize the weighted sum power under the post-processing signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (post-SINR) constraints for all subchannels. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can not only satisfy the post-SINR constraints but also easily adjust the power distribution among the users by changing the weights accordingly. Hence the algorithm can be used to alleviates the adjacent cell interference by reducing the transmitting power to the edge users without performance penalty.
