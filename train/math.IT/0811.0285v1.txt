We consider the problem of communicating the sum of m sources to n terminals in a directed acyclic network. Recently, it was shown that for a network of unit capacity links with either m=2 or n=2, the sum of the sources can be communicated to the terminals if and only if every source-terminal pair is connected in the network. We show in this paper that for any finite set of primes, there exists a network where the sum of the sources can be communicated to the terminals only over finite fields of characteristic belonging to that set. As a corollary, this gives networks where the sum can not be communicated over any finite field even though every source is connected to every terminal.
