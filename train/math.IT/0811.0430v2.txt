This paper derives the analytic expression of the sample auto-correlation matrix from the least-squared channel estimation of doubly selective fading channels for OFDM systems. According to the expression, the sample auto-correlation matrix reveals the bias property which would cause the model mismatch and therefore deteriorate the performance of channel estimation. Numerical results demonstrate the bias property and corresponding analysis.
