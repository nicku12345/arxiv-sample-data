The accuracy of channel state information (CSI) is critical for improving the capacity of wireless networks. In this paper, we introduce a training protocol for wireless relay networks that uses channel estimation and feedforwarding methods. The feedforwarding method is the distinctive feature of the proposed protocol. As we show, each relay feedforwards the imperfect CSI to the destination in a way that provides a higher network capacity and a faster transfer of the CSI than the existing protocols. In addition, we show the importance of the effective CSI accuracy on the wireless relay network capacity by comparing networks with the perfect effective CSI, imperfect effective CSI, and noisy imperfect effective CSI available at the destination.
