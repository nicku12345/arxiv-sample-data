In this paper two cryptographic methods are introduced. In the first method the presence of a certain size subgroup of persons can be checked for an action to take place. For this we use fragments of Raptor codes delivered to the group members. In the other method a selection of a subset of objects can be made secret. Also, it can be proven afterwards, what the original selection was.
