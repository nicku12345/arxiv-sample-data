Consider a memoryless degraded broadcast channel (DBC) in which the channel output is a single-letter function of the channel input and the channel noise. As examples, for the Gaussian broadcast channel (BC) this single-letter function is regular Euclidian addition and for the binary-symmetric BC this single-letter function is Galois-Field-two addition. This paper identifies several classes of discrete memoryless DBCs for which a relatively simple encoding scheme, which we call natural encoding, achieves capacity. Natural Encoding (NE) combines symbols from independent codebooks (one for each receiver) using the same single-letter function that adds distortion to the channel. The alphabet size of each NE codebook is bounded by that of the channel input.   Inspired by Witsenhausen and Wyner, this paper defines the conditional entropy bound function F^*, studies its properties, and applies them to show that NE achieves the boundary of the capacity region for the multi-receiver broadcast Z channel. Then, this paper defines the input-symmetric DBC, introduces permutation encoding for the input-symmetric DBC, and proves its optimality. Because it is a special case of permutation encoding, NE is capacity achieving for the two-receiver group-operation DBC. Combining the broadcast Z channel and group-operation DBC results yields a proof that NE is also optimal for the discrete multiplication DBC. Along the way, the paper also provides explicit parametric expressions for the two-receiver binary-symmetric DBC and broadcast Z channel.
