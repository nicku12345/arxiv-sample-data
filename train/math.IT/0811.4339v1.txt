Many powerful data detection algorithms employed in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, such as sphere decoding (SD) and lattice-reduction (LR)-aided detection, were initially designed for infinite lattices. Detection in MIMO systems is, however, based on finite lattices. In this paper, we systematically study the consequences of finite lattice-size for the performance and complexity of MIMO detection algorithms formulated for infinite lattices. Specifically, we find, considering performance and complexity, that LR does not seem to offer advantages when used in conjunction with SD.
