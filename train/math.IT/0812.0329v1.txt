We consider compressed sensing of block-sparse signals, i.e., sparse signals that have nonzero coefficients occuring in clusters. Based on an uncertainty relation for block-sparse signals, we define a block-coherence measure and we show that a block-version of the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm recovers block k-sparse signals in no more than k steps if the block-coherence is sufficiently small. The same condition on block-sparsity is shown to guarantee successful recovery through a mixed l2/l1 optimization approach. The significance of the results lies in the fact that making explicit use of block-sparsity can yield better reconstruction properties than treating the signal as being sparse in the conventional sense thereby ignoring the additional structure in the problem.
