The rapid proliferation of wireless systems makes interference management more and more important. This paper presents a novel cognitive coexistence framework, which enables an infrastructure system to reduce interference to ad-hoc or peer-to-peer communication links in close proximity. Motivated by the superior resources of the infrastructure system, we study how its centralized resource allocation can accommodate the ad-hoc links based on sensing and predicting their interference patterns.   Based on an ON/OFF continuous-time Markov chain model, the optimal allocation of power and transmission time is formulated as a convex optimization problem and closed-form solutions are derived. The optimal scheduling is extended to the case where the infrastructure channel is random and rate constraints need only be met in the long-term average. Finally, the multi-terminal case is addressed and the problem of optimal sub-channel allocation discussed. Numerical performance analysis illustrates that utilizing the superior flexibility of the infrastructure links can effectively mitigate interference.
