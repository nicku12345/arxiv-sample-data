Network coverage of wireless sensor network (WSN) means how well an area of interest is being monitored by the deployed network. It depends mainly on sensing model of nodes. In this paper, we present three types of sensing models viz. Boolean sensing model, shadow-fading sensing model and Elfes sensing model. We investigate the impact of sensing models on network coverage. We also investigate network coverage based on Poisson node distribution. A comparative study between regular and random node placement has also been presented in this paper. This study will be useful for coverage analysis of WSN.
