Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding is the optimal decoding algorithm for arbitrary linear block codes and can be written as an Integer Programming (IP) problem. Feldman et al. relaxed this IP problem and presented Linear Programming (LP) based decoding algorithm for linear block codes. In this paper, we propose a new IP formulation of the ML decoding problem and solve the IP with generic methods. The formulation uses indicator variables to detect violated parity checks. We derive Gomory cuts from our formulation and use them in a separation algorithm to find ML codewords. We further propose an efficient method of finding cuts induced by redundant parity checks (RPC). Under certain circumstances we can guarantee that these RPC cuts are valid and cut off the fractional optimal solutions of LP decoding. We demonstrate on two LDPC codes and one BCH code that our separation algorithm performs significantly better than LP decoding.
