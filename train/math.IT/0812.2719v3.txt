Secret sharing over the fast-fading MIMO wiretap channel is considered. A source and a destination try to share secret information over a fast-fading MIMO channel in the presence of a wiretapper who also makes channel observations that are different from but correlated to those made by the destination. An interactive authenticated unrestricted public channel is also available for use by the source and destination in the secret sharing process. This falls under the "channel-type model with wiretapper" considered by Ahlswede and Csiszar. A minor extension of their result (to continuous channel alphabets) is employed to evaluate the key capacity of the fast-fading MIMO wiretap channel. The effects of spatial dimensionality provided by the use of multiple antennas at the source, destination, and wiretapper are then investigated.
