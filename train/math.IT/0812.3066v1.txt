Sampling theory has benefited from a surge of research in recent years, due in part to the intense research in wavelet theory and the connections made between the two fields. In this survey we present several extensions of the Shannon theorem, that have been developed primarily in the past two decades, which treat a wide class of input signals as well as nonideal sampling and nonlinear distortions. This framework is based on viewing sampling in a broader sense of projection onto appropriate subspaces, and then choosing the subspaces to yield interesting new possibilities. For example, our results can be used to uniformly sample non-bandlimited signals, and to perfectly compensate for nonlinear effects.
