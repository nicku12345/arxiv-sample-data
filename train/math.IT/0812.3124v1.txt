For the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel with imperfect channel state information (CSI), neither the capacity nor the optimal transmission technique have been fully discovered. In this paper, we derive achievable ergodic rates for a MIMO fading broadcast channel when CSI is delayed and quantized. It is shown that we should not support too many users with spatial division multiplexing due to the residual inter-user interference caused by imperfect CSI. Based on the derived achievable rates, we propose a multi-mode transmission strategy to maximize the throughput, which adaptively adjusts the number of active users based on the channel statistics information.
