The secrecy capacity region for the K-receiver degraded broadcast channel (BC) is given for confidential messages sent to the receivers and to be kept secret from an external wiretapper. Superposition coding and Wyner's random code partitioning are used to show the achievable rate tuples. Error probability analysis and equivocation calculation are also provided. In the converse proof, a new definition for the auxiliary random variables is used, which is different from either the case of the 2-receiver BC without common message or the K-receiver BC with common message, both with an external wiretapper; or the K-receiver BC without a wiretapper.
