The capacity of a fading channel can be substantially increased by feeding back channel state information from the receiver to the transmitter. With limited-rate feedback what state information to feed back and how to encode it are important open questions. This paper studies power loading in a multicarrier system using no more than one bit of feedback per sub-channel. The sub-channels can be correlated and full channel state information is assumed at the receiver.
