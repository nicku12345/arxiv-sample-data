The Marton-Gelfand-Pinsker inner bound on the capacity region of broadcast channels was extended by Han-Costa to include arbitrarily correlated sources where the capacity region is replaced by an admissible source region. The main arguments of Han-Costa are correct but unfortunately the authors overlooked an inequality in their derivation. The corrected region is presented and the absence of the omitted inequality is shown to sometimes admit sources that are not admissible.
