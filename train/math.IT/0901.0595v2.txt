Motivated by a simple broadcast channel, we generalize the notions of a less noisy receiver and a more capable receiver to an essentially less noisy receiver and an essentially more capable receiver respectively. We establish the capacity regions of these classes by borrowing on existing techniques to obtain the characterization of the capacity region for certain new and interesting classes of broadcast channels. We also establish the relationships between the new classes and the existing classes.
