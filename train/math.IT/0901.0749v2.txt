We study the average distortion introduced by scalar, vector, and entropy coded quantization of compressive sensing (CS) measurements. The asymptotic behavior of the underlying quantization schemes is either quantified exactly or characterized via bounds. We adapt two benchmark CS reconstruction algorithms to accommodate quantization errors, and empirically demonstrate that these methods significantly reduce the reconstruction distortion when compared to standard CS techniques.
