A code is said to be two-weight if the non-zero codewords have only two different a weight w1 and w2. Two-weight codes are closely related to strongly regular graphs. In this paper. It is shown that a consta-cyclic code of composite length can be put in the quasi-twisted form. Based on this transformation, a new construction method of quasi-twisted (QT) two-weight codes is presented. A large amount of QT two-weight codes are found, and some new codes are also constructed.
