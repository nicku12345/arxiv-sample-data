Consider a network of nodes where each node has a message to communicate to all other nodes. For this communication problem, we analyze a gossip based protocol where coded messages are exchanged. This problem was studied by Aoyama and Shah where a bound to the dissemination time based on the spectral properties of the underlying communication graph is provided. Our contribution is a uniform bound that holds for arbitrary networks.
