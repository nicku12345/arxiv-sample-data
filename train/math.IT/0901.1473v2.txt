We consider the problem of communicating over a channel for which no mathematical model is specified. We present achievable rates as a function of the channel input and output known a-posteriori for discrete and continuous channels, as well as a rate-adaptive scheme employing feedback which achieves these rates asymptotically without prior knowledge of the channel behavior.
