In this paper we develop a statistical mechanical interpretation of the noiseless source coding scheme based on an absolutely optimal instantaneous code. The notions in statistical mechanics such as statistical mechanical entropy, temperature, and thermal equilibrium are translated into the context of noiseless source coding. Especially, it is discovered that the temperature 1 corresponds to the average codeword length of an instantaneous code in this statistical mechanical interpretation of noiseless source coding scheme. This correspondence is also verified by the investigation using box-counting dimension. Using the notion of temperature and statistical mechanical arguments, some information-theoretic relations can be derived in the manner which appeals to intuition.
