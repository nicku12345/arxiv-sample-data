Non-orthogonal space-time block codes (STBC) with {\em large dimensions} are attractive because they can simultaneously achieve both high spectral efficiencies (same spectral efficiency as in V-BLAST for a given number of transmit antennas) {\em as well as} full transmit diversity. Decoding of non-orthogonal STBCs with large dimensions has been a challenge. In this paper, we present a reactive tabu search (RTS) based algorithm for decoding non-orthogonal STBCs from cyclic division algebras (CDA) having large dimensions. Under i.i.d fading and perfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR), our simulation results show that RTS based decoding of 12\times 12 STBC from CDA and 4-QAM with 288 real dimensions achieves i) 10^{-3} uncoded BER at an SNR of just 0.5 dB away from SISO AWGN performance, and ii) a coded BER performance close to within about 5 dB of the theoretical MIMO capacity, using rate-3/4 turbo code at a spectral efficiency of 18 bps/Hz. RTS is shown to achieve near SISO AWGN performance with less number of dimensions than with LAS algorithm (which we reported recently) at some extra complexity than LAS. We also report good BER performance of RTS when i.i.d fading and perfect CSIR assumptions are relaxed by considering a spatially correlated MIMO channel model, and by using a training based iterative RTS decoding/channel estimation scheme.
