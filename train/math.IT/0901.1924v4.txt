This paper considers a distributed interference avoidance problem employing frequency assignment in the Gaussian interference channel (IC). We divide the common channel into several subchannels and each user chooses the subchannel with less amount of interference from other users as the transmit channel. This mechanism named interference avoidance in this paper can be modeled as a competitive game model. And a completely autonomous distributed iterative algorithm called Tdistributed interference avoidance algorithm (DIA) is adopted to achieve the Nash equilibriumT (NE) of the game. Due to the self-optimum, DIA is a sub-optimal algorithm. Therefore, through introducing an optimal compensation into the competitive game model, we successfully develop a compensation-based game model to approximate the optimal interference avoidance problem. Moreover, an optimal algorithm called iterative optimal interference avoidance algorithm (IOIA) is proposed to reach the optimality of the interference avoidance scheme. We analyze the implementation complexities of the two algorithms. We also give the proof on the convergence of the proposed algorithms. The performance upper bound and lower bound are also derived for the proposed algorithms. The simulation results show that IOIA does reach the optimality under condition of interference avoidance mechanism.
