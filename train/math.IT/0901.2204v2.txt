Communication over the binary erasure channel (BEC) using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and belief propagation (BP) decoding is considered. The average bit error probability of an irregular LDPC code ensemble after a fixed number of iterations converges to a limit, which is calculated via density evolution, as the blocklength n tends to infinity. The difference between the bit error probability with blocklength n and the large-blocklength limit behaves asymptotically like \alpha/n, where the coefficient \alpha depends on the ensemble, the number of iterations and the erasure probability of the BEC\null. In [1], \alpha is calculated for regular ensembles. In this paper, \alpha for irregular expurgated ensembles is derived. It is demonstrated that convergence of numerical estimates of \alpha to the analytic result is significantly fast for irregular unexpurgated ensembles.
