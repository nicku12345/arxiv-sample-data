Channel polarization is a method of constructing capacity achieving codes for symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels (B-DMCs) [1]. In the original paper, the construction complexity is exponential in the blocklength. In this paper, a new construction method for arbitrary symmetric binary memoryless channel (B-MC) with linear complexity in the blocklength is proposed. Furthermore, new upper and lower bounds of the block error probability of polar codes are derived for the BEC and the arbitrary symmetric B-MC, respectively.
