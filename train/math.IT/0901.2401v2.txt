The optimization of the transmit parameters (power allocation and steering vectors) for the MIMO BC under general linear constraints is treated under the optimal DPC coding strategy and the simple suboptimal linear zero-forcing beamforming strategy. In the case of DPC, we show that "SINR duality" and "min-max duality" yield the same dual MAC problem, and compare two alternatives for its efficient solution. In the case of zero-forcing beamforming, we provide a new efficient algorithm based on the direct optimization of a generalized inverse matrix. In both cases, the algorithms presented here address the problems in the most general form and can be applied to special cases previously considered, such as per-antenna and per-group of antennas power constraints, "forbidden interference direction" constraints, or any combination thereof.
