Gabidulin codes are the rank-metric analogs of Reed-Solomon codes and have a major role in practical error control for network coding. This paper presents new encoding and decoding algorithms for Gabidulin codes based on low-complexity normal bases. In addition, a new decoding algorithm is proposed based on a transform-domain approach. Together, these represent the fastest known algorithms for encoding and decoding Gabidulin codes.
