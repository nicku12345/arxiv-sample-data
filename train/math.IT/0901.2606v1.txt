In this paper, we investigate the half-duplex cooperative communication scheme of a two user Gaussian interference channel. We develop achievable region and outer bound for the case when the system allow either transmitter or receiver cooperation. We show that by using our transmitter cooperation scheme, there is significant capacity improvement compare to the previous results, especially when the cooperation link is strong. Further, if the cooperation channel gain is infinity, both our transmitter and receiver cooperation rates achieve their respective outer bound. It is also shown that transmitter cooperation provides larger achievable region than receiver cooperation under the same channel and power conditions.
