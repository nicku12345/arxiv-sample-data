In this paper, we first consider a channel that is contaminated by two independent Gaussian noises S ~ N(0,Q) and Z_0 ~ N(0,N_0). The capacity of this channel is computed when independent noisy versions of S are known to the transmitter and/or receiver. It is shown that the channel capacity is greater then the capacity when S is completely unknown, but is less then the capacity when S is perfectly known at the transmitter or receiver. For example, if there is one noisy version of S known at the transmitter only, the capacity is 0.5log(1+P/(Q(N_1/(Q+N_1))+N_0)), where P is the input power constraint and N_1 is the power of the noise corrupting S. We then consider a Gaussian cognitive interference channel (IC) and propose a causal noisy dirty paper coding (DPC) strategy. We compute the achievable region using this noisy DPC strategy and quantify the regions when it achieves the upper bound on the rate.
