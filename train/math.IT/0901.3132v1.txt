In this paper, we study the secrecy rates over weak Gaussian interference channels for different transmission schemes. We focus on the low-SNR regime and obtain the minimum bit energy E_b/N_0_min values, and the wideband slope regions for both TDMA and multiplexed transmission schemes. We show that secrecy constraints introduce a penalty in both the minimum bit energy and the slope regions. Additionally, we identify under what conditions TDMA or multiplexed transmission is optimal. Finally, we show that TDMA is more likely to be optimal in the presence of secrecy constraints.
