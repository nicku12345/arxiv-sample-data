Wireless OFDM channels can be approximated by a time varying filter with sparse time domain taps. Recent achievements in sparse signal processing such as compressed sensing have facilitated the use of sparsity in estimation, which improves the performance significantly. The problem of these sparse-based methods is the need for a stable transformation matrix which is not fulfilled in the current transmission setups. To assist the analog filtering at the receiver, the transmitter leaves some of the subcarriers at both edges of the bandwidth unused which results in an ill-conditioned DFT submatrix. To overcome this difficulty we propose Adaptive Thresholding for Sparse Signal Detection (ATSSD). Simulation results confirm that the proposed method works well in time-invariant and specially time-varying channels where other methods may not work as well.
