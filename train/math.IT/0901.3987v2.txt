Consider a lossy communication channel for unicast with zero-delay feedback. For this communication scenario, a simple retransmission scheme is optimum with respect to delay. An alternative approach is to use random linear coding in automatic repeat-request (ARQ) mode. We extend the work of Shrader and Ephremides, by deriving an expression for the delay of random linear coding over field of infinite size. Simulation results for various field sizes are also provided.
