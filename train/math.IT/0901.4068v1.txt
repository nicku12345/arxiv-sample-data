Certain deterministic interference channels have been shown to accurately model Gaussian interference channels in the asymptotic low-noise regime. Motivated by this correspondence, we investigate a K user-pair, cyclically symmetric, deterministic interference channel in which each receiver experiences interference only from its neighboring transmitters (Wyner model). We establish the sum capacity for a large set of channel parameters, thus generalizing previous results for the 2-pair case.
