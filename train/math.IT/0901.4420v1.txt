The channel capacity theorem for additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGN), widely known as the Shannon-Hartley Law, expresses the information capacity of a channel bandlimited in the conventional Fourier domain in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio in it. In this letter generalized versions of the Shannon-Hartley Law using the linear canonical transform (LCT) are presented. The channel capacity for AWGN channels is found to be a function of the LCT parameters.
