The problem of reliable transmission of correlated sources over the broadcast channel, originally studied by Han and Costa, is revisited. An alternative characterization of their sufficient condition for reliable transmission is given, which includes results of Marton for channel coding over broadcast channels and of Gray and Wyner for distributed source coding. A ``minimalistic'' coding scheme is presented, which is based on joint typicality encoding and decoding, without requiring the use of Cover's superposition coding, random hashing, and common part between two sources. The analysis of the coding scheme is also conceptually simple and relies on a new multivariate covering lemma and an application of the Fourier--Motzkin elimination procedure.
