Schein and Gallager introduced the Gaussian parallel relay channel in 2000. They proposed the Amplify-and-Forward (AF) and the Decode-and-Forward (DF) strategies for this channel. For a long time, the best known achievable rate for this channel was based on the AF and DF with time sharing (AF-DF). Recently, a Rematch-and-Forward (RF) scheme for the scenario in which different amounts of bandwidth can be assigned to the first and second hops were proposed.   In this paper, we propose a \emph{Combined Amplify-and-Decode Forward (CADF)} scheme for the Gaussian parallel relay channel. We prove that the CADF scheme always gives a better achievable rate compared to the RF scheme, when there is a bandwidth mismatch between the first hop and the second hop. Furthermore, for the equal bandwidth case (Schein's setup), we show that the time sharing between the CADF and the DF schemes (CADF-DF) leads to a better achievable rate compared to the time sharing between the RF and the DF schemes (RF-DF) as well as the AF-DF.
