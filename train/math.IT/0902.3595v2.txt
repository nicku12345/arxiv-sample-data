This paper presents the joint impact of the numbers of antennas, source-to-channel bandwidth ratio and spatial correlation on the optimum expected end-to-end distortion in an outage-free MIMO system. In particular, based on an analytical expression valid for any SNR, a closed-form expression of the optimum asymptotic expected end-to-end distortion valid for high SNR is derived. It is comprised of the optimum distortion exponent and the multiplicative optimum distortion factor. Demonstrated by the simulation results, the analysis on the joint impact of the optimum distortion exponent and the optimum distortion factor explains the behavior of the optimum expected end-to-end distortion varying with the numbers of antennas, source-to-channel bandwidth ratio and spatial correlation. It is also proved that as the correlation tends to zero, the optimum asymptotic expected end-to-end distortion in the setting of correlated channel approaches that in the setting of uncorrelated channel. The results in this paper could be performance objectives for analog-source transmission systems. To some extend, they are instructive for system design.
