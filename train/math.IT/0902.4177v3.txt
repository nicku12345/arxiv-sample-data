In this work, we introduce convolutional codes for network-error correction in the context of coherent network coding. We give a construction of convolutional codes that correct a given set of error patterns, as long as consecutive errors are separated by a certain interval. We also give some bounds on the field size and the number of errors that can get corrected in a certain interval. Compared to previous network error correction schemes, using convolutional codes is seen to have advantages in field size and decoding technique. Some examples are discussed which illustrate the several possible situations that arise in this context.
