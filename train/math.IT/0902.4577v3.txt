Determining how to approach the rate boundary of the Gaussian interference channel in practical system is a big concern. In this paper, a distributed rate-splitting (DRS) scheme is proposed to approach the rate region boundary of the Gaussian interference channel. It is shown that the DRS scheme can be formulated as a non-cooperative game. We introduce the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) with multiple leaders as the equilibrium point of the non-cooperative game. Therefore, an iterative multiple waterlevels water-filling algorithm (IML-WFA) is developed to efficiently reach the SE of the non-cooperative game. The existence of SE is established for the game. Numerical examples show that the rate-tuples achieved by the DRS are very close to the boundary of the well-known HK region.
