In cognitive radio systems, one of the main requirements is to detect the presence of the primary users' transmission, especially in weak signal cases. Cyclostationary detection is always used to solve weak signal detection, however, the computational complexity prevents it from wide usage. In this paper, a fast cycle frequency domain feature detection algorithm has been proposed, in which only feature frequency with significant cyclic signature is considered for a certain modulation mode. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has remarkable performance gain than energy detection when supporting real-time detection with low computational complexity.
