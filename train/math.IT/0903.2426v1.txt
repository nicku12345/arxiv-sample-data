We consider a system with a single base station communicating with multiple users over orthogonal channels while being assisted by multiple relays. Several recent works have suggested that, in such a scenario, selection, i.e., a single relay helping the source, is the best relaying option in terms of the resulting complexity and overhead. However, in a multiuser setting, optimal relay assignment is a combinatorial problem. In this paper, we formulate a related convex optimization problem that provides an extremely tight upper bound on performance and show that selection is, almost always, inherent in the solution. We also provide a heuristic to find a close-to-optimal relay assignment and power allocation across users supported by a single relay. Simulation results using realistic channel models demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed schemes, but also raise the question as to whether the gains from relaying are worth the additional costs.
