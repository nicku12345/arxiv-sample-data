We provide a comprehensive performance comparison of soft-output and hard-output demodulators in the context of non-iterative multiple-input multiple-output bit-interleaved coded modulation (MIMO-BICM). Coded bit error rate (BER), widely used in literature for demodulator comparison, has the drawback of depending strongly on the error correcting code being used. This motivates us to propose a code-independent performance measure in terms of system capacity, i.e., mutual information of the equivalent modulation channel that comprises modulator, wireless channel, and demodulator. We present extensive numerical results for ergodic and quasi-static fading channels under perfect and imperfect channel state information. These results reveal that the performance ranking of MIMO demodulators is rate-dependent. Furthermore, they provide new insights regarding MIMO-BICM system design, i.e., the choice of antenna configuration, symbol constellation, and demodulator for a given target rate.
