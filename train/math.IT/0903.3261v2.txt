In this paper, we consider a scenario where a source node wishes to broadcast two confidential messages for two respective receivers via a Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel. A wire-tapper also receives the transmitted signal via another MIMO channel. First we assumed that the channels are degraded and the wire-tapper has the worst channel. We establish the capacity region of this scenario. Our achievability scheme is a combination of the superposition of Gaussian codes and randomization within the layers which we will refer to as Secret Superposition Coding. For the outerbound, we use the notion of enhanced channel to show that the secret superposition of Gaussian codes is optimal. We show that we only need to enhance the channels of the legitimate receivers, and the channel of the eavesdropper remains unchanged. Then we extend the result of the degraded case to non-degraded case. We show that the secret superposition of Gaussian codes along with successive decoding cannot work when the channels are not degraded. we develop a Secret Dirty Paper Coding (SDPC) scheme and show that SDPC is optimal for this channel. Finally, we investigate practical characterizations for the specific scenario in which the transmitter and the eavesdropper have multiple antennas, while both intended receivers have a single antenna. We characterize the secrecy capacity region in terms of generalized eigenvalues of the receivers channel and the eavesdropper channel. We refer to this configuration as the MISOME case. In high SNR we show that the capacity region is a convex closure of two rectangular regions.
