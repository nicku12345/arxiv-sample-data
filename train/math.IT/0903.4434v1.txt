We study the performance of random linear network coding for time division duplexing channels with Poisson arrivals. We model the system as a bulk-service queue with variable bulk size. A full characterization for random linear network coding is provided for time division duplexing channels [1] by means of the moment generating function. We present numerical results for the mean number of packets in the queue and consider the effect of the range of allowable bulk sizes. We show that there exists an optimal choice of this range that minimizes the mean number of data packets in the queue.
