The deterministic capacity of a relay network is the capacity of a network when relays are restricted to transmitting \emph{reliable} information, that is, (asymptotically) deterministic function of the source message. In this paper it is shown that the deterministic capacity of a number of MIMO relay networks can be found in the low power regime where \SNR\to0. This is accomplished through deriving single letter upper bounds and finding the limit of these as \SNR\to0. The advantage of this technique is that it overcomes the difficulty of finding optimum distributions for mutual information.
