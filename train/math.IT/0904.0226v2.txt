This paper studies the tradeoff between channel coding and ARQ (automatic repeat request) in Rayleigh block-fading channels. A heavily coded system corresponds to a low transmission rate with few ARQ re-transmissions, whereas lighter coding corresponds to a higher transmitted rate but more re-transmissions. The optimum error probability, where optimum refers to the maximization of the average successful throughput, is derived and is shown to be a decreasing function of the average signal-to-noise ratio and of the channel diversity order. A general conclusion of the work is that the optimum error probability is quite large (e.g., 10% or larger) for reasonable channel parameters, and that operating at a very small error probability can lead to a significantly reduced throughput. This conclusion holds even when a number of practical ARQ considerations, such as delay constraints and acknowledgement feedback errors, are taken into account.
