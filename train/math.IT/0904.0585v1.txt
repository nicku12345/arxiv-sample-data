This paper addresses the problem of forbidden states for safe Petri net modeling discrete event systems. We present an efficient method to construct a controller. A set of linear constraints allow forbidding the reachability of specific states. The number of these so-called forbidden states and consequently the number of constraints are large and lead to a large number of control places. A systematic method for constructing very simplified controller is offered. By using a method based on Petri nets partial invariants, maximal permissive controllers are determined.
