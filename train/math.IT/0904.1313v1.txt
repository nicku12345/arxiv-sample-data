A class of novel STAP algorithms based on sparse recovery technique were presented. Intrinsic sparsity of distribution of clutter and target energy on spatial-frequency plane was exploited from the viewpoint of compressed sensing. The original sample data and distribution of target and clutter energy was connected by a ill-posed linear algebraic equation and popular L_1 optimization method could be utilized to search for its solution with sparse characteristic. Several new filtering algorithm acting on this solution were designed to clean clutter component on spatial-frequency plane effectively for detecting invisible targets buried in clutter. The method above is called CS-STAP in general. CS-STAP showed their advantage compared with conventional STAP technique, such as SMI, in two ways: Firstly, the resolution of CS-STAP on estimation for distribution of clutter and target energy is ultra-high such that clutter energy might be annihilated almost completely by carefully tuned filter. Output SCR of CS-STAP algorithms is far superior to the requirement of detection; Secondly, a much smaller size of training sample support compared with SMI method is requested for CS-STAP method. Even with only one snapshot (from target range cell) could CS-STAP method be able to reveal the existence of target clearly. CS-STAP method display its great potential to be used in heterogeneous situation. Experimental result on dataset from mountaintop program has provided the evidence for our assertion on CS-STAP.
