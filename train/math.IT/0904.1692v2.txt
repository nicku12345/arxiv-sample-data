We examine regular and irregular repeat-accumulate (RA) codes with repetition degrees which are all even. For these codes and with a particular choice of an interleaver, we give an upper bound on the decoding error probability of a linear-programming based decoder which is an inverse polynomial in the block length. Our bound is valid for any memoryless, binary-input, output-symmetric (MBIOS) channel. This result generalizes the bound derived by Feldman et al., which was for regular RA(2) codes.
