A word-valued source \mathbf{Y} = Y_1,Y_2,... is discrete random process that is formed by sequentially encoding the symbols of a random process \mathbf{X} = X_1,X_2,... with codewords from a codebook \mathscr{C}. These processes appear frequently in information theory (in particular, in the analysis of source-coding algorithms), so it is of interest to give conditions on \mathbf{X} and \mathscr{C} for which \mathbf{Y} will satisfy an ergodic theorem and possess an Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP). In this correspondence, we prove the following: (1) if \mathbf{X} is asymptotically mean stationary, then \mathbf{Y} will satisfy a pointwise ergodic theorem and possess an AEP; and, (2) if the codebook \mathscr{C} is prefix-free, then the entropy rate of \mathbf{Y} is equal to the entropy rate of \mathbf{X} normalized by the average codeword length.
