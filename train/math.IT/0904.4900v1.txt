The design of the precoder the maximizes the mutual information in linear vector Gaussian channels with an arbitrary input distribution is studied. Precisely, the precoder optimal left singular vectors and singular values are derived. The characterization of the right singular vectors is left, in general, as an open problem whose computational complexity is then studied in three cases: Gaussian signaling, low SNR, and high SNR. For the Gaussian signaling case and the low SNR regime, the dependence of the mutual information on the right singular vectors vanishes, making the optimal precoder design problem easy to solve. In the high SNR regime, however, the dependence on the right singular vectors cannot be avoided and we show the difficulty of computing the optimal precoder through an NP-hardness analysis.
