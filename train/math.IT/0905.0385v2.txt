Diversity-Multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) is a coarse high SNR approximation of the fundamental tradeoff between data rate and reliability in a slow fading channel. In this paper, we characterize the fundamental DMT of the two user single antenna Gaussian interference channel. We show that the class of multilevel superposition coding schemes universally achieves (for all fading statistics) the DMT for the two-user interference channel. For the special case of symmetric DMT, when the two users have identical rate and diversity gain requirements, we characterize the DMT achieved by the Han-Kobayashi scheme, which corresponds to two level superposition coding.
