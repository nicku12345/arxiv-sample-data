This paper proposes a practical successive decoding scheme with finite levels for the finite-state Markov channels where there is no a priori state information at the transmitter or the receiver. The design employs either a random interleaver or a deterministic interleaver with an irregular pattern and an optional iterative estimation and decoding procedure within each level. The interleaver design criteria may be the achievable rate or the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart, depending on the receiver type. For random interleavers, the optimization problem is solved efficiently using a pilot-utility function, while for deterministic interleavers, a good construction is given using empirical rules. Simulation results demonstrate that the new successive decoding scheme combined with irregular low-density parity-check codes can approach the identically and uniformly distributed (i.u.d.) input capacity on the Markov-fading channel using only a few levels.
