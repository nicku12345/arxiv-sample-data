We study quantization of log-likelihood ratios (LLR) in bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems in terms of an equivalent discrete channel. We propose to design the quantizer such that the quantizer outputs become equiprobable. We investigate semi-analytically and numerically the ergodic and outage capacity over single- and multiple-antenna channels for different quantizers. Finally, we show bit error rate simulations for BICM systems with LLR quantization using a rate 1/2 low-density parity-check code.
