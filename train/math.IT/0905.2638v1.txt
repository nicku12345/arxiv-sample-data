In this work, we prove that a positive secure degree of freedom is achievable for a large class of Gaussian channels as long as the channel is not degraded and the channel is fully connected. This class includes the MAC wire-tap channel, the 2-user interference channel with confidential messages, the 2-user interference channel with an external eavesdropper. Best known achievable schemes to date for these channels use Gaussian signaling. In this work, we show that structured codes outperform Gaussian random codes at high SNR when channel gains are real numbers.
