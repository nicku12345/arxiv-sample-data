In this work, we consider achievable secrecy rates for symmetric K-user (K \ge 3) interference channels with confidential messages. We find that nested lattice codes and layered coding are useful in providing secrecy for these channels. Achievable secrecy rates are derived for very strong interference. In addition, we derive the secure degrees of freedom for a range of channel parameters. As a by-product of our approach, we also demonstrate that nested lattice codes are useful for K-user symmetric interference channels without secrecy constraints in that they yield higher degrees of freedom than previous results.
