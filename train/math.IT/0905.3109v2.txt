The role of cooperation in managing interference - a fundamental feature of the wireless channel - is investigated by studying the two-user Gaussian interference channel where the source nodes can both transmit and receive in full-duplex. The sum-capacity of this channel is obtained within a gap of a constant number of bits. The coding scheme used builds up on the superposition scheme of Han and Kobayashi (1981) for the two-user interference channel without cooperation. New upperbounds on the sum-capacity are also derived. The same coding scheme is shown to obtain the sum-capacity of the symmetric two-user Gaussian interference channel with noiseless feedback within a constant gap.
