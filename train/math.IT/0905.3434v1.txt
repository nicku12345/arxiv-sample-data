This paper studies the design of a decentralized multiuser multi-antenna (MIMO) system for spectrum sharing over a fixed narrow band, where the coexisting users independently update their transmit covariance matrices for individual transmit-rate maximization via an iterative manner. This design problem was usually investigated in the literature by assuming that each user treats the co-channel interference from all the other users as additional (colored) noise at the receiver, i.e., the conventional single-user decoder (SUD) is applied. This paper proposes a new decoding method for the decentralized multiuser MIMO system, whereby each user opportunistically cancels the co-channel interference from some or all of the other users via applying multiuser detection techniques, thus termed opportunistic multiuser detection (OMD). This paper studies the optimal transmit covariance design for users' iterative maximization of individual transmit rates with the proposed OMD, and demonstrates the resulting capacity gains in decentralized multiuser MIMO systems against the conventional SUD.
