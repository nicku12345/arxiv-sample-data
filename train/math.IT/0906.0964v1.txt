Channel Estimation is an essential component in applications such as radar and data communication. In multi path time varying environments, it is necessary to estimate time-shifts, scale-shifts (the wideband equivalent of Doppler-shifts), and the gains/phases of each of the multiple paths. With recent advances in sparse estimation (or "compressive sensing"), new estimation techniques have emerged which yield more accurate estimates of these channel parameters than traditional strategies. These estimation strategies, however, restrict potential estimates of time-shifts and scale-shifts to a finite set of values separated by a choice of grid spacing. A small grid spacing increases the number of potential estimates, thus lowering the quantization error, but also increases complexity and estimation time. Conversely, a large grid spacing lowers the number of potential estimates, thus lowering the complexity and estimation time, but increases the quantization error. In this thesis, we derive an expression which relates the choice of grid spacing to the mean-squared quantization error. Furthermore, we consider the case when scale-shifts are approximated by Doppler-shifts, and derive a similar expression relating the choice of the grid spacing and the quantization error. Using insights gained from these expressions, we further explore the effects of the choice and grid spacing, and examine when a wideband model can be well approximated by a narrowband model.
