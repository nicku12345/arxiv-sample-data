In this paper we consider the capacity of the cognitive radio channel in different fading environments under a low interference regime. First we derive the probability that the low interference regime holds under shadow fading as well as Rayleigh and Rician fast fading conditions. We demonstrate that this is the dominant case, especially in practical cognitive radio deployment scenarios. The capacity of the cognitive radio channel depends critically on a power loss parameter, \alpha, which governs how much transmit power the cognitive radio dedicates to relaying the primary message. We derive a simple, accurate approximation to \alpha in Rayleigh and Rician fading environments which gives considerable insight into system capacity. We also investigate the effects of system parameters and propagation environment on \alpha and the cognitive radio capacity. In all cases, the use of the approximation is shown to be extremely accurate.
