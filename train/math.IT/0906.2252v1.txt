A Dirty Paper Coding (DPC) based transmission scheme for the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio channel (CRC) is studied when there is imperfect and perfect channel knowledge at the transmitters (CSIT) and the receivers, respectively. In particular, the problem of optimizing the sum-rate of the MIMO CRC over the transmit covariance matrices is dealt with. Such an optimization, under the DPC-based transmission strategy, needs to be performed jointly with an optimization over the inflation factor. To this end, first the problem of determination of inflation factor over the MIMO channel Y=H_1 X + H_2 S + Z with imperfect CSIT is investigated. For this problem, two iterative algorithms, which generalize the corresponding algorithms proposed for the channel Y=H(X+S)+Z, are developed. Later, the necessary conditions for maximizing the sum-rate of the MIMO CRC over the transmit covariances for a given choice of inflation factor are derived. Using these necessary conditions and the algorithms for the determination of the inflation factor, an iterative, numerical algorithm for the joint optimization is proposed. Some interesting observations are made from the numerical results obtained from the algorithm. Furthermore, the high-SNR sum-rate scaling factor achievable over the CRC with imperfect CSIT is obtained.
