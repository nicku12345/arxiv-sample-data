Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have been used for communication over a two-user Gaussian broadcast channel. It has been shown in the literature that the optimal decoding of such system requires joint decoding of both user messages at each user. Also, a joint code design procedure should be performed. We propose a method which uses a novel labeling strategy and is based on the idea behind the bit-interleaved coded modulation. This method does not require joint decoding and/or joint code optimization. Thus, it reduces the overall complexity of near-capacity coding in broadcast channels. For different rate pairs on the boundary of the capacity region, pairs of LDPC codes are designed to demonstrate the success of this technique.
