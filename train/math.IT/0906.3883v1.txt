Error performance of noncoherent detection of on-off frequency shift keying (OOFSK) modulation over fading channels is analyzed when the receiver is equipped with multiple antennas. The analysis is conducted for two cases: 1) the case in which the receiver has the channel distribution knowledge only; and 2) the case in which the receiver perfectly knows the fading magnitudes. For both cases, the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detection rule is derived and analytical probability of error expressions are obtained. Numerical and simulation results indicate that for sufficiently low duty cycle values, lower error probabilities with respect to FSK signaling are achieved. Equivalently, when compared to FSK modulation, OOFSK with low duty cycle requires less energy to achieve the same probability of error, which renders this modulation a more energy efficient transmission technique. Also, through numerical results, the impact of number of antennas, antenna correlation, duty cycle values, and unknown channel fading on the performance are investigated.
