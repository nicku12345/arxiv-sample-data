The continuous-time, peak-limited, infinite-bandwidth Poisson channel with spurious counts is considered. It is shown that if the times at which the spurious counts occur are known noncausally to the transmitter but not to the receiver, then the capacity is equal to that of the Poisson channel with no spurious counts. Knowing the times at which the spurious counts occur only causally at the transmitter does not increase capacity.
