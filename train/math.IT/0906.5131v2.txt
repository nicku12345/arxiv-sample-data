There is a conception that Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics cannot yield the long tail distribution. This is the justification for the intensive research of nonextensive entropies (i.e. Tsallis entropy and others). Here the error that caused this misconception is explained and it is shown that a long tail distribution exists in equilibrium thermodynamics for more than a century.
