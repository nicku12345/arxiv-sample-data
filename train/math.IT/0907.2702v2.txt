Interference is a fundamental feature of the wireless channel. To better understand the role of cooperation in interference management, the two-user Gaussian interference channel where the destination nodes can cooperate by virtue of being able to both transmit and receive is studied. The sum-capacity of this channel is characterized up to a constant number of bits. The coding scheme employed builds up on the superposition scheme of Han and Kobayashi (1981) for two-user interference channels without cooperation. New upperbounds to the sum-capacity are also derived.
