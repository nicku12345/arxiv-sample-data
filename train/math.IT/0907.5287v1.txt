Let C be an additive subgroup of \Z_{2k}^n for any k\geq 1. We define a Gray map \Phi:\Z_{2k}^n \longrightarrow \Z_2^{kn} such that \Phi(\codi) is a binary propelinear code and, hence, a Hamming-compatible group code. Moreover, \Phi is the unique Gray map such that \Phi(C) is Hamming-compatible group code. Using this Gray map we discuss about the nonexistence of 1-perfect binary mixed group code.
