This paper considers the asymptotic behavior of two-source block-fading single-antenna Gaussian interference channels in the high-SNR regime by means of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. We consider a general setting where the users and the average channel gains are not restricted to be symmetric. Our results are not just extensions of previous results for symmetric networks, as our setting covers scenarios that are not possible under the symmetric assumption, such as the case of "mixed" interference, i.e., when difference sources have different distances from their intended receivers. We derive upper and lower bounds on the diversity. We show that for a fairly large set of channel parameters the two bounds coincides.
