In this paper we provide sufficient conditions for lossy transmission of functions of correlated data over a multiple access channel (MAC). The conditions obtained can be shown as generalized version of Yamamoto's result. We also obtain efficient joint source-channel coding schemes for transmission of discrete and continuous alphabet sources to recover the function values.   Keywords: Joint source-channel coding, Graph coloring, Lipschitz functions, Correlated sources.
