A solution is presented for the asymptotic growth rate of the AWGN-pseudoweight distribution of regular low-density parity-check (LDPC) code ensembles for a selected graph cover degree M >= 1. The evaluation of the growth rate requires solution of a system of 2M+1 nonlinear equations in 2M+1 unknowns. Simulation results for the pseudoweight distribution of two regular LDPC code ensembles are presented for graph covers of low degree.
