In this work, we derive achievable rate regions for the three-user interference channels with asymmetric transmitter cooperation and various decoding capabilities at the receivers. The three-user channel facilitates different ways of message sharing between the transmitters. We introduce two natural ways of extending the concept of unidirectional message sharing from two users to three users - (i) cumulative message sharing and (ii) primary-only message sharing. In addition, we define several cognitive interference channels based on the decoding capability of the receivers. We employ a coding technique, which is a combination of superposition and Gel'fand-Pinsker coding techniques, to derive an achievable rate region for each of the cognitive interference channels. Simulation results, by considering the Gaussian channel case, enables a visual comparison of the two message-sharing schemes considered in this paper. It also provides useful insights into the effect of message-splitting at the transmitters and the decoding capability of the receivers on the achievable rates.
