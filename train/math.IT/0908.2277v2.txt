We examine the capacity of beamforming over a single-user, multi-antenna link taking into account the overhead due to channel estimation and limited feedback of channel state information. Multi-input single-output (MISO) and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels are considered subject to block Rayleigh fading. Each coherence block contains L symbols, and is spanned by T training symbols, B feedback bits, and the data symbols. The training symbols are used to obtain a Minimum Mean Squared Error estimate of the channel matrix. Given this estimate, the receiver selects a transmit beamforming vector from a codebook containing 2^B {\em i.i.d.} random vectors, and sends the corresponding B bits back to the transmitter. We derive bounds on the beamforming capacity for MISO and MIMO channels and characterize the optimal (rate-maximizing) training and feedback overhead (T and B) as L and the number of transmit antennas N_t both become large. The optimal N_t is limited by the coherence time, and increases as L/\log L. For the MISO channel the optimal T/L and B/L (fractional overhead due to training and feedback) are asymptotically the same, and tend to zero at the rate 1/\log N_t. For the MIMO channel the optimal feedback overhead B/L tends to zero faster (as 1/\log^2 N_t).
