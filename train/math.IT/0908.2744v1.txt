Self assembly is a process by which supramolecular species form spontaneously from their components. This process is ubiquitous throughout the life chemistry and is central to biological information processing. It has been predicted that in future self assembly will become an important engineering discipline by combining the fields of bio molecular computation, nano technology and medicine. However error control is a key challenge in realizing the potential of self assembly. Recently many authors have proposed several combinatorial error correction schemes to control errors which have a close analogy with the coding theory such as Winfree s proofreading scheme and its generalizations by Chen and Goel and compact scheme of Reif, Sahu and Yin. In this work, we present an error correction computational tool XTile that can be used to create input files to the Xgrow simulator of Winfree by providing the design logic of the tiles and it also allows the user to apply proofreading, snake and compact error correction schemes.
