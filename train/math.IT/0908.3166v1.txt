In this paper we investigate the criteria proposed by Coronel et al. for constructing MIMO MAC-DMT optimal codes over several classes of fading channels. We first give a counterexample showing their DMT result is not correct when the channel is frequency-selective. For the case of symmetric MIMO-MAC flat fading channels, their DMT result reduces to exactly the same as that derived by Tse et al., and we therefore focus on their criteria for constructing MAC-DMT optimal codes, especially when the number of receive antennas is sufficiently large. In such case, we show their criterion is equivalent to requiring the codes of any subset of users to satisfy a joint non-vanishing determinant criterion when the system operates in the antenna pooling regime. Finally an upper bound on the product of minimum eigenvalues of the difference matrices is provided, and is used to show any MIMO-MAC codes satisfying their criterion can possibly exist only when the target multiplexing gain is small.
