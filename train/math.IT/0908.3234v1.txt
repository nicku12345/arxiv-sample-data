Network coding is known to improve the throughput and the resilience to losses in most network scenarios. In a practical network scenario, however, the accurate modeling of the traffic is often too complex and/or infeasible. The goal is thus to design codes that perform close to the capacity of any network (with arbitrary traffic) efficiently. In this context, random linear network codes are known to be capacity-achieving while requiring a decoding complexity quadratic in the message length. Chunked Codes (CC) were proposed by Maymounkov et al. to improve the computational efficiency of random codes by partitioning the message into a number of non-overlapping chunks. CC can also be capacity-achieving but have a lower encoding/decoding complexity at the expense of slower convergence to the capacity. In this paper, we propose and analyze a generalized version of CC called Overlapped Chunked Codes (OCC) in which chunks are allowed to overlap. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results show that compared to CC, OCC can achieve the capacity with a faster speed while maintaining almost the same advantage in computational efficiency.
