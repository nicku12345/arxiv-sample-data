This letter provides closed-form expressions for the outage probability, the average level crossing rate (LCR) and the average fade duration (AFD) of a dual diversity selection combining (SC) system exposed to the combined influence of the cochannel interference (CCI) and the thermal noise (AWGN) in Nakagami fading channel. The branch selection is based on the desired signal power SC algorithm with all input signals assumed to be independent, while the powers of the desired signals in all diversity branches are mutually equal but distinct from the power of the interference signals. The analytical results reduce to known solutions in the cases of an interference-limited system in Rayleigh fading and an AWGN-limited system in Nakagami fading. The average LCR is determined by an original approach that does not require explicit knowledge of the joint PDF of the envelope and its time derivative, which also paves the way for similar analysis of other diversity systems.
