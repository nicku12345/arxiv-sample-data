Channel equalization is the process of reducing amplitude, frequency and phase distortion in a radio channel with the intent of improving transmission performance. Different types of equalizers, their applications and some practical example is given. Especially, in the digital communication scenario how equalization works is shown. This paper presents a vivid description on channel equalization in digital transmission system.
