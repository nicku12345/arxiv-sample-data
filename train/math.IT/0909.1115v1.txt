This paper studies a layered erasure interference channel model, which is a simplification of the Gaussian interference channel with fading using the deterministic model approach. In particular, the capacity region of the layered erasure one-sided interference channel is completely determined, assuming that the channel state information (CSI) is known to the receivers, but there is no CSI at transmitters (CSIT). The result holds for arbitrary fading statistics. Previous results of Aggarwal, Sankar, Calderbank and Poor on the capacity region or sum capacity under several interference configurations are shown to be special cases of the capacity region shown in this paper.
