The Hilbert transform is essentially the \textit{only} singular operator in one dimension. This undoubtedly makes it one of the the most important linear operators in harmonic analysis. The Hilbert transform has had a profound bearing on several theoretical and physical problems across a wide range of disciplines; this includes problems in Fourier convergence, complex analysis, potential theory, modulation theory, wavelet theory, aerofoil design, dispersion relations and high-energy physics, to name a few.   In this monograph, we revisit some of the established results concerning the global behavior of the Hilbert transform, namely that it is is weakly bounded on \eL^1(\R), and strongly bounded on \eL^p(\R) for 1 < p <\infty, and provide a self-contained derivation of the same using real-variable techniques.
