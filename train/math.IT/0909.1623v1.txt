In this paper a two channel paraunitary filter bank is proposed, which is based on linear canonical transform, instead of discrete Fourier transform. Input-output relation for such a filter bank are derived in terms of polyphase matrices and modulation matrices. It is shown that like conventional filter banks, the LCT based paraunitary filter banks need only one filter to be designed and rest of the filters can be obtained from it. It is also shown that LCT based paraunitary filter banks can be designed by using conventional power-symmetric filter design in Fourier domain.
