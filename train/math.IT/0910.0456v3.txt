Consider the n-dimensional vector y=X\be+\e, where \be \in \R^p has only k nonzero entries and \e \in \R^n is a Gaussian noise. This can be viewed as a linear system with sparsity constraints, corrupted by noise. We find a non-asymptotic upper bound on the probability that the optimal decoder for \beta declares a wrong sparsity pattern, given any generic perturbation matrix X. In the case when X is randomly drawn from a Gaussian ensemble, we obtain asymptotically sharp sufficient conditions for exact recovery, which agree with the known necessary conditions previously established.
