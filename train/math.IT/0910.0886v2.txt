Step-frequency radar (SFR) is a high resolution radar approach, where multiple pulses are transmitted at different frequencies, covering a wide spectrum. The obtained resolution directly depends on the total bandwidth used, or equivalently, the number of transmitted pulses. This paper proposes a novel SFR system, namely SFR with compressive sampling (SFRCS), that achieves the same resolution as a conventional SFR, while using significantly reduced bandwidth, or equivalently, transmitting significantly fewer pulses. This bandwidth reduction is accomplished by employing compressive sampling ideas and exploiting the sparseness of targets in the range velocity space.
