Due to unique characteristics of sensor nodes, choosing energy-efficient modulation scheme with low-complexity implementation (refereed to as green modulation) is a critical factor in the physical layer of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). This paper presents (to the best of our knowledge) the first in-depth analysis of energy efficiency of various modulation schemes using realistic models in IEEE 802.15.4 standard and present state-of-the art technology, to find the best scheme in a proactive WSN over Rayleigh and Rician flat-fading channel models with path-loss. For this purpose, we describe the system model according to a pre-determined time-based process in practical sensor nodes. The present analysis also includes the effect of bandwidth and active mode duration on energy efficiency of popular modulation designs in the pass-band and Ultra-WideBand (UWB) categories. Experimental results show that among various pass-band and UWB modulation schemes, Non-Coherent M-ary Frequency Shift Keying (NC-MFSK) with small order of M and On-Off Keying (OOK) have significant energy saving compared to other schemes for short range scenarios, and could be considered as realistic candidates in WSNs. In addition, NC-MFSK and OOK have the advantage of less complexity and cost in implementation than the other schemes.
