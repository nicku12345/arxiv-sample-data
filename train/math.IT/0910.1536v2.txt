This work proposes a complete algebraic model for classical information theory. As a precursor the essential probabilistic concepts have been defined and analyzed in the algebraic setting. Examples from probability and information theory demonstrate that in addition to theoretical insights provided by the algebraic model one obtains new computational and anlytical tools. Several important theorems of classical probahility and information theory are formulated and proved in the algebraic framework.
