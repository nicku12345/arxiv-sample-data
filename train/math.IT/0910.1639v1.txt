This paper considers the problem of channel sensing in cognitive radios. The system model considered is a set of N parallel (dis-similar) channels, where each channel at any given time is either available or occupied by a legitimate user. The cognitive radio is permitted to sense channels to determine each of their states as available or occupied. The end goal of this paper is to select the best L channels to sense at any given time. Using a convex relaxation approach, this paper formulates and approximately solves this optimal selection problem. Finally, the solution obtained to the relaxed optimization problem is translated into a practical algorithm.
