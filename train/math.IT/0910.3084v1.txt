Self-dual codes over \Z_2\times\Z_4 are subgroups of \Z_2^\alpha \times\Z_4^\beta that are equal to their orthogonal under an inner-product that relates to the binary Hamming scheme. Three types of self-dual codes are defined. For each type, the possible values \alpha,\beta such that there exist a code \C\subseteq \Z_2^\alpha \times\Z_4^\beta are established. Moreover, the construction of a \add-linear code for each type and possible pair (\alpha,\beta) is given. Finally, the standard techniques of invariant theory are applied to describe the weight enumerators for each type.
