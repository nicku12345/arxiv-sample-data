In this paper, we propose a structured peer-to-peer (P2P) distribution scheme based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) graphs. We build a peer-to-peer network that reproduces the FFT graph initially designed for hardware FFT codecs. This topology allows content delivery with a maximum diversity level for a minimum global complexity. The resulting FFTbased network is a structured architecture with an adapted network coding that brings flexibility upon content distribution and robustness upon the dynamic nature of the network. This structure can achieve optimal capacity in terms of content recovery while solving the problem of last remaining blocks, even for large networks.
