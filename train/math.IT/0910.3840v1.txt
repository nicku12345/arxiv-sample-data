In distributed wireless networks, nodes often do not know the topology (network size, connectivity and the channel gains) of the network. Thus, they have to compute their transmission and reception parameters in a distributed fashion. In this paper, we consider that each of the transmitter know the channel gains of all the links that are at-most two-hop distant from it and the receiver knows the channel gains of all the links that are three-hop distant from it in a deterministic interference channel. With this limited information, we find a condition on the network connectivity for which there exist a distributed strategy that can be chosen by the users with partial information about the network state, which achieves the same sum capacity as that achievable by the centralized server that knows all the channel gains. Specifically, distributed decisions are sum-rate optimal only if each connected component is in a one-to-many configuration or a fully-connected configuration. In all other cases of network connectivity, the loss can be arbitrarily large.
