An upper bound on the ergodic capacity of {\bf MIMO} channels was introduced recently in arXiv:0903.1952. This upper bound amounts to the maximization on the simplex of some multilinear polynomial p(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n) with non-negative coefficients. Interestingly, the coefficients are subpermanents of some non-negative matrix. In general, such maximizations problems are {\bf NP-HARD}. But if say, the functional \log(p) is concave on the simplex and can be efficiently evaluated, then the maximization can also be done efficiently. Such log-concavity was conjectured in arXiv:0903.1952. We give in this paper self-contained proof of the conjecture, based on the theory of {\bf H-Stable} polynomials.
