The communication between a multiple-antenna transmitter and multiple receivers (users) with either a single or multiple-antenna each can be significantly enhanced by providing the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) of the users, as this allows for scheduling, beamforming and multiuser multiplexing gains. The traditional view on how to enable CSIT has been as follows so far: In time-division duplexed (TDD) systems, uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) channel reciprocity allows the use of a training sequence in the UL direction, which is exploited to obtain an UL channel estimate. This estimate is in turn recycled in the next downlink slot. In frequency-division duplexed (FDD) systems, which lack the UL and DL reciprocity, the CSIT is provided via the use of a dedicated feedback link of limited capacity between the receivers and the transmitter. In this paper, we focus on TDD systems and put this classical approach in question. In particular, we show that the traditional TDD setup above fails to fully exploit the channel reciprocity in its true sense. In fact, we show that the system can benefit from a combined CSIT acquisition strategy mixing the use of limited feedback and that of a training sequence. This combining gives rise to a very interesting joint estimation and detection problem for which we propose two iterative algorithms. An outage rate based framework is also developed which gives the optimal resource split between training and feedback. We demonstrate the potential of this hybrid combining in terms of the improved CSIT quality under a global training and feedback resource constraint.
