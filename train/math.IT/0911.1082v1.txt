This work studies the capacity region of a two-user ergodic interference channel with fading, where only one of the users is subject to interference from the other user, and the channel state information (CSI) is only available at the receivers. A layered erasure model with one-sided interference and with arbitrary fading statistics is studied first, whose capacity region is completely determined as a polygon. Each dominant rate pair can be regarded as the outcome of a trade-off between the rate gain of the interference-free user and the rate loss of the other user due to interference. Using insights from the layered erasure model, inner and outer bounds of the capacity region are provided for the one-sided fading Gaussian interference channels. In particular, the inner bound is achieved by artificially creating layers in the signaling of the interference-free user. The outer bound is developed by characterizing a similar trade-off as in the erasure model by taking a "layered" view using the incremental channel approach. Furthermore, the gap between the inner and outer bounds is no more than 12.772 bits per channel use per user, regardless of the signal-to-noise ratios and fading statistics.
