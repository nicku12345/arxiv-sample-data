In this paper we show that if the restricted isometry constant \delta_k of the compressed sensing matrix satisfies \[ \delta_k < 0.307, \] then k-sparse signals are guaranteed to be recovered exactly via \ell_1 minimization when no noise is present and k-sparse signals can be estimated stably in the noisy case. It is also shown that the bound cannot be substantively improved. An explicitly example is constructed in which \delta_{k}=\frac{k-1}{2k-1} < 0.5, but it is impossible to recover certain k-sparse signals.
