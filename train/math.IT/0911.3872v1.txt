An operational perspective is used to understand the relationship between source and channel coding. This is based on a direct reduction of one problem to another that uses random coding (and hence common randomness) but unlike all prior work, does not involve any functional computations, in particular, no mutual-information computations. This result is then used to prove a universal source-channel separation theorem in the rate-distortion context where universality is in the sense of a compound ``general channel.''
