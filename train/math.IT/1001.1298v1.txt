In this paper we propose a novel transmit signal structure and an adjusted and optimized receiver for OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing). Instead of the conventional cyclic prefix we use a deterministic sequence, which we call unique word (UW), as guard interval. We show how unique words, which are already well investigated for single carrier systems with frequency domain equalization (SC/FDE), can also be introduced in OFDM symbols. Since unique words represent known sequences, they can advantageously be used for synchronization and channel estimation purposes. Furthermore, the proposed approach introduces a complex number Reed-Solomon (RS-) code structure within the sequence of subcarriers. This allows for RS-decoding or to apply a highly efficient Wiener smoother succeeding a zero forcing stage at the receiver. We present simulation results in an indoor multipath environment to highlight the advantageous properties of the proposed scheme.
