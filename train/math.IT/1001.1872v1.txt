For an n_t transmit, n_r receive antenna system (n_t \times n_r system), a {\it{full-rate}} space time block code (STBC) transmits min(n_t,n_r) complex symbols per channel use. In this paper, a scheme to obtain a full-rate STBC for 4 transmit antennas and any n_r, with reduced ML-decoding complexity is presented. The weight matrices of the proposed STBC are obtained from the unitary matrix representations of Clifford Algebra. By puncturing the symbols of the STBC, full rate designs can be obtained for n_r < 4. For any value of n_r, the proposed design offers the least ML-decoding complexity among known codes. The proposed design is comparable in error performance to the well known perfect code for 4 transmit antennas while offering lower ML-decoding complexity. Further, when n_r < 4, the proposed design has higher ergodic capacity than the punctured Perfect code. Simulation results which corroborate these claims are presented.
