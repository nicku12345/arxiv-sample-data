We study the capacity regions of broadcast channels with binary inputs and symmetric outputs. We study the partial order induced by the more capable ordering of broadcast channels for channels belonging to this class. This study leads to some surprising connections regarding various notions of dominance of receivers. The results here also help us isolate some classes of symmetric channels where the best known inner and outer bounds differ.
