Spatial interference alignment among a finite number of users is proposed as a technique to increase the probability of successful transmission in an interference limited clustered wireless ad hoc network. Using techniques from stochastic geometry, we build on the work of Ganti and Haenggi dealing with Poisson cluster processes with a fixed number of cluster points and provide a numerically integrable expression for the outage probability using an intra-cluster interference alignment strategy with multiplexing gain one. For a special network setting we derive a closed-form upper bound. We demonstrate significant performance gains compared to single-antenna systems without local cooperation.
