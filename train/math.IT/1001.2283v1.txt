We present a method to compute, quickly and efficiently, the mutual information achieved by an IID (independent identically distributed) complex Gaussian input on a block Rayleigh-faded channel without side information at the receiver. The method accommodates both scalar and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) settings. Operationally, the mutual information thus computed represents the highest spectral efficiency that can be attained using standard Gaussian codebooks. Examples are provided that illustrate the loss in spectral efficiency caused by fast fading and how that loss is amplified by the use of multiple transmit antennas. These examples are further enriched by comparisons with the channel capacity under perfect channel-state information at the receiver, and with the spectral efficiency attained by pilot-based transmission.
