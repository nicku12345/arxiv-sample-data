A lower bound on the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel with state information available causally at both the encoder and decoder is established. The lower bound is shown to be strictly larger than that for the noncausal case by Liu and Chen. Achievability is proved using block Markov coding, Shannon strategy, and key generation from common state information. The state sequence available at the end of each block is used to generate a key, which is used to enhance the transmission rate of the confidential message in the following block. An upper bound on the secrecy capacity when the state is available noncausally at the encoder and decoder is established and is shown to coincide with the lower bound for several classes of wiretap channels with state.
