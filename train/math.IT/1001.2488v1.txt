An analog source is to be transmitted across a Gaussian channel in more than one channel use per source symbol. This paper derives a lower bound on the asymptotic mean squared error for a strategy that consists of repeatedly quantizing the source, transmitting the quantizer outputs in the first channel uses, and sending the remaining quantization error uncoded in the last channel use. The bound coincides with the performance achieved by a suboptimal decoder studied by the authors in a previous paper, thereby establishing that the bound is tight.
