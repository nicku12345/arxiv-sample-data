In interference alignment, users sharing a wireless channel are each able to achieve data rates of up to half of the non-interfering channel capacity, no matter the number of users. In an ergodic setting, this is achieved by pairing complementary channel realizations in order to amplify signals and cancel interference. However, this scheme has the possibility for large delays in decoding message symbols. We show that delay can be mitigated by using outputs from potentially more than two channel realizations, although data rate may be reduced. We further demonstrate the tradeoff between rate and delay via a time-sharing strategy. Our analysis considers Gaussian channels; an extension to finite field channels is also possible.
