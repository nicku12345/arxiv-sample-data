We propose an Euclidean geometric representation for the classical detection theory. The proposed representation is so generic that can be employed to almost all communication problems. The hypotheses and observations are mapped into R^N in such a way that a posteriori probability of an hypothesis given an observation decreases exponentially with the square of the Euclidean distance between the vectors corresponding to the hypothesis and the observation.
