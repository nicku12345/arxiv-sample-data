We consider the asymptotic behavior of the polarization process for polar codes when the blocklength tends to infinity. In particular, we study the problem of asymptotic analysis of the cumulative distribution \mathbb{P}(Z_n \leq z), where Z_n=Z(W_n) is the Bhattacharyya process, and its dependence to the rate of transmission R. We show that for a BMS channel W, for R < I(W) we have \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P} (Z_n \leq 2^{-2^{\frac{n}{2}+\sqrt{n} \frac{Q^{-1}(\frac{R}{I(W)})}{2} +o(\sqrt{n})}}) = R and for R<1- I(W) we have \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P} (Z_n \geq 1-2^{-2^{\frac{n}{2}+ \sqrt{n} \frac{Q^{-1}(\frac{R}{1-I(W)})}{2} +o(\sqrt{n})}}) = R, where Q(x) is the probability that a standard normal random variable will obtain a value larger than x. As a result, if we denote by \mathbb{P}_e ^{\text{SC}}(n,R) the probability of error using polar codes of block-length N=2^n and rate R<I(W) under successive cancellation decoding, then \log(-\log(\mathbb{P}_e ^{\text{SC}}(n,R))) scales as \frac{n}{2}+\sqrt{n}\frac{Q^{-1}(\frac{R}{I(W)})}{2}+ o(\sqrt{n}). We also prove that the same result holds for the block error probability using the MAP decoder, i.e., for \log(-\log(\mathbb{P}_e ^{\text{MAP}}(n,R))).
