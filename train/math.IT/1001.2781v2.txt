In 1985 Kaspi provided a single-letter characterization of the sum-rate-distortion function for a two-way lossy source coding problem in which two terminals send multiple messages back and forth with the goal of reproducing each other's sources. Yet, the question remained whether more messages can strictly improve the sum-rate-distortion function. Viewing the sum-rate as a functional of the distortions and the joint source distribution and leveraging its convex-geometric properties, we construct an example which shows that two messages can strictly improve the one-message (Wyner-Ziv) rate-distortion function. The example also shows that the ratio of the one-message rate to the two-message sum-rate can be arbitrarily large and simultaneously the ratio of the backward rate to the forward rate in the two-message sum-rate can be arbitrarily small.
