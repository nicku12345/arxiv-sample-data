A Han-Kobayashi based achievable scheme is presented for ergodic fading two-user Gaussian interference channels (IFCs) with perfect channel state information at all nodes and Gaussian codebooks with no time-sharing. Using max-min optimization techniques, it is shown that jointly coding across all states performs at least as well as separable coding for the sub-classes of uniformly weak (every sub-channel is weak) and hybrid (mix of strong and weak sub-channels that do not achieve the interference-free sum-capacity) IFCs. For the uniformly weak IFCs, sufficient conditions are obtained for which the sum-rate is maximized when interference is ignored at both receivers.
