- The main goal of this research is to develop the concept of an innovative processor system called Functional Processor System. The particular work carried out in this paper focuses on the execution of functions in the heterogeneous functional processor units(FPU) and integration of functions to bring net results. As the functional programs are super-level programs, the requirements of execution are only at functional level. The Execution and integration of results of functions in FPUs are a challenge. The methodology of executing the functions in the functional processor farm and the integration of results of functions according to the assigned addresses are investigated here. The concept of feeding the functions into the processor is promoted rather than the processor fetching the instructions/functions and executing in this paradigm. This work is carried out at conceptual levels and it takes a long way to go into the realization of this model in hardware, possibly only with a large industry team and with a realistic time frame.
