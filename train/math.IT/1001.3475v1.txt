In this paper, a two-hop relay assisted cooperative Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes (OSTBC) transmission scheme is considered for the downlink communication of a cellular system, where the base station (BS) and the relay station (RS) cooperate and transmit data to the user equipment (UE) in a distributed fashion. We analyze the impact of the SNR imbalance between the BS-UE and RS-UE links, as well as the imperfect channel estimation at the UE receiver. The performance is analyzed in the presence of Rayleigh flat fading and our results show that the SNR imbalance does not impact the spatial diversity order. On the other hand, channel estimation errors have a larger impact on the system performance. Simulation results are then provided to confirm the analysis.
