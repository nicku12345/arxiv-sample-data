Thermodynamic properties such as temperature, pressure, and internal energy have been defined for finite binary strings from equilibrium distribution of a chosen computable measure. It is demonstrated a binary string can be associated with one-dimensional gas of quasi-particles of certain mass, momentum, and energy.
