We consider content distribution in vehicular ad hoc networks. We assume that a file is encoded using fountain code, and the encoded message is cached at infostations. Vehicles are allowed to download data packets from infostations, which are placed along a highway. In addition, two vehicles can exchange packets with each other when they are in proximity. As long as a vehicle has received enough packets from infostations or from other vehicles, the original file can be recovered. In this work, we show that system throughput increases linearly with number of users, meaning that the system exhibits linear scalability. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of mobility on system throughput by considering both discrete and continuous velocity distributions for the vehicles. In both cases, system throughput is shown to decrease when the average speed of all vehicles increases. In other words, higher overall mobility reduces system throughput.
