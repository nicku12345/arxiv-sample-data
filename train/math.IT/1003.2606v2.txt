For a family/sequence of STBCs \mathcal{C}_1,\mathcal{C}_2,\dots, with increasing number of transmit antennas N_i, with rates R_i complex symbols per channel use (cspcu), the asymptotic normalized rate is defined as \lim_{i \to \infty}{\frac{R_i}{N_i}}. A family of STBCs is said to be asymptotically-good if the asymptotic normalized rate is non-zero, i.e., when the rate scales as a non-zero fraction of the number of transmit antennas, and the family of STBCs is said to be asymptotically-optimal if the asymptotic normalized rate is 1, which is the maximum possible value. In this paper, we construct a new class of full-diversity STBCs that have the least ML decoding complexity among all known codes for any number of transmit antennas N>1 and rates R>1 cspcu. For a large set of \left(R,N\right) pairs, the new codes have lower ML decoding complexity than the codes already available in the literature. Among the new codes, the class of full-rate codes (R=N) are asymptotically-optimal and fast-decodable, and for N>5 have lower ML decoding complexity than all other families of asymptotically-optimal, fast-decodable, full-diversity STBCs available in the literature. The construction of the new STBCs is facilitated by the following further contributions of this paper:(i) For g > 1, we construct g-group ML-decodable codes with rates greater than one cspcu. These codes are asymptotically-good too. For g>2, these are the first instances of g-group ML-decodable codes with rates greater than 1 cspcu presented in the literature. (ii) We construct a new class of fast-group-decodable codes for all even number of transmit antennas and rates 1 < R \leq 5/4.(iii) Given a design with full-rank linear dispersion matrices, we show that a full-diversity STBC can be constructed from this design by encoding the real symbols independently using only regular PAM constellations.
