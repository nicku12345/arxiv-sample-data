For an n_t transmit, n_r receive antenna system (n_t \times n_r system), a {\it{full-rate}} space time block code (STBC) transmits n_{min} = min(n_t,n_r) complex symbols per channel use and in general, has an ML-decoding complexity of the order of M^{n_tn_{min}} (considering square designs), where M is the constellation size. In this paper, a scheme to obtain a full-rate STBC for 2^a transmit antennas and any n_r, with reduced ML-decoding complexity of the order of M^{n_t(n_{min}-3/4)}, is presented. The weight matrices of the proposed STBC are obtained from the unitary matrix representations of a Clifford Algebra. For any value of n_r, the proposed design offers a reduction from the full ML-decoding complexity by a factor of M^{3n_t/4}}. The well known Silver code for 2 transmit antennas is a special case of the proposed scheme. Further, it is shown that the codes constructed using the scheme have higher ergodic capacity than the well known punctured Perfect codes for n_r < n_t. Simulation results of the symbol error rates are shown for 8 \times 2 systems, where the comparison of the proposed code is with the punctured Perfect code for 8 transmit antennas. The proposed code matches the punctured perfect code in error performance, while having reduced ML-decoding complexity and higher ergodic capacity.
