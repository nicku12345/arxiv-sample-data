Partial interference cancellation (PIC) group decoding proposed by Guo and Xia is an attractive low-complexity alternative to the optimal processing for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications. It can well deal with the tradeoff among rate, diversity and complexity of space-time block codes (STBC). In this paper, a systematic design of full-diversity STBC with low-complexity PIC group decoding is proposed. The proposed code design is featured as a group-orthogonal STBC by replacing every element of an Alamouti code matrix with an elementary matrix composed of multiple diagonal layers of coded symbols. With the PIC group decoding and a particular grouping scheme, the proposed STBC can achieve full diversity, a rate of (2M)/(M+2) and a low-complexity decoding for M transmit antennas. Simulation results show that the proposed codes can achieve the full diversity with PIC group decoding while requiring half decoding complexity of the existing codes.
