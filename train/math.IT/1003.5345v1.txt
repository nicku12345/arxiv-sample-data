In this paper we are going to estimate the sum capacity of a binary CDMA system in presence of the near-far effect. We model the near-far effect as a random variable that is multiplied by the users binary data before entering the noisy channel. We will find a lower bound and a conjectured upper bound for the sum capacity in this situation. All the derivations are in the asymptotic case. Simulations show that especially the lower bound is very tight for typical values Eb/N0 and near-far effect. Also, we exploit our idea in conjunction with the Tanaka's formula [6] which also estimates the sum capacity of binary CDMA systems with perfect power control.
