Consider the broadcast relay channel (BRC) which consists of a source sending information over a two user broadcast   channel in presence of two relay nodes that help the transmission to the destinations. Clearly, this network with   five nodes involves all the problems encountered in relay and broadcast channels. New inner bounds on the capacity   region of this class of channels are derived. These results can be seen as a generalization and hence unification of   previous work in this topic. Our bounds are based on the idea of recombination of message bits and various effective   coding strategies for relay and broadcast channels. Capacity result is obtained for the semi-degraded BRC-CR, where   one relay channel is degraded while the other one is reversely degraded. An inner and upper bound is also presented   for the degraded BRC with common relay (BRC-CR), where both the relay and broadcast channel are degraded which is   the capacity for the Gaussian case. Application of these results arise in the context of opportunistic cooperation   of cellular networks.
