We introduce an additive but not \mathbb{F}_4-linear map S from \mathbb{F}_4^{n} to \mathbb{F}_4^{2n} and exhibit some of its interesting structural properties. If C is a linear [n,k,d]_4-code, then S(C) is an additive (2n,2^{2k},2d)_4-code. If C is an additive cyclic code then S(C) is an additive quasi-cyclic code of index 2. Moreover, if C is a module \theta-cyclic code, a recently introduced type of code which will be explained below, then S(C) is equivalent to an additive cyclic code if n is odd and to an additive quasi-cyclic code of index 2 if n is even. Given any (n,M,d)_4-code C, the code S(C) is self-orthogonal under the trace Hermitian inner product. Since the mapping S preserves nestedness, it can be used as a tool in constructing additive asymmetric quantum codes.
