We consider a two-way relay network, where two source nodes, S1 and S2, exchange information through a cluster of relay nodes. The relay nodes receive the sum signal from S1 and S2 in the first time slot. In the second time slot, each relay node multiplies its received signal by a complex coefficient and retransmits the signal to the two source nodes, which leads to a distributed two-way beamforming system. By applying the principle of analog network coding, each receiver at S1 and S2 cancels the ``self-interference'' in the received signal from the relay cluster and decodes the message. This paper studies the 2-dimensional achievable rate region for such a two-way relay network with distributed beamforming. With different assumptions of channel reciprocity between the source-relay and relay-source channels, the achievable rate region is characterized under two setups. First, with reciprocal channels, we investigate the achievable rate regions when the relay cluster is subject to a sum-power constraint or individual-power constraints. We show that the optimal beamforming vectors obtained from solving the weighted sum inverse-SNR minimization (WSISMin) problems are sufficient to characterize the corresponding achievable rate region. Furthermore, we derive the closed form solutions for those optimal beamforming vectors and consequently propose the partially distributed algorithms to implement the optimal beamforming, where each relay node only needs the local channel information and one global parameter. Second, with the non-reciprocal channels, the achievable rate regions are also characterized for both the sum-power constraint case and the individual-power constraint case. Although no closed-form solutions are available under this setup, we present efficient algorithms to compute the optimal beamforming vectors, which are attained by solving SDP problems after semi-definite relaxation.
