This paper presents a power-efficient mask-constrained ultra-wideband (UWB) waveform design with radio channel effects taken into consideration. Based on a finite impulse response (FIR) filter, we develop a convex optimization model with respect to the autocorrelation of the filter coefficients to optimize the transmitted signal power spectrum, subject to a regulatory emission mask. To improve power efficiency, effects of transmitter radio frequency (RF) components are included in the optimization of the transmitter-output waveform, and radio propagation effects are considered for optimizing at the receiver. Optimum coefficients of the FIR filter are obtained through spectral factorization of their autocorrelations. Simulation results show that the proposed method is able to maximize the transmitted UWB signal power under mask constraints set by regulatory authorities, while mitigating the power loss caused by channel attenuations.
