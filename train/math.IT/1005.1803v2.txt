Too high sampling rate is the bottleneck to wideband spectrum sensing for cognitive radio in mobile communication. Compressed sensing (CS) is introduced to transfer the sampling burden. The standard sparse signal recovery of CS does not consider the distortion in the analogue-to-information converter (AIC). To mitigate performance degeneration casued by the mismatch in least square distortionless constraint which doesn't consider the AIC distortion, we define the sparse signal with the sampling distortion as a bounded additive noise, and An anti-sampling-distortion constraint (ASDC) is deduced. Then we combine the \ell1 norm based sparse constraint with the ASDC to get a novel robust sparse signal recovery operator with sampling distortion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms standard sparse wideband spectrum sensing in accuracy, denoising ability, etc.
