Wideband wireless channel is a time dispersive channel and becomes strongly frequency-selective. However, in most cases, the channel is composed of a few dominant taps and a large part of taps is approximately zero or zero. To exploit the sparsity of multi-path channel (MPC), two methods have been proposed. They are, namely, greedy algorithm and convex program. Greedy algorithm is easy to be implemented but not stable; on the other hand, the convex program method is stable but difficult to be implemented as practical channel estimation problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel channel estimation strategy using compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm which was proposed in [1]. This algorithm will combine the greedy algorithm with the convex program method. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm will be confirmed through comparisons with the existing methods.
