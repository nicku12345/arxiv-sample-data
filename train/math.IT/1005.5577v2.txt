In this paper, linear transceiver design for dual-hop non-regenerative (amplify-and-forward (AF)) MIMO-OFDM systems under channel estimation errors is investigated. Second order moments of channel estimation errors in the two hops are first deduced. Then based on the Bayesian framework, joint design of linear forwarding matrix at the relay and equalizer at the destination under channel estimation errors is proposed to minimize the total mean-square-error (MSE) of the output signal at the destination. The optimal designs for both correlated and uncorrelated channel estimation errors are considered. The relationship with existing algorithms is also disclosed. Moreover, this design is extended to the joint design involving source precoder design. Simulation results show that the proposed design outperforms the design based on estimated channel state information only.
