This work proposes an algebraic model for classical information theory. We first give an algebraic model of probability theory. Information theoretic constructs are based on this model. In addition to theoretical insights provided by our model one obtains new computational and analytical tools. Several important theorems of classical probability and information theory are presented in the algebraic framework.
