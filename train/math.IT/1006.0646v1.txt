We study irregular binary turbo codes over non-ergodic block-fading channels. We first propose an extension of channel multiplexers initially designed for regular turbo codes. We then show that, using these multiplexers, irregular turbo codes that exhibit a small decoding threshold over the ergodic Gaussian-noise channel perform very close to the outage probability on block-fading channels, from both density evolution and finite-length perspectives.
