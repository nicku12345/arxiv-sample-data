Coding for the causal cognitive radio channel, with the cognitive source subjected to a half-duplex constraint, is studied. A discrete memoryless channel model incorporating the half-duplex constraint is presented, and a new achievable rate region is derived for this channel. It is proved that this rate region contains the previously known causal achievable rate region of \cite{Devroye06} for Gaussian channels.
