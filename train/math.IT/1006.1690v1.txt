In this paper, we propose a full-duplex relay (FDR) based on a zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) for a multiuser MIMO relay system. The ZFBF is employed at the base station to suppress both the self-interference of the relay and the multiuser interference at the same time. Numerical results show that the proposed FDR can enhance the sum rate performance as compared to the half-duplex relay (HDR), if sufficient isolation between the transmit and receive antennas is ensured at the relay.
