Associative division algebras are a rich source of fully diverse space-time block codes (STBCs). In this paper the systematic construction of fully diverse STBCs from nonassociative algebras is discussed. As examples, families of fully diverse 2\times 2, 2\times 4 multiblock and 4\x 4 STBCs are designed, employing nonassociative quaternion division algebras.
