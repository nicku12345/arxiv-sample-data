We study the capacity region C_L of an arbitrarily varying multiple-access channel (AVMAC) for deterministic codes with decoding into a list of a fixed size L and for the average error probability criterion. Motivated by known results in the study of fixed size list decoding for a point-to-point arbitrarily varying channel, we define for every AVMAC whose capacity region for random codes has a nonempty interior, a nonnegative integer \Omega called its symmetrizability. It is shown that for every L \leq \Omega, C_L has an empty interior, and for every L \geq (\Omega+1)^2, C_L equals the nondegenerate capacity region of the AVMAC for random codes with a known single-letter characterization. For a binary AVMAC with a nondegenerate random code capacity region, it is shown that the symmetrizability is always finite.
