This paper presents a new approach for channel tracking and parameter estimation in cooperative wireless relay networks. We consider a system with multiple relay nodes operating under an amplify and forward relay function. We develop a novel algorithm to efficiently solve the challenging problem of joint channel tracking and parameters estimation of the Jakes' system model within a mobile wireless relay network. This is based on \textit{particle Markov chain Monte Carlo} (PMCMC) method. In particular, it first involves developing a Bayesian state space model, then estimating the associated high dimensional posterior using an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler relying on a proposal built using a Rao-Blackwellised Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) filter.
