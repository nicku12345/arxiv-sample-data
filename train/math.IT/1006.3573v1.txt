We show that polar codes asymptotically achieve the whole capacity-equivocation region for the wiretap channel when the wiretapper's channel is degraded with respect to the main channel, and the weak secrecy notion is used. Our coding scheme also achieves the capacity of the physically degraded receiver-orthogonal relay channel. We show simulation results for moderate block length for the binary erasure wiretap channel, comparing polar codes and two edge type LDPC codes.
