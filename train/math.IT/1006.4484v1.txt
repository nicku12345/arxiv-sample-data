Efficient information reconciliation is crucial in several scenarios, being quantum key distribution a remarkable example. However, efficiency is not the only requirement for determining the quality of the information reconciliation process. In some of these scenarios we find other relevant parameters such as the interactivity or the adaptability to different channel statistics. We propose an interactive protocol for information reconciliation based on low-density parity-check codes. The coding rate is adapted in real time by using simultaneously puncturing and shortening strategies, allowing it to cover a predefined error rate range with just a single code. The efficiency of the information reconciliation process using the proposed protocol is considerably better than the efficiency of its non-interactive version.
