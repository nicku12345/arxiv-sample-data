This paper exploits recent developments in compressive sensing (CS) to efficiently perform the direction finding via amplitude comprarison. The new method is proposed based on unimodal characteristic of antenna pattern and sparse property of received data. Unlike the conventional methods based peak-searching and symmetric constraint, the sparse reconstruction algorithm requires less pulse and takes advantage of CS. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed method is better than the conventional methods.
