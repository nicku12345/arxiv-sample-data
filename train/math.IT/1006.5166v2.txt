We establish several new results on Marton's coding scheme and its corresponding inner bound on the capacity region of the general broadcast channel. We show that unlike the Gaussian case, Marton's coding scheme without superposition coding is not optimal in general even for a degraded broadcast channel with no common message. We then establish properties of Marton's inner bound that help restrict the search space for computing the sum-rate. Next, we show that the inner bound is optimal along certain directions. Finally, we propose a coding scheme that may lead to a larger inner bound.
