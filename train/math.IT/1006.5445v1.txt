We take two new approaches to design efficient algorithms for transmitter optimization under rate constraints to guarantee the Quality of Service in general MIMO interference networks, named B-MAC Networks, which is a combination of multiple interfering broadcast channels (BC) and multiaccess channels (MAC). Two related optimization problems, maximizing the minimum of weighted rates under a sum-power constraint and minimizing the sum-power under rate constraints, are considered. The first approach takes advantage of existing efficient algorithms for SINR problems by building a bridge between rate and SINR through the design of optimal mappings between them so that the problems can be converted to SINR constraint problems. The approach can be applied to other optimization problems as well. The second approach employs polite water-filling, which is the optimal network version of water-filling that we recently found. It replaces almost all generic optimization algorithms currently used for networks and reduces the complexity while demonstrating superior performance even in non-convex cases. Both centralized and distributed algorithms are designed and the performance is analyzed in addition to numeric examples.
