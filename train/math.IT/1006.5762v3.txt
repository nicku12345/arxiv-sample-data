Protocol sequences are used for channel access in the collision channel without feedback. Each user accesses the channel according to a deterministic zero-one pattern, called the protocol sequence. In order to minimize fluctuation of throughput due to delay offsets, we want to construct protocol sequences whose pairwise Hamming cross-correlation is as close to a constant as possible. In this paper, we present a construction of protocol sequences which is based on the bijective mapping between one-dimensional sequence and two-dimensional array by the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). In the application to the collision channel without feedback, a worst-case lower bound on system throughput is derived.
