The multi-edge type LDPC codes, introduced by Richardson and Urbanke, present the general class of structured LDPC codes. In this paper, we derive the average weight distributions of the multi-edge type LDPC code ensembles. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic exponential growth rate of the average weight distributions and investigate the connection to the stability condition of the density evolution.
