We study incremental redundancy hybrid ARQ (IR-HARQ) schemes based on punctured, finite-length, LDPC codes. The transmission is assumed to take place over time varying binary erasure channels, such as mobile wireless channels at the applications layer. We analyze and optimize the throughput and delay performance of these IR-HARQ protocols under iterative, message-passing decoding. We derive bounds on the performance that are achievable by such schemes, and show that, with a simple extension, the iteratively decoded, punctured LDPC code based IR-HARQ protocol can be made rateless, and operating close to the general theoretical optimum for a wide range of channel erasure rates.
