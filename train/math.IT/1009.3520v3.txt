When the Channel State Information (CSI) is known by both the transmitter and the receiver, beamforming techniques employing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are commonly used in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. Without channel coding, there is a trade-off between full diversity and full multiplexing. When channel coding is added, both of them can be achieved as long as the code rate Rc and the number of employed subchannels S satisfy the condition RcS<=1. By adding a properly designed constellation precoder, both full diversity and full multiplexing can be achieved for both uncoded and coded systems with the trade-off of a higher decoding complexity, e.g., Fully Precoded Multiple Beamforming (FPMB) and Bit-Interleaved Coded Multiple Beamforming with Full Precoding (BICMB-FP) without the condition RcS<=1. Recently discovered Perfect Space-Time Block Code (PSTBC) is a full-rate full-diversity space-time code, which achieves efficient shaping and high coding gain for MIMO systems. In this paper, a new technique, Bit-Interleaved Coded Multiple Beamforming with Perfect Coding (BICMB-PC), is introduced. BICMB-PC transmits PSTBCs through convolutional coded SVD systems. Similar to BICMB-FP, BICMB-PC achieves both full diversity and full multiplexing, and its performance is almost the same as BICMB-FP. The advantage of BICMB-PC is that it can provide a much lower decoding complexity than BICMB-FP, since the real and imaginary parts of the received signal can be separated for BICMB-PC of dimensions 2 and 4, and only the part corresponding to the coded bit is required to acquire one bit metric for the Viterbi decoder.
