Frequency hopping (FH) sequences play a key role in frequency hopping spread spectrum communication systems. It is important to find FH sequences which have simultaneously good Hamming correlation, large family size and large period. In this paper, a new set of FH sequences with large period is proposed, and the Hamming correlation distribution of the new set is investigated. The construction of new FH sequences is based upon Whiteman's generalized cyclotomy. It is shown that the proposed FH sequence set is optimal with respect to the average Hamming correlation bound.
