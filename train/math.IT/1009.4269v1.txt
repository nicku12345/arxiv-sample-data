We consider a two-user Gaussian multiple access channel with two independent additive white Gaussian interferences. Each interference is known to exactly one transmitter non-causally. Transmitters are allowed to cooperate through finite-capacity links. The capacity region is characterized to within 3 and 1.5 bits for the stronger user and the weaker user respectively, regardless of channel parameters. As a by-product, we characterize the capacity region of the case without cooperation to within 1 and 0.5 bits for the stronger user and the weaker user respectively. These results are based on a layered modulo-lattice transmission architecture which realizes distributed interference cancellation.
