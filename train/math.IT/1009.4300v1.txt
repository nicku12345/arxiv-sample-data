In this paper, we propose a robust transceiver design for the K-pair quasi-static MIMO interference channel. Each transmitter is equipped with M antennas, each receiver is equipped with N antennas, and the k-th transmitter sends L_k independent data streams to the desired receiver. In the literature, there exist a variety of theoretically promising transceiver designs for the interference channel such as interference alignment-based schemes, which have feasibility and practical limitations. In order to address practical system issues and requirements, we consider a transceiver design that enforces robustness against imperfect channel state information (CSI) as well as fair performance among the users in the interference channel. Specifically, we formulate the transceiver design as an optimization problem to maximize the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio among all users. We devise a low complexity iterative algorithm based on alternative optimization and semi-definite relaxation techniques. Numerical results verify the advantages of incorporating into transceiver design for the interference channel important practical issues such as CSI uncertainty and fairness performance.
