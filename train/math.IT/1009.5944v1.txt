In this paper, we consider CSMA policies for scheduling of multihop wireless networks with one-hop traffic. The main contribution of this paper is to propose Unlocking CSMA (U-CSMA) policy that enables to obtain high throughput with low (average) packet delay for large wireless networks. In particular, the delay under U-CSMA policy becomes order-optimal. For one-hop traffic, delay is defined to be order-optimal if it is O(1), i.e., it stays bounded, as the network-size increases to infinity. Using mean field theory techniques, we analytically show that for torus (grid-like) interference topologies with one-hop traffic, to achieve a network load of \rho, the delay under U-CSMA policy becomes O(1/(1-\rho)^{3}) as the network-size increases, and hence, delay becomes order optimal. We conduct simulations for general random geometric interference topologies under U-CSMA policy combined with congestion control to maximize a network-wide utility. These simulations confirm that order optimality holds, and that we can use U-CSMA policy jointly with congestion control to operate close to the optimal utility with a low packet delay in arbitrarily large random geometric topologies. To the best of our knowledge, it is for the first time that a simple distributed scheduling policy is proposed that in addition to throughput/utility-optimality exhibits delay order-optimality.
