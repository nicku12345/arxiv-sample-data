In this paper, we propose an antenna selection method in a wireless cognitive radio (CR) system, namely difference selection, whereby a single transmit antenna is selected at the secondary transmitter out of M possible antennas such that the weighted difference between the channel gains of the data link and the interference link is maximized. We analyze mutual information and outage probability of the secondary transmission in a CR system with difference antenna selection, and propose a method of optimizing these performance metrics of the secondary data link subject to practical constraints on the peak secondary transmit power and the average interference power as seen by the primary receiver. The optimization is performed over two parameters: the peak secondary transmit power and the difference selection weight \delta\in [0, 1]. We show that, difference selection using the optimized parameters determined by the proposed method can be, in many cases of interest, superior to a so called ratio selection method disclosed in the literature, although ratio selection has been shown to be optimal, when impractically, the secondary transmission power constraint is not applied. We address the effects that the constraints have on mutual information and outage probability, and discuss the practical implications of the results.
