We consider communication over the binary erasure channel (BEC) using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and belief propagation (BP) decoding. For fixed numbers of BP iterations, the bit error probability approaches a limit as blocklength tends to infinity, and the limit is obtained via density evolution. On the other hand, the difference between the bit error probability of codes with blocklength n and that in the large blocklength limit is asymptotically \alpha(\epsilon,t)/n + \Theta(n^{-2}) where \alpha(\epsilon,t) denotes a specific constant determined by the code ensemble considered, the number t of iterations, and the erasure probability \epsilon of the BEC. In this paper, we derive a set of recursive formulas which allows evaluation of the constant \alpha(\epsilon,t) for standard irregular ensembles. The dominant difference \alpha(\epsilon,t)/n can be considered as effects of cycle-free and single-cycle structures of local graphs. Furthermore, it is confirmed via numerical simulations that estimation of the bit error probability using \alpha(\epsilon,t) is accurate even for small blocklengths.
