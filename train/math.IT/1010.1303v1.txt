A unified framework to obtain all known lower bounds (random coding, typical random coding and expurgated bound) on the reliability function of a point-to-point discrete memoryless channel (DMC) is presented. By using a similar idea for a two-user discrete memoryless (DM) multiple-access channel (MAC), three lower bounds on the reliability function are derived. The first one (random coding) is identical to the best known lower bound on the reliability function of DM-MAC. It is shown that the random coding bound is the performance of the average code in the constant composition code ensemble. The second bound (Typical random coding) is the typical performance of the constant composition code ensemble. To derive the third bound (expurgated), we eliminate some of the codewords from the codebook with larger rate. This is the first bound of this type that explicitly uses the method of expurgation for MACs. It is shown that the exponent of the typical random coding and the expurgated bounds are greater than or equal to the exponent of the known random coding bounds for all rate pairs. Moreover, an example is given where the exponent of the expurgated bound is strictly larger. All these bounds can be universally obtained for all discrete memoryless MACs with given input and output alphabets.
