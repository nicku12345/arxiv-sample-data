Let \mathcal{X} and \mathcal{Y} be finite alphabets and P_{XY} a joint distribution over them, with P_X and P_Y representing the marginals. For any \epsilon > 0, the set of n-length sequences x^n and y^n that are jointly typical \cite{ckbook} according to P_{XY} can be represented on a bipartite graph. We present a formal definition of such a graph, known as a \emph{typicality} graph, and study some of its properties.
