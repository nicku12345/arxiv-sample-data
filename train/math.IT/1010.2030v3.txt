The average weight distribution of a regular low-density parity-check (LDPC) code ensemble over a finite field is thoroughly analyzed. In particular, a precise asymptotic approximation of the average weight distribution is derived for the small-weight case, and a series of fundamental qualitative properties of the asymptotic growth rate of the average weight distribution are proved. Based on this analysis, a general result, including all previous results as special cases, is established for the minimum distance of individual codes in a regular LDPC code ensemble.
