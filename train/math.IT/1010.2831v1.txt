A finite oscillator dictionary which has important applications in sequences designs and the compressive sensing was introduced by Gurevich, Hadani and Sochen. In this paper, we first revisit closed formulae of the finite split oscillator dictionary \mathfrak{S}^s by a simple proof. Then we study the non-split tori of the group SL(2,\mathbb{F}_p). Finally, An explicit algorithm for computing the finite non-split oscillator dictionary \mathfrak{S}^{ns} is described.
