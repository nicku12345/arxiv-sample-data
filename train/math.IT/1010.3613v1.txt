This paper generalizes Wyner's definition of common information of a pair of random variables to that of N random variables. We prove coding theorems that show the same operational meanings for the common information of two random variables generalize to that of N random variables. As a byproduct of our proof, we show that the Gray-Wyner source coding network can be generalized to N source squences with N decoders. We also establish a monotone property of Wyner's common information which is in contrast to other notions of the common information, specifically Shannon's mutual information and G\'{a}cs and K\"{o}rner's common randomness. Examples about the computation of Wyner's common information of N random variables are also given.
