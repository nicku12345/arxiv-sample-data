This paper investigates the problem of information transmission over the simultaneous relay channel with two users (or two possible channel outcomes) where for one of them the more suitable strategy is Decode-and-Forward (DF) while for the other one is Compress-and-Forward (CF). In this setting, it is assumed that the source wishes to send common and private informations to each of the users (or channel outcomes). This problem is relevant to: (i) the transmission of information over the broadcast relay channel (BRC) with different relaying strategies and (ii) the transmission of information over the conventional relay channel where the source is oblivious to the coding strategy of relay. A novel coding that integrates simultaneously DF and CF schemes is proposed and an inner bound on the capacity region is derived for the case of general memoryless BRCs. As special case, the Gaussian BRC is studied where it is shown that by means of the suggested broadcast coding the common rate can be improved compared to existing strategies. Applications of these results arise in broadcast scenarios with relays or in wireless scenarios where the source does not know whether the relay is collocated with the source or with the destination.
