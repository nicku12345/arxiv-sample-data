We consider the 3-user Gaussian interference channel and provide an outer bound on its capacity region. Under some conditions, which we call the mixed strong-very strong interference conditions, this outer bound is achievable. These conditions correspond to the case where at each receiver, one transmitter is causing strong interference and the other is causing very strong interference. Therefore, we characterize the capacity region of the 3-user interference channel with mixed strong-very strong interference.
