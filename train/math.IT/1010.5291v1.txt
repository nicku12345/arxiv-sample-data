In this paper, using the theory of polynomial residue class rings, a new construction is proposed for frequency hopping patterns having optimal Hamming autocorrelation with respect to the well-known Lempel-Greenberger bound. Based on the proposed construction, many new Peng-Fan optimal families of frequency hopping sequences are obtained. The parameters of these sets of frequency hopping sequences are new and flexible.
