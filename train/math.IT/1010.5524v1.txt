We consider general multi-antenna fading channels with coarsely quantized outputs, where the channel is unknown to the transmitter and receiver. This analysis is of interest in the context of sensor network communication where low power and low cost are key requirements (e.g. standard IEEE 802.15.4 applications). This is also motivated by highly energy constrained communications devices where sampling the signal may be more energy consuming than processing or transmitting it. Therefore the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for such applications should be low-resolution, in order to reduce their cost and power consumption. In this paper, we consider the extreme case of only 1-bit ADC for each receive signal component. We derive asymptotics of the mutual information up to the second order in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under average and peak power constraints and study the impact of quantization. We show that up to second order in SNR, the mutual information of a system with two-level (sign) output signals incorporates only a power penalty factor of almost 1.96 dB compared to the system with infinite resolution for all channels of practical interest. This generalizes a recent result for the coherent case.
