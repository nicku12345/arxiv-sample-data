A multiple access channel and a point-to-point channel sharing the same medium for communications are considered. We obtain an outer bound for the capacity region of this setup, and we show that this outer bound is achievable in some cases. These cases are mainly when interference is strong or very strong. A sum capacity upper bound is also obtained, which is nearly tight if the interference power at the receivers is low. In this case, using Gaussian codes and treating interference as noise achieves a sum rate close to the upper bound.
