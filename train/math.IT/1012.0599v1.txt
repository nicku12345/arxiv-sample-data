The dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF) relaying protocol is a relatively new cooperative scheme which has been shown to achieve promising theoretical results in terms of diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff and error rates. The case of a single relay has been extensively studied in the literature and several techniques to approach the optimum performance have been proposed. Until recently, however, a practical implementation for the case of several relays had been considered to be much more challenging. A rotation-based DDF technique, suitable for any number of relays, has been recently proposed which promises to overcome important implementation hurdles. This article provides an overview of the DDF protocol, describes different implementation techniques and compares their performance.
