In this paper, we address the transmit antenna selection in multi-user MIMO systems with precoding. The optimum and reduced complexity sub-optimum antenna selection algorithms are introduced. QR-decomposition (QRD) based antenna selection is investigated and the reason behind its sub-optimality is analytically derived. We introduce the conventional QRD-based algorithm and propose an efficient QRD-based transmit antenna scheme (maxR) that is both implementation and performance efficient. Moreover, we derive explicit formulae for the computational complexities of the aforementioned algorithms. Simulation results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed maxR algorithm requires only 1% of the computational efforts required by the optimal algorithm for a degradation of 1dB and 0.1dB in the case of linear zero-forcing and Tomlinson-Harashima precoding schemes, respectively.
