This paper concerns application of feedback in LT codes. The considered type of feedback is acknowledgments, where information on which symbols have been decoded is given to the transmitter. We identify an important adaptive mechanism in standard LT codes, which is crucial to their ability to perform well under any channel conditions. We show how precipitate application of acknowledgments can interfere with this adaptive mechanism and lead to significant performance degradation. Moreover, our analysis reveals that even sensible use of acknowledgments has very low potential in standard LT codes. Motivated by this, we analyze the impact of acknowledgments on multi layer LT codes, i.e. LT codes with unequal error protection. In this case, feedback proves advantageous. We show that by using only a single feedback message, it is possible to achieve a noticeable performance improvement compared to standard LT codes.
