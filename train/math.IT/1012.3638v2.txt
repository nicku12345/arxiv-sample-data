Sequences sets with low aperiodic auto- and cross-correlations play an important role in many applications like communications, radar and other active sensing applications. The use of antipodal sequences reduces hardware requirements while increases the difficult of the task of signal design. In this paper we present a method for the computation of the Integrated Sidelobe Level (ISL), and we use it to calculate the asymptotic expression for the ISL of a set of sequences formed by different rotations of a Legendre sequence.
