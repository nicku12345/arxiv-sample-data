It has been shown recently that coding for the Gaussian Wiretap Channel can be done with nested lattices. A fine lattice intended to the legitimate user must be designed as a usual lattice code for the Gaussian Channel, while a coarse lattice is added to introduce confusion at the eavesdropper, whose theta series must be minimized. We present a design criterion for both the fine and coarse lattice to obtain wiretap lattice codes for the Rayleigh fading Wiretap Channel.
