In many compressed sensing applications, linear programming (LP) has been used to reconstruct a sparse signal. When observation is noisy, the LP formulation is extended to allow an inequality constraint and the solution is dependent on a parameter \delta, related to the observation noise level. Recently, some researchers also considered quadratic programming (QP) for compressed sensing signal reconstruction and the solution in this case is dependent on a Lagrange multiplier \beta. In this work, we investigated the relation between \delta and \beta and derived an upper and a lower bound on \beta in terms of \delta. For a given \delta, these bounds can be used to approximate \beta. Since \delta is a physically related quantity and easy to determine for an application while there is no easy way in general to determine \beta, our results can be used to set \beta when the QP is used for compressed sensing. Our results and experimental verification also provide some insight into the solutions generated by compressed sensing.
