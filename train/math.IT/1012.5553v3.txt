A discrete-time intersymbol interference channel with additive Gaussian noise is considered, where only the receiver has knowledge of the channel impulse response. An approach for combining decision-feedback equalization with channel coding is proposed, where decoding precedes the removal of intersymbol interference. This is accomplished by combining the recently proposed integer-forcing equalization approach with cyclic block codes. The channel impulse response is linearly equalized to an integer-valued response. This is then utilized by leveraging the property that a cyclic code is closed under (cyclic) integer-valued convolution. Explicit bounds on the performance of the proposed scheme are also derived.
