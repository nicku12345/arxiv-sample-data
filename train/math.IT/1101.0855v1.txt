Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) algorithm, which is one of the lattice reduction (LR) techniques, has been extensively used to obtain better basis of the channel matrix. In this paper, we jointly apply Seysen's lattice reduction algorithm (SA), instead of LLL, with the conventional linear precoding algorithms. Since SA obtains more orthogonal lattice basis compared to that obtained by LLL, lattice reduction aided (LRA) precoding based on SA algorithm outperforms the LRA precoding with LLL. Simulation results demonstrate that a gain of 0.5dB at target BER of 10^-5 is achieved when SA is used instead of LLL for the LR stage.
