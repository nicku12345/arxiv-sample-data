In the recent years, there has been significant advancement in the areas of scientific data management and retrieval techniques, especially in terms of standards and protocols for archiving data. Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Data Archive Center for biogeochemical dynamics is making efforts in building advanced toolsets for these purposes. Mercury is a web-based metadata harvesting, data discovery and access system, built for researchers to search for, share and obtain biogeochemical data. Originally developed for single National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) project, Mercury now used over fourteen different projects across three US federal agencies. Mercury renders various capabilities including metadata management, indexing, searching, data sharing, and also software reusability.
