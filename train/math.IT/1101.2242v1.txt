This paper is a study of non-linear effects of RF Amplifiers on Communication Systems Performance. High speed data communication is made possible by Multilevel Modulation schemes. This paper presents a study of these non linear effects on multilevel Modulation schemes like MPSK and MQAM. We make use of Bit Error Ratio (BER) as performance measure. BER vs SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) curves provide comparison between the non linear effects caused by Gain Compression in particular.
