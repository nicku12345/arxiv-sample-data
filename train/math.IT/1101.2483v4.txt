In the earlier version of this paper, it was wrongly claimed that time-sharing is required to achieve the capacity region of the Gaussian interference channel to within one bit, especially at corner points. The flaw in the argument of the earlier version lies in fixing the decoding paradigm for a fixed common/private message splitting encoding strategy. More specifically, the additional constraints (7b) and (7d) in the earlier version arise if we force the common messages to be always decoded at unintended receivers. However, (7b) and (7d) can be eliminated by allowing the decoders to ignore unintended common messages, particularly at corner points of the rate region, without resorting to time-sharing at the transmit side, as suggested in the earlier version. For these reasons, our earlier claim is invalid.
