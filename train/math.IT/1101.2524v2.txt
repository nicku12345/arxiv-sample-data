For an n_t transmit, n_r receive antenna system (n_t \times n_r system), a {\it{full-rate}} space time block code (STBC) transmits n_{min} = min(n_t,n_r) complex symbols per channel use. The well known Golden code is an example of a full-rate, full-diversity STBC for 2 transmit antennas. Its ML-decoding complexity is of the order of M^{2.5} for square M-QAM. The Silver code for 2 transmit antennas has all the desirable properties of the Golden code except its coding gain, but offers lower ML-decoding complexity of the order of M^2. Importantly, the slight loss in coding gain is negligible compared to the advantage it offers in terms of lowering the ML-decoding complexity. For higher number of transmit antennas, the best known codes are the Perfect codes, which are full-rate, full-diversity, information lossless codes (for n_r \geq n_t) but have a high ML-decoding complexity of the order of M^{n_tn_{min}} (for n_r < n_t, the punctured Perfect codes are considered). In this paper, a scheme to obtain full-rate STBCs for 2^a transmit antennas and any n_r with reduced ML-decoding complexity of the order of M^{n_t(n_{min}-(3/4))-0.5}, is presented. The codes constructed are also information lossless for n_r \geq n_t, like the Perfect codes and allow higher mutual information than the comparable punctured Perfect codes for n_r < n_t. These codes are referred to as the {\it generalized Silver codes}, since they enjoy the same desirable properties as the comparable Perfect codes (except possibly the coding gain) with lower ML-decoding complexity, analogous to the Silver-Golden codes for 2 transmit antennas. Simulation results of the symbol error rates for 4 and 8 transmit antennas show that the generalized Silver codes match the punctured Perfect codes in error performance while offering lower ML-decoding complexity.
