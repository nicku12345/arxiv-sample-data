We introduce and discuss the concept of Gaussian probability density function (pdf) for the n-dimensional hyperbolic space which has been proposed as an environment for coding and decoding signals. An upper bound for the error probability of signal transmission associated with the hyperbolic distance is established. The pdf and the upper bound were developed using Poincare models for the hyperbolic spaces.
