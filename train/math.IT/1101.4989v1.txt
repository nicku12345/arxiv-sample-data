In this paper, we propose an opportunistic buffered decode-wait-and-forward (OBDWF) protocol to exploit both relay buffering and relay mobility to enhance the system throughput and the end-to-end packet delay under bursty arrivals. We consider a point-to-point communication link assisted by K mobile relays. We illustrate that the OBDWF protocol could achieve a better throughput and delay performance compared with existing baseline systems such as the conventional dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF) and amplified-and-forward (AF) protocol. In addition to simulation performance, we also derived closed-form asymptotic throughput and delay expressions of the OBDWF protocol. Specifically, the proposed OBDWF protocol achieves an asymptotic throughput O(logK) with O(1) total transmit power in the relay network. This is a significant gain compared with the best known performance in conventional protocols (O(logK) throughput with O(K) total transmit power). With bursty arrivals, we show that both the stability region and average delay of the proposed OBDWF protocol can achieve order-wise performance gain O(K) compared with conventional DDF protocol.
