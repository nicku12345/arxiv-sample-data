Consider a polynomial F in m variables and a finite point ensemble S=S_1 \times ... \times S_m. When given the leading monomial of F with respect to a lexicographic ordering we derive improved information on the possible number of zeros of F of multiplicity at least r from S. We then use this information to design a list decoding algorithm for a large class of affine variety codes.
