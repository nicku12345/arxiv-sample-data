In most compressive sensing problems l1 norm is used during the signal reconstruction process. In this article the use of entropy functional is proposed to approximate the l1 norm. A modified version of the entropy functional is continuous, differentiable and convex. Therefore, it is possible to construct globally convergent iterative algorithms using Bregman's row action D-projection method for compressive sensing applications. Simulation examples are presented.
