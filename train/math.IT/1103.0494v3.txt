In this paper exact closed-form expressions are derived for the outage probability (OP) in scenarios where both the signal of interest (SOI) and the interfering signals experience {\eta}-{\mu} fading and the background noise can be neglected. With the only assumption that the {\mu} parameter is a positive integer number for the interfering signals, the derived expressions are given in elementary terms for maximal ratio combining (MRC) with independent branches. The analysis is also valid when the {\mu} parameters of the pre-combining SOI power envelopes are positive integer or half-integer numbers and the SOI is formed at the receiver from spatially correlated MRC.
