Motivated by the broadcast view of the interference channel, the new problem of communication with disturbance constraints is formulated. The rate-disturbance region is established for the single constraint case and the optimal encoding scheme turns out to be the same as the Han-Kobayashi scheme for the two user-pair interference channel. This result is extended to the Gaussian vector (MIMO) case. For the case of communication with two disturbance constraints, inner and outer bounds on the rate-disturbance region for a deterministic model are established. The inner bound is achieved by an encoding scheme that involves rate splitting, Marton coding, and superposition coding, and is shown to be optimal in several nontrivial cases. This encoding scheme can be readily applied to discrete memoryless interference channels and motivates a natural extension of the Han-Kobayashi scheme to more than two user pairs.
