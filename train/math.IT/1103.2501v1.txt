We study the interaction between two interfering Gaussian 2-user multiple access channels. The capacity region is characterized under mixed strong--extremely strong interference and individually very strong interference. Furthermore, the sum capacity is derived under a less restricting definition of very strong interference. Finally, a general upper bound on the sum capacity is provided, which is nearly tight for weak cross links.
