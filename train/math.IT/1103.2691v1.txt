Based on the extended binary image of non-binary LDPC codes, we propose a method for generating extra redundant bits, such as to decreases the coding rate of a mother code. The proposed method allows for using the same decoder, regardless of how many extra redundant bits have been produced, which considerably increases the flexibility of the system without significantly increasing its complexity. Extended codes are also optimized for the binary erasure channel, by using density evolution methods. Nevertheless, the results presented in this paper can easily be extrapolated to more general channel models.
