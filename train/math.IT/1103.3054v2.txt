We consider the capacity of memoryless finite-state multiple access channel (FS-MAC) with causal asymmetric noisy state information available at both transmitters and complete state information available at the receiver. Single letter inner and outer bounds are provided for the capacity of such channels when the state process is independent and identically distributed. The outer bound is attained by observing that the proposed inner bound is tight for the sum-rate capacity.
