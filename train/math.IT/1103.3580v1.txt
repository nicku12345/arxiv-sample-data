In this correspondence, for every periodic p-ary sequence satisfying ideal two-level autocorrelation property the existence of an element of the field {\bf GF}(p) which appears one time less than all the rest that are equally distributed in a period of that sequence, is proved by algebraic method. In addition, it is shown that such a special element might not be only the zero element but as well arbitrary element of that field.
