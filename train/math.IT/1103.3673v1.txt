We show that the performance of relay selection can be improved by employing relays with buffers. Under the idealized assumption that no buffer is full or empty, the best source-relay and the best relay-destination channels can be simultaneously exploited by selecting the corresponding relays for reception and transmission, respectively. The resulting relay selection scheme is referred to as max-max relay selection (MMRS). Since for finite buffer sizes, empty and full buffers are practically unavoidable if MMRS is employed, we propose a hybrid relay selection (HRS) scheme, which is a combination of conventional best relay selection (BRS) and MMRS. We analyze the outage probabilities of MMRS and HRS and show that both schemes achieve the same diversity gain as conventional BRS and a superior coding gain. Furthermore, our results show that for moderate buffer sizes (e.g. 30 packets) HRS closely approaches the performance of idealized MMRS and the performance gain compared to BRS approaches 3 dB as the number of relays increases.
