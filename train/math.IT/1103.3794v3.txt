This paper proposes and proves a theorem which stipulates sufficient conditions the coefficients of two quadratic permutation polynomials (QPP) must satisfy, so that the permutations generated by them are identical. The result is used to reduce the search time of QPP interleavers with lengths given by Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard up to 512, by improving the distance spectrum over the set of polynomials with the largest spreading factor. Polynomials that lead to better performance compared to LTE standard are found for several lengths. Simulations show that 0.5 dB coding gains can be obtained compared to LTE standard.
