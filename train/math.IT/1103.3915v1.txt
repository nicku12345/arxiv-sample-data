A coding scheme based on irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is proposed to send secret messages from a source over the Gaussian wiretap channel to a destination in the presence of a wiretapper, with the restriction that the source can send only binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK) symbols. The secrecy performance of the proposed coding scheme is measured by the secret message rate through the wiretap channel as well as the equivocation rate about the message at the wiretapper. A code search procedure is suggested to obtain irregular LDPC codes that achieve good secrecy performance in such context.
