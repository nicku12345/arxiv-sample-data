Multi-cell cooperation is a promising approach for mitigating inter-cell interference in dense cellular networks. Quantifying the performance of multi-cell cooperation is challenging as it integrates physical-layer techniques and network topologies. For tractability, existing work typically relies on the over-simplified Wyner-type models. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic-geometry model for a cellular network with multi-cell cooperation, which accounts for practical factors including the irregular locations of base stations (BSs) and the resultant path-losses. In particular, the proposed network-topology model has three key features: i) the cells are modeled using a Poisson random tessellation generated by Poisson distributed BSs, ii) multi-antenna BSs are clustered using a hexagonal lattice and BSs in the same cluster mitigate mutual interference by spatial interference avoidance, iii) BSs near cluster edges access a different sub-channel from that by other BSs, shielding cluster-edge mobiles from strong interference. Using this model and assuming sparse scattering, we analyze the shapes of the outage probabilities of mobiles served by cluster-interior BSs as the average number K of BSs per cluster increases. The outage probability of a mobile near a cluster center is shown to be proportional to e^{-c(2-\sqrt{\nu})^2K} where \nu is the fraction of BSs lying in the interior of clusters and c is a constant. Moreover, the outage probability of a typical mobile is proved to scale proportionally with e^{-c' (1-\sqrt{\nu})^2K} where c' is a constant.
