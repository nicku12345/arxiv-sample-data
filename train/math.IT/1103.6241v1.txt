Most work on wireless network throughput ignores the temporal correlation inherent to wireless channels because it degrades tractability. To better model and quantify the temporal variations of wireless network throughput, this paper introduces a metric termed ergodic transmission capacity (ETC), which includes spatial and temporal ergodicity. All transmitters in the network form a homogeneous Poisson point process and all channels are modeled by a finite state Markov chain. The bounds on outage probability and ETC are characterized, and their scaling behaviors for a sparse and dense network are discussed. From these results, we show that the ETC can be characterized by the inner product of the channel-state related vector and the invariant probability vector of the Markov chain. This indicates that channel-aware opportunistic transmission does not always increase ETC. Finally, we look at outage probability with interference management from a stochastic geometry point of view. The improved bounds on outage probability and ETC due to interference management are characterized and they provide some useful insights on how to effectively manage interference in sparse and dense networks.
