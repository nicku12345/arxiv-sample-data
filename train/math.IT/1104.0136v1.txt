In this paper, we study the uplink of a cellular system using the linear deterministic approximation model, where there are two users transmitting to a receiver, mutually interfering with a third transmitter communicating with a second receiver. We give an achievable coding scheme and prove its optimality, i.e. characterize the capacity region. This scheme is a form of interference alignment which exploits the channel gain difference of the two-user cell.
