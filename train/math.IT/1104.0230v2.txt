The problem of broadcasting a pair of correlated Gaussian sources using optimal separate source and channel codes is studied. Considerable performance gains over previously known separate source-channel schemes are observed. Although source-channel separation yields suboptimal performance in general, it is shown that the proposed scheme is very competitive for any bandwidth compression/expansion scenarios. In particular, for a high channel SNR scenario, it can be shown to achieve optimal power-distortion tradeoff.
