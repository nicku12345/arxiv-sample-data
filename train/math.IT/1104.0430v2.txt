The two-user Gaussian interference channel with a shared out-of-band relay is considered. The relay observes a linear combination of the source signals and broadcasts a common message to the two destinations, through a perfect link of fixed limited rate R_0 bits per channel use. The out-of-band nature of the relay is reflected by the fact that the common relay message does not interfere with the received signal at the two destinations. A general achievable rate is established, along with upper bounds on the capacity region for the Gaussian case. For R_0 values below a certain threshold, which depends on channel parameters, the capacity region of this channel is determined in this paper to within a constant gap of \Delta=1.95 bits. We identify interference regimes where a two-for-one gain in achievable rates is possible for every bit relayed, up to a constant approximation error. Instrumental to these results is a carefully-designed quantize-and-forward type of relay strategy along with a joint decoding scheme employed at destination ends. Further, we also study successive decoding strategies with optimal decoding order (corresponding to the order at which common, private, and relay messages are decoded), and show that successive decoding also achieves two-for-one gains asymptotically in regimes where a two-for-one gain is achievable by joint decoding; yet, successive decoding produces unbounded loss asymptotically when compared to joint decoding, in general.
