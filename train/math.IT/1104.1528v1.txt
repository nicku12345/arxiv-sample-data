We discuss the application of coded modulation for power-line communications. We combine M-ary FSK with diversity and coding to make the transmission robust against permanent frequency disturbances and impulse noise. We give a particular example of the coding/modulation scheme that is in agreement with the existing CENELEC norms. The scheme can be considered as a form of coded Frequency Hopping and is thus extendable to any frequency range.
