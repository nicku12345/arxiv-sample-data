Traditionally, multi-trial error/erasure decoding of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes is based on Bounded Minimum Distance (BMD) decoders with an erasure option. Such decoders have error/erasure tradeoff factor L=2, which means that an error is twice as expensive as an erasure in terms of the code's minimum distance. The Guruswami-Sudan (GS) list decoder can be considered as state of the art in algebraic decoding of RS codes. Besides an erasure option, it allows to adjust L to values in the range 1<L<=2. Based on previous work, we provide formulae which allow to optimally (in terms of residual codeword error probability) exploit the erasure option of decoders with arbitrary L, if the decoder can be used z>=1 times. We show that BMD decoders with z_BMD decoding trials can result in lower residual codeword error probability than GS decoders with z_GS trials, if z_BMD is only slightly larger than z_GS. This is of practical interest since BMD decoders generally have lower computational complexity than GS decoders.
