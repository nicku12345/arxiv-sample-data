We consider the interference-mitigation based cognitive radio where the primary and secondary users can coexist at the same time and frequency bands, under the constraint that the rate of the primary user (PU) must remain the same with a single-user decoder. To meet such a coexistence constraint, the relaying from the secondary user (SU) can help the PU's transmission under the interference from the SU. However, the relayed signal in the known dirty paper coding (DPC) based scheme is interfered by the SU's signal, and is not "clean". In this paper, under the half-duplex constraints, we propose two new transmission schemes aided by the clean relaying from the SU's transmitter and receiver without interference from the SU. We name them as the clean transmitter relaying (CT) and clean transmitter-receiver relaying (CTR) aided cognitive radio, respectively. The rate and multiplexing gain performances of CT and CTR in fading channels with various availabilities of the channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT) are studied. Our CT generalizes the celebrated DPC based scheme proposed previously. With full CSIT, the multiplexing gain of the CTR is proved to be better (or no less) than that of the previous DPC based schemes. This is because the silent period for decoding the PU's messages for the DPC may not be necessary in the CTR. With only the statistics of CSIT, we further prove that the CTR outperforms the rate performance of the previous scheme in fast Rayleigh fading channels. The numerical examples also show that in a large class of channels, the proposed CT and CTR provide significant rate gains over the previous scheme with small complexity penalties.
