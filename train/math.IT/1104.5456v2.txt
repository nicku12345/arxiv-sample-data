An achievable rate region, based on lattice interference alignment, is derived for a class of time-invariant Gaussian interference channels with more than two users. The result is established via a new coding theorem for the two-user Gaussian multiple-access channel where both users use a single linear code. The class of interference channels treated is such that all interference channel gains are rational. For this class of interference channels, beyond recovering the known results on the degrees of freedom, an explicit rate region is derived for finite signal-to-noise ratios, shedding light on the nature of previously established asymptotic results.
