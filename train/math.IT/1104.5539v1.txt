In cognitive radio mobile ad hoc networks (CR-MANETs), secondary users can cooperatively sense the spectrum to detect the presence of primary users. In this chapter, we propose a fully distributed and scalable cooperative spectrum sensing scheme based on recent advances in consensus algorithms. In the proposed scheme, the secondary users can maintain coordination based on only local information exchange without a centralized common receiver. We use the consensus of secondary users to make the final decision. The proposed scheme is essentially based on recent advances in consensus algorithms that have taken inspiration from complex natural phenomena including flocking of birds, schooling of fish, swarming of ants and honeybees. Unlike the existing cooperative spectrum sensing schemes, there is no need for a centralized receiver in the proposed schemes, which make them suitable in distributed CR-MANETs. Simulation results show that the proposed consensus schemes can have significant lower missing detection probabilities and false alarm probabilities in CR-MANETs. It is also demonstrated that the proposed scheme not only has proven sensitivity in detecting the primary user's presence, but also has robustness in choosing a desirable decision threshold.
