This paper considers resource allocation to achieve max-min fairness in a selection-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing network wherein source nodes are assisted by fixed decode-and-forward relays. The joint problem of transmission strategy selection, relay assignment, and power allocation is a combinatorial problem with exponential complexity. To develop effective solutions to these questions, we approach these problems in two stages. The first set of problems assume ideal source-relay channels; this simplification helps illustrate our general methodology and also why our solutions provide tight bounds. We then formulate the general problem of transmission strategy selection, relay assignment, and power allocation at the sources and relays considering all communication channels, i.e., finite power source-relay channels. In both sets of problems mentioned so far, transmissions over subcarriers are assumed to be independent. However, given the attendant problems of synchronization and the implementation using a FFT/IFFT pair, resource allocation at the subcarrier level appears impractical. We, therefore, consider resource allocation at the level of an entire OFDM block. While optimal resource management requires an exhaustive search, we develop tight bounds with lower complexity. Finally, we propose a decentralized block-based relaying scheme. Simulation results using the COST-231 channel model show that this scheme yields close-to-optimal performance while offering many computational benefits.
