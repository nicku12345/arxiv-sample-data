With the successful worldwide deployment of 3rd generation mobile communication, security aspects are ensured partly. Researchers are now looking for 4G mobile for its deployment with high data rate, enhanced security and reliability so that world should look for CALM, Continuous Air interface for Long and Medium range communication. This CALM will be a reliable high data rate secured mobile communication to be deployed for car to car communication (C2C) for safety application. This paper reviewed the WiMAX ,& 60 GHz RF carrier for C2C. The system is tested at SMIT laboratory with multimedia transmission and reception. With proper deployment of this 60 GHz system on vehicles, the existing commercial products for 802.11P will be required to be replaced or updated soon .
