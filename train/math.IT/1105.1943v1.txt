We consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channel (MAC), where the channel between each transmitter and the receiver is modeled by the doubly-scattering channel model. Based on novel techniques from random matrix theory, we derive deterministic approximations of the mutual information, the signal-to-noise-plus-interference-ratio (SINR) at the output of the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detector and the sum-rate with MMSE detection which are almost surely tight in the large system limit. Moreover, we derive the asymptotically optimal transmit covariance matrices. Our simulation results show that the asymptotic analysis provides very close approximations for realistic system dimensions.
