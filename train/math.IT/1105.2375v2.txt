This paper investigates the Diversity-Multiplexing gain Trade-off (DMT) of a training based reciprocal Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) system, with (i) perfect Channel State Information (CSI) at the Receiver (CSIR) and noisy CSI at the Transmitter (CSIT), and (ii) noisy CSIR and noisy CSIT. In both the cases, the CSIT is acquired through Reverse Channel Training (RCT), i.e., by sending a training sequence from the receiver to the transmitter. A channel-dependent fixed-power training scheme is proposed for acquiring CSIT, along with a forward-link data transmit power control scheme. With perfect CSIR, the proposed scheme is shown to achieve a diversity order that is quadratically increasing with the number of receive antennas. This is in contrast with conventional orthogonal RCT schemes, where the diversity order is known to saturate as the number of receive antennas is increased, for a given channel coherence time. Moreover, the proposed scheme can achieve a larger DMT compared to the orthogonal training scheme. With noisy CSIR and noisy CSIT, a three-way training scheme is proposed and its DMT performance is analyzed. It is shown that nearly the same diversity order is achievable as in the perfect CSIR case. The time-overhead in the training schemes is explicitly accounted for in this work, and the results show that the proposed channel-dependent RCT and data power control schemes offer a significant improvement in terms of the DMT, compared to channel-agnostic orthogonal RCT schemes. The outage performance of the proposed scheme is illustrated through Monte-Carlo simulations.
