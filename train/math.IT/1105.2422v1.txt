In this paper, we consider joint network and LDPC coding for practically implementing the denosie-and-forward protocol over bi-directional relaying. the closed-form expressions for computing the log-likelihood ratios of the network-coded codewords have been derived for both real and complex multiple-access channels. It is revealed that the equivalent channel observed at the relay is an asymmetrical channel, where the channel input is the XOR form of the two source nodes.
