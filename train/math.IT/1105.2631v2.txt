In this paper we explore the decision regions of Linear Programming (LP) decoding. We compare the decision regions of an LP decoder, a Belief Propagation (BP) decoder and the optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoder. We study the effect of minimal-weight pseudocodewords on LP decoding. We present global optimization as a method for finding the minimal pseudoweight of a given code as well as the number of minimal-weight generators. We present a complete pseudoweight distribution for the [24; 12; 8] extended Golay code, and provide justifications of why the pseudoweight distribution alone cannot be used for obtaining a tight upper bound on the error probability.
