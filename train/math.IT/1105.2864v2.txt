This paper investigates a lossy source coding problem in which two decoders can access their side-information respectively. The correlated sources are a product of two component correlated sources, and we exclusively investigate the case such that each component is degraded. We show the rate-distortion function for that case, and give the following observations. When the components are degraded in matched order, the rate distortion function of the product sources is equal to the sum of the component-wise rate distortion functions. On the otherhand, the former is strictly smaller than the latter when the component sources are degraded in mismatched order. The converse proof for the mismatched case is motivated by the enhancement technique used for broadcast channels. For binary Hamming and Gaussian examples, we evaluate the rate-distortion functions.
