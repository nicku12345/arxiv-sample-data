We consider a single antenna narrowband multiple access channel in which users send training sequences to the base station and scheduling is performed based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimates. In such a system, there is an inherent tradeoff between training overhead and the amount of multiuser diversity achieved. We analyze a block fading channel with independent Rayleigh distributed channel gains, where the parameters to be optimized are the number of users considered for transmission in each block and the corresponding time and power spent on training by each user. We derive closed form expressions for the optimal parameters in terms K and L, where K is the number of users considered for transmission in each block and L is the block length in symbols. Considering the behavior of the system as L grows large, we optimize K with respect to an approximate expression for the achievable rate, and obtain second order expressions for the resulting parameters in terms of L.
