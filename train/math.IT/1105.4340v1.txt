We propose a simple and accurate method to evaluate the outage probability at the output of arbitrarily fading L-branch diversity combining receiver. The method is based on the saddlepoint approximation, which only requires the knowledge of the moment generating functions of the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of each diversity branch. In addition, we show that the obtained results reduce to closed-form expressions in many particular cases of practical interest. Numerical results illustrate a very high accuracy of the proposed method for practical outage values and for a large mixture of fading and system parameters.
