A new wireless communication system denoted as Multi-Code Multi-Carrier CDMA (MC-MC CDMA), which is the combination of Multi-Code CDMA and Multi-Carrier CDMA, is analyzed in this paper. This system can satisfy multi-rate services using multi-code schemes and muti-carrier services used for high rate transmission. The system is evaluated using Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA). This type of amplifiers continue to offer the best microwave high power amplifiers (HPA) performance in terms of power efficiency, size and cost, but lag behind Solid State Power Amplifiers (SSPA's) in linearity. This paper presents a technique for improving TWTA linearity. The use of predistorter (PD) linearization technique is described to provide TWTA performance comparable or superior to conventional SSPA's. The characteristics of the PD scheme is derived based on the extension of Saleh's model for HPA.
