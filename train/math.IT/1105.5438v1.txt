We establish a new outer bound for the capacity region of product broadcast channels. This outer bound matches Marton's inner bound for a variety of classes of product broadcast channels whose capacity regions were previously unknown. These classes include product of reversely semi-deterministic and product of reversely more-capable channels. A significant consequence of this new outer bound is that it establishes, via an example, that the previously best known outer-bound is strictly suboptimal for the general broadcast channel. Our example is comprised of a product broadcast channel with two semi-deterministic components in reverse orientation.
