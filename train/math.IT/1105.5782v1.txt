Limited feedback is a paradigm for the feedback of channel state information in wireless systems. In multiple antenna wireless systems, limited feedback usually entails quantizing a source that lives on the Grassmann manifold. Most work on limited feedback beamforming considered single-shot quantization. In wireless systems, however, the channel is temporally correlated, which can be used to reduce feedback requirements. Unfortunately, conventional predictive quantization does not incorporate the non-Euclidean structure of the Grassmann manifold. In this paper, we propose a Grassmannian predictive coding algorithm where the differential geometric structure of the Grassmann manifold is used to formulate a predictive vector quantization encoder and decoder. We analyze the quantization error and derive bounds on the distortion attained by the proposed algorithm. We apply the algorithm to a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output wireless system and show that it improves the achievable sum rate as the temporal correlation of the channel increases.
