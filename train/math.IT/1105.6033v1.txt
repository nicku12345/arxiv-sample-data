The two-user multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) interference and cognitive radio channels are studied under the assumption of no channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) from the degrees of freedom (DoF) region perspective. With M_i and N_i denoting the number of antennas at transmitter i and receiver i respectively, the DoF regions of the MIMO interference channel were recently characterized by Huang et al., Zhu and Guo, and by the authors of this paper for all values of numbers of antennas except when \min(M_1,N_1) > N_2 > M_2 (or \min(M_2,N_2) > N_1 > M_1). This latter case was solved more recently by Zhu and Guo who provided a tight outer-bound. Here, a simpler and more widely applicable proof of that outer-bound is given based on the idea of interference localization. Using it, the DoF region is also established for the class of MIMO cognitive radio channels when \min(M_1+M_2,N_1) > N_2 > M_2 (with the second transmitter cognitive) -- the only class for which the inner and outer bounds previously obtained by the authors were not tight -- thereby completing the DoF region characterization of the general 2-user MIMO cognitive radio channel as well.
