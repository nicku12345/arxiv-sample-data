It is well known that an (n,k) code can be used to store 'k' units of information in 'n' unit-capacity disks of a distributed data storage system. If the code used is maximum distance separable (MDS), then the system can tolerate any (n-k) disk failures, since the original information can be recovered from any k surviving disks. The focus of this paper is the design of a systematic MDS code with the additional property that a single disk failure can be repaired with minimum repair bandwidth, i.e., with the minimum possible amount of data to be downloaded for recovery of the failed disk. Previously, a lower bound of (n-1)/(n-k) units has been established by Dimakis et. al, on the repair bandwidth for a single disk failure in an (n,k) MDS code . Recently, the existence of asymptotic codes achieving this lower bound for arbitrary (n,k) has been established by drawing connections to interference alignment. While the existence of asymptotic constructions achieving this lower bound have been shown, finite code constructions achieving this lower bound existed in previous literature only for the special (high-redundancy) scenario where k \leq \max(n/2,3). The question of existence of finite codes for arbitrary values of (n,k) achieving the lower bound on the repair bandwidth remained open. In this paper, by using permutation coding sub-matrices, we provide the first known finite MDS code which achieves the optimal repair bandwidth of (n-1)/(n-k) for arbitrary (n,k), for recovery of a failed systematic disk. We also generalize our permutation matrix based constructions by developing a novel framework for repair-bandwidth-optimal MDS codes based on the idea of subspace interference alignment - a concept previously introduced by Suh and Tse the context of wireless cellular networks.
