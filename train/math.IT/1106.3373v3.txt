Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is a canonical greedy pursuit algorithm for sparse approximation. Previous studies of OMP have mainly considered the exact recovery of a sparse signal \bm x through \bm \Phi and \bm y=\bm \Phi \bm x, where \bm \Phi is a matrix with more columns than rows. In this paper, based on Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), the performance of OMP is analyzed under general perturbations, which means both \bm y and \bm \Phi are perturbed. Though exact recovery of an almost sparse signal \bm x is no longer feasible, the main contribution reveals that the exact recovery of the locations of k largest magnitude entries of \bm x can be guaranteed under reasonable conditions. The error between \bm x and solution of OMP is also estimated. It is also demonstrated that the sufficient condition is rather tight by constructing an example. When \bm x is strong-decaying, it is proved that the sufficient conditions can be relaxed, and the locations can even be recovered in the order of the entries' magnitude.
