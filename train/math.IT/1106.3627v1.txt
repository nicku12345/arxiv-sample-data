In a recent paper [4], Mari\'c et al. analyzed the performance of the analog network coding (ANC) in a layered relay network for the high-SNR regime. They have proved that under the ANC scheme, if each relay transmits the received signals at the upper bound of the power constraint, the transmission rate will approach the network capacity. In this paper, we consider a more general scenario defined as the generalized high-SNR regime, where the relays at layer l in a layered relay network with L layers do not satisfy the high-SNR conditions, and then determine an ANC relay scheme in such network. By relating the received SNR at the nodes with the propagated noise, we derive the rate achievable by the ANC scheme proposed in this paper. The result shows that the achievable ANC rate approaches the upper bound of the ANC capacity as the received powers at relays in high SNR increase. A comparison of the two ANC schemes implies that the scheme proposed in [4] may not always be the optimal one in the generalized high-SNR regime. The result also demonstrates that the upper and lower bounds of the ANC rate coincide in the limit as the number of relays at layer L-1 dissatisfying the high-SNR conditions tends to infinity, yielding an asymptotic capacity result.
