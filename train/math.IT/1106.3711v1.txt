High sidelobe level is a major disadvantage of the Capon beamforming. To suppress the sidelobe, this paper introduces a mainlobe to sidelobe power ratio constraint to the Capon beamforming. it minimizes the sidelobe power while keeping the mainlobe power constant. Simulations show that the obtained beamformer outperforms the Capon beamformer.
