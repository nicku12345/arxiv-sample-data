Sequences with good correlation properties have been widely adopted in modern communications, radar and sonar applications. In this paper, we present our new findings on some constructions of single H-ary Golay sequence and 4^q-QAM Golay complementary sequence with a large zero autocorrelation zone, where H\ge 2 is an arbitrary even integer and q\ge 2 is an arbitrary integer. Those new results on Golay sequences and QAM Golay complementary sequences can be explored during synchronization and detection at the receiver end and thus improve the performance of the communication system.
