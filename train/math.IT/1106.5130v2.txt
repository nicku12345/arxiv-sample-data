In this paper we study certain properties of R\'{e}nyi entropy functionals H_\alpha(\mathcal{P}) on the space of probability distributions over \mathbb{Z}_+. Primarily, continuity and convergence issues are addressed. Some properties shown parallel those known in the finite alphabet case, while others illustrate a quite different behaviour of R\'enyi entropy in the infinite case. In particular, it is shown that, for any distribution \mathcal P and any r\in[0,\infty], there exists a sequence of distributions \mathcal{P}_n converging to \mathcal{P} with respect to the total variation distance, such that \lim_{n\to\infty}\lim_{\alpha\to{1+}} H_\alpha(\mathcal{P}_n) = \lim_{\alpha\to{1+}}\lim_{n\to\infty} H_\alpha(\mathcal{P}_n) + r.
