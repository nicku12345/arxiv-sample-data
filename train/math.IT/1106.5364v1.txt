In this paper, we propose a practical implementation of the Dynamic Decode and Forward (DDF) protocol based on rateless codes and HARQ. We define the macro diversity order of a transmission from several intermittent sources to a single destination. Considering finite symbol alphabet used by the different sources, upper bounds on the achievable macro diversity order are derived. We analyse the diversity behavior of several relaying schemes for the DDF protocol, and we propose the Patching technique to increase both the macro and the micro diversity orders. The coverage gain for the open-loop transmission case and the spectral efficiency gain for the closed loop transmission case are illustrated by simulation results.
