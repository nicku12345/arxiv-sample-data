In this paper, we propose novel low-complexity adaptive channel estimation techniques for mob ile wireless chan- n els in presence of Rayleigh fading, carrier frequency offsets (CFO) and random channel variations. We show that the selective p artial update of the estimated channel tap-weight vector offers a better trade-off between the performance and computational complexity, compared to the full update of the estimated channel tap-weight vector. We evaluate the mean-square weight error of th e proposed methods and demonstrate the usefulness of its via simulation studies.
