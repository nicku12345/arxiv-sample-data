It is proved that for memoryless vector channels, maximizing the mutual information over all source distributions with a certain average power or over the larger set of source distributions with upperbounded average power yields the same channel capacity in both cases. Hence, the channel capacity cannot decrease with increasing average transmitted power, not even for channels with severe nonlinear distortion.
