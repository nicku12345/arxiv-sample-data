In this paper we consider a probabilistic signal-to-interference and-noise ratio (SINR) constrained problem for transmit beamforming design in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI), under a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink scenario. In particular, we deal with outage-based quality-of-service constraints, where the probability of each user's SINR not satisfying a service requirement must not fall below a given outage probability specification. The study of solution approaches to the probabilistic SINR constrained problem is important because CSI errors are often present in practical systems and they may cause substantial SINR outages if not handled properly. However, a major technical challenge is how to process the probabilistic SINR constraints. To tackle this, we propose a novel relaxation- restriction (RAR) approach, which consists of two key ingredients-semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and analytic tools for conservatively approximating probabilistic constraints. The underlying goal is to establish approximate probabilistic SINR constrained formulations in the form of convex conic optimization problems, so that they can be readily implemented by available solvers. Using either an intuitive worst-case argument or specialized probabilistic results, we develop various conservative approximation schemes for processing probabilistic constraints with quadratic uncertainties. Consequently, we obtain several RAR alternatives for handling the probabilistic SINR constrained problem. Our techniques apply to both complex Gaussian CSI errors and i.i.d. bounded CSI errors with unknown distribution. Moreover, results obtained from our extensive simulations show that the proposed RAR methods significantly improve upon existing ones, both in terms of solution quality and computational complexity.
