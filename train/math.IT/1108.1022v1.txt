We consider an input x generated by an unknown stationary ergodic source X that enters a signal processing system J, resulting in w=J(x). We observe w through a noisy channel, y=z(w); our goal is to estimate x from y, J, and knowledge of f_{Y|W}. This is universal estimation, because f_X is unknown. We provide a formulation that describes a trade-off between information complexity and noise. Initial theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental evidence is presented in support of our approach.
