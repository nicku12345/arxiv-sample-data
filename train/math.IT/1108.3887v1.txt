Irreducible cyclic codes are an interesting type of codes and have applications in space communications. They have been studied for decades and a lot of progress has been made. The objectives of this paper are to survey and extend earlier results on the weight distributions of irreducible cyclic codes, present a divisibility theorem and develop bounds on the weights in irreducible cyclic codes.
