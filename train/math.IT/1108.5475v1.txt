Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are among the most ubiquitous codes due to their good parameters as well as efficient encoding and decoding procedures. However, RS codes suffer from having a fixed length. In many applications where the length is static, the appropriate length can be obtained by an RS code by shortening or puncturing. Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are a generalization of RS codes, whose subfield-subcodes are extensively studied. In this paper we show that a particular class of GRS codes produces many subfield-subcodes with large dimension. An algorithm for searching through the codes is presented as well as a list of new codes obtained from this method.
