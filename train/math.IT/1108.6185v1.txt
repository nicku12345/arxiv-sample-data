We consider weighted Reed-Muller codes over point ensemble S_1 \times...\times S_m where S_i needs not be of the same size as S_j. For m = 2 we determine optimal weights and analyze in detail what is the impact of the ratio |S_1|/|S_2| on the minimum distance. In conclusion the weighted Reed-Muller code construction is much better than its reputation. For a class of affine variety codes that contains the weighted Reed-Muller codes we then present two list decoding algorithms. With a small modification one of these algorithms is able to correct up to 31 errors of the [49, 11, 28] Joyner code.
