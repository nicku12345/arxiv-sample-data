We extend the concept of two-level fingerprinting codes, introduced by Anthapadmanabhan and Barg (2009) in context of traceability (TA) codes, to other types of fingerprinting codes, namely identifiable parent property (IPP) codes, secure-frameproof (SFP) codes, and frameproof (FP) codes. We define and propose the first explicit non-trivial construction for two-level IPP, SFP and FP codes.
