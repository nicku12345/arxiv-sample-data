We consider a low-complexity version of the Compute and Forward scheme that involves only scaling, offset (dithering removal) and scalar quantization at the relays. The proposed scheme is suited for the uplink of a distributed antenna system where the antenna elements must be very simple and are connected to a oint processor via orthogonal perfect links of given rate R0. We consider the design of non-binary LDPC codes naturally matched to the proposed scheme. Each antenna element performs individual (decentralized) Belief Propagation decoding of its own quantized signal, and sends a linear combination of the users' information messages via the noiseless link to the joint processor, which retrieves the users' messages by Gaussian elimination. The complexity of this scheme is linear in the coding block length and polynomial in the system size (number of relays).
