In Fixed Wireless Applications (FWA), the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is the most promising candidate for wideband data access. The reason is the soft limit on the number of active mobile devices. Many Fixed Wireless Applications impose an upper bound on the BER performance which restricts the increase in number of mobile users. The number of active mobile users or Capacity is further reduced in Multipath Fading Environment (MFE). This paper presents an effective method of improving the capacity of CDMA based Fixed Wireless Networks by using a hybrid power control algorithm. The proposed scheme improves the capacity two times as compared to the conventional CDMA based networks. Simulation results have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
