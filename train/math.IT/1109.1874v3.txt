Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is the most promising candidate for wideband data access. This is due to the advantage of soft limit on the number of active mobile devices. Many wireless mesh systems impose an upper bound on the BER performance which restricts the increase in number of mobile users. Capacity is further reduced in Multipath Fading Environment (MFE). This paper presents an effective method of improving the capacity of a CDMA based mesh network by managing the transmitted powers of the mobile devices and using MMSE based Multiuser Detection (MUD). The proposed scheme improves the capacity two times as compared to the conventional CDMA based mesh network. Simulation results have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
