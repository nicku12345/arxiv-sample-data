In this paper, we derive information-theoretic performance limits for secure and reliable communications over the general two-user discrete memoryless broadcast channel with side-information at the transmitter. The sender wishes to broadcast two independent messages to two receivers, under the constraint that each message should be kept confidential from the unintended receiver. Furthermore, the encoder has side-information - for example, fading in the wireless medium, interference caused by neighboring nodes in the network, etc. - provided to it in a noncausal manner, i.e., before the process of transmission. We derive an inner bound on the capacity region of this channel, by employing an extension of Marton's coding technique used for the classical two-user broadcast channel, in conjunction with a stochastic encoder to satisfy confidentiality constraints. Based on previously known results, we discuss a procedure to present a schematic of the achievable rate region. The rate-penalties for dealing with side-information and confidentiality constraints make the achievable region for this channel strictly smaller than the rate regions of those channels where one or both of these constraints are relaxed.
