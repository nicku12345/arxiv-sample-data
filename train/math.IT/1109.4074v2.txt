In this paper, inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of two-user interference channels with two confidential messages have been proposed. By adding secure multiplex coding to the error correction method in [15] which achieves the best achievable capacity region for interference channel up to now, we have shown that the improved secure capacity region compared with [2] now is the whole Han-Kobayashi region. In addition, this construction not only removes the rate loss incurred by adding dummy messages to achieve security, but also change the original weak security condition in [2] to strong security. Then the equivocation rate for a collection of secret messages has also been evaluated, when the length of the message is finite or the information rate is high, our result provides a good approximation for bounding the worst case equivocation rate. Our results can be readily extended to the Gaussian interference channel with little efforts.
