In this paper, the design and analysis of a new bandwidth-efficient signaling method over the bandlimited intensity-modulated direct-detection (IM/DD) channel is presented. The channel can be modeled as a bandlimited channel with nonnegative input and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Due to the nonnegativity constraint, standard methods for coherent bandlimited channels cannot be applied here. Previously established techniques for the IM/DD channel require bandwidth twice the required bandwidth over the conventional coherent channel. We propose a method to transmit without intersymbol interference in a bandwidth no larger than the bit rate. This is done by combining Nyquist or root-Nyquist pulses with a constant bias and using higher-order modulation formats. In fact, we can transmit with a bandwidth equal to that of coherent transmission. A trade-off between the required average optical power and the bandwidth is investigated. Depending on the bandwidth required, the most power-efficient transmission is obtained by the parametric linear pulse, the so-called "better than Nyquist" pulse, or the root-raised cosine pulse.
