The aim of this paper is to study the achievable rates for a K user Gaussian interference channels for any SNR using a combination of lattice and algebraic codes. Lattice codes are first used to transform the Gaussian interference channel (G-IFC) into a discrete input-output noiseless channel, and subsequently algebraic codes are developed to achieve good rates over this new alphabet. In this context, a quantity called efficiency is introduced which reflects the effectiveness of the algebraic coding strategy. The paper first addresses the problem of finding high efficiency algebraic codes. A combination of these codes with Construction-A lattices is then used to achieve non trivial rates for the original Gaussian interference channel.
