We present a general method for the error analysis of spatial modulation (SM) systems over correlated and uncorrelated Rayleigh and Rician fading channels. The proposed method, making use of the properties of proper complex random variables and vectors, provides an exact upper bound for the class of fading channels considered for any number of transmit and receive antennas and for a wide family of linear modulation alphabets. Theoretical derivations are validated via simulation results.
