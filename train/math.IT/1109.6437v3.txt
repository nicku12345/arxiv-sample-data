We consider MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) wiretap channels, where a legitimate transmitter Alice is communicating with a legitimate receiver Bob in the presence of an eavesdropper Eve, and communication is done via MIMO channels. We suppose that Alice's strategy is to use a codebook which has a lattice structure, which then allows her to perform coset encoding. We analyze Eve's probability of correctly decoding the message Alice meant to Bob, and from minimizing this probability, we derive a code design criterion for MIMO lattice wiretap codes. The case of block fading channels is treated similarly, and fast fading channels are derived as a particular case. The Alamouti code is carefully studied as an illustration of the analysis provided.
