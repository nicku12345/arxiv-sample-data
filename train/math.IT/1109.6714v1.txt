Spectrum sensing is a key problem in cognitive radio. However, traditional detectors become ineffective when noise uncertainty is severe. It is shown that the entropy of Gauss white noise is constant in the frequency domain, and a robust detector based on the entropy of spectrum amplitude was proposed. In this paper a novel detector is proposed based on the entropy of spectrum power density, and its performance is better than the previous scheme with less computational complexity. Furthermore, to improve the reliability of the detection, a two-stage entropy-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme using two-bit decision is proposed, and simulation results show its superior performance with relatively low computational complexity.
