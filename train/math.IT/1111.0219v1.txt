In this paper we study opportunistic transmission strategies for cognitive radios (CR) in which causal noisy observation from a primary user(s) (PU) state is available. PU is assumed to be operating in a slotted manner, according to a two-state Markov model. The objective is to maximize utilization ratio (UR), i.e., relative number of the PU-idle slots that are used by CR, subject to interference ratio (IR), i.e., relative number of the PU-active slots that are used by CR, below a certain level. We introduce an a-posteriori LLR-based cognitive transmission strategy and show that this strategy is optimum in the sense of maximizing UR given a certain maximum allowed IR. Two methods for calculating threshold for this strategy in practical situations are presented. One of them performs well in higher SNRs but might have too large IR at low SNRs and low PU activity levels, and the other is proven to never violate the allowed IR at the price of a reduced UR. In addition, an upper-bound for the UR of any CR strategy operating in the presence of Markovian PU is presented. Simulation results have shown a more than 116% improvement in UR at SNR of -3dB and IR level of 10% with PU state estimation. Thus, this opportunistic CR mechanism possesses a high potential in practical scenarios in which there exists no information about true states of PU.
