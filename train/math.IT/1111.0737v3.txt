A practical approach to optimal design of multichannel oversampled warped cosine-modulated filter banks (CMFB) is proposed. Warped CMFB is obtained by allpass transformation of uniform CMFB. The paper addresses the problems of minimization amplitude distortion and suppression of aliasing components emerged due to oversampling of filter bank channel signals. Proposed optimization-based design considerably reduces distortions of overall filter bank transfer function taking into account channel subsampling ratios. Matlab-implementation of the proposed warped CMFB design method is available in public GitHub repository.
