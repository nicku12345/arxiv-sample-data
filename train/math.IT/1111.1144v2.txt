We derive the capacity region of the state-dependent semideterministic broadcast channel with noncausal state-information at the transmitter. One of the two outputs of this channel is a deterministic function of the channel input and the channel state, and the state is assumed to be known noncausally to the transmitter but not to the receivers. We show that appending the state to the deterministic output does not increase capacity.   We also derive an outer bound on the capacity of general (not necessarily semideterministic) state-dependent broadcast channels.
