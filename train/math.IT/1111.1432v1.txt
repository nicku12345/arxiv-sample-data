A binary string of length 2^k induces the Boolean function of k variables whose Shannon expansion is the given binary string. This Boolean function then is representable via a unique reduced ordered binary decision diagram (ROBDD). The given binary string is fully recoverable from this ROBDD. We exhibit a lossless data compression algorithm in which a binary string of length a power of two is compressed via compression of the ROBDD associated to it as described above.   We show that when binary strings of length n a power of two are compressed via this algorithm, the maximal pointwise redundancy/sample with respect to any s-state binary information source has the upper bound (4\log_2s+16+o(1))/\log_2n . To establish this result, we exploit a result of Liaw and Lin stating that the ROBDD representation of a Boolean function of k variables contains a number of vertices on the order of (2+o(1))2^{k}/k.
