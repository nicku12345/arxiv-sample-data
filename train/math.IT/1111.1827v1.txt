We consider one-hop communication in wireless networks with random connections. In the random connection model, the channel powers between different nodes are drawn from a common distribution in an i.i.d. manner. An scheme achieving the throughput scaling of order n^{1/3-\delta}, for any \delta>0, is proposed, where n is the number of nodes. Such achievable throughput, along with the order n^{1/3} upper bound derived by Cui et al., characterizes the throughput capacity of one-hop schemes for the class of connection models with finite mean and variance.
