This paper is focused on the moderate-deviations analysis of binary hypothesis testing. The analysis relies on a concentration inequality for discrete-parameter martingales with bounded jumps, where this inequality forms a refinement to the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality. Relations of the analysis to the moderate deviations principle for i.i.d. random variables and to the relative entropy are considered.
