Time Interference Alignment is a flavor of Interference Alignment that increases the network capacity by suitably staggering the transmission delays of the senders. In this work the analysis of the existing literature is generalized and the focus is on the computation of the dof for networks with randomly placed users in a n-dimensional Euclidean space. In the basic case without coordination among the transmitters analytical expressions of the sum dof can be derived. If the transmit delays are coordinated, in 20% of the cases time Interference Alignment yields additional dof with respect to orthogonal access schemes. The potential capacity improvements for satellite networks are also investigated.
