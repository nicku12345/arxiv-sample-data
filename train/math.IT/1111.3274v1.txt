In this paper we propose a novel form of clipping mitigation in OFDM using compressive sensing that completely avoids tone reservation and hence rate loss for this purpose. The method builds on selecting the most reliable perturbations from the constellation lattice upon decoding at the receiver, and performs compressive sensing over these observations in order to completely recover the temporally sparse nonlinear distortion. As such, the method provides a unique practical solution to the problem of initial erroneous decoding decisions in iterative ML methods, offering both the ability to augment these techniques and to solely recover the distorted signal in one shot.
