We consider the general discrete memoryless two-way relay channel, where two users exchange messages via a relay, and propose two functional-decode-forward coding strategies for this channel. Functional-decode-forward involves the relay decoding a function of the users' messages rather than the individual messages themselves. This function is then broadcast back to the users, which can be used in conjunction with the user's own message to decode the other user's message. Via a numerical example, we show that functional-decode-forward with linear codes is capable of achieving strictly larger sum rates than those achievable by other strategies.
