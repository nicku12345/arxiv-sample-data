Let n=2m, m odd, e|m, and p odd prime with p\equiv1\ \mathrm{mod}\ 4. Let d=\frac{(p^{m}+1)^{2}}{2(p^{e}+1)}. In this paper, we study the cross-correlation between a p-ary m-sequence \{s_{t}\} of period p^{2m}-1 and its decimation \{s_{dt}\}. Our result shows that the cross-correlation function is six-valued and that it takes the values in \{-1,\ \pm p^{m}-1,\ \frac{1\pm p^{\frac{e}{2}}}{2}p^{m}-1,\ \frac{(1- p^{e})}{2}p^{m}-1\}. Also, the distribution of the cross-correlation is completely determined.
