Communication over a multiple access channel is considered. Each user modulates his signal as a superposition of redundant data streams where interconnection of data bits can be represented by means of a sparse graph. The receiver observes a signal resulting from the coupling of the sparse modulation graphs. Iterative interference cancellation decoding is analyzed. It is proved that spatial graph coupling allows to achieve the AWGN channel capacity with equal power transmissions.
