In this contribution, the evaluation of the diversity of the MIMO MMSE receiver is addressed for finite rates in both flat fading channels and frequency selective fading channels with cyclic prefix. It has been observed recently that in contrast with the other MIMO receivers, the MMSE receiver has a diversity depending on the aimed finite rate, and that for sufficiently low rates the MMSE receiver reaches the full diversity - that is, the diversity of the ML receiver. This behavior has so far only been partially explained. The purpose of this paper is to provide complete proofs for flat fading MIMO channels, and to improve the partial existing results in frequency selective MIMO channels with cyclic prefix.
