In this paper, we study, information theoretically, the impact of transmitter and or receiver cognition on the channel capacity. The cognition can be described by state information, dependent on the channel noise and or input. Specifically, as a new idea, we consider the receiver cognition as a state information dependent on the noise and we derive a capacity theorem based on the Gaussian version of the Cover-Chiang capacity theorem for two-sided state information channel. As intuitively expected, the receiver cognition increases the channel capacity and our theorem shows this increase quantitatively. Also, our capacity theorem includes the famous Costa theorem as its special cases.
