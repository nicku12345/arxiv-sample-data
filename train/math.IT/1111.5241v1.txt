In 1938, Gini studied a mean having two parameters. Later, many authors studied properties of this mean. It contains as particular cases the famous means such as harmonic, geometric, arithmetic, etc. Also it contains, the power mean of order r and Lehmer mean as particular cases. In this paper we have considered inequalities arising due to Gini-Mean and Heron's mean, and improved them based on the results recently studied by the author (Taneja, 2011).
