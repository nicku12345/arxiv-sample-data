This work considers a Gaussian interference channel with processing energy cost, which explicitly takes into account the energy expended for processing when each transmitter is on. With processing overhead, bursty transmission at each transmitter generally becomes more advantageous. Assuming on-off states do not carry information, for a two-user Z-interference channel, the new regime of very strong interference is identified and shown to be enlarged compared with the conventional one. With the interfered receiver listening when its own transmitter is silent, for a wide range of cross-link power gains, one can either achieve or get close to the interference-free upper bound on sum rate.
