Notions of interpolating variational splines and Paley-Wiener spaces are introduced on a combinatorial graph G. Both of these definitions explore existence of a combinatorial Laplace operator onG. The existence and uniqueness of interpolating variational splines on a graph is shown. As an application of variational splines, the paper presents a reconstruction algorithm of Paley-Wiener functions on graphs from their uniqueness sets.
