The performance of MMSE Iterative Equalization based on MAP-SBVP and COD-MAP algorithms (for generating extrinsic information) are compared for fading and non-fading communication channels employing serial concatenated convolution codes.   MAP-SBVP is a convolution decoder using a conventional soft-MAP decoder followed by a soft-convolution encoder using the soft-boolean value propagation (SBVP).   From the simulations it is observed that for MMSE Iterative Equalization, MAP-SBVP performance is comparable to COD-MAP for fading and non-fading channels.
