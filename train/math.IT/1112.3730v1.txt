Using the EXIT chart approach, a necessary and sufficient condition is developed for the local stability of iterative decoding of multi-edge type (MET) doubly-generalized low-density parity-check (D-GLDPC) code ensembles. In such code ensembles, the use of arbitrary linear block codes as component codes is combined with the further design of local Tanner graph connectivity through the use of multiple edge types. The stability condition for these code ensembles is shown to be succinctly described in terms of the value of the spectral radius of an appropriately defined polynomial matrix.
