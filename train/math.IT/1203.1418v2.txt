In 2008, Cusick {\it et al.} conjectured that certain elementary symmetric Boolean functions of the form \sigma_{2^{t+1}l-1, 2^t} are the only nonlinear balanced ones, where t, l are any positive integers, and \sigma_{n,d}=\bigoplus_{1\le i_1<...<i_d\le n}x_{i_1}x_{i_2}...x_{i_d} for positive integers n, 1\le d\le n. In this note, by analyzing the weight of \sigma_{n, 2^t} and \sigma_{n, d}, we prove that {\rm wt}(\sigma_{n, d})<2^{n-1} holds in most cases, and so does the conjecture. According to the remainder of modulo 4, we also consider the weight of \sigma_{n, d} from two aspects: n\equiv 3({\rm mod\}4) and n\not\equiv 3({\rm mod\}4). Thus, we can simplify the conjecture. In particular, our results cover the most known results. In order to fully solve the conjecture, we also consider the weight of \sigma_{n, 2^t+2^s} and give some experiment results on it.
