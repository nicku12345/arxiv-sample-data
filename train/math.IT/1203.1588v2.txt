We derive the optimal resource allocation of a practical half-duplex scheme for the Gaussian multiple access channel with transmitter cooperation (MAC-TC). Based on rate splitting and superposition coding, two users transmit information to a destination over 3 phases, such that the users partially exchange their information during the first 2 phases and cooperatively transmit to the destination during the last one. This scheme is near capacity-achieving when the inter-user links are stronger than each user-destination link; it also includes partial decode-forward relaying as a special case. We propose efficient algorithms to find the optimal resource allocation for maximizing either the individual or the sum rate and identify the corresponding optimal scheme for each channel configuration. For fixed phase durations, the power allocation problem is convex and can be solved analytically based on the KKT conditions. The optimal phase durations can then be obtained numerically using simple search methods. Results show that as the interuser link qualities increase, the optimal scheme moves from no cooperation to partial then to full cooperation, in which the users fully exchange their information and cooperatively send it to the destination. Therefore, in practical systems with strong inter-user links, simple decode-forward relaying at both users is rate-optimal.
