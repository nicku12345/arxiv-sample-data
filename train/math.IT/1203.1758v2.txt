In this paper, coordinated beamforming based on relaxed zero forcing (RZF) for K transmitter-receiver pair multiple-input single-output (MISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels is considered. In the RZF coordinated beamforming, conventional zero-forcing interference leakage constraints are relaxed so that some predetermined interference leakage to undesired receivers is allowed in order to increase the beam design space for larger rates than those of the zero-forcing (ZF) scheme or to make beam design feasible when ZF is impossible. In the MISO case, it is shown that the rate-maximizing beam vector under the RZF framework for a given set of interference leakage levels can be obtained by sequential orthogonal projection combining (SOPC). Based on this, exact and approximate closed-form solutions are provided in two-user and three-user cases, respectively, and an efficient beam design algorithm for RZF coordinated beamforming is provided in general cases. Furthermore, the rate control problem under the RZF framework is considered. A centralized approach and a distributed heuristic approach are proposed to control the position of the designed rate-tuple in the achievable rate region. Finally, the RZF framework is extended to MIMO interference channels by deriving a new lower bound on the rate of each user.
