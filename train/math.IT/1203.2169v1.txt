This paper introduces a novel blind carrier phase recovery estimator for general 2{\Pi}/M-rotationally symmetric constellations. This estimation method is a generalization of the non-data-aided (NDA) nonlinear Phase Metric Method (PMM) estimator already designed for general quadrature amplitude constellations. This unbiased estimator is seen here as a fourth order PMM then generalized to Mth order (Mth PMM) in such manner that it covers general 2{\Pi}/M-rotationally symmetric constellations such as PAM, QAM, PSK. Simulation results demonstrate the good performance of this Mth PMM estimation algorithm against competitive blind phase estimators already published for various modulation systems of practical interest.
