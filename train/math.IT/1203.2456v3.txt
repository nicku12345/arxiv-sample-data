We consider secrecy obtained when one transmits on a Gaussian Wiretap channel above the secrecy capacity. Instead of equivocation, we consider probability of error as the criterion of secrecy. The usual channel codes are considered for transmission. The rates obtained can reach the channel capacity. We show that the "confusion" caused to the Eve when the rate of transmission is above capacity of the Eve's channel is similar to the confusion caused by using the wiretap channel codes used below the secrecy capacity.
