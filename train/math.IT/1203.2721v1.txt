Finite field spreading scheme is proposed for a synchronous multiple-access channel with Gaussian noise and equal-power users. For each user, s information bits are spread \emph{jointly} into a length-sL vector by L multiplications on GF(2^s). Thus, each information bit is dispersed into sL transmitted symbols, and the finite field despreading (FF-DES) of each bit can take advantage of sL independent receiving observations. To show the performance gain of joint spreading quantitatively, an extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) function analysis of the FF-DES is given. It shows that the asymptotic slope of this EXIT function increases as s increases and is in fact the absolute slope of the bit error rate (BER) curve at the low BER region. This means that by increasing the length s of information bits for joint spreading, a larger absolute slope of the BER curve is achieved. For s, L\geq 2, the BER curve of the finite field spreading has a larger absolute slope than that of the single-user transmission with BPSK modulation.
