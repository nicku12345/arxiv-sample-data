From geometrical point of view, Eve (2003) studied seven means. These means are Harmonic, Geometric, Arithmetic, Heronian, Contra-harmonic, Root-mean square and Centroidal mean. We have considered for the first time a new measure calling generalized triangular discrimination. Inequalities among non-negative differences arising due to seven means and particular cases of generalized triangular discrimination are considered. Some new generating measures and their exponential representations are also presented.
