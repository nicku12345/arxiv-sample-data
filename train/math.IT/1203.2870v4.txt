Data streaming transmission over a block fading channel is studied. It is assumed that the transmitter receives a new message at each channel block at a constant rate, which is fixed by an underlying application, and tries to deliver the arriving messages by a common deadline. Various transmission schemes are proposed and compared with an informed transmitter upper bound in terms of the average decoded rate. It is shown that in the single receiver case the adaptive joint encoding (aJE) scheme is asymptotically optimal, in that it achieves the ergodic capacity as the transmission deadline goes to infinity; and it closely follows the performance of the informed transmitter upper bound in the case of finite transmission deadline. On the other hand, in the presence of multiple receivers with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), memoryless transmission (MT), time sharing (TS) and superposition transmission (ST) schemes are shown to be more robust than the joint encoding (JE) scheme as they have gradual performance loss with decreasing SNR.
