Consider a connected network of n nodes that all wish to recover k desired packets. Each node begins with a subset of the desired packets and exchanges coded packets with its neighbors. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions which characterize the set of all transmission schemes that permit every node to ultimately learn (recover) all k packets. When the network satisfies certain regularity conditions and packets are randomly distributed, this paper provides tight concentration results on the number of transmissions required to achieve universal recovery. For the case of a fully connected network, a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an optimal transmission scheme is derived. An application to secrecy generation is discussed.
