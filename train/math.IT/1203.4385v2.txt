In this paper, we present a novel way for solving the main problem of designing the capacity approaching irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) code ensemble over binary erasure channel (BEC). The proposed method is much simpler, faster, accurate and practical than other methods. Our method does not use any relaxation or any approximate solution like previous works. Our method works and finds optimal answer for any given check node degree distribution. The proposed method was implemented and it works well in practice with polynomial time complexity. As a result, we represent some degree distributions that their rates are close to the capacity with maximum erasure probability and maximum code rate.
