We propose new results on low weight codewords of affine and projective generalized Reed-Muller codes. In the affine case we prove that if the size of the working finite field is large compared to the degree of the code, the low weight codewords are products of affine functions. Then in the general case we study some types of codewords and prove that they cannot be second, thirds or fourth weight depending on the hypothesis. In the projective case the second distance of generalized Reed-Muller codes is estimated, namely a lower bound and an upper bound of this weight are given.
