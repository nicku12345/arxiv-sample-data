In this paper, a new peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is proposed based on the selected mapping (SLM) scheme. The proposed SLM scheme generates alternative OFDM signal sequences by cyclically shifting the connections in each subblock at an intermediate stage of inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). Compared with the conventional SLM scheme, the proposed SLM scheme achieves similar PAPR reduction performance with much lower computational complexity and no bit error rate (BER) degradation. The performance of the proposed SLM scheme is verified through numerical analysis. Also, it is shown that the proposed SLM scheme has the lowest computational complexity among the existing low-complexity SLM schemes exploiting the signals at an intermediate stage of IFFT.
