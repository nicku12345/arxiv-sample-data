We develop several lower bounds on the capacity of binary input symmetric output channels with synchronization errors which also suffer from other types of impairments such as substitutions, erasures, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) etc. More precisely, we show that if the channel with synchronization errors can be decomposed into a cascade of two channels where only the first one suffers from synchronization errors and the second one is a memoryless channel, a lower bound on the capacity of the original channel in terms of the capacity of the synchronization error-only channel can be derived. To accomplish this, we derive lower bounds on the mutual information rate between the transmitted and received sequences (for the original channel) for an arbitrary input distribution, and then relate this result to the channel capacity. The results apply without the knowledge of the exact capacity achieving input distributions. A primary application of our results is that we can employ any lower bound derived on the capacity of the first channel (synchronization error channel in the decomposition) to find lower bounds on the capacity of the (original) noisy channel with synchronization errors. We apply the general ideas to several specific classes of channels such as synchronization error channels with erasures and substitutions, with symmetric q-ary outputs and with AWGN explicitly, and obtain easy-to-compute bounds. We illustrate that, with our approach, it is possible to derive tighter capacity lower bounds compared to the currently available bounds in the literature for certain classes of channels, e.g., deletion/substitution channels and deletion/AWGN channels (for certain signal to noise ratio (SNR) ranges).
