We introduce a relative variant of information loss to characterize the behavior of deterministic input-output systems. We show that the relative loss is closely related to Renyi's information dimension. We provide an upper bound for continuous input random variables and an exact result for a class of functions (comprising quantizers) with infinite absolute information loss. A connection between relative information loss and reconstruction error is investigated.
