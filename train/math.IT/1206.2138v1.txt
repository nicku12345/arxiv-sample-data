The performance of a CDMA based wireless system is largely dependent on the characteristics of pseudo-random spreading codes. The spreading codes should be carefully chosen to ensure highest possible peak value of auto-correlation function and lower correlation peaks (side-lobes) at non-zero time-shifts. Simultaneously, zero cross-correlation value at all time shifts is required in order to eliminate the effect of multiple access interference at the receiver. But no such code family exists which possess both characteristics simultaneously. That's why an exhaustive effort has been made in this paper to evaluate the peak correlation characteristics of various non-orthogonal spreading codes and suggest a suitable solution.
