In this paper we have established relations of the genetic tables with magic and bimagic squares. Connections with Hamming distances, binomial coefficients are established. The idea of Gray code is applied. Shannon entropy of magic squares of order 4x4, 8x8 and 16x16 are also calculated. Some comparison is also made. Symmetry among restriction enzymes having four letters is also studied.
