We consider irregular product codes.In this class of codes, each codeword is represented by a matrix. The entries in each row (column) of the matrix should come from a component row (column) code. As opposed to (standard) product codes, we do not require that all component row codes nor all component column codes be the same. As we will see, relaxing this requirement can provide some additional attractive features including 1) allowing some regions of the codeword be more error-resilient 2) allowing a more refined spectrum of rates for finite-lengths and improved performance in some of these rates 3) more interaction between row and column codes during decoding. We study these codes over erasure channels. We find that for any 0 < \epsilon < 1, for many rate distributions on component row codes, there is a matching rate distribution on component column codes such that an irregular product code based on MDS codes with those rate distributions on the component codes has asymptotic rate 1 - \epsilon and can decode on erasure channels (of alphabet size equal the alphabet size of the component MDS codes) with erasure probability < \epsilon.
