This report presents the results of applying different compression algorithms to the network protocol of an online game. The algorithm implementations compared are zlib, liblzma and my own implementation based on LZ77 and a variation of adaptive Huffman coding. The comparison data was collected from the game TomeNET. The results show that adaptive coding is especially useful for compressing large amounts of very small packets.
