A code C \subseteq \F_2^n is a (c,\epsilon,\delta)-expander code if it has a Tanner graph, where every variable node has degree c, and every subset of variable nodes L_0 such that |L_0|\leq \delta n has at least \epsilon c |L_0| neighbors. Feldman et al. (IEEE IT, 2007) proved that LP decoding corrects \frac{3\epsilon-2}{2\epsilon-1} \cdot (\delta n-1) errors of (c,\epsilon,\delta)-expander code, where \epsilon > 2/3+\frac{1}{3c}. In this paper, we provide a simpler proof of their result and show that this result holds for every expansion parameter \epsilon > 2/3.
