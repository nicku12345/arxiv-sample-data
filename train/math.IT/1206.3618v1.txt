This short paper describes a simple coding technique, Sparse Sequential Dirichlet Coding, for multi-alphabet memoryless sources. It is appropriate in situations where only a small, unknown subset of the possible alphabet symbols can be expected to occur in any particular data sequence. We provide a competitive analysis which shows that the performance of Sparse Sequential Dirichlet Coding will be close to that of a Sequential Dirichlet Coder that knows in advance the exact subset of occurring alphabet symbols. Empirically we show that our technique can perform similarly to the more computationally demanding Sequential Sub-Alphabet Estimator, while using less computational resources.
