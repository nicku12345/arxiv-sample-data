In this paper we consider the secure transmission over the fast fading multiple antenna Gaussian broadcast channels with confidential messages (FMGBC-CM), where a multiple-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential messages to two users with information theoretic secrecy and only the statistics of the receivers' channel state information are known at the transmitter. We first use the same marginal property of the FMGBC-CM to classify the non-trivial cases, i.e., those not degraded to the common wiretap channels. We then derive the achievable rate region for the FMGBC-CM by solving the channel input covariance matrices and the inflation factor. Due to the complicated rate region formulae, we resort to low SNR analysis to investigate the characteristics of the channel. Finally, the numerical examples show that under the information-theoretic secrecy requirement both users can achieve positive rates simultaneously.
