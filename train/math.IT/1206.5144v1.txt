In this article, we examine several design and complexity aspects of the optimal physical layer resource allocation problem for a generic interference channel (IC). The latter is a natural model for multi-user communication networks. In particular, we characterize the computational complexity, the convexity as well as the duality of the optimal resource allocation problem. Moreover, we summarize various existing algorithms for resource allocation and discuss their complexity and performance tradeoff. We also mention various open research problems throughout the article.
