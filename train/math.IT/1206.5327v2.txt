We present a systematic technique for transforming XACML 3.0 policies in Answer Set Programming (ASP). We show that the resulting logic program has a unique answer set that directly corresponds to our formalisation of the standard semantics of XACML 3.0 from Ramli et. al. We demonstrate how our results make it possible to use off-the-shelf ASP solvers to formally verify properties of access control policies represented in XACML, such as checking the completeness of a set of access control policies and verifying policy properties.
