In this paper, the outage probability and outage-based beam design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels are considered. First, closed-form expressions for the outage probability in MIMO interference channels are derived under the assumption of Gaussian-distributed channel state information (CSI) error, and the asymptotic behavior of the outage probability as a function of several system parameters is examined by using the Chernoff bound. It is shown that the outage probability decreases exponentially with respect to the quality of CSI measured by the inverse of the mean square error of CSI. Second, based on the derived outage probability expressions, an iterative beam design algorithm for maximizing the sum outage rate is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed beam design algorithm yields better sum outage rate performance than conventional algorithms such as interference alignment developed under the assumption of perfect CSI.
