The main objective of this project is to design the full-rate Space-Time-Frequency Trellis code (STFTC), which is based on Quasi-Orthogonal designs for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The proposed Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time-Frequency Trellis code combines set partitioning and the structure of quasi-orthogonal space-frequency designs in a systematic way. In addition to multipath diversity and transmit diversity, the proposed code provides receive diversity, array gain, and achieve high-coding gain over a frequency selective fading channel. As simulation results demonstrate, the code outperforms the existing Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time-Frequency Trellis codes in terms of frame error rate performance.
