The generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) of the symmetric two-user Gaussian interference relay channel (IRC) is studied. While it is known that the relay does not increase the DoF of the IC, this is not known for the more general GDoF. For the characterization of the GDoF, new sum-capacity upper bounds and lower bounds are derived. The lower bounds are obtained by a new scheme, which is based on functional decode-and-forward (FDF). The GDoF is characterized for the regime in which the source-relay link is weaker than the interference link, which constitutes half the overall space of channel parameters. It is shown that the relay can indeed increase the GDoF of the IRC and that it is achieved by FDF.
