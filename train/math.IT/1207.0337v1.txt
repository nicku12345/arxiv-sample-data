It was shown recently that the 2-user interference channel with a cognitive relay (IC-CR) has full degrees of freedom (DoF) almost surely, that is, 2 DoF. The purpose of this work is to check whether the DoF of the K-user IC-CR, consisting of K user pairs and a cognitive relay, follow as a straight forward extension of the 2-user case. As it turns out, this is not the case. The K-user IC-CR is shown to have 2K/3 DoF if K>2 for the when the channel is time varying, achievable using interference alignment. Thus, while the basic K-user IC with time varying channel coefficients has 1/2 DoF per user for all K, the K-user IC-CR with varying channels has 1 DoF per user if K=2 and 2/3 DoF per user if K>2. Furthermore, the DoF region of the 3-user IC-CR with constant channels is characterized using interference neutralization, and a new upper bound on the sum-capacity of the 2-user IC-CR is given.
