Femtocell networks are promising for not only improving the coverage but also increasing the capacity of current cellular networks. The interference-limited reality in femtocell networks makes interference management (IM) the key to maintaining the quality of service and fairness in femtocell networks. Over-the-air signaling is one of the most effective means for fast distributed dynamic IM. However, the design of this type of signal is challenging. In this paper, we address the challenges and propose an effective solution, referred to as single-tone signaling (STS). The proposed STS scheme possesses many highly desirable properties, such as no dedicated resource requirement (no system overhead), no near-far effect, no inter-signal interference, and immunity to synchronization error. In addition, the proposed STS signal provides a means for high quality wideband channel estimation for the use of coordinated techniques, such as coordinated beamforming. Based on the proposed STS, two distributed dynamic IM schemes, ON/OFF power control and SLNR (signal-to-leakage-plus-noise-ratio)-based transmitter beam coordination, are proposed. Simulation results show significant performance improvement as a result of the use of STS-based IM schemes.
