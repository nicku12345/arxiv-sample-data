We study the exact and optimal repair of multiple failures in codes for distributed storage. More particularly, we provide an explicit construction of exact minimum bandwidth coordinated regenerating codes (MBCR) for n=d+t,k,d >= k,t >= 1. Our construction differs from existing constructions by allowing both t>1 (i.e., repair of multiple failures) and d>k (i.e., contacting more than k devices during repair).
