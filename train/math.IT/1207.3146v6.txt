We present an achievable rate region for the general three user discrete memoryless broadcast channel, based on nested coset codes. We characterize 3-to-1 discrete broadcast channels, a class of broadcast channels for which the best known coding technique\footnote{We henceforth refer to this as Marton's coding for three user discrete broadcast channel.}, which is obtained by a natural generalization of that proposed by Marton for the general two user discrete broadcast channel, is strictly sub-optimal. In particular, we identify a novel 3-to-1 discrete broadcast channel for which Marton's coding is \textit{analytically} proved to be strictly suboptimal. We present achievable rate regions for the general 3-to-1 discrete broadcast channels, based on nested coset codes, that strictly enlarge Marton's rate region for the aforementioned channel. We generalize this to present achievable rate region for the general three user discrete broadcast channel. Combining together Marton's coding and that proposed herein, we propose the best known coding technique, for a general three user discrete broadcast channel.
