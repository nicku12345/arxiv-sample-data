We construct codes over the ring \mathbb{F}_2+u\mathbb{F}_2 with u^2=0. These code are designed for use in DNA computing applications. The codes obtained satisfy the reverse complement constraint, the GC content constraint and avoid the secondary structure. they are derived from the cyclic complement reversible codes over the ring \mathbb{F}_2+u\mathbb{F}_2. We also construct an infinite family of BCH DNA codes.
