In this paper we investigate repeated root cyclic and negacyclic codes of length p^rm over \mathbb{F}_{p^s} with (m,p)=1. In the case p odd, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the existence of negacyclic self-dual codes. When m=2m' with m' odd, we characterize the codes in terms of their generator polynomials. This provides simple conditions on the existence of self-dual negacyclic codes, and generalizes the results of Dinh \cite{dinh}. We also answer an open problem concerning the number of self-dual cyclic codes given by Jia et al. \cite{jia}.
