The L-user additive white Gaussian noise multiway relay channel is investigated, where L users exchange information at the same rate through a single relay. A new achievable rate region, based on the functional-decode-forward coding strategy, is derived. For the case where there are three or more users, and all nodes transmit at the same power, the capacity is obtained. For the case where the relay power scales with the number of users, it is shown that both compress-forward and functional-decode-forward achieve rates within a constant number of bits of the capacity at all SNR levels; in addition, functional-decode-forward outperforms compress-forward and complete-decode-forward at high SNR levels.
