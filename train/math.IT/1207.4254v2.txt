In this paper, we analyze a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel where nodes are randomly distributed on a plane as a spatial Poisson cluster point process. Each cluster uses interference alignment (IA) to suppress intra-cluster interference but unlike most work on IA, we do not neglect inter-cluster interference. We also connect the accuracy of channel state information to the distance between the nodes, i.e. the quality of CSI degrades with increasing distance. Accounting for the training and feedback overhead, we derive the transmission capacity of this MIMO IA ad hoc network and then compare it to open-loop (interference-blind) spatial multiplexing. Finally, we present exemplary system setups where spatial multiplexing outperforms IA due to the imperfect channel state information or the non-aligned inter-cluster interference.
