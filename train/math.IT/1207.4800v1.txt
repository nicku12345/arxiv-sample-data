We introduce a new paradigm for finite precision iterative decoding on low-density parity-check codes over the Binary Symmetric channel. The messages take values from a finite alphabet, and unlike traditional quantized decoders which are quantized versions of the Belief propagation (BP) decoder, the proposed finite alphabet iterative decoders (FAIDs) do not propagate quantized probabilities or log-likelihoods and the variable node update functions do not mimic the BP decoder. Rather, the update functions are maps designed using the knowledge of potentially harmful subgraphs that could be present in a given code, thereby rendering these decoders capable of outperforming the BP in the error floor region. On certain column-weight-three codes of practical interest, we show that there exist 3-bit precision FAIDs that surpass the BP decoder in the error floor. Hence, FAIDs are able to achieve a superior performance at much lower complexity. We also provide a methodology for the selection of FAIDs that is not code-specific, but gives a set of candidate FAIDs containing potentially good decoders in the error floor region for any column-weight-three code. We validate the code generality of our methodology by providing particularly good three-bit precision FAIDs for a variety of codes with different rates and lengths.
