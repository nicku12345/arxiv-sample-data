One of the design objectives in distributed storage system is the minimization of the data traffic during the repair of failed storage nodes. By repairing multiple failures simultaneously and cooperatively, further reduction of repair traffic is made possible. A closed-form expression of the optimal tradeoff between the repair traffic and the amount of storage in each node for cooperative repair is given. We show that the points on the tradeoff curve can be achieved by linear cooperative regenerating codes, with an explicit bound on the required finite field size. The proof relies on a max-flow-min-cut-type theorem for submodular flow from combinatorial optimization. Two families of explicit constructions are given.
