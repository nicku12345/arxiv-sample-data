The SPS-LASSO has recently been introduced as a solution to the problem of regularization parameter selection in the complex-valued LASSO problem. Still, the dependence on the grid size and the polynomial time of performing convex optimization technique in each iteration, in addition to the deficiencies in the low noise regime, confines its performance for Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. This work presents methods to apply LASSO without grid size limitation and with less complexity. As we show by simulations, the proposed methods loose a negligible performance compared to the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator, which needs a combinatorial search We also show by simulations that compared to practical implementations of ML, the proposed techniques are less sensitive to the source power difference.
