The construction of optimal non-uniform mappings for discrete input memoryless channels (DIMCs) is investigated. An efficient algorithm to find optimal mappings is proposed and the rate by which a target distribution is approached is investigated. The results are applied to non-uniform mappings for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with finite signal constellations. The mappings found by the proposed methods outperform those obtained via a central limit theorem approach as suggested in the literature.
