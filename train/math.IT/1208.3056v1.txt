A method to construct nonasymmetric distributed source coding (DSC) scheme using polar codes which can achieve any point on the dominant face of the Slepian-Wolf (SW) rate region for sources with uniform marginals is considered. In addition to nonasymmetric case, we also discuss and show explicitly how asymmetric and single source compression is done using successive cancellation (SC) polar decoder. We then present simulation results that exhibit the performance of the considered methods.
