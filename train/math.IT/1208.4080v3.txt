Convolutional low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes (or spatially-coupled codes) have now been shown to achieve capacity on binary-input memoryless symmetric channels. The principle behind this surprising result is the threshold-saturation phenomenon, which is defined by the belief-propagation threshold of the spatially-coupled ensemble saturating to a fundamental threshold defined by the uncoupled system.   Previously, the authors demonstrated that potential functions can be used to provide a simple proof of threshold saturation for coupled scalar recursions. In this paper, we present a simple proof of threshold saturation that applies to a wide class of coupled vector recursions. The conditions of the theorem are verified for the density-evolution equations of: (i) joint decoding of irregular LDPC codes for a Slepian-Wolf problem with erasures, (ii) joint decoding of irregular LDPC codes on an erasure multiple-access channel, and (iii) general protograph codes on the BEC. This proves threshold saturation for these systems.
