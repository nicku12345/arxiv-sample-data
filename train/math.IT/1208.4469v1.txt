In this paper the secrecy problem in the cognitive statedependent interference channel is considered. In this scenario we have a primary and a cognitive transmitter-receiver pairs. The cognitive transmitter has the message of the primary sender as side information. In addition, the state of the channel is known at the cognitive encoder. So, the cognitive encoder uses this side information to cooperate with the primary transmitter and sends its individual message confidentially. An achievable rate region and an outer bound for the rate region in this channel are derived. The results are extended to the previous works as special cases.
