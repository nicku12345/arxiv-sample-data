We consider the problem of finding optimal, fair and distributed power-rate strategies to achieve the sum capacity of the Gaussian multiple-access block-fading channel. In here, the transmitters have access to only their own fading coefficients, while the receiver has global access to all the fading coefficients. Outage is not permitted in any communication block. The resulting average sum-throughput is also known as `power-controlled adaptive sum-capacity', which appears as an open problem in literature.   This paper presents the power-controlled adaptive sum-capacity of a wide-class of popular MAC models. In particular, we propose a power-rate strategy in the presence of distributed channel state information (CSI), which is throughput optimal when all the users have identical channel statistics. The proposed scheme also has an efficient implementation using successive cancellation and rate-splitting. We propose an upperbound when the channel laws are not identical. Furthermore, the optimal schemes are extended to situations in which each transmitter has additional finite-rate partial CSI on the link quality of others.
