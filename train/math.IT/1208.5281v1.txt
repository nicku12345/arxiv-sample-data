We address the expected supremum of a linear combination of shifts of the sinc kernel with random coefficients. When the coefficients are Gaussian, the expected supremum is of order \sqrt{\log n}, where n is the number of shifts. When the coefficients are uniformly bounded, the expected supremum is of order \log\log n. This is a noteworthy difference to orthonormal functions on the unit interval, where the expected supremum is of order \sqrt{n\log n} for all reasonable coefficient statistics.
