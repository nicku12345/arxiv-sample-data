Suppose Alice and Bob receive strings X=(X_1,...,X_n) and Y=(Y_1,...,Y_n) each uniformly random in [s]^n but so that X and Y are correlated . For each symbol i, we have that Y_i = X_i with probability 1-\eps and otherwise Y_i is chosen independently and uniformly from [s].   Alice and Bob wish to use their respective strings to extract a uniformly chosen common sequence from [s]^k but without communicating. How well can they do? The trivial strategy of outputting the first k symbols yields an agreement probability of (1 - \eps + \eps/s)^k. In a recent work by Bogdanov and Mossel it was shown that in the binary case where s=2 and k = k(\eps) is large enough then it is possible to extract k bits with a better agreement probability rate. In particular, it is possible to achieve agreement probability (k\eps)^{-1/2} \cdot 2^{-k\eps/(2(1 - \eps/2))} using a random construction based on Hamming balls, and this is optimal up to lower order terms.   In the current paper we consider the same problem over larger alphabet sizes s and we show that the agreement probability rate changes dramatically as the alphabet grows. In particular we show no strategy can achieve agreement probability better than (1-\eps)^k (1+\delta(s))^k where \delta(s) \to 0 as s \to \infty. We also show that Hamming ball based constructions have {\em much lower} agreement probability rate than the trivial algorithm as s \to \infty. Our proofs and results are intimately related to subtle properties of hypercontractive inequalities.
