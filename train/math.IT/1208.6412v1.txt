There are many selected mapping (SLM) schemes to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. Beginning with the conventional SLM scheme, there have been proposed many low-complexity SLM schemes including Lim's, Wang's, and Baxely's SLM schemes typically. In this paper, we propose an adaptive generation (AG) method of OFDM signals in SLM schemes. By generating the alternative OFDM signals adaptively, unnecessary computational complexity of SLM schemes can be removed without any degradation of their PAPR reduction performance. In this paper, we apply the AG method to various SLM schemes which are the conventional SLM scheme and its low-complexity versions such as Lim's, Wang's, and Baxely's SLM schemes. Of course, the AG method can be applied to most of existing SLM schemes easily. The numerical results show that the AG method can reduce their computational complexity substantially.
