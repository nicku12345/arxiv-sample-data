Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is a popular approach to sparse signal recovery in compressed sensing (CS). In SBL, the signal sparsity information is exploited by assuming a sparsity-inducing prior for the signal that is then estimated using Bayesian inference. In this paper, a new sparsity-inducing prior is introduced and efficient algorithms are developed for signal recovery. The main algorithm is shown to produce a sparser solution than existing SBL methods while preserving their desirable properties. Numerical simulations with one-dimensional synthetic signals and two-dimensional images verify our analysis and show that for sparse signals the proposed algorithm outperforms its SBL peers in both the signal recovery accuracy and computational speed. Its improved performance is also demonstrated in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in CS.
