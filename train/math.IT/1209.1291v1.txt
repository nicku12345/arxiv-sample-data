The question of whether the degrees of freedom (DoF) of multi-user networks can be enhanced even under isotropic fading and no channel state information (or output feedback) at the transmitters (CSIT) is investigated. Toward this end, the two-user MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) broadcast and interference channels are studied with no side-information whatsoever at the transmitters and with receivers equipped with full-duplex radios. The full-duplex feature allows for receiver cooperation because each receiver, in addition to receiving the signals sent by the transmitters, can also simultaneously transmit a signal in the same band to the other receiver. Unlike the case of MIMO networks with CSIT and full-duplex receivers, for which DoF are known, it is shown that for MIMO networks with no CSIT, full-duplex receiver cooperation is beneficial to such an extent that even the DoF region is enhanced. Indeed, for important classes of two-user MIMO broadcast and interference channels, defined by certain relationships on numbers of antennas at different terminals, the exact DoF regions are established. The key to achieving DoF-optimal performance for such networks are new retro-cooperative interference alignment schemes. Their optimality is established via the DoF analysis of certain genie-aided or enhanced version of those networks.
