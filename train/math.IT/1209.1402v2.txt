We propose Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing (JSDM), an approach to multiuser MIMO downlink that exploits the structure of the correlation of the channel vectors in order to allow for a large number of antennas at the base station while requiring reduced-dimensional Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). This allows for significant savings both in the downlink training and in the CSIT feedback from the user terminals to the base station, thus making the use of a large number of base station antennas potentially suitable also for Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) systems, for which uplink/downlink channel reciprocity cannot be exploited. JSDM forms the multiuser MIMO downlink precoder by concatenating a pre-beamforming matrix, which depends only on the channel second-order statistics, with a classical multiuser precoder, based on the instantaneous knowledge of the resulting reduced dimensional effective channels. We prove a simple condition under which JSDM incurs no loss of optimality with respect to the full CSIT case. For linear uniformly spaced arrays, we show that such condition is closely approached when the number of antennas is large. For this case, we use Szego asymptotic theory of large Toeplitz matrices to design a DFT-based pre-beamforming scheme requiring only coarse information about the users angles of arrival and angular spread. Finally, we extend these ideas to the case of a two-dimensional base station antenna array, with 3-dimensional beamforming, including multiple beams in the elevation angle direction. We provide guidelines for the pre-beamforming optimization and calculate the system spectral efficiency under proportional fairness and maxmin fairness criteria, showing extremely attractive performance. Our numerical results are obtained via an asymptotic random matrix theory tool known as deterministic equivalent approximation.
