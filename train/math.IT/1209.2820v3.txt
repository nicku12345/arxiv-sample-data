Motivated by results in optical communications, where the performance can degrade dramatically if the transmit power is sufficiently increased, the channel capacity is characterized for various kinds of memoryless vector channels. It is proved that for all static point-to-point channels, the channel capacity is a nondecreasing function of power. As a consequence, maximizing the mutual information over all input distributions with a certain power is for such channels equivalent to maximizing it over the larger set of input distributions with upperbounded power. For interference channels such as optical wavelength-division multiplexing systems, the primary channel capacity is always nondecreasing with power if all interferers transmit with identical distributions as the primary user. Also, if all input distributions in an interference channel are optimized jointly, then the achievable sum-rate capacity is again nondecreasing. The results generalizes to the channel capacity as a function of a wide class of costs, not only power.
