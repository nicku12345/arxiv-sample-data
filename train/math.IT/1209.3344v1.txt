For decades, cellular networks have greatly evolved to support high data rates over reliable communication. Hybrid automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) is one of the techniques to make such improvement possible. However, this advancement is reduced at the cell edge where interference is not negligible. In order to overcome the challenge at the cell edge, the concept of interference-aware receiver has been recently proposed in which both desired and interference signals are successively decoded, called interference-aware successive decoding (IASD). Although IASD is the advanced receiver technology, interference signals are out of the mobile station's control so that they cannot be requested by the mobile station. For this reason, this paper proposes new combining schemes for the IASD receiver, which operate with hybrid ARQ in a bit level or in a symbol level. In addition, this paper compares the memory requirement among the proposed combining schemes and analyzes the impact of discrete modulation on the proposed scheme. Simulation results presents the superiority of the proposed combining schemes and shows the improvement in terms of the number of transmission.
