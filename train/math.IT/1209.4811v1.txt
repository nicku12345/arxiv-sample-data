Increasing demands on high data rate mobile communications services will inevitably drive future broadband mobile communication systems toward achieving data transmission rates in excess of 100 Mbps. One of the promising technologies which can satisfy this demand on high data rate mobile communications services is the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission technology which falls under the general category of multicarrier modulation systems. OFDM is a spectrally efficient modulation technique that can achieve high speed data transmission over multipath fading channels without the need for powerful equalization techniques. However the price paid for this high spectral efficiency and less intensive equalization is low power efficiency. OFDM signals are very sensitive to non-linear effects due to the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which leads to the power inefficiency in the RF section of the transmitter. This paper analyzes the relation between aperiodic autocorrelation of OFDM symbols and PAPR. The paper also gives a comparative study of PAPR reduction performance of various channel coding techniques for the OFDM signals. For our study we have considered Hamming codes, cyclic codes, convolution codes, Golay and Reed-Muller codes. The results show that each of the channel coding technique has a different PAPR reduction performance. Coding technique with the highest value of PAPR reduction has been identified along with an illustration on PAPR reduction performances with respect to each code.
