Square COD (complex orthogonal design) with size [n, n, k] is an n \times n matrix \mathcal{O}_z, where each entry is a complex linear combination of z_i and their conjugations z_i^*, i=1,\ldots, k, such that \mathcal{O}_z^H \mathcal{O}_z = (|z_1|^2 + \ldots + |z_k|^2)I_n. Closely following the work of Hottinen and Tirkkonen, which proved an upper bound of k/n by making a crucial observation between square COD and group representation, we prove the structure theorem of square COD.
