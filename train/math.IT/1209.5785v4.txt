We consider a signaling format where the information to be communicated from one or multiple transmitters to a receiver is modulated via a superposition of independent data streams. Each data stream is formed by error-correction encoding, constellation mapping, replication and permutation of symbols, and application of signature sequences. The relations between the data bits and modulation symbols transmitted over the channel can be represented by a sparse graph. In the case where the modulated data streams are transmitted with time offsets the receiver observes spatial coupling of the individual graphs into a graph chain enabling efficient demodulation/decoding. We prove that a two-stage demodulation/decoding method, in which iterative demodulation based on symbol estimation and interference cancellation is followed by parallel error correction decoding, achieves capacity on the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel asymptotically. We compare the performance of the two-stage receiver to the receiver which utilizes hard feedback between the error-correction encoders and the iterative demodulator.
