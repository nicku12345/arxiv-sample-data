In this paper, a design criterion for space-time block codes (STBC) is proposed for two-user MIMO interference channels when a group zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm is applied at each receiver to eliminate the inter-user interference. Based on the design criterion, a design of STBC for two-user interference channels is proposed that can achieve full diversity for each user with the group ZF receiver. The code rate approaches one when the time delay in the encoding (or code block size) gets large. Performance results demonstrate that the full diversity can be guaranteed by our proposed STBC with the group ZF receiver.
