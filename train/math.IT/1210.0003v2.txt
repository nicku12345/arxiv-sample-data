This paper further investigates the data compression of fuzzy relation information systems. First, we introduce an algorithm for constructing the homomorphism between fuzzy relation information systems. Then, we discuss that how to compress the dynamic fuzzy relation information systems by utilizing the compression of the original systems. Afterwards, several illustrative examples are employed to show that the data compression of fuzzy relation information systems and dynamic fuzzy relation information systems can be simplified significantly by our proposed
