This paper studies the successive convex approximation for low complexity (SCALE) algorithm, which was proposed to address the weighted sum rate (WSR) maximized dynamic power spectrum management (DSM) problem for multiuser multicarrier systems. To this end, we first revisit the algorithm, and then present geometric interpretation and properties of the algorithm. A geometric programming (GP) implementation approach is proposed and compared with the low-complexity approach proposed previously. In particular, an analytical method is proposed to set up the default lower-bound constraints added by a GP solver. Finally, numerical experiments are used to illustrate the analysis and compare the two implementation approaches.
