Many data applications in the next generation cellular networks, such as content precaching and video progressive downloading, require flow-level quality of service (QoS) guarantees. One such requirement is deadline, where the transmission task needs to be completed before the application-specific time. To minimize the number of uncompleted transmission tasks, we study laxity-based scheduling policies in this paper. We propose a Less-Laxity-Higher-Possible-Rate (L^2HPR) policy and prove its asymptotic optimality in underloaded identical-deadline systems. The asymptotic optimality of L^2HPR can be applied to estimate the schedulability of a system and provide insights on the design of scheduling policies for general systems. Based on it, we propose a framework and three heuristic policies for practical systems. Simulation results demonstrate the asymptotic optimality of L^2HPR and performance improvement of proposed policies over greedy policies.
