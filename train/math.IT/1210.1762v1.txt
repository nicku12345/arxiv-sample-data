In this paper we use a variation of simulated annealing algorithm for optimizing two-dimensional constellations with 32 signals. The main objective is to maximize the symmetric pragmatic capacity under the peak-power constraint. The method allows the joint optimization of constellation and binary labeling. We also investigate the performance of the optimized constellation over nonlinear satellite channel under additive white Gaussian noise. We consider the performance over systems with and without pre-distorters. In both cases the optimized constellations perform considerably better than the conventional Amplitude Phase Shift Keying (APSK) modulations, used in the current digital video broadcasting standard (DVB-S2) on satellite channels. Based on our optimized constellations, we also propose a new labeling for the 4+12+16-APSK constellation of the DVB-S2 standard which is Gray over all rings.
