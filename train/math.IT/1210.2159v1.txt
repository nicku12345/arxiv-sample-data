In this paper, we design explicit codes for strong coordination in two-node networks. Specifically, we consider a two-node network in which the action imposed by nature is binary and uniform, and the action to coordinate is obtained via a symmetric discrete memoryless channel. By observing that polar codes are useful for channel resolvability over binary symmetric channels, we prove that nested polar codes achieve a subset of the strong coordination capacity region, and therefore provide a constructive and low complexity solution for strong coordination.
