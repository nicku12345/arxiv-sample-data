A unique decoding algorithm for general AG codes, namely multipoint evaluation codes on algebraic curves, is presented. It is a natural generalization of the previous decoding algorithm which was only for one-point AG codes. As such, it retains the same advantages of fast speed and regular structure with the previous algorithm. Compared with other known decoding algorithms for general AG codes, it is much simpler in its description and implementation.
