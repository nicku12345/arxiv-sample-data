In this report, we investigate the data transmission model in which a sequence of data is broadcasted to a number of receivers. The receivers, which have different channel capacities, wish to decode the data sequentially at different rates. Our results are applicable to a wide range of scenarios. For instance, it can be employed in the broadcast streaming of a video clip through the internet, so that receivers with different bandwidths can play the video at different speed. Receivers with greater bandwidths can provide a smooth playback, while receivers with smaller bandwidths can play the video at a slower speed, or with short pauses or rebuffering.
