Many satellite communication systems operating today employ low cost upconverters or downconverters which create phase noise. This noise can severely limit the information rate of the system and pose a serious challenge for the detection systems. Moreover, simple solutions for phase noise tracking such as PLL either require low phase noise or otherwise require many pilot symbols which reduce the effective data rate. In the last decade we have witnessed a significant amount of research done on joint estimation and decoding of phase noise and coded information. These algorithms are based on the factor graph representation of the joint posterior distribution. The framework proposed in [5], allows the design of efficient message passing algorithms which incorporate both the code graph and the channel graph. The use of LDPC or Turbo decoders, as part of iterative message passing schemes, allows the receiver to operate in low SNR regions while requiring less pilot symbols. In this paper we propose a multiple hypotheses algorithm for joint detection and estimation of coded information in a strong phase noise channel. We also present a low complexity mixture reduction procedure which maintains very good accuracy for the belief propagation messages.
