The aim of this paper is to introduce the construction of codes for a general discrete stationary memoryless multiple access channel based on the the notion of the hash property. Since an ensemble of sparse matrices has a hash property, we can use sparse matrices for code construction. Our approach has a potential advantage compared to the conventional random coding because it is expected that we can use some approximation algorithms by using the sparse structure of codes.
