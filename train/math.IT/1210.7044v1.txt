Let F be a number field with ring of integers \Oc_F and \Dc a division F-algebra with a maximal cyclic subfield K. We study rings occurring as quotients of a natural \Oc_F-order \Lambda in \Dc by two-sided ideals. We reduce the problem to studying the ideal structure of \Lambda/\qf^s\Lambda, where \qf is a prime ideal in \Oc_F, s\geq 1. We study the case where \qf remains unramified in K, both when s=1 and s>1. This work is motivated by its applications to space-time coded modulation.
