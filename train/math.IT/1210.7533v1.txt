In ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems with impulse radio (IR) modulation, the bandwidth is usually 1GHz or more. To process the received signal digitally, high sampling rate analog-digital-converters (ADC) are required. Due to the high complexity and large power consumption, monobit ADC is appropriate. The optimal monobit receiver has been derived. But it is not efficient to combat intersymbol interference (ISI). Decision feedback equalization (DFE) is an effect way dealing with ISI. In this paper, we proposed a algorithm that combines Viterbi decoding and DFE together for monobit receivers. In this way, we suppress the impact of ISI effectively, thus improving the bit error rate (BER) performance. By state expansion, we achieve better performance. The simulation results show that the algorithm has about 1dB SNR gain compared to separate demodulation and decoding method and 1dB loss compared to the BER performance in the channel without ISI. Compare to the full resolution detection in fading channel without ISI, it has 3dB SNR loss after state expansion.
