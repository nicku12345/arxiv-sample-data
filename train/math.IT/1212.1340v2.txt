In this paper, we consider the Spatial Modulation (SM) system in a frequency selective channel under single carrier (SC) communication scenario and propose zero-padding instead of cyclic prefix considered in the existing literature. We show that the zero-padded single carrier (ZP-SC) SM system offers full multipath diversity under maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, unlike the cyclic prefixed SM system. Further, we show that the order of ML decoding complexity in the proposed ZP-SC SM system is independent of the frame length and depends only on the number of multipath links between the transmitter and the receiver. Thus, we show that the zero-padding in the SC SM system has two fold advantage over cyclic prefixing: 1) gives full multipath diversity, and 2) offers relatively low ML decoding complexity. Furthermore, we extend the partial interference cancellation receiver (PIC-R) proposed by Guo and Xia for the decoding of STBCs in order to convert the ZP-SC system into a set of flat-fading subsystems. We show that the transmission of any full rank STBC over these subsystems achieves full transmit, receive as well as multipath diversity under PIC-R. With the aid of this extended PIC-R, we show that the ZP-SC SM system achieves receive and multipath diversity with a decoding complexity same as that of the SM system in flat-fading scenario.
