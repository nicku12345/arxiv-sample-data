We design optimal 2 \times N (2 <N) matrices, with unit columns, so that the maximum condition number of all the submatrices comprising 3 columns is minimized. The problem has two applications. When estimating a 2-dimensional signal by using only three of N observations at a given time, this minimizes the worst-case achievable estimation error. It also captures the problem of optimum sensor placement for monitoring a source located in a plane, when only a minimum number of required sensors are active at any given time. For arbitrary N\geq3, we derive the optimal matrices which minimize the maximum condition number of all the submatrices of three columns. Surprisingly, a uniform distribution of the columns is \emph{not} the optimal design for odd N\geq 7.
