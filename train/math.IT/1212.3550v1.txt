In this paper, we examine discrete memoryless Multiple Access Channels (MACs) with two-sided feedback in the presence of two correlated channel states that are correlated in the sense of Slepian-Wolf (SW). We find achievable rate region for this channel when the states are provided non-causally to the transmitters and show that our achievable rate region subsumes Cover-Leung achievable rate for the discrete memoryless MAC with two-sided feedback as its special case. We also find the capacity region of discrete memoryless MAC with two-sided feedback and with SW-type correlated states available causally or strictly causally to the transmitters. We also study discrete memoryless MAC with partial feedback in the presence of two SW-type correlated channel states that are provided non-causally, causally, or strictly causally to the transmitters. An achievable rate region is found when channel states are non-causally provided to the transmitters whereas capacity regions are characterized when channel states are causally, or strictly causally available at the transmitters.
