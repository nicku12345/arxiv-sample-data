Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has recently been applied in wireless communication systems due to its high data rate transmission capability with high bandwidth efficiency and its robustness to multi-path delay. Fading is the one of the major aspect which is considered in the receiver. To cancel the effect of fading, channel estimation and equalization procedure must be done at the receiver before data demodulation. This paper mainly deals with pilot based channel estimation techniques for OFDM communication over frequency selective fading channels. This paper proposes a specific approach to channel equalization for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) systems. Inserting an equalizer realized as an adaptive system before the FFT processing, the influence of variable delay and multi path could be mitigated in order to remove or reduce considerably the guard interval and to gain some spectral efficiency. The adaptive algorithm is based on adaptive filtering with averaging (AFA) for parameter update. Based on the development of a model of the OFDM system, through extensive computer simulations, we investigate the performance of the channel equalized system. The results show much higher convergence and adaptation rate compared to one of the most frequently used algorithms - Least Mean Squares (LMS).
