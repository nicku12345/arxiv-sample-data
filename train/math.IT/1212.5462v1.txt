Recent experimental results have shown that full-duplex communication is possible for short-range communications. However, extending full-duplex to long-range communication remains a challenge, primarily due to residual self-interference even with a combination of passive suppression and active cancellation methods. In this paper, we investigate the root cause of performance bottlenecks in current full-duplex systems. We first classify all known full-duplex architectures based on how they compute their cancelling signal and where the cancelling signal is injected to cancel self-interference. Based on the classification, we analytically explain several published experimental results. The key bottleneck in current systems turns out to be the phase noise in the local oscillators in the transmit and receive chain of the full-duplex node. As a key by-product of our analysis, we propose signal models for wideband and MIMO full-duplex systems, capturing all the salient design parameters, and thus allowing future analytical development of advanced coding and signal design for full-duplex systems.
