The main decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes are based on a bivariate interpolation step, which is expensive in time complexity. Lot of interpolation methods were proposed in order to decrease the complexity of this procedure, but they stay still expensive. Then Koetter, Ma and Vardy proposed in 2010 a technique, called re-encoding, which allows to reduce the practical running time. However, this trick is only devoted for the Koetter interpolation algorithm. We propose a reformulation of the re-encoding for any interpolation methods. The assumption for this reformulation permits only to apply it to the Welch-Berlekamp algorithm.
