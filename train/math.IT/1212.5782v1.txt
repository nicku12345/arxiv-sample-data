Leveraging recent progress in physical-layer network coding we propose a new approach to random access: When packets collide, it is possible to recover a linear combination of the packets at the receiver. Over many rounds of transmission, the receiver can thus obtain many linear combinations and eventually recover all original packets. This is by contrast to slotted ALOHA where packet collisions lead to complete erasures. The throughput of the proposed strategy is derived and shown to be significantly superior to the best known strategies, including multipacket reception.
