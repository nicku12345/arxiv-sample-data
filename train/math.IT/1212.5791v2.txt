In this paper, a novel carrier frequency offset estimation approach, including preamble structure, carrier frequency offset estimation algorithm, is proposed for hexagonal multi-carrier transmission (HMCT) system. The closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound of the proposed carrier frequency offset estimation scheme is given. Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that the proposed preamble structure and carrier frequency offset estimation algorithm for HMCT system obtains an approximation to the Cramer-Rao lower bound mean square error (MSE) performance over the doubly dispersive (DD) propagation channel.
