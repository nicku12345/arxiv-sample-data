In this paper, a novel receiver for Hexagonal Multicarrier Transmission (HMT) system based on the maximizing Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (Max-SINR) criterion is proposed. Theoretical analysis shows that the prototype pulse of the proposed Max-SINR receiver should adapt to the root mean square (RMS) delay spread of the doubly dispersive (DD) channel with exponential power delay profile and U-shape Doppler spectrum. Simulation results show that the proposed Max-SINR receiver outperforms traditional projection scheme and obtains an approximation to the theoretical upper bound SINR performance within the full range of channel spread factor. Meanwhile, the SINR performance of the proposed prototype pulse is robust to the estimation error between the estimated value and the real value of time delay spread.
