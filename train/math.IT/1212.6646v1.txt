We propose blind adaptive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear receivers for DS-CDMA systems using multiple transmit antennas and space-time block codes (STBC) in multipath channels. A space-time code-constrained constant modulus (CCM) design criterion based on constrained optimization techniques is considered and recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive algorithms are developed for estimating the parameters of the linear receivers. A blind space-time channel estimation method for MIMO DS-CDMA systems with STBC based on a subspace approach is also proposed along with an efficient RLS algorithm. Simulations for a downlink scenario assess the proposed algorithms in several situations against existing methods.
