In this paper, we investigate the outage performance of time division broadcasting (TDBC) protocol in independent but non-identical Rayleigh flat-fading channels, where all nodes are interfered by a finite number of co-channel interferers. We assume that the relay operates in the amplified-and-forward mode. A tight lower bound as well as the asymptotic expression of the outage probability is obtained in closed-form. Through both theoretic analyses and simulation results, we show that the achievable diversity of TDBC protocol is zero in the interference-limited scenario. Moreover, we study the impacts of interference power, number of interferers and relay placement on the outage probability. Finally, the correctness of our analytic results is validated via computer simulations.
