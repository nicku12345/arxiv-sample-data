An opportunistic DF-AF selection relaying scheme with maximal received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination is investigated in this paper. The outage probability of the opportunistic DF-AF selection relaying scheme over Nakagami-m fading channels is analyzed, and a closed-form solution is obtained. We perform asymptotic analysis of the outage probability in high SNR domain. The coding gain and the diversity order are obtained. For the purpose of comparison, the asymptotic analysis of opportunistic AF scheme in Nakagami-m fading channels is also performed by using the Squeeze Theorem. In addition, we prove that compared with the opportunistic DF scheme and opportunistic AF scheme, the opportunistic DF-AF selection relaying scheme has better outage performance.
