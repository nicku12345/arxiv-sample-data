Codes in the Grassmannian have recently found an application in random network coding. All the codewords in such codes are subspaces of \F_q^n with a given dimension.   In this paper, we consider the problem of list decoding of a certain family of codes in the Grassmannian, called lifted Gabidulin codes.   For this purpose we use the Pl\"ucker embedding of the Grassmannian. We describe a way of representing a subset of the Pl\"ucker coordinates of lifted Gabidulin codes as linear block codes. The union of the parity-check equations of these block codes and the equations which arise from the description of a ball around a subspace in the Pl\"ucker coordinates describe the list of codewords with distance less than a given parameter from the received word.
