Cyclic codes have been widely used in digital communication systems and consume electronics as they have efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. The weight distribution of cyclic codes has been an important topic of study for many years. It is in general hard to determine the weight distribution of linear codes. In this paper, a class of cyclic codes with any number of zeros are described and their weight distributions are determined.
