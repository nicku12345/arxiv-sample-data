We consider the vector linear solvability of networks over a field \mathbb{F}_q. It is well known that a scalar linear solution over \mathbb{F}_q exists for a network if and only if the network is \textit{matroidal} with respect to a \textit{matroid} representable over \mathbb{F}_q. A \textit{discrete polymatroid} is the multi-set analogue of a matroid. In this paper, a \textit{discrete polymatroidal} network is defined and it is shown that a vector linear solution over a field \mathbb{F}_q exists for a network if and only if the network is discrete polymatroidal with respect to a discrete polymatroid representable over \mathbb{F}_q. An algorithm to construct networks starting from a discrete polymatroid is provided. Every representation over \mathbb{F}_q for the discrete polymatroid, results in a vector linear solution over \mathbb{F}_q for the constructed network. Examples which illustrate the construction algorithm are provided, in which the resulting networks admit vector linear solution but no scalar linear solution over \mathbb{F}_q.
