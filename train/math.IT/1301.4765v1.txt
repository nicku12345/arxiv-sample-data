In this letter, we analyze the ergodic capacity of bidirectional amplify-and-forward relay selection (RS) with imperfect channel state information (CSI), i.e., outdated CSI and imperfect channel estimation. Practically, the optimal RS scheme in maximizing the ergodic capacity cannot be achieved, due to the imperfect CSI. Therefore, two suboptimal RS schemes are discussed and analyzed, in which the first RS scheme is based on the imperfect channel coefficients, and the second RS scheme is based on the predicted channel coefficients. The lower bound of the ergodic capacity with imperfect CSI is derived in a closed-form, which matches tightly with the simulation results. The results reveal that once CSI is imperfect, the ergodic capacity of bidirectional RS degrades greatly, whereas the RS scheme based on the predicted channel has better performance, and it approaches infinitely to the optimal performance, when the prediction length is sufficiently large.
