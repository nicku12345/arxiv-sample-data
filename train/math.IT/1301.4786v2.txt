In this paper, we propose a model for energy cooperation between cellular base stations (BSs) with individual hybrid power supplies (including both the conventional grid and renewable energy sources), limited energy storages, and connected by resistive power lines for energy sharing. When the renewable energy profile and energy demand profile at all BSs are deterministic or known ahead of time, we show that the optimal energy cooperation policy for the BSs can be found by solving a linear program. We show the benefits of energy cooperation in this regime. When the renewable energy and demand profiles are stochastic and only causally known at the BSs, we propose an online energy cooperation algorithm and show the optimality properties of this algorithm under certain conditions. Furthermore, the energy-saving performances of the developed offline and online algorithms are compared by simulations, and the effect of the availability of energy state information (ESI) on the performance gains of the BSs' energy cooperation is investigated. Finally, we propose a hybrid algorithm that can incorporate offline information about the energy profiles, but operates in an online manner.
