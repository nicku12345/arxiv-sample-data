We study the extremality of the BEC and the BSC for Gallager's reliability function E_0 evaluated under the uniform input distribution for binary input DMCs from the aspect of channel polarization. In particular, we show that amongst all B-DMCs of a given E_0(\rho) value, for a fixed \rho \geq 0, the BEC and BSC are extremal in the evolution of E_0 under the one-step polarization transformations.
