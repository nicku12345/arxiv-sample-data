In this paper, we study a general additive state-dependent Gaussian interference channel (ASD-GIC) where we consider two-user interference channel with two independent states known non-causally at both transmitters, but unknown to either of the receivers. An special case, where the additive states over the two links are the same is studied in [1], [2], in which it is shown that the gap between the achievable symmetric rate and the upper bound is less than 1/4 bit for the strong interference case. Here, we also consider the case where each channel state has unbounded variance [3], which is referred to as the strong interferences. We first obtain an outer bound on the capacity region. By utilizing lattice-based coding schemes, we obtain four achievable rate regions. Depend on noise variance and channel power constraint, achievable rate regions can coincide with the channel capacity region. For the symmetric model, the achievable sum-rate reaches to within 0.661 bit of the channel capacity for signal to noise ratio (SNR) greater than one.
