We prove that the ensemble the nested coset codes built on finite fields achieves the capacity of arbitrary discrete memoryless point-to-point channels. Exploiting it's algebraic structure, we develop a coding technique for communication over general discrete multiple access channel with channel state information distributed at the transmitters. We build an algebraic coding framework for this problem using the ensemble of Abelian group codes and thereby derive a new achievable rate region. We identify non-additive and non-symmteric examples for which the proposed achievable rate region is strictly larger than the one achievable using random unstructured codes.
