The problem of computing sum of sources over a multiple access channel (MAC) is considered. Building on the technique of linear computation coding (LCC) proposed by Nazer and Gastpar [2007], we employ the ensemble of nested coset codes to derive a new set of sufficient conditions for computing the sum of sources over an \textit{arbitrary} MAC. The optimality of nested coset codes [Padakandla, Pradhan 2011] enables this technique outperform LCC even for linear MAC with a structural match. Examples of nonadditive MAC for which the technique proposed herein outperforms separation and systematic based computation are also presented. Finally, this technique is enhanced by incorporating separation based strategy, leading to a new set of sufficient conditions for computing the sum over a MAC.
