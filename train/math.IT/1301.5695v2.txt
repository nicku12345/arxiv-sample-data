This paper investigates amplify-and-forward (AF) schemes for both one and two-way relay channels. Unlike most existing works assuming independent noise at the relays, we consider a more general scenario with correlated relay noise. We first propose an approach to efficiently solve a class of quadratically constrained fractional problems via second-order cone programming (SOCP). Then it is shown that the AF relay optimization problems studied in this paper can be incorporated into such quadratically constrained fractional problems. As a consequence, the proposed approach can be used as a unified framework to solve the optimal AF rate for the one-way relay channel and the optimal AF rate region for the two-way relay channel under both sum and individual relay power constraints.   In particular, for one-way relay channel under individual relay power constraints, we propose two suboptimal AF schemes in closed-form. It is shown that they are approximately optimal in certain conditions of interest. Furthermore, we find an interesting result that, on average, noise correlation is beneficial no matter the relays know the noise covariance matrix or not for such scenario. Overall, the obtained results recover and generalize several existing results for the uncorrelated counterpart. (unsubmitted)
