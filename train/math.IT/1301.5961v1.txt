This paper provides new constructive lower bounds for constant dimension codes, using different techniques such as Ferrers diagram rank metric codes and pending blocks. Constructions for two families of parameters of constant dimension codes are presented. The examples of codes obtained by these constructions are the largest known constant dimension codes for the given parameters.
