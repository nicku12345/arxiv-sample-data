This paper considers the K user cognitive interference channel with one primary and K-1 secondary/cognitive transmitters with a cumulative message sharing structure, i.e cognitive transmitter i\in [2:K] knows non-causally all messages of the users with index less than i. We propose a computable outer bound valid for any memoryless channel. We first evaluate the sum-rate outer bound for the high- SNR linear deterministic approximation of the Gaussian noise channel. This is shown to be capacity for the 3-user channel with arbitrary channel gains and the sum-capacity for the symmetric K-user channel. Interestingly. for the K user channel having only the K th cognitive know all the other messages is sufficient to achieve capacity i.e cognition at transmitter 2 to K-1 is not needed. Next the sum capacity of the symmetric Gaussian noise channel is characterized to within a constant additive and multiplicative gap. The proposed achievable scheme for the additive gap is based on Dirty paper coding and can be thought of as a MIMO-broadcast scheme where only one encoding order is possible due to the message sharing structure. As opposed to other multiuser interference channel models, a single scheme suffices for both the weak and strong interference regimes. With this scheme the generalized degrees of freedom (gDOF) is shown to be a function of K, in contrast to the non cognitive case and the broadcast channel case. Interestingly, it is show that as the number of users grows to infinity the gDoF of the K-user cognitive interference channel with cumulative message sharing tends to the gDoF of a broadcast channel with a K-antenna transmitter and K single-antenna receivers. The analytical additive additive and multiplicative gaps are a function of the number of users. Numerical evaluations of inner and outer bounds show that the actual gap is less than the analytical one.
