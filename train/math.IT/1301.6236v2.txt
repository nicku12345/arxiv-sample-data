An iterated refinement procedure for the Guruswami--Sudan list decoding algorithm for Generalised Reed--Solomon codes based on Alekhnovich's module minimisation is proposed. The method is parametrisable and allows variants of the usual list decoding approach. In particular, finding the list of \emph{closest} codewords within an intermediate radius can be performed with improved average-case complexity while retaining the worst-case complexity.
