This paper considers the sum rate maximization problem of a two-user multiple-input single-output interference channel with receivers that can scavenge energy from the radio signals transmitted by the transmitters. We first study the optimal transmission strategy for an ideal scenario where the two receivers can simultaneously decode the information signal and harvest energy. Then, considering the limitations of the current circuit technology, we propose two practical schemes based on TDMA, where, at each time slot, the receiver either operates in the energy harvesting mode or in the information detection mode. Optimal transmission strategies for the two practical schemes are respectively investigated. Simulation results show that the three schemes exhibit interesting tradeoff between achievable sum rate and energy harvesting requirement, and do not dominate each other in terms of maximum achievable sum rate.
