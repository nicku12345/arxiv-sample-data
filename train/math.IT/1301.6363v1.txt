We present a novel algorithm that solves the turbo code LP decoding problem in a fininte number of steps by Euclidean distance minimizations, which in turn rely on repeated shortest path computations in the trellis graph representing the turbo code. Previous attempts to exploit the combinatorial graph structure only led to algorithms which are either of heuristic nature or do not guarantee finite convergence. A numerical study shows that our algorithm clearly beats the running time, up to a factor of 100, of generic commercial LP solvers for medium-sized codes, especially for high SNR values.
