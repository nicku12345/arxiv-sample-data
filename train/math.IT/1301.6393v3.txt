An open-loop single-user multiple-input multiple-output communication scheme is considered where a transmitter, equipped with multiple antennas, encodes the data into independent streams all taken from the same linear code. The coded streams are then linearly precoded using the encoding matrix of a perfect linear dispersion space-time code. At the receiver side, integer-forcing equalization is applied, followed by standard single-stream decoding. It is shown that this communication architecture achieves the capacity of any Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output channel up to a gap that depends only on the number of transmit antennas.
