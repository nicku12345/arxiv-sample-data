Is it a good idea to use the frequency of events in the past, as a guide to their frequency in the future (as we all do anyway)? In this paper the question is attacked from the perspective of universal prediction of individual sequences. It is shown that there is a universal sequential probability assignment, such that for a large class loss functions (optimization goals), the predictor minimizing the expected loss under this probability, is a good universal predictor. The proposed probability assignment is based on randomly dithering the empirical frequencies of states in the past, and it is easy to show that randomization is essential. This yields a very simple universal prediction scheme which is similar to Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) and works for a large class of loss functions, as well as a partial justification for using probabilistic assumptions.
