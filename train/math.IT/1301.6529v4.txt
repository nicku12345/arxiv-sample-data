We show how to solve a generalised version of the Multi-sequence Linear Feedback Shift-Register (MLFSR) problem using minimisation of free modules over \mathbb F[x]. We show how two existing algorithms for minimising such modules run particularly fast on these instances. Furthermore, we show how one of them can be made even faster for our use. With our modeling of the problem, classical algebraic results tremendously simplify arguing about the algorithms. For the non-generalised MLFSR, these algorithms are as fast as what is currently known. We then use our generalised MLFSR to give a new fast decoding algorithm for Reed Solomon codes.
