In this paper, two-user Gaussian interference channel(GIC) is revisited with the objective of developing implementable (explicit) channel codes. Specifically, low density parity check (LDPC) codes are adopted for use over these channels, and their benefits are studied. Different scenarios on the level of interference are considered. In particular, for strong interference channel examples with binary phase shift keying (BPSK), it is demonstrated that rates better than those offered by single user codes with time sharing are achievable. Promising results are also observed with quadrature-shift-keying (QPSK). Under general interference a Han-Kobayashi coding based scheme is employed splitting the information into public and private parts, and utilizing appropriate iterative decoders at the receivers. Using QPSK modulation at the two transmitters, it is shown that rate points higher than those achievable by time sharing are obtained.
