We define capacity for group testing problems and deduce bounds for the capacity of a variety of noisy models, based on the capacity of equivalent noisy communication channels. For noiseless adaptive group testing we prove an information-theoretic lower bound which tightens a bound of Chan et al. This can be combined with a performance analysis of a version of Hwang's adaptive group testing algorithm, in order to deduce the capacity of noiseless and erasure group testing models.
