In this paper we consider the identification (ID) via multiple access channels (MACs). In the general MAC the ID capacity region includes the ordinary transmission (TR) capacity region. In this paper we discuss the converse coding theorem. We estimate two types of error probabilities of identification for rates outside capacity region, deriving some function which serves as a lower bound of the sum of two error probabilities of identification. This function has a property that it tends to zero as n\to \infty for noisy channels satisfying the strong converse property. Using this property, we establish that the transmission capacity region is equal to the ID capacity for the MAC satisfying the strong converse property. To derive the result we introduce a new resolvability problem on the output from the MAC. We further develop a new method of converting the direct coding theorem for the above MAC resolvability problem into the converse coding theorem for the ID via MACs.
