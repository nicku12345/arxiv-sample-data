While the efficiency of MIMO transmissions in a rich scattering environment has been demonstrated, less is known about the situation where the fading matrix coefficients come from a line-of-sight model. In this paper, we study in detail how this line-of-sight assumption affects the performance of distributed MIMO transmissions between far away clusters of nodes in a wireless network. Our analysis pertains to the study of a new class of random matrices.
