Theoretical analysis has long indicated that feedback improves the error exponent but not the capacity of single-user memoryless channels. Recently Polyanskiy et al. studied the benefit of variable-length feedback with termination (VLFT) codes in the non-asymptotic regime. In that work, achievability is based on an infinite length random code and decoding is attempted at every symbol. The coding rate backoff from capacity due to channel dispersion is greatly reduced with feedback, allowing capacity to be approached with surprisingly small expected latency. This paper is mainly concerned with VLFT codes based on finite-length codes and decoding attempts only at certain specified decoding times. The penalties of using a finite block-length N and a sequence of specified decoding times are studied. This paper shows that properly scaling N with the expected latency can achieve the same performance up to constant terms as with N = \infty. The penalty introduced by periodic decoding times is a linear term of the interval between decoding times and hence the performance approaches capacity as the expected latency grows if the interval between decoding times grows sub-linearly with the expected latency.
