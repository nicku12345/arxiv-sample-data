The Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLT) is a data structure which supports insertion, deletion, retrieval and listing operations of the key-value pair. The IBLT can be used to realize efficient set reconciliation for database synchronization. The most notable feature of the IBLT is the complete listing operation of the key-value pairs based on the algorithm similar to the peeling algorithm for low-density generator-matrix (LDGM) codes. In this paper, we will present a stopping set (SS) analysis for the IBLT which reveals finite length behaviors of the listing failure probability. The key of the analysis is enumeration of the number of stopping matrices of given size. We derived a novel recursive formula useful for computationally efficient enumeration. An upper bound on the listing failure probability based on the union bound accurately captures the error floor behaviors. It will be shown that, in the error floor region, the dominant SS have size 2. We propose a simple modification on hash functions, which are called SS avoiding hash functions, for preventing occurrences of the SS of size 2.
