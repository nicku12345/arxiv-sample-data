This paper considers an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) point-to-point wireless communication system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. We study a receiver which is able to harvest energy from the desired signal, noise, and interference. In particular, we consider a power splitting receiver which dynamically splits the received power into two power streams for information decoding and energy harvesting. We design power allocation algorithms maximizing the spectral efficiency (bit/s/Hz) of data transmission. In particular, the algorithm design is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem which takes into account the constraint on the minimum power delivered to the receiver. The problem is solved by using convex optimization techniques and a one-dimensional search. The optimal power allocation algorithm serves as a system benchmark scheme due to its high complexity. To strike a balance between system performance and computational complexity, we also propose two suboptimal algorithms which require a low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed suboptimal algorithms.
