New non-asymptotic random coding theorems (with error probability \epsilon and finite block length n) based on Gallager parity check ensemble and Shannon random code ensemble with a fixed codeword type are established for discrete input arbitrary output channels. The resulting non-asymptotic achievability bounds, when combined with non-asymptotic equipartition properties developed in the paper, can be easily computed. Analytically, these non-asymptotic achievability bounds are shown to be asymptotically tight up to the second order of the coding rate as n goes to infinity with either constant or sub-exponentially decreasing \epsilon. Numerically, they are also compared favourably, for finite n and \epsilon of practical interest, with existing non-asymptotic achievability bounds in the literature in general.
