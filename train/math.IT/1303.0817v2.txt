A receiver wants to compute a function of two correlated sources separately observed by two transmitters. One of the transmitters may send a possibly private message to the other transmitter in a cooperation phase before both transmitters communicate to the receiver. For this network configuration this paper investigates both a function computation setup, wherein the receiver wants to compute a given function of the sources exactly, and a rate distortion setup, wherein the receiver wants to compute a given function within some distortion.   For the function computation setup, a general inner bound to the rate region is established and shown to be tight in a number of cases: partially invertible functions, full cooperation between transmitters, one-round point-to-point communication, two-round point-to-point communication, and the cascade setup where the transmitters and the receiver are aligned. In particular it is shown that the ratio of the total number of transmitted bits without cooperation and the total number of transmitted bits with cooperation can be arbitrarily large. Furthermore, one bit of cooperation suffices to arbitrarily reduce the amount of information both transmitters need to convey to the receiver.   For the rate distortion version, an inner bound to the rate region is exhibited which always includes, and sometimes strictly, the convex hull of Kaspi-Berger's related inner bounds. The strict inclusion is shown via two examples.
