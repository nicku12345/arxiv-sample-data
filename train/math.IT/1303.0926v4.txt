Let p\geq3 be a prime and e\geq2 an integer. Let \sigma(x) be a primitive polynomial of degree n over Z/p^eZ and G'(\sigma(x),p^e) the set of primitive linear recurring sequences generated by \sigma(x). A compressing map \varphi on Z/p^eZ naturally induces a map \hat{\varphi} on G'(\sigma(x),p^e). For a subset D of the image of \varphi,\hat{\varphi} is called to be injective w.r.t. D-uniformity if the distribution of elements of D in the compressed sequence implies all information of the original primitive sequence. In this correspondence, for at least 1-2(p-1)/(p^n-1) of primitive polynomials of degree n, a clear criterion on \varphi is obtained to decide whether \hat{\varphi} is injective w.r.t. D-uniformity, and the majority of maps on Z/p^eZ induce injective maps on G'(\sigma(x),p^e). Furthermore, a sufficient condition on \varphi is given to ensure injectivity of \hat{\varphi} w.r.t. D-uniformity. It follows from the sufficient condition that if \sigma(x) is strongly primitive and the compressing map \varphi(x)=f(x_{e-1}), where f(x_{e-1}) is a permutation polynomial over \mathbb{F}_{p}, then \hat{\varphi} is injective w.r.t. D-uniformity for \emptyset\neq D\subset\mathbb{F}_{p}. Moreover, we give three specific families of compressing maps which induce injective maps on G'(\sigma(x),p^e).
