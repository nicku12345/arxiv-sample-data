In certain applications, relay terminals can be employed to simultaneously deliver information and energy to a designated receiver and a radio frequency (RF) energy harvester, respectively. In such scenarios, the relay that is preferable for information transmission does not necessarily coincide with the relay with the strongest channel to the energy harvester, since the corresponding channels fade independently. Relay selection thus entails a tradeoff between the efficiency of the information transfer to the receiver and the amount of energy transferred to the energy harvester. The study of this tradeoff is the subject on which this work mainly focuses. Specifically, we investigate the behavior of the ergodic capacity and the outage probability of the information transmission to the receiver, for a given amount of energy transferred to the RF energy harvester. We propose two relay selection methods that apply to any number of available relays. Furthermore, for the case of two relays, we develop the optimal relay selection method in a maximum capacity / minimum outage probability sense, for a given energy transfer constraint. A close-to-optimal selection method that is easier to analyze than the optimal one is also examined. Closed-form expressions for the capacity-energy and the outage-energy tradeoffs of the developed schemes are provided and corroborated by simulations. Interesting insights on the aforementioned tradeoffs are obtained.
