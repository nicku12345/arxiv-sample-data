In this paper, we study the performance of blind adaptive beamforming algorithms for smart antennas in realistic environments. A constrained constant modulus (CCM) design criterion is described and used for deriving a recursive least squares (RLS) type optimization algorithm. Furthermore, two kinds of scenarios are considered in the paper for analyzing its performance. Simulations are performed to compare the performance of the proposed method to other well-known methods for blind adaptive beamforming. Results indicate that the proposed method has a significant faster convergence rate, better robustness to changeable environments and better tracking capability.
