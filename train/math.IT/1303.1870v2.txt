This paper present the construction cyclic isodual codes over finite fields and finite chain rings. These codes are monomially equivalent to their dual. Conditions are given for the existence of cyclic isodual codes. In addition, the concept of duadic codes over finite fields is extended to finite chain rings. Several constructions of isodual cyclic codes and self-dual codes are given.
