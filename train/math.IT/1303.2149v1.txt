Recent work characterizing the optimal performance of secrecy systems has made use of a distortion-like metric for partial secrecy as a replacement for the more traditional metric of equivocation. In this work we use the log-loss function to show that the optimal performance limits characterized by equivocation are, in fact, special cases of distortion-based counterparts. This observation illuminates why equivocation doesn't tell the whole story of secrecy. It also justifies the causal-disclosure framework for secrecy (past source symbols and actions revealed to the eavesdropper).
