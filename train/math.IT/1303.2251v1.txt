Sequential Compressive Sensing, which may be widely used in sensing devices, is a popular topic of recent research. This paper proposes an online recovery algorithm for sparse approximation of sequential compressive sensing. Several techniques including warm start, fast iteration, and variable step size are adopted in the proposed algorithm to improve its online performance. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate its better performance than the relative art.
