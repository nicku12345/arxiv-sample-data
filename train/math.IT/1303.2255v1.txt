The newly proposed l_1 norm constraint zero-point attraction Least Mean Square algorithm (ZA-LMS) demonstrates excellent performance on exact sparse system identification. However, ZA-LMS has less advantage against standard LMS when the system is near sparse. Thus, in this paper, firstly the near sparse system modeling by Generalized Gaussian Distribution is recommended, where the sparsity is defined accordingly. Secondly, two modifications to the ZA-LMS algorithm have been made. The l_1 norm penalty is replaced by a partial l_1 norm in the cost function, enhancing robustness without increasing the computational complexity. Moreover, the zero-point attraction item is weighted by the magnitude of estimation error which adjusts the zero-point attraction force dynamically. By combining the two improvements, Dynamic Windowing ZA-LMS (DWZA-LMS) algorithm is further proposed, which shows better performance on near sparse system identification. In addition, the mean square performance of DWZA-LMS algorithm is analyzed. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and verify the result of theoretical analysis.
