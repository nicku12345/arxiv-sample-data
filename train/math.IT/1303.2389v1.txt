We consider the problem of recovering a block (or group) sparse signal from an underdetermined set of random linear measurements, which appear in compressed sensing applications such as radar and imaging. Recent results of Donoho, Johnstone, and Montanari have shown that approximate message passing (AMP) in combination with Stein's shrinkage outperforms group LASSO for large block sizes. In this paper, we prove that, for a fixed block size and in the strong undersampling regime (i.e., having very few measurements compared to the ambient dimension), AMP cannot improve upon group LASSO, thereby complementing the results of Donoho et al.
