A new family of binary linear completely transitive (and, therefore, completely regular) codes is constructed. The covering radius of these codes is growing with the length of the code. In particular, for any integer r > 1, there exist two codes with d=3, covering radius r and length 2r(4r-1) and (2r+1)(4r+1), respectively. These new completely transitive codes induce, as coset graphs, a family of distance-transitive graphs of growing diameter.
