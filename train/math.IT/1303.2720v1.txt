In this paper, two low-complexity adaptive step size algorithms are investigated for blind adaptive beamforming. Both of them are used in a stochastic gradient (SG) algorithm, which employs the constrained constant modulus (CCM) criterion as the design approach. A brief analysis is given for illustrating their properties. Simulations are performed to compare the performances of the novel algorithms with other well-known methods. Results indicate that the proposed algorithms achieve superior performance, better convergence behavior and lower computational complexity in both stationary and non-stationary environments.
