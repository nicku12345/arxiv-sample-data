It was shown in a previous work that some blind methods can be made robust to channel order overmodeling by using the \ell_1 or \ell_p quasi-norms. However, no theoretical argument has been provided to support this statement. In this work, we study the robustness of subspace blind based methods using \ell_1 or \ell_p quasi-norms. For the \ell_1 norm, we provide the sufficient and necessary condition that the channel should satisfy in order to ensure its identifiability in the noise-less case. We then study its frequency of occurrence, and deduce the effect of channel parameters on the robustness of blind subspace methods using \ell_1 norms.
