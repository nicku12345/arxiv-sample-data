The remarkable promise of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels has motivated an intense research activity to characterize the theoretical and practical issues associated with the design of transmit (source) and receive (destination) processing matrices under different operating conditions. This activity was primarily focused on point-to-point (single-hop) communications but more recently there has been an extensive work on two-hop or multi-hop settings in which single or multiple relays are used to deliver the information from the source to the destination. The aim of this tutorial is to provide an up-to-date overview of the fundamental results and practical implementation issues of designing amplify-and-forward MIMO relay systems.
