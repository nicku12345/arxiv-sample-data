This paper presents an unusual view of interference wireless networks based on complex system thinking. To proceed with this analysis, a literature review of the different applications of complex systems is firstly presented to illustrate how such an approach can be used in a wide range of research topics, from economics to linguistics. Then the problem of quantifying the fundamental limits of wireless systems where the co-channel interference is the main limiting factor is described and hence contextualized in the perspective of complex systems. Specifically some possible internal and external pressures that the network elements may suffer are identified as, for example, queue stability, maximum packet loss rate and transmit power constraint. Besides, other important external factors such as mobility and incoming traffic are also pointed out. As a study case, a decentralized point-to-point interference network is described and several claims about the optimal design setting for different network states and under two mobility conditions, namely quasi-static and highly mobile, are stated based on results found in the literature. Using these claims as a background, the design of a robust adaptive algorithm that each network element should run is investigated.
