This paper proposes a new adaptive algorithm for the implementation of the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer. The proposed algorithm utilizes the set-membership filtering (SMF) framework and the reduced-rank joint iterative optimization (JIO) scheme. We develop a stochastic gradient (SG) based algorithm for the beamformer design. An effective time-varying bound is employed in the proposed method to adjust the step sizes, avoid the misadjustment and the risk of overbounding or underbounding. Simulations are performed to show the improved performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with existing full-rank and reduced-rank methods.
