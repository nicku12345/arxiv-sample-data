Full-rate space-time block codes (STBCs) achieve high spectral-efficiency by transmitting linear combinations of information symbols through every transmit antenna. However, the coefficients used for the linear combinations, if not chosen carefully, results in ({\em i}) large number of processor bits for the encoder and ({\em ii}) high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) values. In this work, we propose a new class of full-rate STBCs called Integer STBCs (ICs) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. A unique property of ICs is the presence of integer coefficients in the code structure which enables reduced numbers of processor bits for the encoder and lower PAPR values. We show that the reduction in the number of processor bits is significant for small MIMO channels, while the reduction in the PAPR is significant for large MIMO channels. We also highlight the advantages of the proposed codes in comparison with the well known full-rate algebraic STBCs.
