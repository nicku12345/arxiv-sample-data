Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are widely used in storage systems to protect against disk (node) failures. A node is said to have capacity l over some field \mathbb{F}, if it can store that amount of symbols of the field. An (n,k,l) MDS code uses n nodes of capacity l to store k information nodes. The MDS property guarantees the resiliency to any n-k node failures. An \emph{optimal bandwidth} (resp. \emph{optimal access}) MDS code communicates (resp. accesses) the minimum amount of data during the repair process of a single failed node. It was shown that this amount equals a fraction of 1/(n-k) of data stored in each node. In previous optimal bandwidth constructions, l scaled polynomially with k in codes with asymptotic rate <1. Moreover, in constructions with a constant number of parities, i.e. rate approaches 1, l is scaled exponentially w.r.t. k. In this paper, we focus on the later case of constant number of parities n-k=r, and ask the following question: Given the capacity of a node l what is the largest number of information disks k in an optimal bandwidth (resp. access) (k+r,k,l) MDS code. We give an upper bound for the general case, and two tight bounds in the special cases of two important families of codes. Moreover, the bounds show that in some cases optimal-bandwidth code has larger k than optimal-access code, and therefore these two measures are not equivalent.
