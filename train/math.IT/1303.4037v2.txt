Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based multi-carrier systems can support high data rate wireless transmission without the requirement of any extensive equalization and yet offer excellent immunity against fading and inter-symbol interference. But one of the major drawbacks of these systems is the large Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal which renders a straightforward implementation costly and inefficient. In this paper, a new PAPR reduction scheme is introduced where a number of sequences from the original data sequence is generated by changing the position of each symbol and the sequence with lowest PAPR is selected for transmission. A comparison of performance of this proposed technique with an existing PAPR reduction scheme, i.e., the Selective Mapping (SLM) is performed. It is shown that considerable reduction in PAPR along with higher throughput can be achieved at the expense of some additional computational complexity.
