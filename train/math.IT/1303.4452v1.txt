We consider bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) receiver performance improvement based on the concept of generalized mutual information (GMI). Increasing achievable rates of BICM receiver with GMI maximization by proper scaling of the log likelihood ratio (LLR) is investigated. While it has been shown in the literature that look-up table based LLR scaling functions matched to each specific transmission scenario may provide close to optimal solutions, this method is difficult to adapt to time-varying channel conditions. To solve this problem, an online adaptive scaling factor searching algorithm is developed. Uniform scaling factors are applied to LLRs from different bit channels of each data frame by maximizing an approximate GMI that characterizes the transmission conditions of current data frame. Numerical analysis on effective achievable rates as well as link level simulation of realistic mobile transmission scenarios indicate that the proposed method is simple yet effective.
