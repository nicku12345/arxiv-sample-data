The multiple-input multiple-output interference channel is considered with perfect channel information at the transmitters and single-user decoding receivers. With all transmissions restricted to single stream beamforming, we consider the problem of finding all Pareto optimal rate-tuples in the achievable rate region. The problem is cast as a rate profile optimization problem. Due to its nonconvexity, we resort to an alternating approach: For fixed receivers, optimal transmission is known. For fixed transmitters, we show that optimal receive beamforming is a solution to an inverse field of values problem. We prove the solution's stationarity and compare it with existing approaches.
