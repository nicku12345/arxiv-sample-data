This short note proves the \ell_2-\ell_1 instance optimality of a \ell_1/\ell_1 solver, i.e a variant of \emph{basis pursuit denoising} with a \ell_1 fidelity constraint, when applied to the estimation of sparse (or compressible) signals observed by sparsely corrupted compressive measurements. The approach simply combines two known results due to Y. Plan, R. Vershynin and E. Cand\`es.
