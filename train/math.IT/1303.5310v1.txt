In this paper, we contribute to the theoretical understanding, the design, and the performance evaluation of multi-source multi-relay network-coded cooperative diversity protocols. These protocols are useful to counteract the spectral inefficiency of repetition-based cooperation. We provide a general analytical framework for analysis and design of wireless networks using the Demodulate-and-Forward (DemF) protocol with binary Network Coding (NC) at the relays and Cooperative Maximal Ratio Combining (C-MRC) at the destination. Our system model encompasses an arbitrary number of relays which offer two cooperation levels: i) full-cooperative relays, which postpone the transmission of their own data frames to help the transmission of the sources via DemF relaying and binary NC; and ii) partial-cooperative relays, which exploit NC to transmit their own data frames along with the packets received from the sources. The relays can apply NC on different subsets of sources, which is shown to provide the sources with unequal diversity orders. Guidelines to choose the packets to be combined, i.e., the network code, to achieve the desired diversity order are given. Our study shows that partial-cooperative relays provide no contribution to the diversity order of the sources. Theoretical findings and design guidelines are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.
