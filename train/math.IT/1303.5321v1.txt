Conditions are derived on line-of-sight channels to ensure the feasibility of interference alignment. The conditions involve choosing only the spacing between two subcarriers of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme. The maximal degrees-of-freedom are achieved and even an upper bound on the sum-rate of interference alignment is approached arbitrarily closely.
