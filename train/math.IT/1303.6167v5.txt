This paper studies the second-order asymptotics of coding rates for the discrete memoryless multiple-access channel with a fixed target error probability. Using constant-composition random coding, coded time-sharing, and a variant of Hoeffding's combinatorial central limit theorem, an inner bound on the set of locally achievable second-order coding rates is given for each point on the boundary of the capacity region. It is shown that the inner bound for constant-composition random coding includes that recovered by i.i.d. random coding, and that the inclusion may be strict. The inner bound is extended to the Gaussian multiple-access channel via an increasingly fine quantization of the inputs.
