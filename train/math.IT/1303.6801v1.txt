In a distributed storage systems (DSS), regenerating codes are used to optimize bandwidth in the repair process of a failed node. To optimize other DSS parameters such as computation and disk I/O, Distributed Replication-based Simple Storage (Dress) Codes consisting of an inner Fractional Repetition (FR) code and an outer MDS code are commonly used. Thus constructing FR codes is an important research problem, and several constructions using graphs and designs have been proposed. In this paper, we present an algorithm for constructing the node-packet distribution matrix of FR codes and thus enumerate some FR codes up to a given number of nodes n. We also present algorithms for constructing regular graphs which give rise to FR codes.
