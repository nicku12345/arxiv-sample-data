A waveform channel is considered where the transmitted signal is corrupted by Wiener phase noise and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). A discrete-time channel model is introduced that is based on a multi-sample receiver. Tight lower bounds on the information rates achieved by the multi-sample receiver are computed by means of numerical simulations. The results show that oversampling at the receiver is beneficial for both strong and weak phase noise at high signal-to-noise ratios. The results are compared with results obtained when using other discrete-time models.
