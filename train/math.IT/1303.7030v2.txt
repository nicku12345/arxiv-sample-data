The impact of cognition on the energy efficiency of a downlink cellular system in which multiple relays assist the transmission of the base station is considered. The problem is motivated by the practical importance of relay-assisted solutions in mobile networks, such as LTE-A, in which cooperation among relays holds the promise of greatly improving the energy efficiency of the system. We study the fundamental tradeoff between the power consumption at the base station and the level of cooperation and cognition at the relay nodes. By distributing the same message to multiple relays, the base station consumes more power but it enables cooperation among the relays, thus making the transmission between relays to destination a multiuser cognitive channel. Cooperation among the relays allows for a reduction of the power used to transmit from the relays to the end users due to interference management and the coherent combining gains. These gain are present even in the case of partial or unidirectional transmitter cooperation, which is the case in cognitive channels such as the cognitive interference channel and the interference channel with a cognitive relay. We therefore address the problem of determining the optimal level of cooperation at the relays which results in the smallest total power consumption when accounting for the power reduction due to cognition. A practical design examples and numerical simulation are presented in a companion paper (part II).
