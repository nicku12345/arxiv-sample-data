Consider a simple two-way relaying channel where two single-antenna sources exchange information via a multiple-antenna relay. To such a scenario, all the existing works which can achieve full diversity order are based on the antenna/relay selection, where the difficulty to design the beamforming lies in the fact that a single beamformer needs to serve two destinations. In this paper, we propose a new full-diversity beamforming scheme which ensures that the relay signals are coherently combined at both destinations. Both analytical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate that this proposed scheme can outperform the existing one based on the antenna selection.
