A new precoding-based intersession network coding (NC) scheme has recently been proposed, which applies the interference alignment technique, originally devised for wireless interference channels, to the 3-unicast problem of directed acyclic networks. The main result of this work is a graph-theoretic characterization of the feasibility of the 3-unicast interference alignment scheme. To that end, we first investigate several key relationships between the point-to-point network channel gains and the underlying graph structure. Such relationships turn out to be critical when characterizing graph-theoretically the feasibility of precoding-based solutions.
