In this work we seek to characterise the performance of spatial modulation (SM) and spatial multiplexing (SMX) with an experimental test bed. Two National Instruments (NI)-PXIe devices are used for the system testing, one for the transmitter and one for the receiver. The digital signal processing that formats the information data in preparation of transmission is described along with the digital signal processing that recovers the information data. In addition, the hardware limitations of the system are also analysed. The average bit error ratio (ABER) of the system is validated through both theoretical analysis and simulation results for SM and SMX under line of sight (LoS) channel conditions.
