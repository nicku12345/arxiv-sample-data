An algorithm for computing the nonlinearity of a Boolean function from its algebraic normal form (ANF) is proposed. By generalizing the expression of the weight of a Boolean function in terms of its ANF coefficients, a formulation of the distances to linear functions is obtained. The special structure of these distances can be exploited to reduce the task of nonlinearity computation to solving an associated binary integer programming problem. The proposed algorithm can be used in cases where applying the Fast Walsh transform is infeasible, typically when the number of input variables exceeds 40.
