SD codes are erasure codes that address the mixed failure mode of current RAID systems. Rather than dedicate entire disks to erasure coding, as done in RAID-5, RAID-6 and Reed-Solomon coding, an SD code dedicates entire disks, plus individual sectors to erasure coding. The code then tolerates combinations of disk and sector errors, rather than solely disk errors. It is been an open problem to construct general codes that have the SD property, and previous work has relied on Monte Carlo searches. In this paper, we present two general constructions that address the cases with one disk and two sectors, and two disks and two sectors. Additionally, we make an observation about shortening SD codes that allows us to prune Monte Carlo searches.
