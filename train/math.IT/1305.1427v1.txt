This is a companion technical report of the main manuscript "Physical-Layer Multicasting by Stochastic Transmit Beamforming and Alamouti Space-Time Coding". The report serves to give detailed derivations of the achievable rate functions encountered in the main manuscript, which are too long to be included in the latter. In addition, more simulation results are presented to verify the viability of the multicast schemes developed in the main manuscript.
