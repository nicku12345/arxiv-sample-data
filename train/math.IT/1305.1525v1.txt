We consider downlink precoding in a frequency-selective multi-user Massive MIMO system with highly efficient but non-linear power amplifiers at the base station (BS). A low-complexity precoding algorithm is proposed, which generates constant-envelope (CE) signals at each BS antenna. To achieve a desired per-user information rate, the extra total transmit power required under the per-antenna CE constraint when compared to the commonly used less stringent total average transmit power constraint, is small.
