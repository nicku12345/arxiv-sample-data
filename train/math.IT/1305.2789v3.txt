This paper considers the recovery of continuous signals in infinite dimensional spaces from the magnitude of their frequency samples. It proposes a sampling scheme which involves a combination of oversampling and modulations with complex exponentials. Sufficient conditions are given such that almost every signal with compact support can be reconstructed up to a unimodular constant using only its magnitude samples in the frequency domain. Finally it is shown that an average sampling rate of four times the Nyquist rate is enough to reconstruct almost every time-limited signal.
