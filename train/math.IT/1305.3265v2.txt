We investigate how to exploit intermittent feedback for interference management. Focusing on the two-user linear deterministic interference channel, we completely characterize the capacity region. We find that the characterization only depends on the forward channel parameters and the marginal probability distribution of each feedback link. The scheme we propose makes use of block Markov encoding and quantize-map-and-forward at the transmitters, and backward decoding at the receivers. Matching outer bounds are derived based on novel genie-aided techniques. As a consequence, the perfect-feedback capacity can be achieved once the two feedback links are active with large enough probabilities.
