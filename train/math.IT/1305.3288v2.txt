This paper studies the notion of computational entropy. Using techniques from convex optimization, we investigate the following problems: (a) Can we derandomize the computational entropy? More precisely, for the computational entropy, what is the real difference in security defined using the three important classes of circuits: deterministic boolean, deterministic real valued, or (the most powerful) randomized ones? (b) How large the difference in the computational entropy for an unbounded versus efficient adversary can be? (c) Can we obtain useful, simpler characterizations for the computational entropy?
