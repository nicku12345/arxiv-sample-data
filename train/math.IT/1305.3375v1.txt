This paper focuses on the problem of L-channel quadratic Gaussian multiple description (MD) coding. We recently introduced a new encoding scheme in [1] for general L-channel MD problem, based on a technique called `Combinatorial Message Sharing' (CMS), where every subset of the descriptions shares a distinct common message. The new achievable region subsumes the most well known region for the general problem, due to Venkataramani, Kramer and Goyal (VKG) [2]. Moreover, we showed in [3] that the new scheme provides a strict improvement of the achievable region for any source and distortion measures for which some 2-description subset is such that the Zhang and Berger (ZB) scheme achieves points outside the El-Gamal and Cover (EC) region. In this paper, we show a more surprising result: CMS outperforms VKG for a general class of sources and distortion measures, which includes scenarios where for all 2-description subsets, the ZB and EC regions coincide. In particular, we show that CMS strictly extends VKG region, for the L-channel quadratic Gaussian MD problem for all L\geq3, despite the fact that the EC region is complete for the corresponding 2-descriptions problem. Using the encoding principles derived, we show that the CMS scheme achieves the complete rate-distortion region for several asymmetric cross-sections of the L-channel quadratic Gaussian MD problem, which have not been considered earlier.
