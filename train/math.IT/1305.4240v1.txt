Most previous researches on bidirectional relay selection (RS) typically assume perfect channel state information (CSI). However, outdated CSI, caused by the the time-variation of channel, cannot be ignored in the practical system, and it will deteriorate the performance. In this paper, the effect of outdated CSI on the performance of bidirectional amplify-and-forward RS is investigated. The optimal single RS scheme in minimizing the symbol error rate (SER) is revised by incorporating the outdated channels. The analytical expressions of end-to-end signal to noise ratio (SNR) and symbol error rate (SER) are derived in a closed-form, along with the asymptotic SER expression in high SNR. All the analytical expressions are verified by the Monte-Carlo simulations. The analytical and the simulation results reveal that once CSI is outdated, the diversity order degrades to one from full diversity. Furthermore, a multiple RS scheme is proposed and verified that this scheme is a feasible solution to compensate the diversity loss caused by outdated CSI.
