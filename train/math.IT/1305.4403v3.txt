Relay networks aid in increasing the rate of communication from source to destination. However, the capacity of even a three-terminal relay channel is an open problem. In this work, we propose a new lower bound for the capacity of the three-terminal relay channel with destination-to-source feedback in the presence of correlated noise. Our lower bound improves on the existing bounds in the literature. We then extend our lower bound to general relay network configurations using an arbitrary number of filter-and-forward relay nodes. Such network configurations are common in many multi-hop communication systems where the intermediate nodes can only perform minimal processing due to limited computational power. Simulation results show that significant improvements in the achievable rate can be obtained through our approach. We next derive a coding strategy (optimized using post processed signal-to-noise ratio as a criterion) for the three-terminal relay channel with noisy channel output feedback for two transmissions. This coding scheme can be used in conjunction with open-loop codes for applications like automatic repeat request (ARQ) or hybrid-ARQ.
