In this paper, we study the problem of simulating a DMC channel from another DMC channel under an average-case and an exact model. We present several achievability and infeasibility results, with tight characterizations in special cases. In particular for the exact model, we fully characterize when a BSC channel can be simulated from a BEC channel when there is no shared randomness. We also provide infeasibility and achievability results for simulation of a binary channel from another binary channel in the case of no shared randomness. To do this, we use properties of R\'enyi capacity of a given order. We also introduce a notion of "channel diameter" which is shown to be additive and satisfy a data processing inequality.
