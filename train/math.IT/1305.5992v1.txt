We study the problem of strong coordination in a three-terminal line network, in which agents use common randomness and communicate over a line network to ensure that their actions follow a prescribed behavior, modeled by a target joint distribution of actions. We provide inner and outer bounds to the coordination capacity region, and show that these bounds are partially optimal. We leverage this characterization to develop insight into the interplay between communication and coordination. Specifically, we show that common randomness helps to achieve optimal communication rates between agents, and that matching the network topology to the behavior structure may reduce inter-agent communication rates.
