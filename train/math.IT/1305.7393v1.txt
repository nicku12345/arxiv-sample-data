The main objective of this paper is to compare block transmission system performance analytically for Code Divisional Multiple Access (CDMA) modulations in Generalized Multicarrier environment against linear modulation techniques for both single user and multiuser. The effectivity of GMC-CDMA for multiuser will also be judged for different Direct Sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA) such as MC-CDMA, MC-DS-CDMA, MC-SS-CDMA. The analytical comparison will be in terms of computing probability of bit error for frequency selective and slow flat fading channels for different modulation techniques. The Bit Error Rate should be a good indication for of the performance. The tolerance characteristics of DS-CDMA in frequency-selective channels and MC-CDMA in flat fading channels will be shown analytically and improved capacity and Bit Error Rate performance will be derived for Block Spread Multiuser Multicarrier by relying block symbol spreading and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations. GMC-CDMA should give guaranteed symbol recovery regardless of channel limitations.
