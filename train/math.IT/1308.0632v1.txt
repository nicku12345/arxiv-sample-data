In this paper, we use linear codes to study zero-error Slepian-Wolf coding of a set of sources with deviation symmetry, where the sources are generalization of the Hamming sources over an arbitrary field. We extend our previous codes, Generalized Hamming Codes for Multiple Sources, to Matrix Partition Codes and use the latter to efficiently compress the target sources. We further show that every perfect or linear-optimal code is a Matrix Partition Code. We also present some conditions when Matrix Partition Codes are perfect and/or linear-optimal. Detail discussions of Matrix Partition Codes on Hamming sources are given at last as examples.
