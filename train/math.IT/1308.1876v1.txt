Cooperative relay systems have become an active area of research during recent years since they help cellular networks to enhance data rate and coverage. In this paper we develop a method to jointly optimize precoding matrices for amplify-and-forward relay station and base station. Our objective is to increase max-min SINR fairness within co-channel users in a cell. The main achievement of this work is avoiding any tedious alternating optimization for joint design of RS/BS precoders, in order to save complexity. Moreover, no convex solver is required in this method. RS precoding is done by transforming the underlying non-convex problem into a system of nonlinear equations which is then solved using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. This method for RS precoder design is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum. For the BS precoder a low-complexity iterative method is proposed. The efficiency of the joint optimization method is verified by simulations.
