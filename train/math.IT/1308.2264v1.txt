In this paper, we analyze the error performance of decode and forward (DF) and amplify and forward (AF) multi-way relay networks (MWRN). We consider a MWRN with pair-wise data exchange protocol using binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels. We quantify the possible error events in an L-user DF or AF MWRN and derive accurate asymptotic bounds on the probability for the general case that a user incorrectly decodes the messages of exactly k (k\in[1,L-1]) users. We show that at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the higher order error events (k\geq 3) are less probable in AF MWRN, but all error events are equally probable in a DF MWRN. We derive the average BER of a user in a DF or AF MWRN in both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels under high SNR conditions. Simulation results validate the correctness of the derived expressions. Our results show that at medium to high SNR, DF MWRN provides better error performance than AF MWRN in AWGN channels even with a large number of users (for example, L=100). Whereas, AF MWRN outperforms DF MWRN in Rayleigh fading channels even for much smaller number of users (for example, L > 10).
