The classic MIMO wiretap channel comprises a passive eavesdropper that attempts to intercept communications between an authorized transmitter-receiver pair, each node being equipped with multiple antennas. In a dynamic network, it is imperative that the presence of an eavesdropper be determined before the transmitter can deploy robust secrecyencoding schemes as a countermeasure. This is a difficult task in general, since by definition the eavesdropper is passive and never transmits. In this work we adopt a method that allows the legitimate nodes to detect the passive eavesdropper from the local oscillator power that is inadvertently leaked from its RF front end. We examine the performance of non-coherent energy detection and optimal coherent detection, followed by composite GLRT detection methods that account for unknown parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed detectors allow the legitimate nodes to increase the secrecy rate of the MIMO wiretap channel.
