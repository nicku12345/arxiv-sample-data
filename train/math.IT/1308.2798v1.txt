In this paper, we consider the characterization of the bentness of quadratic Boolean functions of the form f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{\frac{m}{2}-1} Tr^n_1(c_ix^{1+2^{ei}})+ Tr_1^{n/2}(c_{m/2}x^{1+2^{n/2}}) , where n=me, m is even and c_i\in GF(2^e). For a general m, it is difficult to determine the bentness of these functions. We present the bentness of quadratic Boolean function for two cases: m=2^vp^r and m=2^vpq, where p and q are two distinct primes. Further, we give the enumeration of quadratic bent functions for the case m=2^vpq.
