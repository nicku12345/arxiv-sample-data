An efficient analog network coding transmission protocol is proposed in this letter for a MIMO two way cellular network. Block signal alignment is first proposed to null the inter-user interference for multi-antenna users, which makes the dimensions of aligned space larger compared with the existing signal alignment. Two algorithms are developed to jointly design the precoding matrices at the relay and BS for outage optimization. Especially, the last algorithm is designed to maximize the effective channel gain to the effective noise gain ratio. The performance of this transmission protocol is also verified by simulations.
