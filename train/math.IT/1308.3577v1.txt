There have been various constructions of classical codes from polynomial valuations in literature \cite{ARC04, LNX01,LX04,XF04,XL00}. In this paper, we present a construction of classical codes based on polynomial construction again. One of the features of this construction is that not only the classical codes arisen from the construction have good parameters, but also quantum codes with reasonably good parameters can be produced from these classical codes. In particular, some new quantum codes are constructed (see Examples \ref{5.5} and \ref{5.6}).
