In this paper we continue to study a question proposed by Babadi and Tarokh \cite{ba2} on the mysterious randomness of Gold sequences. Upon improving their result, we establish the randomness of product of pseudorandom matrices formed from two linear block codes with respect to the empirical spectral distribution, if the dual distance of both codes is at least 5, hence providing an affirmative answer to the question.
