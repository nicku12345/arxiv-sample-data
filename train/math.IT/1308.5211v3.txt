In this paper, we propose locally repairable codes (LRCs) with optimal minimum distance for distributed storage systems (DSS). A two-layer encoding structure is employed to ensure data reconstruction and the designated repair locality. The data is first encoded in the first layer by any existing maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, and then the encoded symbols are divided into non-overlapping groups and encoded by an MDS array code in the second layer. The encoding in the second layer provides enough redundancy for local repair, while the overall code performs recovery of the data based on redundancy from both layers. Our codes can be constructed over a finite field with size growing linearly with the total number of nodes in the DSS, and facilitate efficient degraded reads.
