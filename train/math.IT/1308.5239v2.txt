Locally decodable channel codes form a special class of error-correcting codes with the property that the decoder is able to reconstruct any bit of the input message from querying only a few bits of a noisy codeword. It is well known that such codes require significantly more redundancy (in particular have vanishing rate) compared to their non-local counterparts. In this paper, we define a dual problem, i.e. locally decodable source codes (LDSC). We consider both almost lossless (block error) and lossy (bit error) cases. In almost lossless case, we show that optimal compression (to entropy) is possible with O(log n) queries to compressed string by the decompressor. We also show the following converse bounds: 1) linear LDSC cannot achieve any rate below one, with a bounded number of queries, 2) rate of any source coding with linear decoder (not necessarily local) in one, 3) for 2 queries, any code construction cannot have a rate below one. In lossy case, we show that any rate above rate distortion is achievable with a bounded number of queries. We also show that, rate distortion is achievable with any scaling number of queries. We provide an achievability bound in the finite block-length regime and compare it with the existing bounds in succinct data structures literature.
