The purpose of this note is to establish a new generalized Dictionary-Restricted Isometry Property (D-RIP) sparsity bound constant for compressed sensing.   For fulfilling D-RIP, the constant \delta_k is used in the definition: (1 -\delta_k)\|D v\|_2^2 \le \|\Phi D v\|_2^2 \le (1 + \delta_k)\|D v\|^2. We prove that signals with k-sparse D-representation can be reconstructed if \delta_{2k} < \frac{2}3.   The approach in this note can be extended to obtain other D-RIP bounds (i.e., \delta_{tk}).
