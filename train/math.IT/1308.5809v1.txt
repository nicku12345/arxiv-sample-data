Several practical multi-user multi-carrier communication systems are characterized by a multi-carrier interference channel system model where the interference is treated as noise. For these systems, spectrum optimization is a promising means to mitigate interference. This however corresponds to a challenging nonconvex optimization problem. Existing iterative convex approximation (ICA) methods consist in solving a series of improving convex approximations and are typically implemented in a per-user iterative approach. However they do not take this typical iterative implementation into account in their design. This paper proposes a novel class of iterative approximation methods that focuses explicitly on the per-user iterative implementation, which allows to relax the problem significantly, dropping joint convexity and even convexity requirements for the approximations. A systematic design framework is proposed to construct instances of this novel class, where several new iterative approximation methods are developed with improved per-user convex and nonconvex approximations that are both tighter and simpler to solve (in closed-form). As a result, these novel methods display a much faster convergence speed and require a significantly lower computational cost. Furthermore, a majority of the proposed methods can tackle the issue of getting stuck in bad locally optimal solutions, and hence improve solution quality compared to existing ICA methods.
