Let m\geq 3 be an odd integer and p be an odd prime. % with p-1=2^rh, where h is an odd integer.   In this paper, many classes of three-weight cyclic codes over \mathbb{F}_{p} are presented via an examination of the condition for the cyclic codes \mathcal{C}_{(1,d)} and \mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}, which have parity-check polynomials m_1(x)m_d(x) and m_1(x)m_e(x) respectively, to have the same weight distribution, where m_i(x) is the minimal polynomial of \pi^{-i} over \mathbb{F}_{p} for a primitive element \pi of \mathbb{F}_{p^m}. %For p=3, the duals of five classes of the proposed cyclic codes are optimal in the sense that they meet certain bounds on linear codes. Furthermore, for p\equiv 3 \pmod{4} and positive integers e such that there exist integers k with \gcd(m,k)=1 and \tau\in\{0,1,\cdots, m-1\} satisfying (p^k+1)\cdot e\equiv 2 p^{\tau}\pmod{p^m-1}, the value distributions of the two exponential sums T(a,b)=\sum\limits_{x\in \mathbb{F}_{p^m}}\omega^{\Tr(ax+bx^e)} and  S(a,b,c)=\sum\limits_{x\in \mathbb{F}_{p^m}}\omega^{\Tr(ax+bx^e+cx^s)},  where s=(p^m-1)/2, are settled. As an application, the value distribution of S(a,b,c) is utilized to investigate the weight distribution of the cyclic codes \mathcal{C}_{(1,e,s)} with parity-check polynomial m_1(x)m_e(x)m_s(x). In the case of p=3 and even e satisfying the above condition, the duals of the cyclic codes \mathcal{C}_{(1,e,s)} have the optimal minimum distance.
