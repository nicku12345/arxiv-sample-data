In a MIMO radar network the multiple transmit elements may emit waveforms that differ on power and bandwidth. In this paper, we are asking, given that these two resources are limited, what is the optimal power, optimal bandwidth and optimal joint power and bandwidth allocation for best localization of multiple targets. The well known Cr\'amer-Rao lower bound for target localization accuracy is used as a figure of merit and approximate solutions are found by minimizing a sequence of convex problems. Their quality is assessed through extensive numerical simulations and with the help of a lower-bound on the true solution. Simulations results reveal that bandwidth allocation policies have a definitely stronger impact on performance than power.
