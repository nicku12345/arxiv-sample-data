Two-direction multiscaling functions \boldsymbol{\phi} and two-direction multiwavelets \boldsymbol{\psi} associated with \boldsymbol{\phi} are more general and more flexible setting than one-direction multiscaling functions and multiwavelets. In this paper, we investigate how to find and normalize point values and those of derivatives of the two-direction multiscaling functions \boldsymbol{\phi} and multiwavelets \boldsymbol{\psi}. %associated with \boldsymbol{\phi}. For finding point values, we investigate the eigenvalue approach. For normalization, we investigate the normalizing conditions for them by normalizing the zeroth continuous moment of \boldsymbol{\phi}. Examples for illustrating the general theory are given.
