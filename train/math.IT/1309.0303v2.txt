The stepped-frequency (SF) waveform is an effective way to achieve high range resolution (HRR) in modern radars. In this paper, we determine some fundamental limits of SF waveforms on ambiguity, stability and accuracy of stable targets profiling, and velocity compensation accuracy of moving targets. The investigation shows that via using the information contained in both phase and envelop of the echo signal, the radar can achieve HRR profiles without ambiguity under a looser criterion, and can compensate the range shift caused by targets' radial velocity. The results of this paper can help the SF waveform design and the processing algorithm development for HRR profiling and velocity compensation.
