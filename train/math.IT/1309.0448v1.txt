This work considers distributed sensing and transmission of sporadic random samples. Lower bounds are derived for the reconstruction error of a single normally or uniformly-distributed finite-dimensional vector imperfectly measured by a network of sensors and transmitted with finite energy to a common receiver via an additive white Gaussian noise asynchronous multiple-access channel. Transmission makes use of a perfect causal feedback link to the encoder connected to each sensor. A retransmission protocol inspired by the classical scheme in [1] applied to the transmission of single and bi-variate analog samples analyzed in [2] and [3] is extended to the more general network scenario, for which asymptotic upper-bounds on the reconstruction error are provided. Both the upper and lower-bounds show that collaboration can be achieved through energy accumulation under certain circumstances. In order to investigate the practical performance of the proposed retransmission protocol we provide a numerical evaluation of the upper-bounds in the non-asymptotic energy regime using low-order quantization in the sensors. The latter includes a minor modification of the protocol to improve reconstruction fidelity. Numerical results show that an increase in the size of the network brings benefit in terms of performance, but that the gain in terms of energy efficiency diminishes quickly at finite energies due to a non-coherent combining loss.
