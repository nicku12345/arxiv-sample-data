In this paper, we derive a performance comparison between two training-based schemes for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. The two schemes are thetime-division multiplexing scheme and the recently proposed data-dependent superimposed pilot scheme. For both schemes, a closed-form expressions for the Bit Error Rate (BER) is provided. We also determine, for both schemes, the optimal allocation of power between pilot and data that minimizes the BER.
