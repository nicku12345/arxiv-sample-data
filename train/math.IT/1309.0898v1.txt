We consider the two-hop interference channel (IC), which consists of two source-destination pairs communicating with each other via two relays. We analyze the degrees of freedom (DoF) of this network when the relays are restricted to perform linear schemes, and the channel gains are constant (i.e., slow fading). We show that, somewhat surprisingly, by using vector-linear strategies at the relays, it is possible to achieve 4/3 sum-DoF when the channel gains are real. The key achievability idea is to alternate relaying coefficients across time, to create different end-to-end interference structures (or topologies) at different times. Although each of these topologies has only 1 sum-DoF, we manage to achieve 4/3 by coding across them. Furthermore, we develop a novel outer bound that matches our achievability, hence characterizing the sum-DoF of two-hop interference channels with linear schemes. As for the case of complex channel gains, we characterize the sum-DoF with linear schemes to be 5/3. We also generalize the results to the multi-antenna setting, characterizing the sum-DoF with linear schemes to be 2M-1/3 (for complex channel gains), where M is the number of antennas at each node.
