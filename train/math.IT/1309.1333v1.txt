The stable throughput region of the two-user interference channel is investigated here. First, the stability region for the general case is characterized. Second, we study the cases where the receivers treat interference as noise or perform successive interference cancelation. Finally, we provide conditions for the convexity/concavity of the stability region and for which a certain interference management strategy leads to broader stability region.
