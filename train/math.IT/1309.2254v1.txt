In this paper, an algorithm for construction of multiple sets of two dimensional (2D) or matrix unipolar (optical) orthogonal codes has been proposed. Representations of these 2D codes in difference of positions representation (DoPR) have also been discussed along-with conventional weighted positions representation (WPR) of the code. This paper also proposes less complex methods for calculation of auto-correlation as well as cross-correlation constraints within set of matrix codes. The multiple sets of matrix codes provide flexibility for selection of optical orthogonal codes set in wavelength-hopping time-spreading (WHTS) optical code division multiple access (CDMA) system.
