We propose a low complexity list successive cancellation (LCLSC) decoding algorithm to reduce complexity of traditional list successive cancellation (LSC) decoding of polar codes while trying to maintain the LSC decoding performance at the same time. By defining two thresholds, namely "likelihood ratio (LR) threshold" and "Bhattacharyya parameter threshold", we classify the reliability of each received information bit and the quality of each bit channel. Based on this classification, we implement successive cancellation (SC) decoding instead of LSC decoding when the information bits from "bad" subchannels are received reliably and further attempt to skip LSC decoding for the rest information bits in order to achieve a lower complexity compared to full LSC decoding. Simulation results show that the complexity of LCLSC decoding is much lower than LSC decoding and can be close to that of SC decoding, especially in low code rate regions.
