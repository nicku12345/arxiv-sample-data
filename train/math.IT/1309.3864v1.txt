In this paper, we consider designing low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded modulation systems to achieve unequal error protection (UEP). We propose a new UEP approach by partial superposition transmission called UEP-by-PST. In the UEP-by-PST system, the information sequence is distinguished as two parts, the more important data (MID) and the less important data (LID), both of which are coded with LDPC codes. The codeword that corresponds to the MID is superimposed on the codeword that corresponds to the LID. The system performance can be analyzed by using discretized density evolution. Also proposed in this paper is a criterion from a practical point of view to compare the efficiencies of different UEP approaches. Numerical results show that, over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, 1) UEP-by-PST provides higher coding gain for the MID compared with the traditional equal error protection (EEP) approach, but with negligible performance loss for the LID; 2) UEP-by-PST is more efficient with the proposed practical criterion than the UEP approach in the digital video broadcasting (DVB) system.
