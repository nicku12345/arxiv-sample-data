We consider a heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet) where a macrocell tier with a large antenna array base station (BS) is overlaid with a dense tier of small cells (SCs). We investigate the potential benefits of incorporating a massive MIMO BS in a TDD-based HetNet and we provide analytical expressions for the coverage probability and the area spectral efficiency using stochastic geometry. The duplexing mode in which SCs should operate during uplink macrocell transmissions is optimized. Furthermore, we consider a reverse TDD scheme, in which the massive MIMO BS can estimate the SC interference covariance matrix. Our results suggest that significant throughput improvement can be achieved by exploiting interference nulling and implicit coordination across the tiers due to flexible and asymmetric TDD operation.
