For a singular and symmetric discrete memoryless channel with positive dispersion, the third-order term in the normal approximation is shown to be upper bounded by a constant. This finding completes the characterization of the third-order term for symmetric discrete memoryless channels. The proof method is extended to asymmetric and singular channels with constant composition codes, and its connection to existing results, as well as its limitation in the error exponents regime, are discussed.
