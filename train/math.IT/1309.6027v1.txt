In this letter, we consider a large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where the receiver should harvest energy from the transmitter by wireless power transfer to support its wireless information transmission. The energy beamforming in the large-scale MIMO system is utilized to address the challenging problem of long-distance wireless power transfer. Furthermore, considering the limitation of the power in such a system, this letter focuses on the maximization of the energy efficiency of information transmission (bit per Joule) while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, i.e. delay constraint, by jointly optimizing transfer duration and transmit power. By solving the optimization problem, we derive an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
