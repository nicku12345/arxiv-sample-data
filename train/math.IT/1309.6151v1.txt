A design flow for {\Delta}{\Sigma} modulators is illustrated, allowing quantization noise to be shaped according to an arbitrary weighting profile. Being based on FIR NTFs, possibly with high order, the flow is best suited for digital architectures. The work builds on a recent proposal where the modulator is matched to the reconstruction filter, showing that this type of optimization can benefit a wide range of applications where noise (including in-band noise) is known to have a different impact at different frequencies. The design of a multiband modulator, a modulator avoiding DC noise, and an audio modulator capable of distributing quantization artifacts according to a psychoacoustic model are discussed as examples. A software toolbox is provided as a general design aid and to replicate the proposed results.
