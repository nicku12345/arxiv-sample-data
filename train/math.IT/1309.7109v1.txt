We present a novel class of divergences induced by a smooth convex function called total Jensen divergences. Those total Jensen divergences are invariant by construction to rotations, a feature yielding regularization of ordinary Jensen divergences by a conformal factor. We analyze the relationships between this novel class of total Jensen divergences and the recently introduced total Bregman divergences. We then proceed by defining the total Jensen centroids as average distortion minimizers, and study their robustness performance to outliers. Finally, we prove that the k-means++ initialization that bypasses explicit centroid computations is good enough in practice to guarantee probabilistically a constant approximation factor to the optimal k-means clustering.
