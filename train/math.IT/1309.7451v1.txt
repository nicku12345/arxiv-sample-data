In this paper, we propose opportunistic jammer selection in a wireless security system for increasing the secure degrees of freedom (DoF) between a transmitter and a legitimate receiver (say, Alice and Bob). There is a jammer group consisting of S jammers among which Bob selects K jammers. The selected jammers transmit independent and identically distributed Gaussian signals to hinder the eavesdropper (Eve). Since the channels of Bob and Eve are independent, we can select the jammers whose jamming channels are aligned at Bob, but not at Eve. As a result, Eve cannot obtain any DoF unless it has more than KN_j receive antennas, where N_j is the number of jammer's transmit antenna each, and hence KN_j can be regarded as defensible dimensions against Eve. For the jamming signal alignment at Bob, we propose two opportunistic jammer selection schemes and find the scaling law of the required number of jammers for target secure DoF by a geometrical interpretation of the received signals.
