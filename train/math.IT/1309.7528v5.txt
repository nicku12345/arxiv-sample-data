We study finite-length bounds for source coding with side information for Markov sources and channel coding for channels with conditional Markovian additive noise. For this purpose, we propose two criteria for finite-length bounds. One is the asymptotic optimality and the other is the efficient computability of the bound. Then, we derive finite-length upper and lower bounds for coding length in both settings so that their computational complexity is efficient. To discuss the first criterion, we derive the large deviation bounds, the moderate deviation bounds, and second order bounds for these two topics, and show that these finite-length bounds achieves the asymptotic optimality in these senses. For this discussion, we introduce several kinds of information measure for transition matrices.
