The determination of the cross correlation between an m-sequence and its decimated sequence has been a long-standing research problem. Considering a ternary m-sequence of period 3^{3r}-1, we determine the cross correlation distribution for decimations d=3^{r}+2 and d=3^{2r}+2, where \gcd(r,3)=1. Meanwhile, for a binary m-sequence of period 2^{2lm}-1, we make an initial investigation for the decimation d=\frac{2^{2lm}-1}{2^{m}+1}+2^{s}, where l \ge 2 is even and 0 \le s \le 2m-1. It is shown that the cross correlation takes at least four values. Furthermore, we confirm the validity of two famous conjectures due to Sarwate et al. and Helleseth in this case.
