The aim of this paper is to study the performance of some coding schemes recently proposed for updating the TC channel coding standard for space applications, in the presence of jamming. Besides low-density parity-check codes, that appear as the most eligible candidates, we also consider other solutions based on parallel turbo codes and extended BCH codes. We show that all these schemes offer very good performance, which approaches the theoretical limits achievable.
