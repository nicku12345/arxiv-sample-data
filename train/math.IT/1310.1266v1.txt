Compressed sensing (CS) is an innovative technique allowing to represent signals through a small number of their linear projections. Hence, CS can be thought of as a natural candidate for acquisition of multidimensional signals, as the amount of data acquired and processed by conventional sensors could create problems in terms of computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a framework for the acquisition and reconstruction of multidimensional correlated signals. The approach is general and can be applied to D dimensional signals, even if the algorithms we propose to practically implement such architectures apply to 2-D and 3-D signals. The proposed architectures employ iterative local signal reconstruction based on a hybrid transform/prediction correlation model, coupled with a proper initialization strategy.
