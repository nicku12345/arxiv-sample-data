In this paper we study energy efficient joint power allocation and beamforming for coordinated multicell multiuser downlink systems. The considered optimization problem is in a non-convex fractional form and hard to tackle. We propose to first transform the original problem into an equivalent optimization problem in a parametric subtractive form, by which we reach its solution through a two-layer optimization scheme. The outer layer only involves one-dimension search for the energy efficiency parameter which can be addressed using the bi-section search, the key issue lies in the inner layer where a non-fractional sub-problem needs to tackle. By exploiting the relationship between the user rate and the mean square error, we then develop an iterative algorithm to solve it. The convergence of this algorithm is proved and the solution is further derived in closed-form. Our analysis also shows that the proposed algorithm can be implemented in parallel with reasonable complexity. Numerical results illustrate that our algorithm has a fast convergence and achieves near-optimal energy efficiency. It is also observed that at the low transmit power region, our solution almost achieves the optimal sum rate and the optimal energy efficiency simultaneously; while at the middle-high transmit power region, a certain sum rate loss is suffered in order to guarantee the energy efficiency.
