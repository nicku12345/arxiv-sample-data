The theory of group lifting structures is applied to linear phase lifting factorizations for the two nontrivial classes of two-channel linear phase perfect reconstruction filter banks, the whole- and half-sample symmetric classes. Group lifting structures defined for the reversible and irreversible classes of whole- and half-sample symmetric filter banks are shown to satisfy the hypotheses of the uniqueness theorem for group lifting structures. It follows that linear phase group lifting factorizations of whole- and half-sample symmetric filter banks are therefore independent of the factorization methods used to construct them. These results cover the specification of whole-sample symmetric filter banks in the ISO/IEC JPEG 2000 image coding standard.
