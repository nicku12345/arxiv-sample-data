This paper investigates a source coding problem in which two terminals communicating through a relay wish to estimate one another's source within some distortion constraint. The relay has access to side information that is correlated with the sources. Two different schemes based on the order of communication, \emph{distributed source coding/delivery} and \emph{two cascaded rounds}, are proposed and inner and outer bounds for the resulting rate-distortion regions are provided. Examples are provided to show that neither rate-distortion region includes the other one.
