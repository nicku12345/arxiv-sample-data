As storage systems grow in size, device failures happen more frequently than ever before. Given the commodity nature of hard drives employed, a storage system needs to tolerate a certain number of disk failures while maintaining data integrity, and to recover lost data with minimal interference to normal disk I/O operations. RAID-6, which can tolerate up to two disk failures with the minimum redundancy, is becoming widespread. However, traditional RAID-6 codes suffer from high disk I/O overhead during recovery. In this paper, we propose a new family of RAID-6 codes, the Minimum Disk I/O Repairable (MDR) codes, which achieve the optimal disk I/O overhead for single failure recoveries. Moreover, we show that MDR codes can be encoded with the minimum number of bit-wise XOR operations. Simulation results show that MDR codes help to save about half of disk read operations than traditional RAID-6 codes, and thus can reduce the recovery time by up to 40%.
