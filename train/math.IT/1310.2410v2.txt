In the context of compressed sensing, the nonconvex \ell_q minimization with 0<q<1 has been studied in recent years. In this paper, by generalizing the sharp bound for \ell_1 minimization of Cai and Zhang, we show that the condition \delta_{(s^q+1)k}<\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{s^{q-2}+1}} in terms of \emph{restricted isometry constant (RIC)} can guarantee the exact recovery of k-sparse signals in noiseless case and the stable recovery of approximately k-sparse signals in noisy case by \ell_q minimization. This result is more general than the sharp bound for \ell_1 minimization when the order of RIC is greater than 2k and illustrates the fact that a better approximation to \ell_0 minimization is provided by \ell_q minimization than that provided by \ell_1 minimization.
