Energy efficient communication technology has attracted much attention due to the explosive growth of energy consumption in current wireless communication systems. In this letter we focus on fairness-based energy efficiency and aim to maximize the minimum user energy efficiency in the multicell multiuser joint beamforming system, taking both dynamic and static power consumptions into account. This optimization problem is a non-convex fractional programming problem and hard to tackle. In order to find its solution, the original problem is transformed into a parameterized polynomial subtractive form by exploiting the relationship between the user rate and the minimum mean square error, and using the fractional programming theorem. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm with proved convergence is developed to achieve a near-optimal performance. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the max-min rate optimization algorithm in terms of maximizing the minimum energy efficiency.
