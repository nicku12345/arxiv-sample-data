We propose two novel approaches to the recovery of an (approximately) sparse signal from noisy linear measurements in the case that the signal is a priori known to be non-negative and obey given linear equality constraints, such as simplex signals. This problem arises in, e.g., hyperspectral imaging, portfolio optimization, density estimation, and certain cases of compressive imaging. Our first approach solves a linearly constrained non-negative version of LASSO using the max-sum version of the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm, where we consider both quadratic and absolute loss, and where we propose a novel approach to tuning the LASSO regularization parameter via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Our second approach is based on the sum-product version of the GAMP algorithm, where we propose the use of a Bernoulli non-negative Gaussian-mixture signal prior and a Laplacian likelihood, and propose an EM-based approach to learning the underlying statistical parameters. In both approaches, the linear equality constraints are enforced by augmenting GAMP's generalized-linear observation model with noiseless pseudo-measurements. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed approaches.
