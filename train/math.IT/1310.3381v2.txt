We propose a low complexity graph-based linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) equalizer which considers both the intersymbol interference (ISI) and the effect of non-white noise inherent in Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling. In order to incorporate the statistics of noise signal into the factor graph over which the LMMSE algorithm is implemented, we suggest a method that models it as an autoregressive (AR) process. Furthermore, we develop a new mechanism for exchange of information between the proposed equalizer and the channel decoder through turbo iterations. Based on these improvements, we show that the proposed low complexity receiver structure performs close to the optimal decoder operating in ISI-free ideal scenario without FTN signaling through simulations.
