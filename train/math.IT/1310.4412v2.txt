We consider a transmitter broadcasting random linear combinations (over a field of size d) formed from a block of c packets to a collection of n receivers, where the channels between the transmitter and each receiver are independent erasure channels with reception probabilities \mathbf{q} = (q_1,\ldots,q_n). We establish several properties of the random delay until all n receivers have recovered all c packets, denoted Y_{n:n}^{(c)}. First, we provide lower and upper bounds, exact expressions, and a recurrence for the moments of Y_{n:n}^{(c)}. Second, we study the delay per packet Y_{n:n}^{(c)}/c as a function of c, including the asymptotic delay (as c \to \infty), and monotonicity (in c) properties of the delay per packet. Third, we employ extreme value theory to investigate Y_{n:n}^{(c)} as a function of n (as n \to \infty). Several results are new, some results are extensions of existing results, and some results are proofs of known results using new (probabilistic) proof techniques.
