Quadrature compressive sampling (QuadCS) is a newly introduced sub-Nyquist sampling for acquiring inphase and quadrature (I/Q) components of radio-frequency signals. For applications to pulse-Doppler radars, the QuadCS outputs can be arranged in 2-dimensional data similar to that by Nyquist sampling. This paper develops a compressive sampling pulse-Doppler (CoSaPD) processing scheme from the sub-Nyquist samples. The CoSaPD scheme follows Doppler estimation/detection and range estimation and is conducted on the sub-Nyquist samples without recovering the Nyquist samples. The Doppler estimation is realized through spectrum analyzer as in classic processing. The detection is done on the Doppler bin data. The range estimation is performed through sparse recovery algorithms on the detected targets and thus the computational load is reduced. The detection threshold can be set at a low value for improving detection probability and then the introduced false targets are removed in the range estimation stage through inherent detection characteristic in the recovery algorithms. Simulation results confirm our findings. The CoSaPD scheme with the data at one eighth the Nyquist rate and for SNR above -25dB can achieve performance of the classic processing with Nyquist samples.
