In this note we show that stable recovery of complex-valued signals x\in\mathbb{C}^n up to global sign can be achieved from the magnitudes of 4n-1 Fourier measurements when a certain "symmetrization and zero-padding" is performed before measurement (4n-3 is possible in certain cases). For real signals, symmetrization itself is linear and therefore our result is in this case a statement on uniform phase retrieval. Since complex conjugation is involved, such measurement procedure is not complex-linear but recovery is still possible from magnitudes of linear measurements on, for example, (\Re(x),\Im(x)).
