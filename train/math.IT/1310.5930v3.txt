This paper considers the impact of external noise sources, including interfering transmitters, on a diffusive molecular communication system, where the impact is measured as the number of noise molecules expected to be observed at a passive receiver. A unifying model for noise, multiuser interference, and intersymbol interference is presented, where, under certain circumstances, interference can be approximated as a noise source that is emitting continuously. The model includes the presence of advection and molecule degradation. The time-varying and asymptotic impact is derived for a series of special cases, some of which facilitate closed-form solutions. Simulation results show the accuracy of the expressions derived for the impact of a continuously-emitting noise source, and show how approximating intersymbol interference as a noise source can simplify the calculation of the expected bit error probability of a weighted sum detector.
