A hybrid automatic repeat request scheme with Chase combing (HARQ-CC) of polar codes is proposed. The existing analysis tools of the underlying rate-compatible punctured polar (RCPP) codes for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels are extended to Rayleigh fading channels. Then, an approximation bound of the throughput efficiency for the polar coded HARQ-CC scheme is derived. Utilizing this bound, the parameter configurations of the proposed scheme can be optimized. Simulation results show that, the proposed HARQ-CC scheme under a low-complexity SC decoding is only about 1.0dB away from the existing schemes with incremental redundancy (\mbox{HARQ-IR}). Compared with the polar coded \mbox{HARQ-IR} scheme, the proposed HARQ-CC scheme requires less retransmissions and has the advantage of good compatibility to other communication techniques.
