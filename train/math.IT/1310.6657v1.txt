In this contribution, we focus on a frequency domain two-user Multiple-Input-Single-Output Broadcast Channel (MISO BC) where the transmitter has imperfect and (un)matched Channel State Information (CSI) of the two users in two subbands. We provide an upper-bound to the Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) region, which is tight compared to the state of the art. By decomposing the subbands into subchannels according to the CSI feedback qualities, we interpret the DoF region as the weighted-sum of that in each subchannel. Moreover, we study the sum \emph{DoF} loss when employing sub-optimal schemes, namely Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Zero-Forcing Beamforming (ZFBF) and the S_3^{3/2} scheme proposed by Tandon et al. The results show that by switching among the sub-optimal strategies, we can obtain at least 80% and 66.7% of the optimal sum \emph{DoF} performance for the unmatched and matched CSIT scenario respectively.
