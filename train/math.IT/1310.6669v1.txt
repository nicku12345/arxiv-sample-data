This contribution investigates the Degrees-of-Freedom region of a two-user frequency correlated Multiple-Input-Single-Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) with imperfect Channel State Information at the transmitter (CSIT). We assume that the system consists of an arbitrary number of subbands, denoted as L. Besides, the CSIT state varies across users and subbands. A tight outer-bound is found as a function of the minimum average CSIT quality between the two users. Based on the CSIT states across the subbands, the DoF region is interpreted as a weighted sum of the optimal DoF regions in the scenarios where the CSIT of both users are perfect, alternatively perfect and not known. Inspired by the weighted-sum interpretation and identifying the benefit of the optimal scheme for the unmatched CSIT proposed by Chen et al., we also design a scheme achieving the upper-bound for the general L-subband scenario in frequency domain BC, thus showing the optimality of the DoF region.
