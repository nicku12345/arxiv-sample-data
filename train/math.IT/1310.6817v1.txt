The rank-modulation scheme has been recently proposed for efficiently storing data in nonvolatile memories. Error-correcting codes are essential for rank modulation, however, existing results have been limited. In this work we explore a new approach, \emph{systematic error-correcting codes for rank modulation}. Systematic codes have the benefits of enabling efficient information retrieval and potentially supporting more efficient encoding and decoding procedures. We study systematic codes for rank modulation under Kendall's \tau-metric as well as under the \ell_\infty-metric.   In Kendall's \tau-metric we present [k+2,k,3]-systematic codes for correcting one error, which have optimal rates, unless systematic perfect codes exist. We also study the design of multi-error-correcting codes, and provide two explicit constructions, one resulting in [n+1,k+1,2t+2] systematic codes with redundancy at most 2t+1. We use non-constructive arguments to show the existence of [n,k,n-k]-systematic codes for general parameters. Furthermore, we prove that for rank modulation, systematic codes achieve the same capacity as general error-correcting codes.   Finally, in the \ell_\infty-metric we construct two [n,k,d] systematic multi-error-correcting codes, the first for the case of d=O(1), and the second for d=\Theta(n). In the latter case, the codes have the same asymptotic rate as the best codes currently known in this metric.
