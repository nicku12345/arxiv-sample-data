Interference alignment aims to achieve maximum degrees of freedom in an interference system. For achieving Interference alignment in interfering broadcast systems a closed-form solution is proposed in [1] which is an extension of the grouping scheme in [2]. In a downlink scenario where there are a large number of users, the base station is required to select a subset of users such that the sum rate is maximized. To search for the optimal user subset using brute-force approach is computationally exhaustive because of the large number of possible user subset combinations. We propose a user selection algorithm achieving sum rate close to that of optimal solution. The algorithm employs coordinate ascent approach and exploits orthogonality between the desired signal space and the interference channel space in the reciprocal system to select the user at each step. For the sake of completeness, we have also extended the sum rate approach based algorithm to Interfering broadcast channel. The complexity of both these algorithms is shown to be linear with respect to the total number of users as compared to exponential in brute-force search.
