We consider the problem of user subset selection for maximizing the sum rate of downlink multi-user MIMO systems. The brute-force search for the optimal user set becomes impractical as the total number of users in a cell increase. We propose a user selection algorithm based on conditional differential entropy. We apply the proposed algorithm on Block diagonalization scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed conditional entropy based algorithm offers better alternatives than the existing user selection algorithms. Furthermore, in terms of sum rate, the solution obtained by the proposed algorithm turns out to be close to the optimal solution with significantly lower computational complexity than brute-force search.
