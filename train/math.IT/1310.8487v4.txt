This work investigates the information loss in a decimation system, i.e., in a downsampler preceded by an anti-aliasing filter. It is shown that, without a specific signal model in mind, the anti-aliasing filter cannot reduce information loss, while, e.g., for a simple signal-plus-noise model it can. For the Gaussian case, the optimal anti-aliasing filter is shown to coincide with the one obtained from energetic considerations. For a non-Gaussian signal corrupted by Gaussian noise, the Gaussian assumption yields an upper bound on the information loss, justifying filter design principles based on second-order statistics from an information-theoretic point-of-view.
