When several wireless users are sharing the spectrum, packet collision is a simple, yet widely used model for interference. Under this model, when transmitters cause interference at any of the receivers, their collided packets are discarded and need to be retransmitted. However, in reality, that receiver can still store its analog received signal and utilize it for decoding the packets in the future (for example, by successive interference cancellation techniques). In this work, we propose a physical layer model for wireless packet networks that allows for such flexibility at the receivers. We assume that the transmitters will be aware of the state of the channel (i.e. when and where collisions occur, or an unintended receiver overhears the signal) with some delay, and propose several coding opportunities that can be utilized by the transmitters to exploit the available signal at the receivers for interference management (as opposed to discarding them). We analyze the achievable throughput of our strategy in a canonical interference channel with two transmitter-receiver pairs, and demonstrate the gain over conventional schemes. By deriving an outer-bound, we also prove the optimality of our scheme for the corresponding model.
