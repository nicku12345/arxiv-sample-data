This paper studies the impact of co-channel interferences (CCIs) on the system performance of multi-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying, in a simple and explicit way. For generality, the desired channels along consecutive relaying hops and the CCIs at all nodes are subject to Nakagami-m fading with different shape factors. This study reveals that the diversity gain is determined only by the fading shape factor of the desired channels, regardless of the interference and the number of relaying hops. On the other hand, although the coding gain is in general a complex function of various system parameters, if the desired channels are subject to Rayleigh fading, the coding gain is inversely proportional to the accumulated interference at the destination, i.e. the product of the number of relaying hops and the average interference-to-noise ratio, irrespective of the fading distribution of the CCIs.
