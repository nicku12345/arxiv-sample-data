This paper studies the optimization of zero-delay analog mappings in a network setting that involves distributed coding. The cost surface is known to be non-convex, and known greedy methods tend to get trapped in poor locally optimal solutions that depend heavily on initialization. We derive an optimization algorithm based on the principles of "deterministic annealing", a powerful global optimization framework that has been successfully employed in several disciplines, including, in our recent work, to a simple zero-delay analog communications problem. We demonstrate strict superiority over the descent based methods, as well as present example mappings whose properties lend insights on the workings of the solution and relations with digital distributed coding.
