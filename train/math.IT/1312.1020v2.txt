A novel framework to construct an efficient sensing (measurement) matrix, called mixed adaptive-random (MAR) matrix, is introduced for directly acquiring a compressed image representation. The mixed sampling (sensing) procedure hybridizes adaptive edge measurements extracted from a low-resolution image with uniform random measurements predefined for the high-resolution image to be recovered. The mixed sensing matrix seamlessly captures important information of an image, and meanwhile approximately satisfies the restricted isometry property. To recover the high-resolution image from MAR measurements, the total variation algorithm based on the compressive sensing theory is employed for solving the Lagrangian regularization problem. Both peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity results demonstrate the MAR sensing framework shows much better recovery performance than the completely random sensing one. The work is particularly helpful for high-performance and lost-cost data acquisition.
