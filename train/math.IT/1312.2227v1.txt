In this correspondence we study the problem of channel-aware decision fusion when the sensor detection probability is not known at the decision fusion center. Several alternatives proposed in the literature are compared and new fusion rules (namely 'ideal sensors' and 'locally-optimum detection') are proposed, showing attractive performance and linear complexity. Simulations are provided to compare the performance of the aforementioned rules.
