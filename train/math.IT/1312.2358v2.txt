Numerical experiments in literature on compressed sensing have indicated that the reweighted l_1 minimization performs exceptionally well in recovering sparse signal. In this paper, we develop exact recovery conditions and algorithm for sparse signal via weighted l_1 minimization from the insight of the classical NSP (null space property) and RIC (restricted isometry constant) bound. We first introduce the concept of WNSP (weighted null space property) and reveal that it is a necessary and sufficient condition for exact recovery. We then prove that the RIC bound by weighted l_1 minimization is \delta_{ak}<\sqrt{\frac{a-1}{a-1+\gamma^2}}, where a>1, 0<\gamma\leq1 is determined by an optimization problem over the null space. When \gamma< 1 this bound is greater than \sqrt{\frac{a-1}{a}} from l_1 minimization. In addition, we also establish the bound on \delta_k and show that it can be larger than the sharp one 1/3 via l_1 minimization and also greater than 0.4343 via weighted l_1 minimization under some mild cases. Finally, we achieve a modified iterative reweighted l_1 minimization (MIRL1) algorithm based on our selection principle of weight, and the numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm behaves much better than l_1 minimization and iterative reweighted l_1 minimization (IRL1) algorithm.
