Two-hop wireless network serves as the basic net-work model for the study of general wireless networks, while cooperative jamming is a promising scheme to achieve the physi-cal layer security. This paper establishes a theoretical framework for the study of eavesdropper-tolerance capability (i.e., the exact maximum number of eavesdroppers that can be tolerated) in a two-hop wireless network, where the cooperative jamming is adopted to ensure security defined by secrecy outage probability (SOP) and opportunistic relaying is adopted to guarantee relia-bility defined by transmission outage probability (TOP). For the concerned network, closed form modeling for both SOP and TOP is first conducted based on the Central Limit Theorem. With the help of SOP and TOP models and also the Stochastic Ordering Theory, the model for eavesdropper-tolerance capability analysis is then developed. Finally, extensive simulation and numerical results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of our theoretical framework as well as the eavesdropper-tolerance capability of the concerned network from adopting cooperative jamming and opportunistic relaying.
