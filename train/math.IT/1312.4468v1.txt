We describe certain extremalities for Gallager's E_0 function evaluated under the uniform input distribution for binary input discrete memoryless channels. The results characterize the extremality of the E_0(\rho) curves of the binary erasure channel and the binary symmetric channel among all the E_0(\rho) curves that can be generated by the class of binary discrete memoryless channels whose E_0(\rho) curves pass through a given point (\rho_0, e_0), for some \rho_0 > -1.
