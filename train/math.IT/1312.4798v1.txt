Lazy scheduling, i.e. setting transmit power and rate in response to data traffic as low as possible so as to satisfy delay constraints, is a known method for energy efficient transmission.This paper addresses an online lazy scheduling problem over finite time-slotted transmission window and introduces low-complexity heuristics which attain near-optimal performance.Particularly, this paper generalizes lazy scheduling problem for energy harvesting systems to deal with packet arrival, energy harvesting and time-varying channel processes simultaneously. The time-slotted formulation of the problem and depiction of its offline optimal solution provide explicit expressions allowing to derive good online policies and algorithms.
