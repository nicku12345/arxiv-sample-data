In this paper we study the fiber F of the rational Jones-Goodwillie character  F:=\hofiber(ch:K^\rat(A)@>>>HN^\rat(A))  going from K-theory to negative cyclic homology of associative rings. We describe this fiber F in terms of sheaf cohomology. We prove that, for n\ge 1, there is an isomorphism:  \pi_n(F)\cong H^{-n}_{inf}(A,K^\rat)  between the homotopy of the fiber and the hypercohomology groups of K^\rat on a non-commutative version of Grothendieck's infinitesimal site.
