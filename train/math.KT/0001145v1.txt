We consider commutative algebras and chain DG algebras over a fixed commutative ground ring k as in the title. We are concerned with the problem of computing the cyclic (and Hochschild) homology of such algebras via free DG-resolutions \Lambda V @>>> A. We find spectral sequences E^2_{p,q}=H_p(\Lambda V\otimes\Gamma^q(dV))\Rightarrow HH_{p+q}(\Lambda V) and {E'}^2_{\pq}=H_p(\Lambda V\otimes\Gamma^{\le q}(dV)) \Rightarrow HC_{p+q}(\Lambda V) The algebra \Lambda V\otimes\Gamma(dV) is a divided power version of the de Rham algebra; in the particular case when k is a field of characteristic zero, the spectral sequences above agree with those found by Burghelea and Vigu\'e (Cyclic homology of commutative algebras I, Lecture Notes in Math. {\bf 1318} (1988) 51-72), where it is shown they degenerate at the E^2 term. For arbitrary ground rings we prove here (Theorem 2.3) that if V_n=0 for n\ge 2 then E^2=E^\infty. From this we derive a formula for the Hochschild homology of flat complete intersections in terms of a filtration of the complex for crystalline cohomology, and find a description of {E'}^2 also in terms of crystalline cohomology (theorem 3.0). The latter spectral sequence degenerates for complete intersections of embedding dimension \le 2 (Corollary 3.1). Without flatness assumptions, our results can be viewed as the computation Shukla (cyclic) homology (T. Pirashvili, F. Waldhausen; Mac Lane homology and topological Hochschild homology, J. Pure Appl. Algebra{\bf 82} (1992) 81-98).
