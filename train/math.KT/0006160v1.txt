We define and compare two different definitions of Chow motives for Deligne-Mumford stacks, associated with two definitions of Chow rings. The main result we prove is that both categories of motives are equivalent to the usual category of motives of algebraic varieties, but the motives of a given stack associated with both theories are not isomorphic. We will also give some examples of motives associated with some alegbraic stacks.
