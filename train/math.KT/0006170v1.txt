The main purpose of this paper is the geometric construction, and the analysis of the formalism of elliptic Bloch groups. In the setting of absolute cohomology, we obtain a generalization of Beilinson's Eisenstein symbol to divisors of an elliptic curve, whose support is not necessarily torsion. For motivic cohomology, such a generalization is obtained in low degrees. Our main result shows that the Eisenstein symbol can be defined in all degrees if the elliptic analogue of the Beilinson-Soule vanishing conjecture holds.
