We define the C^*-algebra of quantum real projective space \R P_q^2, classify its irreducible representations and compute its K-theory. We also show that the q-disc of Klimek-Lesniewski can be obtained as a non-Galois \Z_2-quotient of the equator Podle\'s quantum sphere. On the way, we provide the Cartesian coordinates for all Podle\'s quantum spheres and determine an explicit form of isomorphisms between the C^*-algebras of the equilateral spheres and the C^*-algebra of the equator one.
