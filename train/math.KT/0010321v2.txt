We extend the Kontsevich formality L_\infty-morphism \U\colon T^\ndot_\poly(\R^d)\to\D^\ndot_\poly(\R^d) to an L_\infty-morphism of an L_\infty-modules over T^\ndot_\poly(\R^d), \hat \U\colon C_\ndot(A,A)\to\Omega^\ndot(\R^d), A=C^\infty(\R^d). The construction of the map \hat \U is given in Kontsevich-type integrals. The conjecture that such an L_\infty-morphism exists is due to Boris Tsygan \cite{Ts}. As an application, we obtain an explicit formula for isomorphism A_*/[A_*,A_*]\simto A/\{A,A\} (A_* is the Kontsevich deformation quantization of the algebra A by a Poisson bivector field, and \{{,}\} is the Poisson bracket). We also formulate a conjecture extending the Kontsevich theorem on the cup-products to this context. The conjecture implies a generalization of the Duflo formula, and many other things.
