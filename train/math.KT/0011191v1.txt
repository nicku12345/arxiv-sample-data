Let \Gamma be a torsion free lattice in G=\PGL(3,{{\mathbb F}}) where {{\mathbb F}} is a nonarchimedean local field. Then \Gamma acts freely on the affine Bruhat-Tits building {\mathcal B} of G and there is an induced action on the boundary \Omega of {\mathcal B}. The crossed product C^*-algebra {\mathcal A}(\Gamma)=C(\Omega) \rtimes \Gamma depends only on \Gamma and is classified by its K-theory. This article shows how to compute the K-theory of {\mathcal A}(\Gamma) and of the larger class of rank two Cuntz-Krieger algebras.
