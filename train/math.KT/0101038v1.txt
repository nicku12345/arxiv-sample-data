In joint work with M. Hopkins and C. Teleman we find a new description of the Verlinde algebra associated to a compact Lie group. In this expository account we describe twisted K-theory, prove the theorem for the group SU(2), and motivate the general theorem using ideas in topological field theory. The full proof will appear elsewhere.
