The aim of section 1 is to define the homotopic functor to category of Abelian groups, connected with the special classes of bundles with fiber matrix algebra or projective space. The aim of section 2 is to define some generalization of the notion of formal group. More precisely, we consider the analog of formal groups with coefficients belonging to a Hopf algebra. We also study some example of a formal group over a Hopf algebra, which generalizes the formal group of geometric cobordisms.
