Using elementary graded automorphisms of polytopal algebras (essentially the coordinate rings of projective toric varieties) polyhedral versions of the group of elementary matrices and the Steinberg and Milnor groups are defined. They coincide with the usual K-theoretic groups in the special case when the polytope is a unit simplex and can be thought of as compact/polytopal substitutes for the tame automorphism groups of polynomial algebras. Relative to the classical case, many new aspects have to be taken into account. We describe these groups explicitly when the underlying polytope is 2-dimensional. Already this low-dimensional case provides interesting classes of groups.
