In this paper we construct an explicit geometric model for the group of gerbes over an orbifold X. We show how from its curvature we can obtain its characteristic class in H^3(X) via Chern-Weil theory. For an arbitrary gerbe \LL, a twisting \Korb{\LL}(X) of the orbifold K-theory of X is constructed, and shown to generalize previous twisting by Rosenberg, Witten, Atiyah-Segal and Bowknegt et. al. in the smooth case and by Adem-Ruan for discrete torsion on an orbifold.
