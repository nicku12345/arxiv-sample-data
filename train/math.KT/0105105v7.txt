We introduce the concept of {\it para-Hopf algebroid} and define their cyclic cohomology in the spirit of Connes-Moscovici cyclic cohomology for Hopf algebras. Para-Hopf algebroids are closely related to, but different from, Hopf algebroids. Their definition is motivated by attempting to define a cyclic cohomology theory for Hopf algebroids in general. We show that many of Hopf algebraic structures, including the Connes-Moscovici algebra \mathcal{H}_{FM}, are para-Hopf algebroids.
