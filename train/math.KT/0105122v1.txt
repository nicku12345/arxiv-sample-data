In this paper we study some generalization of the notion of a formal group over ring, which may be called a formal group over Hopf algebra (FGoHA). The first example of FGoHA was found under the study of cobordism's ring of some H-space \hat{Gr}. The results, which are represented in this paper, show that some constructions of the theory of formal group may be generalized to FGoHA. For example, if {\frak F}(x\otimes 1,1\otimes x) \in (H{\mathop{\hat{\otimes}}\limits_R}H)[[x\otimes 1,1\otimes x]] is a FGoHA over a Hopf algebra (H,\mu,\nu, \Delta,\epsilon, S) over a ring R without torsion, then there exists a logarithm, i.e. the formal series {\frak g}(x)\in H_\mathbb{Q}[[x]] such that (\Delta {\frak g})({\frak F}(x\otimes 1,1\otimes x))= {\frak c}+{\frak g}(x)\otimes 1+1\otimes {\frak g}(x), where {\frak c}\in H_\mathbb{Q}{\mathop{\hat{\otimes}}\limits_{R_ \mathbb{Q}}}H_\mathbb{Q}, (\id \otimes \epsilon){\frak c}=0=(\epsilon \otimes \id){\frak c} and (\id \otimes \Delta){\frak c}+1\otimes {\frak c}-(\Delta \otimes \id){\frak c}-{\frak c}\otimes 1=0 (recall that the last condition means that {\frak c} is a cocycle in the cobar complex of the Hopf algebra H_\mathbb{\mathbb{Q}}). On the other hand, FGoHA have series of new properties. For example, the convolution on a Hopf algebra allows us to get new FGoHA from given.
