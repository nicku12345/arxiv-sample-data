We extend our work in~\cite{rm01} to the case of Hopf comodule coalgebras. We introduce the cocylindrical module C \natural^{} \mathcal{H}, where \mathcal{H} is a Hopf algebra with bijective antipode and C is a Hopf comodule coalgebra over \mathcal{H}. We show that there exists an isomorphism between the cocyclic module of the crossed coproduct coalgebra C > \blacktriangleleft \mathcal{H}  and \Delta(C \natural^{}\mathcal{H}) , the cocyclic module related to the diagonal of C \natural^{} \mathcal{H}. We approximate HC^{\bullet}(C > \blacktriangleleft \mathcal{H})  by a spectral sequence and we give an interpretation for  \mathsf{E}^0, \mathsf{E}^1 and \mathsf{E}^2  terms of this spectral sequence.
