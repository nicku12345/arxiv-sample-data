We obtain a decomposition for the Hochschild cochain complex of a split algebra and we study some properties of the cohomology of each term of this decomposition. Then, we consider the case of trivial extensions, specially of Frobenius algebras. In particular, we determine completely the cohomology of the trivial extension of a finite dimensional Hopf algebra. Finally, as an application, we obtain a result about the Hochschild cohomology of Frobenius algebras.
