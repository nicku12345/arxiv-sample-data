In this paper we construct a cylindrical module A \natural \mathcal{H} for an \mathcal{H}-comodule algebra A, where the antipode of the Hopf algebra \mathcal{H} is bijective. We show that the cyclic module associated to the diagonal of A \natural \mathcal{H} is isomorphic with the cyclic module of the crossed product algebra A \rtimes \mathcal{H}. This enables us to derive a spectral sequence for the cyclic homology of the crossed product algebra. We also construct a cocylindrical module for Hopf module coalgebras and establish a similar spectral sequence to compute the cyclic cohomology of crossed product coalgebras.
