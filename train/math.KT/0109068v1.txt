Let A_n be the n-th Weyl algebra, and let G\subset\Sp_{2n}(\C)\subset\Aut(A_n) be a finite group of linear automorphisms of A_n. In this paper we compute the multiplicative structure on the Hochschild cohomology \HH^*(A_n^G) of the algebra of invariants of G. We prove that, as a graded algebra, \HH^*(A_n^G) is isomorphic to the graded algebra associated to the center of the group algebra \C G with respect to a filtration defined in terms of the defining representation of G.
