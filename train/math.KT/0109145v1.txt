Let X be a simply connected space and \Bbb K be any field. The normalized singular cochains N^*(X; {\Bbb K}) admit a natural strongly homotopy commutative algebra structure, which induces a natural product on the Hochschild homology HH_* N^*X of the space X. We prove that, endowed with this product, HH_*N^*X is isomorphic to the cohomology algebra of the free loop space of X with coefficients in \Bbb K. We also show how to construct a simpler Hochschild complex which allows direct computation.
