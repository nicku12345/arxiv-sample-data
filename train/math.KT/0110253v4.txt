We consider the norm closure A of the algebra of all operators of order and class zero in Boutet de Monvel's calculus on a manifold X with boundary Y. We first describe the image and the kernel of the continuous extension of the boundary principal symbol to A. If the X is connected and Y is not empty, we then show that the K-groups of A are topologically determined. In case the manifold, its boundary and the tangent space of the interior have torsion-free K-theory, we prove that K_i(A/K) is isomorphic to the direct sum of K_i(C(X)) and K_{1-i}(C_0(TX')), for i=0,1, with K denoting the compact ideal and TX' the tangent bundle of the interior of X. Using Boutet de Monvel's index theorem, we also prove this result for i=1 without assuming the torsion-free hypothesis. We also give a composition sequence for A.
