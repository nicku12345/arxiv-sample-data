Motivated by the search for new examples of ``noncommutative manifolds'', we study the noncommutative geometry (in the sense of Connes) of the group C*-algebra of the three dimensional discrete Heisenberg group. We present a unified treatment of the K-homology, cyclic cohomology and derivations of this algebra.
