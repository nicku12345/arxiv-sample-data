Motivated by the search for new examples of ``noncommutative manifolds'', we study the noncommutative geometry (in the sense of Connes) of the group C*-algebras of various discrete groups. The examples we consider are the infinite dihedral group Z \times_{\sigma} Z_2 and the semidirect product group Z \times_{\sigma} Z. We present a unified treatment of the K-homology and cyclic cohomology of these algebras.
