We define the gauge-equivariant index of a family of elliptic operators invariant with respect to the free action of a family \GR \to B of Lie groups (these families are called ``gauge-invariant families'' in what follows). If the fibers of \GR \to B are simply-connected and solvable, we compute the Chern character of the gauge-equivariant index, the result being given by an Atiyah-Singer type formula that incorporates also topological information about the bundle \GR \to B. The algebras of invariant pseudodifferential operators that we study, \Psm {\infty}Y and \PsS {\infty}Y, are generalizations of ``parameter dependent'' algebras of pseudodifferential operators (with parameter in \mathbb R^q), so our results provide also an index theorem for elliptic, parameter dependent pseudodifferential operators. We apply these results to study Fredholm boundary conditions on a simplex.
