Let \GR \to B be a bundle of compact Lie groups acting on a fiber bundle Y \to B. In this paper we introduce and study gauge-equivariant K-theory groups K_\GR^i(Y). These groups satisfy the usual properties of the equivariant K-theory groups, but also some new phenomena arise due to the topological non-triviality of the bundle \GR \to B. As an application, we define a gauge-equivariant index for a family of elliptic operators (P_b)_{b \in B} invariant with respect to the action of \GR \to B, which, in this approach, is an element of K_\GR^0(B). We then give another definition of the gauge-equivariant index as an element of K_0(C^*(\GR)), the K-theory group of the Banach algebra C^*(\GR). We prove that K_0(C^*(\GR)) \simeq K^0_\GR(\GR) and that the two definitions of the gauge-equivariant index are equivalent. The algebra C^*(\GR) is the algebra of continuous sections of a certain field of C^*-algebras with non-trivial Dixmier-Douady invariant. The gauge-equivariant K-theory groups are thus examples of twisted K-theory groups, which have recently proved themselves useful in the study of Ramond-Ramond fields.
