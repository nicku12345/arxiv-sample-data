Relationship is clarified between the notions of linear extension of algebraic theories, and central extension, in the sense of commutator calculus, of their models. Varieties of algebras turn out to be nilpotent Maltsev precisely when their theories may be obtained as results of iterated linear extensions by bifunctors from the so called abelian theories. The latter theories are described; they are slightly more general than theories of modules over a ring.
