When G is abelian and l is a prime we show how elements of the relative K-group K_{0}({\bf Z}_{l}[G], {\bf Q}_{l}) give rise to annihilator/Fitting ideal relations of certain associated {\bf Z}[G]-modules. Examples of this phenomenon are ubiquitous. Particularly, we give examples in which G is the Galois group of an extension of global fields and the resulting annihilator/Fitting ideal relation is closely connected to Stickelberger's Theorem and to the conjectures Coates-Sinnott and Brumer.
