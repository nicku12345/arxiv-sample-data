We study the Hochschild homology of the iterated skew polynomial rings introduced by D. Jordan in ``A simple localization of the quantized Weyl algebra''. First, we obtain a complex, smaller than the canonical one of Hochschild, given the homology of such an algebra, and then, we study this complex in order to compute the homology of some families of algebras. In particular we compute the homology of some quantum groups, in the generic case.
