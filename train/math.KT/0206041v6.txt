In 1972, B. E. Johnson proved that a locally compact group G is amenable if and only if certain Hochschild cohomology groups of its convolution algebra L^1(G) vanish. Similarly, G is compact if and only if L^1(G) is biprojective: In each case, a classical property of G corresponds to a cohomological propety of L^1(G). Starting with the work of Z.-J. Ruan in 1995, it has become apparent that in the non-commutative setting, i.e. when dealing with the Fourier algebra A(G) or the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra B(G), the canonical operator space structure of the algebras under consideration has to be taken into account: In analogy with Johnson's result, Ruan characterized the amenable locally compact groups G through the vanishing of certain cohomology groups of A(G). In this paper, we give a survey of historical developments, known results, and current open problems.
