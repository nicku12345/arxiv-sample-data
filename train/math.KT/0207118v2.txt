We define a noncommutative analogue of invariant de Rham cohomology.   More precisely, for a triple (A,\mathcal{H},M) consisting of a Hopf algebra \mathcal{H}, an \mathcal{H}-comodule algebra A, an \mathcal{H}-module M, and a compatible grouplike element \sigma in \mathcal{H}, we define the cyclic module of invariant chains on A with coefficients in M and call its cyclic homology the invariant cyclic homology of A with coefficients in M. We also develop a dual theory for coalgebras. Examples include cyclic cohomology of Hopf algebras defined by Connes-Moscovici and its dual theory. We establish various results and computations including one for the quantum group SL(q,2).
