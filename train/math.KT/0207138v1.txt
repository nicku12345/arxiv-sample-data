We first prove that the Whitehead group of a torsion-free virtually solvable linear group vanishes. Next we make a reduction of the fibered isomorphism conjecture from virtually solvable groups to a class of virtually solvable Q-linear groups. Finally we prove an L-theory analogue for elementary amenable groups.
