This paper continues our previous work done in math.AG/0008207 and is an attempt to establish a conceptual framework which generalizes the work of Manin on the relation between non-linear second order ODEs of type Painleve VI and integrable systems. The principle behind everything is a strong interaction between K-theory and Picard-Fuchs type differential equations via Abel-Jacobi maps. Our main result is an extension of a theorem of Donagi and Markman to our setup.
