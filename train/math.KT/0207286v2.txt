In 1977 Kervaire and Murthy presented three conjectures regarding K_0 \mathbb{Z} C_{p^n}, where C_{p^n} is the cyclic group of order p^n and p is a semi-regular prime. The Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence provides the following short exact sequence 0\to V_n\to \pic (\mathbb{Z} C_{p^n})\to \cl \mathbb{Q} (\zeta_{n-1})\times \pic (\mathbb{Z} C_{p^{n-1}})\to 0 where \zeta_{n-1} is a primitive p^n-th root of unity. The group V_n that injects into \pic \mathbb{Z} C_{p^n}\cong\tilde{K}_0\mathbb{Z} C_{p^n}, is a canonical quotient of an in some sense simpler group \mathcal{V}_n. Both groups split in a ``positive'' and ``negative'' part. While V_n^- is well understood there is still no complete information on V_n^+. Kervaire and Murthy showed that K_0 \Z C_{p^n} and V_n are tightly connected to class groups of cyclotomic fields. They conjectured that V_n^+\cong (\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z})^{r(p)}, where r(p) is the index of regularity of the prime p and that \mathcal{V}_n^+\cong V_n^+, and moreover, \char\mathcal{V}_n^+\cong \cl^{(p)} \mathbb{Q} (\zeta_{n-1}), the p-part of the class group. In the present paper we calculate \mathcal{V}_n^+ and prove that \char \mathcal{V}_n^+\cong \cl^{(p)} \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{n-1}) for all semi-regular primes which also gives us the structure of \cl^{(p)} \mathbb{Q}(\z_{n-1}) as an abelian group. Moreover we conclude that all three Kervaire and Murthy conjectures hold is equivalent to that the Iwasawa invariant \lambda equals r(p) and that this also implies that the Iwasawa invariant \nu equals r(p).
