We present a simple extension of the classical Hilton-Eckmann argument classically used to prove that the endomorphism monoid of the unit object in a monoidal category is commutative. It allows us to recover in a uniform way well-known results on the graded-commutativity of cup products defined on the cohomology theories attached to various algebraic structures, as well as some more recent results.
