There is an Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence involving the Picard group of the integer group ring \Z C_{p^n} where C_{p^n} is the cyclic group of order p^n and \zeta_{n-1} is a primitive p^n-th root of unity. The "unknown" part of the sequence is a group. V_n. V_n splits as V_n\cong V_n^+\oplus V_n^- and V_n^- is explicitly known. V_n^+ is a quotient of an in some sense simpler group \mathcal{V}_n. In 1977 Kervaire and Murthy conjectured that for semi-regular primes p, V_n^+ \cong \mathcal{V}_n^+ \cong \cl^{(p)}(\Q (\zeta_{n-1}))\cong (\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z})^{r(p)}, where r(p) is the index of regularity of p. Under an extra condition on the prime p, Ullom calculated V_n^+ in 1978 in terms of the Iwasawa invariant \lambda as V_n^+ \cong (\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z})^{r(p)}\oplus (\mathbb{Z}/p^{n-1} \mathbb{Z})^{\lambda-r(p)}.   In the previous paper we proved that for all semi-regular primes, \mathcal{V}_n^+\cong \cl^{(p)}(\Q (\zeta_{n-1})) and that these groups are isomorphic to \[(\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z})^{r_0}\oplus (\mathbb{Z}/p^{n-1} \mathbb{Z})^{r_1-r_0} \oplus \hdots \oplus (\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z})^{r_{n-1}-r_{n-2}} \] for a certain sequence \{r_k\} (where r_0=r(p)). Under Ulloms extra condition it was proved that \[V_n^+ \cong \mathcal{V}_n^+ \cong \cl^{(p)}(\Q(\z_{n-1})) \cong (\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z})^{r(p)}\oplus (\mathbb{Z}/p^{n-1}\mathbb{Z})^{\lambda-r(p)}.\] In the present paper we prove that Ullom's extra condition is valid for all semi-regular primes and it is hence shown that the above result holds for all semi-regular primes.
