In this note, we exhibit a method to prove the Baum-Connes conjecture (with coefficients) for extensions with finite quotients of certain groups which already satisfy the Baum-Connes conjecture. Interesting examples to which this method applies are torsion-free finite extensions of the pure braid groups, e.g. the full braid groups, or certain fundamental groups of complements of links in S^3.
