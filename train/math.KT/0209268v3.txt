We consider two Z/2Z-actions on the Podles generic quantum spheres. They yield, as noncommutative quotient spaces, the Klimek-Lesniewski q-disc and the quantum real projective space, respectively. The C*-algebras of all these quantum spaces are described as graph C*-algebras. The K-groups of the thus presented C*-algebras are then easily determined from the general theory of graph C*-algebras. For the quantum real projective space, we also recall the classification of the classes of irreducible *-representations of its algebra and give a linear basis for this algebra.
