Our results are of three types. First we describe a general procedure of adjoining polynomial variables to A_\infty-ring spectra whose coefficient rings satisfy certain restrictions.A host of examples of such spectra is provided by killing a regular ideal in the coefficient ring of MU, the complex cobordism spectrum. Second, we show that the algebraic procedure of adjoining roots of unity carries over in the topological context for such spectra. Third, we use the developed technology to compute the homotopy types of spaces of strictly multiplicative maps between suitable K(n)-localizations of such spectra. This generalizes the famous Hopkins-Miller theorem and gives strengthened versions of various splitting theorems.
