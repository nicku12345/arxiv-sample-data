We construct spectral triples for the C^*-algebra of continuous functions on the quantum SU(2) group and the quantum sphere. There has been various approaches towards building a calculus on quantum spaces, but there seems to be very few instances of computations outlined in chapter~6 of Connes' book. We give detailed computations of the associated Connes-de Rham complex and the space of L_2-forms.
