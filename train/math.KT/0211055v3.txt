Metrics of constant negative curvature on a compact Riemann surface are critical points of the Liouville action functional, which in recent constructions is rigorously defined as a class in a Cech-de Rham complex with respect to a suitable covering of the surface.   We show that this class is the square of the metrized holomorphic tangent bundle in hermitian-holomorphic Deligne cohomology. We achieve this by introducing a different version of the hermitian-holomorphic Deligne complex which is nevertheless quasi-isomorphic to the one introduced by Brylinski in his construction of Quillen line bundles. We reprove the relation with the determinant of cohomology construction.   Furthermore, if we specialize the covering to the one provided by a Kleinian uniformization (thereby allowing possibly disconnected surfaces) the same class can be reinterpreted as the transgression of the regulator class expressed by the Bloch-Wigner dilogarithm.
