This is a survey paper on cohomology theories for A_\infty and E_\infty ring spectra. Different constructions and main properties of topological Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology and of topological derivations are described. We give sample calculations of these cohomology theories and outline applications to the existence of A_\infty and E_\infty structures on various spectra. We also explain the relationship between topological derivations, spaces of multiplicative maps and moduli spaces of multiplicative structures.
