Let G be a finite group and W be a faithful representation of G over {\bf C}. The group G acts on the field of rational functions \mathbf C(W). The aim of this paper is to give a description of the unramified cohomology group of degree 3 of the field of invariant functions \mathbf C(W)^G in terms of the cohomology of G when G is a group of odd order. This enables us to give an example of a group for which this field is not rational, although its unramified Brauer group is trivial.
