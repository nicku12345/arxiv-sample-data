Described the algebraic structure on the space of homotopy classes of cycles with marked topological flags of disks. This space is a non-commutative monoid, with an Abelian quotient corresponding to the group of singular homologies H_k(M). For the marked flag contracted to a point the multiplication becomes commutative and the subgroup of spherical cycles corresponds to the usual homotopy group \pi_k(M).
