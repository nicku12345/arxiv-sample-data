We consider Hopf crossed products of the the type A#_\sigma \mathcal{H}, where \mathcal{H} is a cocommutative Hopf algebra, A is an \mathcal{H}-module algebra and \sigma is a "numerical" convolution invertible 2-cocycle on \mathcal{H}. we give an spectral sequence that converges to the cyclic homology of A#_\sigma \mathcal{H} and identify the E^1 and E^2 terms of the spectral sequence.
