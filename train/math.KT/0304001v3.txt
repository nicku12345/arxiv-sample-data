For an algebra B with an action of a Hopf algebra H we establish the pairing between even equivariant cyclic cohomology and equivariant K-theory for B. We then extend this formalism to compact quantum group actions and show that equivariant cyclic cohomology is a target space for the equivariant Chern character of equivariant summable Fredholm modules. We prove an analogue of Julg's theorem relating equivariant K-theory to ordinary K-theory of the C*-algebra crossed product, and characterize equivariant vector bundles on quantum homogeneous spaces.
