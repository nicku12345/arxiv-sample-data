We outline briefly results and examples related with the bijectivity of the norm residue homomorphism. We define norm varieties and describe some constructions. We discuss degree formulas which form a major tool to handle norm varieties. Finally we formulate Hilbert's 90 for symbols which is the hard part of the bijectivity of the norm residue homomorphism, modulo a theorem of Voevodsky.
