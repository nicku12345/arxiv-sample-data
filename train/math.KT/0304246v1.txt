The standard (Berezin-Toeplitz) geometric quantization of a compact Kaehler manifold is restricted by integrality conditions. These restrictions can be circumvented by passing to the universal covering space, provided that the lift of the symplectic form is exact. I relate this construction to the Baum-Connes assembly map and prove that it gives a strict quantization of the manifold. I also propose a further generalization, classify the required structure, and provide a means of computing the resulting algebras. These constructions involve twisted group C*-algebras of the fundamental group which are determined by a group cocycle constructed from the cohomology class of the symplectic form.
