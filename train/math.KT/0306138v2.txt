In this paper, we develop twisted K-theory for stacks, where the twisted class is given by an S^1-gerbe over the stack. General properties, including the Mayer-Vietoris property, Bott periodicity, and the product structure K^i_\alpha \otimes K^j_\beta \to K^{i+j}_{\alpha +\beta} are derived. Our approach provides a uniform framework for studying various twisted K-theories including the usual twisted K-theory of topological spaces, twisted equivariant K-theory, and the twisted K-theory of orbifolds. We also present a Fredholm picture, and discuss the conditions under which twisted K-groups can be expressed by so-called "twisted vector bundles".   Our approach is to work on presentations of stacks, namely \emph{groupoids}, and relies heavily on the machinery of K-theory (KK-theory) of C^*-algebras.
