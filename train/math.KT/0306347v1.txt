I conjecture that index formulas for K-theory classes on the moduli of holomorphic G-bundles over a compact Riemann surface \Sigma are controlled, in a precise way, by Frobenius algebra deformations of the Verlinde algebra of G. The Frobenius algebras in question are twisted K-theories of G, equivariant under the conjugation action, and the controlling device is the equivariant Gysin map along the "product of commutators" from G^{2g} to G. The conjecture is compatible with naive virtual localization of holomorphic bundles, from G to its maximal torus; this follows by localization in twisted K-theory.
