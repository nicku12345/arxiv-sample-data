Let \Gamma be a discrete finitely generated group. Let \hat{M}\to T be a \Gamma-equivariant fibration, with fibers diffeomorphic to a fixed even dimensional manifold with boundary Z. We assume that \Gamma\to \hat{M}\to \hat{M}/\Gamma is a Galois covering of a compact manifold with boundary. Let (D^+ (\theta))_{\theta\in T} be a \Gamma-equivariant family of Dirac-type operators. Under the assumption that the boundary family is L^2-invertible, we define an index class in the K-theory of the cross-product algebra, K_0 (C^0 (T)\rtimes_r \Gamma). If, in addition, \Gamma is of polynomial growth, we define higher indeces by pairing the index class with suitable cyclic cocycles. Our main result is then a formula for these higher indeces: the structure of the formula is as in the seminal work of Atiyah, Patodi and Singer, with an interior geometric contribution and a boundary contribution in the form of a higher eta invariant associated to the boundary family. Under similar assumptions we extend our theorem to any G-proper manifold, with G an \'etale groupoid. We employ this generalization in order to establish a higher Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index formula on certain foliations with boundary. Fundamental to our work is a suitable generalization of Melrose b-pseudodifferential calculus as well as the superconnection proof of the index theorem on G-proper manifolds recently given by Gorokhovsky and Lott.
