It is proved that every separable C^*-algebra of real rank zero contains an AF-sub-C^*-algebra such that the inclusion mapping induces an isomorphism of the ideal lattices of the two C^*-algebras and such that every projection in a matrix algebra over the large C^*-algebra is equivalent to a projection in a matrix algebra over the AF-sub-C^*-algebra. This result is proved at the level of monoids, using that the monoid of Murray-von Neumann equivalence classes of projections in a C^*-algebra of real rank zero has the refinement property. As an application of our result, we show that given a unital C^*-algebra A of real rank zero and a natural number n, then there is a unital ^*-homomorphism M_{n_1} \oplus ... \oplus M_{n_r} \to A for some natural numbers r,n_1, ...,n_r with n_j \ge n for all j if and only if A has no representation of dimension less than n.
