We introduce a concept of \frac23PROP generalizing the Kontsevich concept of \frac12PROP. We prove that some Stasheff-type compactification of the Kontsevich spaces K(m,n) defines a topological \frac23PROP structure. The corresponding chain complex is a minimal model for its cohomology (both are considered as \frac23PROPs). We construct a \frac23PROP \End(V) for a vector space V. Finally, we construct a dg Lie algebra controlling the deformations of a (co)associative bialgebra. Philosophically, this construction is a version of the Markl's operadic construction from [M1] applied to minimal models of \frac23PROPs.
