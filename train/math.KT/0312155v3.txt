This is the third paper of a series relating the equivariant twisted K-theory of a compact Lie group G to the ``Verlinde space'' of isomorphism classes of projective lowest-weight representations of the loop groups. Here, we treat arbitrary compact Lie groups. In addition, we discuss the relation to semi-infinite cohomology, the fusion product of Conformal Field theory, the r\^ole of energy and the topological Peter-Weyl theorem.
