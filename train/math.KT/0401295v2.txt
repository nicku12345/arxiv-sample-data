We introduce a new version kk^{\rm alg} of bivariant K-theory that is defined on the category of all locally convex algebras. A motivating example is the Weyl algebra W, i.e. the algebra generated by two elements satisfying the Heisenberg commutation relation, with the fine locally convex topology. We determine its kk^{\rm alg}-invariants using a natural extension for W. Using similar methods the kk^{\rm alg}-invariants can be determined for many other algebras of similar type.
