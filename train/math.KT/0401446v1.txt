For a finite dimensional monomial algebra \Lambda over a field K we show that the Hochschild cohomology ring of \Lambda modulo the ideal generated by homogeneous nilpotent elements is a commutative finitely generated K-algebra of Krull dimension at most one. This was conjectured to be true for any finite dimensional algebra over a field by Snashall-Solberg.
