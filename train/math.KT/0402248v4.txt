We prove Tsygan's formality conjecture for Hochschild chains of the algebra of functions on an arbitrary smooth manifold M using the Fedosov resolutions proposed in math.QA/0307212 and the formality quasi-isomorphism for Hochschild chains of R[[y_1, ..., y_d]] proposed in paper math.QA/0010321 by Shoikhet. This result allows us to describe traces on the quantum algebra of functions on an arbitrary Poisson manifold.
