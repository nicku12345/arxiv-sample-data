Let G be a (not necessarily Hausdorff) locally compact groupoid. We introduce a notion of properness for G, which is invariant under Morita-equivalence. We show that any generalized morphism between two locally compact groupoids which satisfies some properness conditions induces a C*-correspondence from C*_r(G_1) to C^*_r(G_2), and thus two Morita equivalent groupoids have Morita-equivalent C^*-algebras.
