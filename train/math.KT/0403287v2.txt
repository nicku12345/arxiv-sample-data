We present an encompassing treatment of D-brane charges in supersymmetric SO(3) WZW models. There are two distinct supersymmetric CFTs at each even level: the standard bosonic SO(3) modular invariant tensored with free fermions, as well as a novel twisted model. We calculate the relevant twisted K-theories and find complete agreement with the CFT analysis of D-brane charges. The K-theoretical computation in particular elucidates some important aspects of N=1 supersymmetric WZW models on non-simply connected Lie groups.
