This is an overview of results from our experiment of merging two seemingly unrelated disciplines - higher algebraic K-theory of rings and the theory of lattice polytopes. The usual K-theory is the ``theory of a unit simplex''. A conjecture is proposed on the structure of higher polyhedral K-groups for certain class of polytopes for which the coincidence of Quillen's and Volodin's theories is known.
