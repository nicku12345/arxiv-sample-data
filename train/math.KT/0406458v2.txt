Given a row-finite k-graph \Lambda with no sources we investigate the K-theory of the higher rank graph C^*-algebra, C^*(\Lambda). When k=2 we are able to give explicit formulae to calculate the K-groups of C^*(\Lambda). The K-groups of C^*(\Lambda) for k>2 can be calculated under certain circumstances and we consider the case k=3. We prove that for arbitrary k, the torsion-free rank of K_0(C^*(\Lambda)) and K_1(C^*\Lambda)) are equal when C^*(\Lambda) is unital, and for k=2 we determine the position of the class of the unit of C^*(\Lambda) in K_0(C^*(\Lambda)).
