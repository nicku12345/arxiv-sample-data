The usual notion of a site fibred over a stack is expanded to a definition of a site C/A fibred over a presheaf of categories A. Presheaves of simplicial sets on the site fibred over a presheaf of categories A are contravariant enriched diagrams defined on A, taking values in simplicial sets. The standard model structure for presheaves of simplicial sets induces a coarse equivariant structure for enriched contravariant A-diagrams. If the presheaf of categories is a presheaf of groupoids G, then the associated homotopy theory is Quillen equivalent to the homotopy theory of simplicial presheaves over BG, and so the homotopy theory for the fibred site C/G is an invariant of the homotopy type of G. Similar homotopy invariance results obtain for presheaves of spectra and presheaves of symmetric spectra on C/G. In particular, stack cohomology can be calculated on the fibred site for a representing presheaf of groupoids.
