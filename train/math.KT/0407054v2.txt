Twisted complex K-theory can be defined for a space X equipped with a bundle of complex projective spaces, or, equivalently, with a bundle of C^*-algebras. Up to equivalence, the twisting corresponds to an element of H^3(X;\Z). We give a systematic account of the definition and basic properties of the twisted theory, emphasizing some points where it behaves differently from ordinary K-theory. (We omit, however, its relations to classical cohomology, which we shall treat in a sequel.) We develop an equivariant version of the theory for the action of a compact Lie group, proving that then the twistings are classified by the equivariant cohomology group H^3_G(X;\Z). We also consider some basic examples of twisted K-theory classes, related to those appearing in the recent work of Freed-Hopkins-Teleman.
