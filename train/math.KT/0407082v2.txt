For an oriented cohomology theory A and a relative cellular space X, we decompose the A-motive of X into a direct sum of twisted motives of the base spaces. We also obtain respective decompositions of the A-cohomology of X. Applying them, one can compute A(X), where X is an isotropic projective homogeneous variety and A means algebraic K-theory, motivic cohomology or algebraic cobordism MGL.
