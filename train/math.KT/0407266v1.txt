Let X be a finite connected graph, each of whose vertices has degree at least three. The fundamental group \Gamma of X is a free group and acts on the universal covering tree \Delta and on its boundary \partial \Delta, endowed with a natural topology and Borel measure. The crossed product C^*-algebra C(\partial \Delta) \rtimes \Gamma depends only on the rank of \Gamma and is a Cuntz-Krieger algebra whose structure is explicitly determined. The crossed product von Neumann algebra does not possess this rigidity. If X is homogeneous of degree q+1 then the von Neumann algebra L^\infty(\partial \Delta)\rtimes \Gamma is the hyperfinite factor of type III_\lambda where \lambda=1/{q^2} if X is bipartite, and \lambda=1/{q} otherwise.
