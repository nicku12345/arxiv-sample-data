Certain cocycles constructed by Connes are characters of p-summable Fredholm modules. In this article, we establish some consequences of the universal properties which these characters enjoy. Our main technical result is that the entire cyclic cohomology of the p-th Schatten ideal L^p (respectively, homology) is independent of p and isomorphic to the entire cyclic cohomology (respectively, homology) of the ideal of trace class operators L^1.
