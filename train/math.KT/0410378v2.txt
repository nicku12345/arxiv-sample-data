We characterize the smooth toric varieties for which the Merkurjev spectral sequence, connecting equivariant and ordinary K-theory, degenerates. We find under which conditions on the support of the fan the E^2 terms of the spectral sequence are invariants by subdivisions of the fan. Assuming these conditions, we describe explicitly the E^2 terms, linking them to the reduced homology of the fan.
