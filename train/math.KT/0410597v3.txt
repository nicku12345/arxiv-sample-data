Group cohomology of polynomial growth is defined for any finitely generated discrete group, using cochains that have polynomial growth with respect to the word length function. We give a geometric condition that guarantees that it agrees with the usual group cohomology and verify this condition for a class of combable groups. Our condition involves a chain complex that is closely related to exotic cohomology theories studied by Allcock and Gersten and by Mineyev.
