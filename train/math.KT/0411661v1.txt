In this paper we prove that Loday--Quillen--Tsygan Theorem generalizes to the case of coalgebras. Specifically, we show that the Chevalley--Eilenberg--Lie homology of the Lie coalgebra of infinite matrices over a coassociative coalgebra C is generated by the cyclic homology of the underlying coalgebra C as an exterior algebra.
