We consider smooth actions of totally disconnected groups on simplicial complexes and compare different equivariant cohomology groups associated to such actions. Our main result is that the bivariant equivariant cohomology theory introduced by Baum and Schneider can be described using equivariant periodic cyclic homology. This provides a new approach to the construction of Baum and Schneider as well as a computation of equivariant periodic cyclic homology for a natural class of examples. In addition we discuss the relation between cosheaf homology and equivariant Bredon homology. Since the theory of Baum and Schneider generalizes cosheaf homology we finally see that all these approaches to equivariant cohomology for totally disconnected groups are closely related.
