Using algebraic and topological K-theory together with complex C^*-algebras, we prove that every abelian group may be realized as the centre of a strongly torsion generated group whose integral homology is zero in dimension one and isomorphic to two arbitrarily prescribed abelian groups in dimensions two and three.
