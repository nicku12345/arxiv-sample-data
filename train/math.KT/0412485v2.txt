A central result here is the computation of the entire cyclic homology of canonical smooth subalgebras of stable continuous trace C*-algebras having smooth manifolds M as their spectrum. More precisely, the entire cyclic homology is shown to be canonically isomorphic to the continuous periodic cyclic homology for these algebras. By an earlier result of the authors, one concludes that the entire cyclic homology of the algebra is canonically isomorphic to the twisted de Rham cohomology of M.
