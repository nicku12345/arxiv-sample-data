We show that two C*-algebraic noncommutative tori are strongly Morita equivalent if and only if they have isomorphic ordered K_0-groups and centers, extending N. C. Phillips's result in the case that the algebras are simple. This is also generalized to the twisted group C*-algebras of arbitrary finitely generated abelian groups.
