The main objectives of this paper are to give general proofs of the following two facts:   A. For an operad \oo in \ab, let A be a simplicial \oo-algebra such that A_m is the \oo-subalgebra generated by (\sum_{i = 0}^{m} s_i(A_{m-1})), for every n, and let \N A be the Moore complex of A. Then \[ d (\N_m A) = \sum_{I} \gamma(\oo_{p} \otimes \bigcap_{i \in I_1}\ker d_i \otimes ... \otimes \bigcap_{i \in I_{p}}\ker d_i) \] where the sum runs over those partitions of [m-1], I = (I_1,...,I_p), p \geq 1, and \gamma is the action of \oo on A.   B. Let G be a simplicial group with Moore complex \N G in which the normal subgroup of G_n generated by the degenerate elements in dimension n is the proper G_n. Then d(\N_nG) = \prod_{I,J}[\bigcap_{i \in I}\ker d_i, \bigcap_{j \in J}\ker d_j], for I,J \subseteq [n-1] with I \cup J = [n-1].   In both cases, d_i is the i-th face of the corresponding simplicial object.   The former result completes and generalizes results from Ak\c{c}a and Arvasi, and Arvasi and Porter; the latter, results from Mutlu and Porter. Our approach to the problem is different from that of the cited works. We have first succeeded with a proof for the case of algebras over an operad by introducing a different description of the adjoint inverse of the normalization functor \N: \sab \to \ch. For the case of simplicial groups, we have then adapted the construction for the adjoint inverse used for algebras to get a simplicial group G \boxtimes \lb from the Moore complex of a simplicial group G. This construction could be of interest in itself.
