Let (G,{\mathfrak I},N,S) be an affine topological Tits system, and let \Gamma be a torsion free cocompact lattice in G. This article studies the coinvariants H_0(\Gamma; C(\Omega,{\mathbb Z})), where \Omega is the Furstenberg boundary of G. It is shown that the class [1] of the identity function in H_0(\Gamma; C(\Omega,{\mathbb Z})) has finite order, with explicit bounds for the order.   A similar statement applies to the K_0 group of the boundary crossed product C^*-algebra C(\Omega)\rtimes\Gamma. If the Tits system has type \widetilde A_2, exact computations are given, both for the crossed product algebra and for the reduced group C^*-algebra.
