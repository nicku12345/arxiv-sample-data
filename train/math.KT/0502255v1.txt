We prove a blow-up formula for cyclic homology which we use to show that infinitesimal K-theory satisfies cdh-descent. Combining that result with some computations of the cdh-cohomology of the sheaf of regular functions, we verify a conjecture of Weibel predicting the vanishing of algebraic K-theory of a scheme in degrees less than minus the dimension of the scheme, for schemes essentially of finite type over a field of characteristic zero.
