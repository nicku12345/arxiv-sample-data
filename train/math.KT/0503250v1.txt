We explain the relationship between various characteristic classes for smooth manifold bundles known as ``higher torsion'' classes. We isolate two fundamental properties that these cohomology classes may or may not have: additivity and transfer. We show that higher Franz-Reidemeister torsion and higher Miller-Morita-Mumford classes satisfy these axioms. Conversely, any characteristic class of smooth bundles satisfying the two axioms must be a linear combination of these two examples.   We also show how higher torsion invariants can be computed using only the axioms. Finally, we explain the conjectured formula of S. Goette relating higher analytic torsion classes and higher Franz-Reidemeister torsion.
