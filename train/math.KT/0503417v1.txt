We consider functors from the category of locally convex algebras to abelian groups and prove invariance under smooth homotopies for weakly J-stable algebras, where J is a harmonic operator ideal. This applies in particular to negative algebraic K-theory. We develop the technology of Kasparov modules in an algebraic setting in order to obtain the results. The article also includes a computation of the first algebraic K-theory of harmonic operator ideals.
