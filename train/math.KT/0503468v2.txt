We prove that "unitary deformation K-theory" takes products of finitely generated groups to coproducts of algebra spectra over ku, the connective K-theory spectrum. Additionally, we give spectral sequences for computing the homotopy groups of the unitary deformation K-theory of a group G and the cofiber of the Bott map in terms of PU(n)-equivariant K-theory and homology of spaces of G-representations.
