The goal of the present paper is the calculation of the equivariant twisted K-theory of a compact Lie group which acts on itself by conjugations, and elements of a TQFT-structure on the twisted K-groups. These results are originally due to D.S.Freed, M.J.Hopkins and C.Teleman. In this paper we redo their calculations in the framework of topological and differentiable stacks. We also show how moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces give rise to trivializations of twists.
