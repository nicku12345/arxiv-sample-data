Let G be a locally compact group, let X be a universal proper G-space, and let Z be a G-equivariant compactification of X that is H-equivariantly contractible for each compact subgroup H of G. Let W be the resulting boundary. Assuming the Baum-Connes conjecture for G with coefficients C and C(W), we construct an exact sequence that computes the map on K-theory induced by the embedding of the reduced group C*-algebra of G into the crossed product of G by C(W). This exact sequence involves the equivariant Euler characteristic of X, which we study using an abstract notion of Poincare duality in bivariant K-theory. As a consequence, if G is torsion-free and the Euler characteristic of the orbit space X/G is non-zero, then the unit element of the boundary crossed product is a torsion element whose order is equal to the absolute value of the Euler characteristic of X/G. Furthermore, we get a new proof of a theorem of Lueck and Rosenberg concerning the class of the de Rham operator in equivariant K-homology.
