This proceedings note introduces aspects of the authors' work relating mirror symmetry and integral variations of Hodge structure. The emphasis is on their classification of the integral variations of Hodge structure which can underly families of Calabi-Yau threefolds over the thrice-punctured sphere with b^3 = 4, or equivalently h^{2,1} = 1, and the related issues of geometric realization of these variations. The presentation parallels that of the first author's talk at the BIRS workshop.
