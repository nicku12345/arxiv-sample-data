Let G be a complex, connected, reductive algebraic group. In this paper we show analogues of the computations by Borho and MacPherson of the invariants and anti-invariants of the cohomology of the Springer fibres of the cone of nilpotent elements, \mathcal N, of \operatorname{Lie}(G) for the Steinberg variety Z of triples.   Using a general specialization argument we show that for a parabolic subgroup W_P \times W_Q of W \times W the space of W_P \times W_Q-invariants and the space of W_P \times W_Q-anti-invariants of H_{4n}(Z) are isomorphic to the top Borel-Moore homology groups of certain generalized Steinberg varieties introduced in [5].   The rational group algebra of the Weyl group W of G is isomorphic to the opposite of the top Borel-Moore homology H_{4n}(Z) of Z, where 2n = \dim \mathcal N. Suppose W_P \times W_Q is a parabolic subgroup of W \times W. We show that the space of W_P \times W_Q-invariants of H_{4n}(Z) is e_Q{\mathbb Q} We_P, where e_P is the idempotent in group algebra of W_P affording the trivial representation of W_P and e_Q is defined similarly. We also show that the space of W_P \times W_Q-anti-invariants of H_{4n}(Z) is \epsilon_Q{\mathbb Q} W\epsilon_P, where \epsilon_P is the idempotent in group algebra of W_P affording the sign representation of W_P and \epsilon_Q is defined similarly.
