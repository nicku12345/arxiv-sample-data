We establish the Thom isomorphism in twisted K-theory for any real vector bundle and develop the push-forward map in twisted K-theory for any differentiable proper map f: X\to Y (not necessarily K-oriented). The push-forward map generalizes the push-forward map in ordinary K-theory for any K-oriented differentiable proper map and the Atiyah-Singer index theorem of Dirac operators on Clifford modules. For D-branes satisfying Freed-Witten's anomaly cancellation condition in a manifold with a non-trivial B-field, we associate a canonical element in the twisted K-group to get the so-called D-brane charges.
