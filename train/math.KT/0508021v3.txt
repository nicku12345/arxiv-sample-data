The focus of this paper is on a poorly understood invariant of a commutative noetherian local ring R with residue field k: the stable cohomology modules \hat{Ext}^{n}_R(k,k), defined for each n\in\mathbb{Z} by Benson and Carlson, Mislin, and Vogel; it coincides with Tate cohomology when R is Gorenstein. It is proved that important properties of R, such as being regular, complete intersection, or Gorenstein, are detected by the k-rank of \hat{Ext}^{n}_R(k,k) for an arbitrary n\in\mathbb{Z}. Such numerical characterizations are made possible by results on the structure of \mathbb{Z}-graded k-algebra carried by \hat{Ext}^{n}_R(k,k). It is proved that in many cases this algebra is determined by the absolute cohomology algebra through a canonical homomorphism {Ext}^{n}_R(k,k)\to\hat{Ext}^{n}_R(k,k).
