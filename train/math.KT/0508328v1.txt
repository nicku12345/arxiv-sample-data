We give an explicit decription for univeral principal U(r)-bundles with periodic map by means of equivariant Stiefel manifolds. We then show that the associated equivariant vector bundle is equivalent to the canonical one given by G. Segal. Finally, we investigate some ideals involved in the equivariant K-theory of this classifying space.
