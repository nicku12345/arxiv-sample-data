We study cohomology groups of the Lie algebra of vector fields on the complex line, W_1, with values in the tensor fields in several variables. From a generalization by Scheja of the second Riemann (Hartogs) continuation theorem, we deduce a cohomology exact sequence of the subalgebra of W_1 consisting of vectors having a zero at the origin. As applications, we compute the cohomology algebra of W_1 with values in the functions on \Bbb C^n explicitly, and establish a certain vanishing theorem for the cohomology of W_1 with values in the quadratic differentials in several variables, which is closely related to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.
