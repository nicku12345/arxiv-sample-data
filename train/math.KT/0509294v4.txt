Controlled K-theory is used to show that algebraic K-theory of virtually abelian groups is described by an assembly map defined using possibly-infinite hyperelementary subgroups. The Farrell-Jones summand (coming from infinite subgroups) is parameterized by the rational projective space of the group, and a reduced version is torsion. Includes general material on assembly and universal spaces.
