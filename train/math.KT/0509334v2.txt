We show that Khovanov homology and Hochschild homology theories share common structure. In fact they overlap: Khovanov homology of a (2,n)-torus link can be interpreted as a Hochschild homology of the algebra underlining the Khovanov homology. In the classical case of Khovanov homology we prove the concrete connection. In the general case of Khovanov-Rozansky, sl(n), homology and their deformations we conjecture the connection. The best framework to explore our ideas is to use a comultiplication-free version of Khovanov homology for graphs developed by L. Helme-Guizon and Y. Rong and extended here to to \mathbb M-reduced case, and to noncommutative algebras (in the case of a graph being a polygon). In this framework we prove that for any unital algebra \A the Hochschild homology of \A is isomorphic to graph homology over \A of a polygon. We expect that this paper will encourage a flow of ideas in both directions between Hochschild/cyclic homology and Khovanov homology theories.
