The 2-primary torsion of the higher algebraic K-theory of the integers has been computed by Rognes and Weibel. In this paper we prove analogous results for the Hermitian K-theory of the integers with 2 inverted (denoted by Z'). We also prove in this case the analog of the Lichtenbaum conjecture for the hermitian K-theory of Z' : the homotopy fixed point set of a suitable Z/2 action on the classifying space of the algebraic K-theory of Z' is the hermitian K-theory of Z' after 2-adic completion.
