The computation of the Hochschild cohomology HH^*(T)=H^*(T,T) of a triangular algebra T=\pmatrix{A&M\cr 0&B\cr} was performed in {\bf[BG2]}, by the means of a certain triangular complex. We use this result here to show how HH^*(T) splits in little pieces whenever the bimodule M is decomposable. As an example, we express the Hilbert-Poincar\'{e} serie \sum\_{i=0}^\infty dim\_K HH^i(T\_m)t^i of the "general" Kr\"{o}necker algebra T\_m=\pmatrix{A&M^m\cr 0&B\cr} as a function of m\geq 1 and those of T (here the ground ring K is a field and dim\_K T<+\infty). The Lie algebra structure of HH^1(T) is also considered.
