We consider the "homotopy coniveau tower" for an arbitrary cohomology theory on smooth varieties over a field or a Dedekind domain. This tower is a generalization of the construction used by Bloch-Lichtenbaum and Friedlander-Suslin in their studies of the spectral sequence from motivic cohomology to K-theory. Our main result is that an application of the classical Chow's moving lemma and some categorical constructions make the homotopy coniveau tower strictly functorial when the base is a field, and functorial in the homotopy category when the base is a Dedekind domain.
