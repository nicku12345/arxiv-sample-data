Consider a smooth affine algebraic variety X over an algebraically closed field, and let a finite group G act on it. We assume that the characteristic of the field is greater than the dimension of X and the order of G. An explicit formula for multiplication on the Hochschild cohomology of a crossed product of k[G] and k[X] is given in terms of multivector fields on X and g-invariant subvarieties of X for g\in G.
