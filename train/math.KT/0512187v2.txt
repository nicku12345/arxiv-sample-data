In this article we describe the G\times G-equivariant K-ring of X, where X is a regular compactification of a connected complex reductive algebraic group G. Furthermore, in the case when G is a semisimple group of adjoint type, and X its wonderful compactification, we describe its ordinary K-ring K(X). More precisely, we prove that K(X) is a free module over K(G/B) of rank the cardinality of the Weyl group. We further give an explicit basis of K(X) over K(G/B), and also determine the structure constants with respect to this basis.
