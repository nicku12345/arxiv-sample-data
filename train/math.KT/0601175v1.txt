The aim of this note is to give a simplified proof of the surjectivity of the natural Milnor-Chow homomorphism \rho: K^M_n(A) \to CH^n(A,n) between Milnor K-theory and higher Chow groups for essentially smooth (semi-)local k-algebras A with k infinite. It implies the exactness of the Gersten resolution for Milnor K-theory at the generic point. Our method uses the Bloch-Levine moving technique and some properties of the Milnor K-theory norm for fields.
