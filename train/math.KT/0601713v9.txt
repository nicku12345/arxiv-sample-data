We describe the Voevodsky's category DM^{eff}_{gm} of motives in terms of Suslin complexes of smooth projective varieties. This shows that Voeovodsky's DM_{gm} is anti-equivalent to Hanamura's one. We give a description of any triangulated subcategory of DM^{eff}_{gm} (including the category of effective mixed Tate motives). We descibe 'truncation' functors t_N for N>0. t=t_0 generalizes the weight complex of Soule and Gillet; its target is K^b(Chow_{eff}); it calculates K_0(DM^{eff}_{gm}), and checks whether a motive is a mixed Tate one. t_N give a weight filtration and a 'motivic descent spectral sequence' for a large class of realizations, including the 'standard' ones and motivic cohomology. This gives a new filtration for the motivic cohomology of a motif. For 'standard realizations' for l,s\ge 0 we have a nice description of W_{l+s}H^i/W_{l-1}H^i(X) in terms of t_s(X).   We define the 'length of a motif' that (modulo standard conjectures) coincides with the 'total' length of the weight filtration of singular cohomology. Over a finite field t_0Q is (modulo Beilinson-Parshin conjecture) an equivalence.
