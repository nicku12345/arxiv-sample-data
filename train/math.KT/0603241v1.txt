In the paper M. Somekawa, {\it{On Milnor K-groups attached at semi-Abelian varieties}}, K-theory, \textbf{4} (1990) p.105, Somekawa conjectures that his Milnor K-group K(k,G_1,...,G_r) attached to semi-abelian varieties G_1,...,G_r over a field k is isomorphic to {\rm Ext}_{\mathcal{M}_k}^r(\mathbb{Z},G_1[-1] \otimes ... \otimes G_r[-1]) where \mathcal{M}_k is a certain category of motives over k. The purpose of this note is to give remarks on this conjecture, when we take \mathcal{M}_k as Voevodsky's category of motives {\rm DM}^{eff}_{-}(k) .
