A Poisson geometry arising from maximal commutative subalgebras is studied. A spectral sequence convergent to Hochschild homology with coefficients in a bimodule is presented. It depends on the choice of a maximal commutative subalgebra inducing appropriate filtrations. Its E^{2}_{p,q}-groups are computed in terms of canonical homology with values in a Poisson module defined by a given bimodule and a maximal commutative subalgebra.
