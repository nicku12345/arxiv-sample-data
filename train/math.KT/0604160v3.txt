We prove, under some mild conditions, that the equivariant twisted K-theory group of a crossed module admits a ring structure if the twisting 2-cocycle is 2-multiplicative. We also give an explicit construction of the transgression map T_1: H^*(\Gamma;A) \to H^{*-1}((N\rtimes \Gamma;A) for any crossed module N\to \Gamma and prove that any element in the image is \infty-multiplicative. As a consequence, we prove that, under some mild conditions, for a crossed module N \to \gm and any e \in \check{Z}^3(\Gamma;S^1), that the equivariant twisted K-theory group K^*_{e,\Gamma}(N) admits a ring structure. As an application, we prove that for a compact, connected and simply connected Lie group G, the equivariant twisted K-theory group K_{[c], G}^* (G) is endowed with a canonical ring structure K^{i+d}_{[c],G}(G)\otimes K^{j+d}_{[c],G}(G)\to K^{i+j+d}_{[c], G}(G), where d=dim G and [c]\in H^2(G\rtimes G;S^1).
