The paper is devoted to prove a version of Milnor-Moore Theorem for connected braided bialgebras that are infinitesimally cocommutative. Namely in characteristic different from 2, we prove that, for a given connected braided bialgebra A having a \lambda -cocommutative infinitesimal braiding for some regular element \lambda \neq 0 in the base field, then the infinitesimal braiding of A is of Hecke-type of mark \lambda and A is isomorphic as a braided bialgebra to the symmetric algebra of the braided subspace of its primitive elements.
