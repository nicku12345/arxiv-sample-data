We prove 2-out-of-3 property for rationality of motivic zeta function in distinguished triangles in Voevodsky's category DM. As an application, we show rationality of motivic zeta functions for all varieties whose motives are in the thick triangulated monoidal subcategory generated by motives of quasi-projective curves in DM. Joint with a result of P.O'Sullivan it also gives an example of a variety whose motive is not finite-dimensional while the motivic zeta function is rational.
