We study the relationship between trivial cocycles on the Torelli group and invariants of oriented integral homology 3-spheres. We give ncecessary and sufficient conditions for a function defined on the union of the Torelli groups to be an invariant of homology spheres. We apply this study to give a new purely algebraic construction of the Casson invariant and prove in this setting its surgery properties. As a by-product we get a new 2-torsion cohomology class in the second integral cohomology of the Torelli group.
