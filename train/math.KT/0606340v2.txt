We define a version of Hochschild homology and cohomology suitable for a class of algebras admitting compatible actions of bialgebras, called module algebras. We show this (co)homology, called Hopf--Hochschild (co)homology, can also be defined as a derived functor on the category of representations of a crossed product algebra. We investigate the relationship of our theory with Hopf cyclic cohomology and also prove Morita invariance of the Hopf--Hochschild (co)homology.
