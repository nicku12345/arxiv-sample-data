The {\ell}^1-convolution algebra of a semilattice is known to have trivial cohom ology in degrees 1,2 and 3 whenever the coefficient bimodule is symmetric. We ex tend this result to all cohomology groups of degree \geq 1 with symmetric coef ficients. Our techniques prove a stronger splitting result, namely that the spli tting can be made natural with respect to the underlying semilattice.
