For \Gamma a relatively hyperbolic group, we construct a model for the universal space among \Gamma-spaces with isotropy on the family VC of virtually cyclic subgroups of \Gamma. We provide a recipe for identifying the maximal infinite virtually cyclic subgroups of Coxeter groups which are lattices in O^+(n,1)= \iso(\mathbb H^n). We use the information we obtain to explicitly compute the lower algebraic K-theory of the Coxeter group \gt (a non-uniform lattice in O^+(3,1)). Part of this computation involves calculating certain Waldhausen Nil-groups for \mathbb Z[D_2], \mathbb Z[D_3].
