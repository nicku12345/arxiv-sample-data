We study Quillen's model category structure for homotopy of simplicial objects in the context of Janelidze, Marki and Tholen's semi-abelian categories. This model structure exists as soon as the base category A is regular Mal'tsev and has enough regular projectives; then the fibrations are the Kan fibrations of simplicial objects in A. When, moreover, A is semi-abelian, weak equivalences and homology isomorphisms coincide.
