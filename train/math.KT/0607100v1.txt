The theory of abelian categories proved very useful, providing an axiomatic framework for homology and cohomology of modules over a ring and, in particular, of abelian groups. For many years, a similar categorical framework has been lacking for non-abelian (co)homology, the subject of which includes the categories of non-abelian groups, of rings, Lie algebras, etc. The notion of semi-abelian category due to Janelidze, Marki and Tholen allows a unified study of many important homological properties of such categories. For instance, in any semi-abelian category, the classical diagram lemmas (the Short Five Lemma, the 3x3 Lemma, the Snake Lemma, Noether's Isomorphism Theorems) hold. The point of this thesis is, that the semi-abelian framework is indeed perfectly suited for the study of non-abelian (co)homology and the corresponding homotopy theory. It describes the foundations for a categorical homology theory that unifies many basic aspects of the classical (co)homology theories of e.g., groups, Lie algebras and crossed modules. Starting from homology of (proper) chain complexes and of simplicial objects, a semi-abelian version of Barr-Beck cotriple homology is introduced. A systematic study of the theory of Baer invariants in this context yields categorical versions of Hopf's formula (describing the second homology object in terms of commutators) and the Stallings-Stammbach sequence. We obtain a Universal Coefficient Theorem, a version of the Hochschild-Serre sequence, and an interpretation of the second cohomology group in terms of isomorphism classes of central extensions. Also, Quillen model category structures for homotopy of simplicial objects and internal categories are studied, and are shown to be compatible with the respective semi-abelian notions of homology.
