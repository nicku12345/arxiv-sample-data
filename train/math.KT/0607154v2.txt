We show that the existence of a Fredholm element of the zero calculus of pseudodifferential operators on a compact manifold with boundary with a given elliptic symbol is determined, up to stability, by the vanishing of the Atiyah-Bott obstruction. It follows that, up to small deformations and stability, the same symbols have Fredholm realizations in the zero calculus, in the scattering calculus and in the transmission calculus of Boutet de Monvel.
