For an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0, we give a cycle-theoretic description of the additive 4-term motivic exact sequence associated to the additive dilogarithm of J.-L. Cathelineau, that is the derivative of the Bloch-Wigner function, via the cubical additive higher Chow groups under one assumption. The 4-term functional equation of Cathelineau, an additive analogue of Abel's 5-term functional equation, is also discussed cycle-theoretically.
