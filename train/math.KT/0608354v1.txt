We establish the stable homotopy classification of elliptic pseudodifferential operators on manifolds with corners and show that the set of elliptic operators modulo stable homotopy is isomorphic to the K-homology group of some stratified manifold. By way of application, generalizations of some recent results due to Monthubert and Nistor are given.
