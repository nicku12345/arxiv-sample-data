In this paper we construct a bivariant Chern character for the equivariant KK-theory of a totally disconnected group with values in bivariant equivariant cohomology in the sense of Baum and Schneider. We prove in particular that the complexified left hand side of the Baum-Connes conjecture for a totally disconnected group is isomorphic to cosheaf homology. Moreover, it is shown that our transformation extends the Chern character defined by Baum and Schneider for profinite groups.
