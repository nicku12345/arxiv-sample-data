We exhibit a Poisson module restoring a twisted Poincare duality between Poisson homology and cohomology for the polynomial algebra R=C[X_1,...,X_n] endowed with Poisson bracket arising from a uniparametrised quantum affine space. This Poisson module is obtained as the semiclassical limit of the dualising bimodule for Hochschild homology of the corresponding quantum affine space. As a corollary we compute the Poisson cohomology of R, and so retrieve a result obtained by direct methods (so completely different from ours) by Monnier.
