We show that the inertia stack of a topological stack is again a topological stack. We further observe that the inertia stack of an orbispace is again an orbispace. We show how a U(1)-banded gerbe over an orbispace gives rise to a flat line bundle over its inertia stack. Via sheaf theory over topological stacks it gives rise to the twisted delocalized cohomology of the orbispace.   With these results and constructions we generalize concepts, which are well-known in the smooth framework, to the topological case. In the smooth case we show, that our sheaf-theoretic definition of twisted delocalized cohomology of orbispaces coincides with former definitions using a twisted de Rham complex.
