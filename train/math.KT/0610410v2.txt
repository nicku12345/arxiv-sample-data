We consider the lower central filtration of the free associative algebra A_n with n generators as a Lie algebra. We consider the associated graded Lie algebra. It is shown that this Lie algebra has a huge center which belongs to the cyclic words, and on the quotient Lie algebra by the center there acts the Lie algebra W_n of polynomial vector fields on \mathbb{C}^n. We compute the space [A_n,A_n]/[A_n,[A_n,A_n]] and show that it is isomorphic to the space \Omega^2_{closed}(\mathbb{C}^n) \oplus \Omega^4_{closed}(\mathbb{C}^n) \oplus \Omega^6_{closed}(\mathbb{C}^n) \oplus ....
