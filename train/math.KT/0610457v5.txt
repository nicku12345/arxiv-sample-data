Suppose given functors A x A' -F-> B -G-> C between abelian categories, an object X in A and an object X' in A' such that certain conditions hold. We show that, E_1-terms exempt, the Grothendieck spectral sequence of the composition of F(X,-) and G evaluated at X' is isomorphic to the Grothendieck spectral sequence of the composition of F(-,X') and G evaluated at X. So instead of "resolving X' twice", we may just as well "resolve X twice".
