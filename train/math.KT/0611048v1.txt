In this paper we use fractal geometry to investigate boundary aspects of the first homology group for finite coverings of the modular surface. We obtain a complete description of algebraically invisible parts of this homology group. More precisely, we first show that for any modular subgroup the geodesic forward dynamic on the associated surface admits a canonical symbolic representation by a finitely irreducible shift space. We then use this representation to derive an `almost complete' multifractal description of the higher--dimensional level sets arising from Manin--Marcolli's limiting modular symbols.
