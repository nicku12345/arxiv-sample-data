In this work we apply the techniques that were developed in [Lalin: An algebraic integration for Mahler measure] in order to study several examples of multivariable polynomials whose Mahler measure is expressed in terms of special values of the Riemann zeta function or Dirichlet L-series. The examples may be understood in terms of evaluations of regulators. Moreover, we apply the same techniques to the computation of generalized Mahler measures, in the sense of Gon and Oyanagi [Gon, Oyanagi: Generalized Mahler measures and multiple sine functions]
