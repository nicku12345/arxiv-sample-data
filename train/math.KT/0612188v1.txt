We give an explicit description of the set of all factorization structures, or twisting maps, existing between the algebras k^2 and k^2, and classify the resulting algebras up to isomorphism. In the process we relate several different approaches formerly taken to deal with this problem, filling a gap that appeared in a recent paper by Cibils. We also provide a counterexample to a result concerning the Hochschild (co)homology appeared in a paper by J.A. Guccione and J.J. Guccione.
