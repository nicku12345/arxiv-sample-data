We introduce unitary representations of continuous groupoids on continuous fields of Hilbert spaces. We investigate some properties of these objects and discuss some of the standard constructions from representation theory in this particular context. An important r\^{ole} is played by the regular representation. We conclude by discussing some operator algebra associated to continuous representations of groupoids; in particular, we analyse the relationship of continuous representations of G and continuous representations of the Banach *-category \hat{L}^{1}(G).
