Following Gorokhovsky and Lott and using an extension of the b-pseudodifferential calculus of Melrose, we give a formula for the Chern character of the Dirac index class of a longitudinal Dirac type operators on a foliated manifold with boundary. For this purpose we use the Bismut local index formula in the context of non commutative geometry. This paper uses heavily the methods and technical results developed by E.Leichtnam and P.Piazza.
