The quantum group SU_q(\ell+1) has a canonical action on the odd dimensional sphere S_q^{2\ell+1}. All odd spectral triples acting on the L_2 space of S_q^{2\ell+1} and equivariant under this action have been characterized. This characterization then leads to the construction of an optimum family of equivariant spectral triples having nontrivial K-homology class. These generalize the results of Chakraborty & Pal for SU_q(2).
