This survey article on bivariant Kasparov theory and E-theory is mainly intended for readers with a background in homotopical algebra and category theory. We approach both bivariant K-theories via their universal properties and equip them with extra structure such as a tensor product and a triangulated category structure. We discuss the construction of the Baum-Connes assembly map via localisation of categories and explain how this is related to the purely topological construction by Davis and Lueck.
