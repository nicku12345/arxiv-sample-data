Let G be a complex, linear algebraic group acting on an algebraic space X. The purpose of this paper is to prove a Riemann-Roch theorem (Theorem 5.3) which gives a description of the completion of the equivariant Grothendieck group G_0(G,X) at any maximal ideal of the representation ring R(G) \otimes \C in terms of equivariant cycles. The main new technique for proving this theorem is our non-abelian completion theorem (Theorem 4.3) for equivariant K-theory. Theorem 4.3 generalizes the classical localization theorems for diagonalizable group actions to arbitrary groups.
