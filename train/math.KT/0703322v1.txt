Conner and Hurrelbrink established a method of determining the structure of the 2-Sylow subgroup of the tame kernel K_2(\mathcal{O}) for certain quadratic number fields. Specifically, the 4-rank for these fields was characterized in terms of positive definite binary quadratic forms. Numerical calculations led to questions concerning possible density results of the 4-rank of tame kernels. In this paper, we succeed in giving affirmative answers to these questions.
