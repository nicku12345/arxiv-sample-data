There has been recent progress on computing the 4-rank of the tame kernel K_2(\mathcal{O}_F) for F a quadratic number field. For certain quadratic number fields, this progress has led to "density results'' concerning the 4-rank of tame kernels. These results were first mentioned in \cite{CH} and proven in \cite{RO}. In this paper, we consider some additional quadratic number fields and obtain further density results of 4-ranks of tame kernels. Additionally, we give tables which might indicate densities in some generality.
