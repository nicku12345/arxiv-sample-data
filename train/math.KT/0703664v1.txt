We study certain aspects of the algebraic K-theory of Hopf-Galois extensions. We show that the Cartan map from K-theory to G-theory of such an extension is a rational isomorphism, provided the ring of coinvariants is regular, the Hopf algebra is finite dimensional and its Cartan map is injective in degree zero. This covers the case of a crossed product of a regular ring with a finite group and has an application to the study of Iwasawa modules.
