This is the first of three articles on the Fibered Isomorphism Conjecture of Farrell and Jones for L-theory. We apply the general techniques developed in [15] and [16] to the L-theory case of the conjecture and prove several results.   Here we prove the conjecture, after inverting 2, for poly-free groups. In particular, it follows for braid groups. We also prove the conjecture for some classes of groups without inverting 2. In fact we consider a general class of groups satisfying certain conditions which includes the above groups and some other important classes of groups. We check that the properties we defined in [15] are satisfied in several instances of the conjecture.
