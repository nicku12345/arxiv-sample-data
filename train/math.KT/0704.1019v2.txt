We give explicit formulae for the continuous Hochschild and cyclic homology and cohomology of certain topological algebras. To this end we show that, for a continuous morphism \phi: \X\to \Y of complexes of complete nuclear DF-spaces, the isomorphism of cohomology groups H^n(\phi): H^n(\X) \to H^n(\Y) is automatically topological. The continuous cyclic-type homology and cohomology are described up to topological isomorphism for the following classes of biprojective \hat{\otimes}-algebras: the tensor algebra E \hat{\otimes} F generated by the duality (E, F, < \cdot, \cdot >) for nuclear Fr\'echet spaces E and F or for nuclear DF-spaces E and F; nuclear biprojective K\"{o}the algebras \lambda(P) which are Fr\'echet spaces or DF-spaces; the algebra of distributions \mathcal{E}^*(G) on a compact Lie group G.
