The paper establishes, for a wide class of locally compact groupoids \Gamma, the E-theoretic descent functor at the C^{*}-algebra level, in a way parallel to that established for locally compact groups by Guentner, Higson and Trout. The second section shows that \Gamma-actions on a C_{0}(X)-algebra B, where X is the unit space of \Gamma, can be usefully formulated in terms of an action on the associated bundle B^{\sharp}. The third section shows that the functor B\to C^{*}(\Gamma,B) is continuous and exact, and uses the disintegration theory of J. Renault. The last section establishes the existence of the descent functor under a very mild condition on \Gamma, the main technical difficulty involved being that of finding a \Gamma-algebra that plays the role of C_{b}(T,B)^{cont} in the group case.
