We study to what extent group C^\ast-algebras are characterized by their unitary groups. A complete characterization of which Abelian group C^\ast-algebras have isomorphic unitary groups is obtained. We compare these results with other unitary-related invariants of C^\ast(\Gamma), such as the K-theoretic K_1(C^\ast(\Gamma)) and find that C^\ast-algebras of nonisomorphic torsion-free Abelian groups may have isomorphic K_1-groups, in sharp contrast with the well-known fact that C^\ast(\Gamma) (even \Gamma) is characterized by the topological group structure of its unitary group when \Gamma  is torsion-free and Abelian.
