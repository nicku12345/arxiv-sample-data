We extend Geisser and Hesselholt's result on ``bi-relative K-theory'' from discrete rings to connective ring spectra. That is, if \mathcal A is a homotopy cartesian n-cube of ring spectra (satisfying connectivity hypotheses), then the (n+1)-cube induced by the cyclotomic trace K(\mathcal A)\to TC(\mathcal A) is homotopy cartesian after profinite completion. In other words, the fiber of the profinitely completed cyclotomic trace satisfies excision.
