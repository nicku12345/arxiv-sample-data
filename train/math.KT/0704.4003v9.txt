This paper is dedicated to triangulated categories endowed with weight structures (a new notion; D. Pauksztello has independently introduced them as co-t-structures). This axiomatizes the properties of stupid truncations of complexes in K(B). We also construct weight structures for Voevodsky's categories of motives and for various categories of spectra. A weight structure w defines Postnikov towers of objects; these towers are canonical and functorial 'up to morphisms that are zero on cohomology'. For Hw being the heart of w (in DM_{gm} we have Hw=Chow) we define a canonical conservative 'weakly exact' functor t from our C to a certain weak category of complexes K_w(Hw). For any (co)homological functor H:C\to A for an abelian A we construct a weight spectral sequence T:H(X^i[j])\implies H(X[i+j]) where (X^i)=t(X); it is canonical and functorial starting from E_2. This spectral sequences specializes to the 'usual' (Deligne's) weight spectral sequences for 'classical' realizations of motives and to Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences for spectra. Under certain restrictions, we prove that K_0(C)\cong K_0(Hw) and K_0(End C)\cong K_0(End Hw).   The definition of a weight structure is almost dual to those of a t-structure; yet several properties differ. One can often construct a certain t-structure which is 'adjacent' to w and vice versa. This is the case for the Voevodsky's DM^{eff}_- (one obtains certain new Chow weight and t-structures for it; the heart of the latter is 'dual' to Chow^{eff}) and for the stable homotopy category. The Chow t-structure is closely related to unramified cohomology.
