In this article we build a Quillen model category structure on the category of sequentially complete l.m.c.-C*-algebras such that the corresponding homotopy classes of maps Ho(A,B) for separable C*-algebras A and B coincide with the Kasparov groups KK(A,B). This answers an open question posed by Mark Hovey about the possibility of describing KK-theory for C*-algebras using the language of Quillen model categories.
