Let \Tt be an aperiodic and repetitive tiling of \RM^d with finite local complexity. We present a spectral sequence that converges to the K-theory of \Tt with E_2-page given by a new cohomology that will be called PV in reference to the Pimsner-Voiculescu exact sequence. It is a generalization of the Serre spectral sequence. The PV cohomology of \Tt generalizes the cohomology of the base space of a fibration with local coefficients in the K-theory of its fiber. We prove that it is isomorphic to the \v{C}ech cohomology of the hull of \Tt (a compactification of the family of its translates).
