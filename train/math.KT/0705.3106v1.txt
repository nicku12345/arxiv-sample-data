Let R be a commutative ring, G a group and RG its group ring. Let \phi_{\sigma} : RG\to RG denote the involution defined by \phi_{\sigma} (\sum r_{g}g) = \sum r_{g} \sigma (g) g^{-1}, where \sigma:G\to \{\pm 1\} is a group homomorphism (called an orientation morphism). An element x in RG is said to be antisymmetric if \phi_{\sigma} (x) =-x. We give a full characterization of the groups G and its orientations for which the antisymmetric elements of RG commute.
