In these notes, we survey the homology of the loop group Omega(K) of a compact group K, also known as the affine Grassmannian of a complex loop group. Using the Bott picture of H_*(Omega(K)), the homology algebra or Pontryagin ring, we obtain two new results: A. Factorization of affine Schubert homology classes. B. Definition of affine Schubert polynomials representing the affine Schubert homology classes in all types, in terms similar to ordinary Schubert polynomials.
