In 1987 Roberts completed the proof of the New Intersection Theorem (NIT) by settling the mixed characteristic case using local Chern characters, as developed by Fulton and also by Roberts. His proof has been the only one recorded of the NIT in mixed characteristic.   This paper gives a new proof of this theorem, one which mostly parallels Roberts' original proof, but avoids the use of local Chern characters. Instead, the proof here uses Adams operations on K-theory with supports as developed by Gillet-Soule.
