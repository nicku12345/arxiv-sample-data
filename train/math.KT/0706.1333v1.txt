Let \g_1 and \g_2 be two dg Lie algebras, then it is well-known that the L_\infty morphisms from \g_1 to \g_2 are in 1-1 correspondence to the solutions of the Maurer-Cartan equation in some dg Lie algebra \Bbbk(\g_1,\g_2). Then the gauge action by exponents of the zero degree component \Bbbk(\g_1,\g_2)^0 on MC\subset\Bbbk(\g_1,\g_2)^1 gives an explicit "homotopy relation" between two L_\infty morphisms. We prove that the quotient category by this relation (that is, the category whose objects are L_\infty algebras and morphisms are L_\infty morphisms modulo the gauge relation) is well-defined, and is a localization of the category of dg Lie algebras and dg Lie maps by quasi-isomorphisms. As localization is unique up to an equivalence, it is equivalent to the Quillen-Hinich homotopical category of dg Lie algebras [Q1,2], [H1,2]. Moreover, we prove that the Quillen's concept of a homotopy coincides with ours. The last result was conjectured by V.Dolgushev [D].
