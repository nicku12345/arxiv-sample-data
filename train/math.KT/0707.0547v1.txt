In this paper, we construct a local ring A such that the kernel of the map G_0(A)\subq \to G_0(\hat{A})\subq is not zero, where \hat{A} is the comletion of A with respect to the maximal ideal, and G_0()\subq is the Grothendieck group of finitely generated modules with rational coefficient. In our example, A is a two-dimensional local ring which is essentially of finite type over {\Bbb C}, but it is not normal.
