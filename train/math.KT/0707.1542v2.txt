After introducing a noncommutative counterpart of commutative algebraic geometry based on monoidal categories of quasi-coherent sheaves we show that various constructions in noncommutative geometry (e.g. Morita equivalences, Hopf-Galois extensions) can be given geometric meaning extending their geometric interpretations in the commutative case. On the other hand, we show that some constructions in commutative geometry (e.g. faithfully flat descent theory, principal fibrations, equivariant and infinitesimal geometry) can be interpreted as noncommutative geometric constructions applied to commutative objects. For such generalized geometry we define global invariants constructing cyclic objects from which we derive Hochschild, cyclic and periodic cyclic homology (with coefficients) in the standard way.
