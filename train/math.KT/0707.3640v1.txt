The deformation bicomplex of a module-algebra over a bialgebra is constructed. It is then applied to study algebraic deformations in which both the module structure and the algebra structure are deformed. The cases of module-coalgebras, comodule-(co)algebras, and (co)module-bialgebras are also considered.
