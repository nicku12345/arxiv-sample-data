We show that the image of Connes-Karoubi-Chern character, restricted to the image of the Baum-Connes assembly map in the Bott-periodized topological K-theory of the complex group algebra, lies in the elliptic summand of the (periodic) cyclic homology of the group algebra. This implies that for any (weighted) ell-1 completion of the group algebra, rational surjectivity of the Baum-Connes assembly map implies the generalized Bass conjecture for that algebra.
