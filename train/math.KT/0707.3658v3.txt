By deploying dense subalgebras of \ell^1(G) we generalize the Bass conjecture in terms of Connes' cyclic homology theory. In particular, we propose a stronger version of the \ell^1-Bass Conjecture. We prove that hyperbolic groups relative to finitely many subgroups, each of which posses the polynomial conjugacy-bound property and nilpotent periodicity property, satisfy the \ell^1-Stronger-Bass Conjecture. Moreover, we determine the conjugacy-bound for relatively hyperbolic groups and compute the cyclic cohomology of the \ell^1-algebra of any discrete group.
