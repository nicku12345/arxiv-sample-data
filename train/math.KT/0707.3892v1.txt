This paper is a continuation of arXiv:0706.3511, where we obtained a local index formula for matrix elliptic operators with shifts. Here we establish a cohomological index formula of Atiyah-Singer type for elliptic differential operators with shifts acting between section spaces of arbitrary vector bundles. The key step is the construction of closed graded traces on certain differential algebras over the symbol algebra for this class of operators.
