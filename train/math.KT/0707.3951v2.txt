In this paper we show that a strongly homotopy commutative (or C_\infty-) algebra with an invariant inner product on its cohomology can be uniquely extended to a symplectic C_\infty-algebra (an \infty-generalisation of a commutative Frobenius algebra introduced by Kontsevich). This result relies on the algebraic Hodge decomposition of the cyclic Hochschild cohomology of a \ci-algebra and does not generalize to algebras over other operads.
