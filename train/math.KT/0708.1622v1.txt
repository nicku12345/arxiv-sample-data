Given a quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme X, a bijection between the tensor localizing subcategories of finite type in Qcoh(X) and the set of all subsets Y\subseteq X of the form Y=\bigcup_{i\in\Omega}Y_i, with X\setminus Y_i quasi-compact and open for all i\in\Omega, is established. As an application, there is constructed an isomorphism of ringed spaces (X,O_X)-->(Spec(Qcoh(X)),O_{Qcoh(X)}), where (Spec(Qcoh(X)),O_{Qcoh(X)}) is a ringed space associated to the lattice of tensor localizing subcategories of finite type. Also, a bijective correspondence between the tensor thick subcategories of perfect complexes \perf(X) and the tensor localizing subcategories of finite type in Qcoh(X) is established.
