Topological Andr\'e-Quillen homology for commutative S-algebras was introduced by Basterra following work of Kriz, and has been intensively studied by several authors. In this paper we discuss it as a homology theory on CW S-algebras and apply it to obtain results on minimal atomic p-local S-algebras which generalise those of Baker and May for p-local spectra and simply connected spaces. We exhibit some new examples of minimal atomic S-algebras.
