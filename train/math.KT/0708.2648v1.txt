We describe a categorical framework for the classification of D-branes on noncommutative spaces using techniques from bivariant K-theory of C*-algebras. We present a new description of bivariant K-theory in terms of noncommutative correspondences which is nicely adapted to the study of T-duality in open string theory. We systematically use the diagram calculus for bivariant K-theory as detailed in our previous paper. We explicitly work out our theory for a number of examples of noncommutative manifolds.
