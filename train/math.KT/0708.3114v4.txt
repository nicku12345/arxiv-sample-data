In this paper, we develop differential twisted K-theory and define a twisted Chern character on twisted K-theory which depends on a choice of connection and curving on the twisting gerbe. We also establish the general Riemann-Roch theorem in twisted K-theory and find some applications in the study of twisted K-theory of compact simple Lie groups.
