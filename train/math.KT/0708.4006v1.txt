This paper exposes the fundamental role that the Drinfel'd double \dkg of the group ring of a finite group G and its twists \dbkg, \beta \in Z^3(G,\uk) as defined by Dijkgraaf--Pasquier--Roche play in stringy orbifold theories and their twistings.   The results pertain to three different aspects of the theory. First, we show that G--Frobenius algebras arising in global orbifold cohomology or K-theory are most naturally defined as elements in the braided category of \dkg--modules. Secondly, we obtain a geometric realization of the Drinfel'd double as the global orbifold K--theory of global quotient given by the inertia variety of a point with a G action on the one hand and more stunningly a geometric realization of its representation ring in the braided category sense as the full K--theory of the stack [pt/G]. Finally, we show how one can use the co-cycles \beta above to twist a) the global orbifold K--theory of the inertia of a global quotient and more importantly b) the stacky K--theory of a global quotient [X/G]. This corresponds to twistings with a special type of 2--gerbe.
