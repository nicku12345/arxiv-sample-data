Our aim in this paper is to compute the entire cyclic cohomology of noncommutative 2-tori. First of all, we clarify their algebraic structure of noncommutative 2-tori as a F^*-algebra, according to the idea of Elliott-Evans. Actually, they are the inductive limit of subhomogeneous F^*-algebras. Using such a result, we compute their entire cyclic cohomology, which is isomorphic to their periodic one as a complex vector space.
