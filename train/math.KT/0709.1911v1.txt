We consider complexes (\X, d) of nuclear Fr\'echet spaces and continuous boundary maps d_n with closed ranges and prove that, up to topological isomorphism,  (H_{n}(\X, d))^* \iso H^{n}(\X^*,d^*), where (H_{n}(\X,d))^* is the strong dual space of the homology group of (\X,d) and  H^{n}(\X^*,d^*) is the cohomology group of the strong dual complex (\X^*,d^*). We use this result to establish the existence of topological isomorphisms in the K\"{u}nneth formula for the cohomology of complete nuclear DF-complexes and in the K\"{u}nneth formula for continuous Hochschild cohomology of nuclear \hat{\otimes}-algebras which are Fr\'echet spaces or DF-spaces for which all boundary maps of the standard homology complexes have closed ranges. We describe explicitly continuous Hochschild and cyclic cohomology groups of certain tensor products of \hat{\otimes}-algebras which are Fr\'echet spaces or nuclear DF-spaces.
