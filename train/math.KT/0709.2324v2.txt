The Fredholm representation theory is well adapted to construction of homotopy invariants of non simply connected manifolds on the base of generalized Hirzebruch formula. Earlier a natural family of the Fredholm representations was constructed that lead to a symmetric vector bundle on completion of the fundamental group with a modification of the Higson-Roe corona when the completion is a closed manifold. Here we will discuss a homology version of symmetry in the case when completion with a modification of the Higson-Roe corona is a manifold with boundary. The results were developed during the visit of the first author in Ancona on March, 2007. The second version is supplemented by details of consideration the case of manifolds with boundary.
