We interpret certain equivariant Kasparov groups as equivariant representable K-theory groups. We compute these groups via a classifying space and as K-theory groups of suitable sigma-C*-algebras. We also relate equivariant vector bundles to these sigma-C*-algebras and provide sufficient conditions for equivariant vector bundles to generate representable K-theory. Mostly we work in the generality of locally compact groupoids with Haar system.
