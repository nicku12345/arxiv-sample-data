We introduce concepts of intermediate rank for countable groups that "interpolate" between consecutive values of the classical (integer-valued) rank. Various classes of groups are proved to have intermediate rank behaviors. We are especially interested in interpolation between rank 1 and rank 2. For instance, we construct groups "of rank 7/4". Our setting is essentially that of non positively curved spaces, where concepts of intermediate rank include polynomial rank, local rank, and mesoscopic rank. The resulting framework has interesting connections to operator algebras. We prove property RD in many cases where intermediate rank occurs. This gives a new family of groups satisfying the Baum-Connes conjecture. We prove that the reduced C^*-algebras of groups of rank 7/4 have stable rank 1.
