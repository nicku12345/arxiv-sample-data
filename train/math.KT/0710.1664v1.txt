In this paper we introduce the 2-typical de Rham-Witt complex for arbitrary commutative, unital rings and log-rings. We describe this complex for the rings \Z and \Z_{(2)}, for the log-ring (\Z_{(2)},M) with the canonical log-structure, and we describe its behaviour under polynomial extensions. In an appendix we also describe the p-typical de Rham-Witt complex of (\Z_{(p)},M) for p odd.
