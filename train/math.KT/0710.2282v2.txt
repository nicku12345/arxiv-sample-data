We study the Farrell-Jones Conjecture with coefficients in an additive G-category with involution. This is a variant of the L-theoretic Farrell-Jones Conjecture which originally deals with group rings with the standard involution. We show that this formulation of the conjecture can be applied to crossed product rings R*G equipped with twisted involutions and automatically implies the a priori more general fibered version.
