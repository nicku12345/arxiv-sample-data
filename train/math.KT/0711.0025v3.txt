We study several duality isomorphisms between equivariant bivariant K-theory groups, generalising Kasparov's first and second Poincare duality isomorphisms.   We use the first duality to define an equivariant generalisation of Lefschetz invariants of generalised self-maps. The second duality is related to the description of bivariant Kasparov theory for commutative C*-algebras by families of elliptic pseudodifferential operators. For many groupoids, both dualities apply to a universal proper G-space. This is a basic requirement for the dual Dirac method and allows us to describe the Baum-Connes assembly map via localisation of categories.
