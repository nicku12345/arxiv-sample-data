Let X be a locally compact space with a continuous proper action of a locally compact group G. Assuming that X satisfies a certain kind of duality in equivariant bivariant Kasparov theory, we can enrich the classical construction of Lefschetz numbers to equivariant K-homology classes. We compute the Lefschetz invariants for self-maps of finite-dimensional simplicial complexes and of self-maps of smooth manifolds. The resulting invariants are independent of the extra structure used to compute them. Since smooth manifolds can be triangulated, we get two formulas for the same Lefschetz invariant in these cases. The resulting identity is closely related to the equivariant Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem of Luck and Rosenberg.
