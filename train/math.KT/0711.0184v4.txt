The formality theorem for Hochschild chains of the algebra of functions on a smooth manifold gives us a version of the trace density map from the zeroth Hochschild homology of a deformation quantization algebra to the zeroth Poisson homology. We propose a version of the algebraic index theorem for a Poisson manifold which is based on this trace density map.
