In this paper, the Lawson homology and morphic cohomology are defined on the Chow motives. We also define the rational coefficient Lawson homology and morphic cohomology of the Chow motives of finite quotient projective varieties. As a consequence, we obtain a formula for the Hilbert scheme of points on a smooth complex projective surface. Further discussion concerning generic finite maps is given. As a result, we give examples of self-product of smooth projective curves with nontrivial Griffiths groups by using a result of Ceresa.
