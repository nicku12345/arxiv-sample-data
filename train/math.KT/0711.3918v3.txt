The paper is suspended. The reason: as was noted by prof. H. Esnault, Theorem 2.1.1 of the previous version (as well as the related Theorem 6.1.1 of http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/9908/9908037v2.pdf of D. Arapura and P. Sastry) is wrong unless one assumes H to be a generic hyperplane section. Hence the proofs of all results starting from 2.3 contain gaps.   The author hopes to correct this (somehow) in a future version. At least, most of the results follow from certain "standard" motivic conjectures (see part 1 of Remark 3.2.4 in the previous version). If the author would not find a way to prove Theorems 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 (without 2.1.1), then in the next version of the preprint the results of section 4 will be deduced from certain conjectures; certainly this is not a very exiting result.
