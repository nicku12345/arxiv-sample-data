Using Paschke-Higson duality, we can get a natural index pairing K_{i}(A) \times K_{i+1}(D_{\Phi}) \to \boldsymbol{Z} \quad (i=0,1) (\mbox{mod}2), where A is a separable C\sp*-algebra, and \Phi is a representation of A on a separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space H. It is proved that this is a special case of the Kasparov Product. As a step, we show a proof of Bott-periodicity for KK-theory asserting that \mathbb{C}_1 and S are KK-equivalent using the odd index pairing.
