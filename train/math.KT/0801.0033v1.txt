In a recent paper arXiv:0705.3190, we gave a general construction of a para-cocyclic structure on a cosimplex, associated to a so called admissible septuple -- consisting of two categories, three functors and two natural transformations, subject to compatibility relations. The main examples of such admissible septuples were induced by algebra homomorphisms. In this note we provide more general examples coming from appropriate (`locally braided') morphisms of monads.
