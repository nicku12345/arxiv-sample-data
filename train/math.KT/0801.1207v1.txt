Thanks to the theory of determinants over an Ore domain, also called Adjamagbo determinant by the Russian school of non commutative algebra, we extend to any Weyl algebra over a field of characteristic zero Suslin theorem solving what Suslin himself called the K_1-analogue of the well-known Serre Conjecture and asserting that for any integer n greater than 2, any n by n matrix with coefficients in any algebra of polynomials over a field and with determinant one is the product of elementary matrices with coefficients in this algebra
