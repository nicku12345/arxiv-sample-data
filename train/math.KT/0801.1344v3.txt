We use homological ideals in triangulated categories to get a sufficient criterion for a pair of subcategories in a triangulated category to be complementary. We apply this criterion to construct the Baum-Connes assembly map for locally compact groups and torsion-free discrete quantum groups. Our methods are related to the abstract version of the Adams spectral sequence by Brinkmann and Christensen.
