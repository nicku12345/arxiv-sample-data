This article presents some computations for a new topological invariant for foliations introduced some years ago by the author using techniques from noncommutative geometry, in particular the pairing between K-Theory and cyclic cohomology. The motivation came from theoretical physics, more specifically from flat vector bundles, in physics terminology from potentials which are pure gauge.
