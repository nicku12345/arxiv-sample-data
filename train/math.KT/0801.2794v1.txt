The purpose of this shord paper is to make the link between the fundamental work of Atiyah, Bott and Shapiro (MR0167985/29/5250) and twisted K-theory (MR0282363/43/8075). This link was implicit for a long time in the literature (for the description of the real K-theory of spheres as an example) but was not explicitly defined before.
