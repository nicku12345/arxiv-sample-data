In this paper we begin a study of the space of unbounded self-adjoint Fredholm operators as a classifying space for K^{1}(X), with the goal of incorporating the information in the eigenspaces and eigenvalues of the operators. In particular, the role that the multiplicity of eigenvalues plays is developed here.
