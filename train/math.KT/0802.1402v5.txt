We continue studying net bundles over partially ordered sets (posets), defined as the analogues of ordinary fibre bundles. To this end, we analyze the connection between homotopy, net homology and net cohomology of a poset, giving versions of classical Hurewicz theorems. Focusing our attention on Hilbert net bundles, we define the K-theory of a poset and introduce functions over the homotopy groupoid satisfying the same formal properties as Chern classes. As when the given poset is a base for the topology of a space, our results apply to the category of locally constant bundles.
