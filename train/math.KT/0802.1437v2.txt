The paper discusses four approaches to the biextension of Chow groups and their equivalences. These are the following: an explicit construction given by S.Bloch, a construction in terms of the Poincare biextension of dual intermediate Jacobians, a construction in terms of K-cohomology, and a construction in terms of determinant of cohomology of coherent sheaves. A new approach to J.Franke's Chow categories is given. An explicit formula for the Weil pairing of algebraic cycles is obtained.
