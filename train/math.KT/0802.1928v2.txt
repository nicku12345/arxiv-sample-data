The K-theory of a polynomial ring R[t] contains the K-theory of R as a summand. For R commutative and containing \Q, we describe K_*(R[t])/K_*(R) in terms of Hochschild homology and the cohomology of K\"ahler differentials for the cdh topology. We use this to address Bass' question, on whether K_n(R)=K_n(R[t]) implies K_n(R)=K_n(R[t_1,t_2]). The answer is positive over fields of infinite transcendence degree; the companion paper arXiv:1004.3829 provides a counterexample over a number field.
