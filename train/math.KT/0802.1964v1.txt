Over a field of characteristic zero, we introduce two motivic operations on additive higher Chow cycles: analogues of the Connes boundary B operator and the shuffle product on Hochschild complexes. The former allows us to apply the formalism of mixed complexes to additive Chow complexes building a bridge between additive higher Chow theory and additive K-theory. The latter induces a wedge product on additive Chow groups for which we show that the Connes operator is a graded derivation for the wedge product using a variation of a Totaro's cycle. Hence, the additive higher Chow groups with the wedge product and the Connes operator form a commutative differential graded algebra. On zero-cycles, they induce the wedge product and the exterior derivation on the absolute K\"ahler differentials, answering a question of S. Bloch and H. Esnault.
