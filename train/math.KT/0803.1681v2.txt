Recently Cortinas-Haesemayer-Walker-Weibel gave affirmative answer to Bass' 1972 question on NK-groups for algebras of essentially finite type over large fields of characteristic 0. Here we give an alternative short proof of this result for algebras of finite type over such fields. Our approach is based on classical techniques in higher K-theory of rings and a direct K_i-analogue of an old observation of Murthy-Pedrini, dating back from the same 1972.
