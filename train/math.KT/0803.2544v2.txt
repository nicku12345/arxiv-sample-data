We say that a group G has cohomology almost everywhere finitary if and only if the nth cohomology functors of G commute with filtered colimits for all sufficiently large n.   In this paper, we show that if G is a group in Kropholler's class LHF with cohomology almost everywhere finitary, then G has an Eilenberg--Mac Lane space K(G,1) which is dominated by a CW-complex with finitely many n-cells for all sufficiently large n. It is an open question as to whether this holds for arbitrary G.   We also remark that the converse holds for any group G.
