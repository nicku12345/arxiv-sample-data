A Frechet algebra endowed with a multiplicatively convex topology has two types of invariants: homotopy invariants (topological K-theory and periodic cyclic homology) and secondary invariants (multiplicative K-theory and the non-periodic versions of cyclic homology). The aim of this paper is to establish a Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem relating direct images for homotopy and secondary invariants of Frechet m-algebras under finitely summable quasihomomorphisms.
