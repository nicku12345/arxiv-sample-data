In the present paper we study bundles equipped with extra homotopy conditions, in particular so-called simplicial n-bundles. It is shown that (under some condition) the classifying space of 1-bundles is the double coset space of some finite dimensional Lie group. We also establish some relation between our bundles and C*-algebras.
