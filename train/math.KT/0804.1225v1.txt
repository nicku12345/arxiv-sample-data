In 1996, Berline and Vergne gave a cohomological formula for the index of a transversally elliptic operator. In this paper we propose a new point of view where the cohomological formulae make use of equivariant Chern characters with generalized coefficients and with compact suppport. This kind of Chern characters was studied by the authors in a previous paper (see arXiv:0801.2822).
