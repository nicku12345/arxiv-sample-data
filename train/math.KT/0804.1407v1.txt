We define relative support varieties with respect to some fixed module over a finite dimensional algebra. These varieties share many of the standard properties of classical support varieties. Moreover, when introducing finite generation conditions on cohomology, we show that relative support varieties contain homological information on the modules involved. As an application, we provide a new criterion for a selfinjective algebra to be of wild representation type.
