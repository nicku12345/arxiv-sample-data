Let \L be an artin algebra. Iyama conjectures that the endomorphism ring of any two maximal l-orthogonal modules, M_1 and M_2, are derived equivalent. He proves the conjecture for l=1, and for l>1 he gives some orthogonality condition on M_1 and M_2, such that the \End_\L(M_2)^\op-\End_\L(M_1)-bimodule \Hom_\L(M_2,M_1) is tilting, which implies that the rings \End_\L(M_2) and \End_\L(M_1) are derived equivalent (see \cite{H}). The purpose of this paper is to characterize tilting modules of the form \Hom_\L(M_2,M_1) in terms of the relative theories induced by the \L-modules M_1 and M_2, thus getting a generilization of Iyama's result.
