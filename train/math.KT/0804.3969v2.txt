We present a higher index theorem for a certain class of etale one-dimensional complex-analytic groupoids. The novelty is the use of the local anomaly formula established in a previous paper, which represents the bivariant Chern character of a quasihomomorphism as the chiral anomaly associated to a renormalized non-commutative chiral field theory. In the present situation the geometry is non-metric and the corresponding field theory can be renormalized in a purely conformal way, by exploiting the complex-analytic structure of the groupoid only. The index formula is automatically localized at the automorphism subset of the groupoid and involves a cap-product with the sum of two different cyclic cocycles over the groupoid algebra. The first cocycle is a trace involving a generalization of the Lefschetz numbers to higher-order fixed points. The second cocycle is a non-commutative Todd class, constructed from the modular automorphism group of the algebra.
