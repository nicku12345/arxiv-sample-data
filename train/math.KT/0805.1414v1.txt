The Steenrod operations (mod p) in Chow theory are defined for any prime p for a quasi-projective scheme, without appealing to the results of any domain but Milnor's K-theory. The new definition also gives a direct formula that depends only on the scheme itself. Additionally, basic properties of the operations are proved from the new definition. The idea is based on a construction of M. Rost.
