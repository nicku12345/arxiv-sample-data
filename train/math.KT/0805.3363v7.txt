It is well-known that the Kontsevich formality [K97] for Hochschild cochains of the polynomial algebra A=S(V^*) fails if the vector space V is infinite-dimensional. In the present paper, we study the corresponding obstructions. We construct an L_\infty structure on polyvector fields on V having the even degree Taylor components, with the degree 2 component given by the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket, but having as well higher non-vanishing Taylor components. We prove that this L_\infty algebra is quasi-isomorphic to the corresponding Hochschild cochain complex. We prove that our L_\infty algebra is L_\infty quasi-isomorphic to the Lie algebra of polyvector fields on V with the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket, if V is finite-dimensional.
