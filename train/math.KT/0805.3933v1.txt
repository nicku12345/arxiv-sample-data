We give a necessary condition for Morita equivalence of simple Generalized Weyl algebras of classical type. We propose a reformulation of Hodges' result, which describes Morita equivalences in case the polynomial defining the Generalized Weyl algebra has degree 2, in terms of isomorphisms of quantum tori, inspired by similar considerations in noncommutative differential geometry. We study how far this link can be generalized for n\ge 3.
