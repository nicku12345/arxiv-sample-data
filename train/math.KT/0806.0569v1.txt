In a triangulated symmetric monoidal closed category, there are natural dualities induced by the internal Hom. Given a monoidal functor f^* between two such catgories and adjoint couples (f^*,f_*) and (f_*,f^!), we prove the necessary commutative diagrams for f^* and f_* to respect certain dualities, for a projection formula to hold between them (as duality preserving functors) and for classical base change and composition formulas to hold when such duality preserving functors are composed. This framework is for example useful to define push-forwards for Witt groups.
