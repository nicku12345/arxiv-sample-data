We give a complete classification (up to smooth homotopy) of finitely summable Fredholm representations (Fredholm modules) over higher rank groups and lattices. Our results are a direct consequence of work of Bader, Furman, Gelander and Monod on generalisations of Kazhdan's property T for locally compact groups.
