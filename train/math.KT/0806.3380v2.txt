In paper 0704.4003, Bondarko recently defined the notion of weight structure, and proved that the category \DgM of geometrical motives over a perfect field k, as defined and studied by Voevodsky, Suslin and Friedlander, is canonically equipped with such a structure. Building on this result, and under a condition on the weights avoided by the boundary motive, we describe a method to construct intrinsically in \DgM a motivic version of interior cohomology of smooth, but possibly non-projective schemes. In a sequel to this work, this method will be applied to Shimura varieties.
