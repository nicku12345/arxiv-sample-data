The goal of this paper is to present proofs of two results of Markus Rost: the Chain Lemma and the Norm Principle. These are the final steps needed to complete the publishable verification of the Bloch-Kato conjecture, that the norm residue maps are isomorphisms between Milnor K-theory K_n^M(k)/p and etale cohomology H^n(k,\mu_p^n) for every prime p, every n and every field k containing 1/p.   Our proofs of these two results are based on Rost's 1998 preprints, his web site and Rost's lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1999-2000 and 2005.
