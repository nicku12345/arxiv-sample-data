Relying on results of Hopkins-Morel, we show that, for X a quasi-projective variety over a field of characteristic zero, the canonical map \Omega_n(X)\to MGL_{2n,n}'(X) is an isomorphism. Here \Omega_*(X) is the theory of algebraic cobordism defined by Levine-Morel, and MGL_{*,*}' is the Borel-Moore homology version of the theory of algebraic cobordism defined via the algebraic Thom complex in the Morel-Voevodsky motivic stable homotopy category.
