We examine various versions of oriented cohomology and Borel-Moore homology theories in algebraic geometry and put these two together in the setting of an "oriented duality theory", a generalization of Bloch-Ogus twisted duality theory. This combines and exends work of Panin and Mocanasu. We apply this to give a Borel-Moore homology version MGL'_{*,*} of Voevodsky's MGL^{*,*}-theory, and a natural map \vartheta:\Omega_*\to MGL'_{2*,*}, where \Omega_* is the algebraic cobordism theory defined by Levine-Morel. We conjecture that \vartheta is an isomorphism and describe a program for proving this conjecture.
