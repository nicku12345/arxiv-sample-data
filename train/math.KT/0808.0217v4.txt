This is an old paper put here for archeological purposes. We derive a general formula expressing the second homology of a Lie algebra of the form L\otimes A with coefficients in the trivial module through homology of L, cyclic homology of A, and other invariants of L and A. This is achieved by using the Hopf formula expressing the second homology of a Lie algebra in terms of its presentation. We also derive a similar formula for the associated Lie algebra of the tensor product of two associative algebras.
