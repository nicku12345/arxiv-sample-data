We prove that for any infinite field homology stability for the third integral homology of the special linear groups SL(n,F) begins at n=3. When n=2 the cokernel of the map from the third homology of SL(2,F) to the third homology of SL(3,F) is naturally isomorphic to the square of Milnor K_3. We discuss applications to the indecomposable K_3 of the field and to Milnor-Witt K-theory.
