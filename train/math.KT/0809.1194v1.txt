Using cyclotomic specializations of the equivariant K-theory with respect to a torus action we derive congruences for discrete invariants of exceptional objects in derived categories of coherent sheaves on a class of varieties that includes Grassmannians and smooth quadrics. For example, we prove that if X={\Bbb P}^{n_1-1}\times...\times{\Bbb P}^{n_k-1}, where n_i's are powers of a fixed prime number p, then the rank of an exceptional object on X is congruent to \pm 1 modulo p.
