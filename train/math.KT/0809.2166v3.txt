Let p be an odd prime number and F a field containing a primitive pth root of unity. We prove a new restriction on the group-theoretic structure of the absolute Galois group G_F of F. Namely, the third subgroup G_F^{(3)} in the descending p-central sequence of G_F is the intersection of all open normal subgroups N such that G_F/N is 1, \mathbb{Z}/p^2, or the modular group M_{p^3} of order p^3.
