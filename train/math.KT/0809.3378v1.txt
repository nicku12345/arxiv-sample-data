This paper contains two results concerning the equivariant K-theory of toric varieties. The first is a formula for the equivariant K-groups of an arbitrary affine toric variety, generalizing the known formula for smooth ones. In fact, this result is established in a more general context, involving the K-theory of graded projective modules. The second result is a new proof of a theorem due to Vezzosi and Vistoli concerning the equivariant K-theory of smooth (not necessarily affine) toric varieties.
