In a parallel way to the work of Wang, we define higher order characteristic classes associated with the Chern character, generalizing the work of Bott-Chern and Gillet-Soul\'e on secondary characteristic classes. Our formalism is simplicial and the computations are easier. As a consequence, we obtain the comparison of Borel and Beilinson regulators and an explicit formula for the real single-valued function associated with the Grasmannian polylogarithm.
