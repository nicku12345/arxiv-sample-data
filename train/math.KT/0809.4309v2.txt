This paper is the continuation of arXiv:0802.1245. We construct the Hochschild class for coherent modules over a deformation quantization algebroid on a complex Poisson manifold. We also define the convolution of Hochschild homologies, and prove that the Hochschild class of the convolution of two coherent modules is the convolution of their Hochschild classes. We study with some details the case of symplectic deformations.
