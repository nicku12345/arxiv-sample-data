This paper is concerned with the localization of higher analytic indices for Lie groupoids. Let \gr be a Lie groupoid with Lie algebroid A\gr. Let \tau be a (periodic) cyclic cocycle over the convolution algebra \cg. We say that \tau can be localized if there is a correspondence K^0(A^*\gr)\stackrel{Ind_{\tau}}{\longrightarrow}\mathbb{C} satisfying Ind_{\tau}(a)=< ind D_a,\tau> (Connes pairing). In this case, we call Ind_{\tau} the higher localized index associated to \tau. In {Ca4} we use the algebra of functions over the tangent groupoid introduced in {Ca2}, which is in fact a strict deformation quantization of the Schwartz algebra \sw(A\gr), to prove the following results: \item Every bounded continuous cyclic cocycle can be localized. \item If \gr is {\'e}tale, every cyclic cocycle can be localized. We will recall this results with the difference that in this paper, a formula for higher localized indices will be given in terms of an asymptotic limit of a pairing at the level of the deformation algebra mentioned above. We will discuss how the higher index formulas of Connes-Moscovici, Gorokhovsky-Lott fit in this unifying setting.
