Let F be a field of characteristic zero and let f(t,n) be the stabilization homomorphism from the n-th integral homology of SL(t,F) to the n-th homology of SL(t+1,F). We prove the following results: For all n, f(t,n) is an isomorphism if t is at least n+1, and is surjective for t=n, confirming a conjecture of C-H. Sah. Furthermore if n is odd, then f(n,n) is an isomorphism and when n is even the kernel of f(n,n) is the (n+1)st power of the fundamental ideal of the Witt Ring of the field.. If n is even, then the cokernel of f(n-1,n) is naturally isomorphic to the n-th Milnor-Witt K-group of F, MWK(n,F) and when n>2 is odd the cokernel of f(n-1,n) is the square of the nth Milnor K-group of F.
