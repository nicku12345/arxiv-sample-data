A resolution of the intersection of a finite number of subgroups of an abelian group by means of their sums is constructed, provided the lattice generated by these subgroups is distributive. This is used for detecting singularities of modules over Dedekind rings. A generalized Chinese remainder theorem is derived as a consequence of the above resolution. The Gelfand-Naimark duality between finite closed coverings of compact Hausdorff spaces and the generalized Chinese remainder theorem is clarified.
