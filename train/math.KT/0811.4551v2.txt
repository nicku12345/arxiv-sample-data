We first study the weight structure on the triangulated category of Artin-Tate motives over a perfect base field k, building on results of Bondarko's. We then study the t-structure on the triangulated category of Artin-Tate motives, when k is algebraic over the rationals, generalizing a result of Levine's. We finally study the interaction of the weight structure and the t-structure. When k is a number field, this will give a useful criterion identifying the weight structure via realizations.
