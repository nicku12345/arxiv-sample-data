In this paper, we consider for any free presentation G = F/R of a group G the coinvariance H_{0}(G,R_{ab}^{\otimes n}) of the n-th tensor power of the relation module R_{ab} and show that the homology group H_{2n}(G,{\mathbb Z}) may be identified with the limit of the groups H_{0}(G,R_{ab}^{\otimes n}), where the limit is taken over the category of these presentations of G. We also consider the free Lie ring generated by the relation module R_{ab}, in order to relate the limit of the groups \gamma_{n}R/[\gamma_{n}R,F] to the n-torsion subgroup of H_{2n}(G,{\mathbb Z}).
