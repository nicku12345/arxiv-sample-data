The Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra vanishes. If we want to extend this result to Lie superalgebras, we should deal with infinite sums. We observe that a suitable method of summation, which goes back to Euler, allows to do that, to a certain degree. The mathematics behind it is simple, we just glue the pieces of elementary homological algebra, first-year calculus and pedestrian combinatorics together, and present them in a (hopefully) coherent manner.
