For a finite group G, the so-called G-Mackey functors form an abelian category M(G) that has many applications in the study of G-equivariant stable homotopy. One would expect that the derived category D(M(G)) would be similarly important as the "homological" counterpart of the G-equivariant stable homotopy category. It turns out that this is not so -- D(M(G)) is pathological in many respects. We propose and study a replacement for D(M(G)), a certain triangulated category DM(G) of "derived Mackey functors" that contains M(G) but is different from D(M(G)). We show that standard features of the G-equivariant stable homotopy category such as the fixed points functors of two types have exact analogs for the category DM(G).
