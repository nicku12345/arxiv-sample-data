We prove an Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem for Dirac operators twisted by C*-vector bundles. We use it to derive a general product formula for eta-forms and to define and study new rho-invariants generalizing Lott's higher rho-form. The higher Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem of Leichtnam-Piazza can be recovered by applying the theorem to Dirac operators twisted by the Mishenko-Fomenko bundle associated to the reduced C*-algebra of the fundamental group.
