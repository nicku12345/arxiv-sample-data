We prove finite generation of the cohomology ring of any finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebra, having abelian group of grouplike elements, under some mild restrictions on the group order. The proof uses the recent classification by Andruskiewitsch and Schneider of such Hopf algebras. Examples include all of Lusztig's small quantum groups, whose cohomology was first computed explicitly by Ginzburg and Kumar, as well as many new pointed Hopf algebras. We also show that in general the cohomology ring of a Hopf algebra in a braided category is braided commutative. As a consequence we obtain some further information about the structure of the cohomology ring of a finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebra and its related Nichols algebra.
