We compare two known definitions for a relative family of effective zero cycles, based on traces and norms of functions, respectively. In characteristic zero we show that both definitions agree. In the general setting, we show that the norm map on functions can be expanded to a norm functor between certain categories of line bundles, therefore giving a third approach to families of zero cycles.
