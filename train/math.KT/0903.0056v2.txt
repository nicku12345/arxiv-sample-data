Let E be a row-finite quiver and let E_0 be the set of vertices of E; consider the adjacency matrix N'_E=(n_{ij})\in\Z^{(E_0\times E_0)}, n_{ij}=#\{ arrows from i to j\}. Write N^t_E and 1 for the matrices \in \Z^{(E_0\times E_0\setminus\Sink(E))} which result from N'^t_E and from the identity matrix after removing the columns corresponding to sinks. We consider the K-theory of the Leavitt algebra L_R(E)=L_\Z(E)\otimes R. We show that if R is either a Noetherian regular ring or a stable C^*-algebra, then there is an exact sequence (n\in\Z) \[ K_n(R)^{(E_0\setminus\Sink(E))}\stackrel{1-N_E^t}{\longrightarrow} K_n(R)^{(E_0)}\to K_n(L_R(E))\to K_{n-1}(R)^{(E_0\setminus\Sink(E))} \] We also show that for general R, the obstruction for having a sequence as above is measured by twisted nil-K-groups. If we replace K-theory by homotopy algebraic K-theory, the obstructions dissapear, and we get, for every ring R, a long exact sequence \[ KH_n(R)^{(E_0\setminus\Sink(E))}\stackrel{1-N_E^t}{\longrightarrow}KH_n(R)^{(E_0)}\to KH_n(L_R(E))\to KH_{n-1}(R)^{(E_0\setminus\Sink(E))} \] We also compare, for a C^*-algebra \fA, the algebraic K-theory of L_\fA(E) with the topological K-theory of the Cuntz-Krieger algebra C^*_\fA(E). We show that the map \[ K_n(L_\fA(E))\to K^{\top}_n(C^*_\fA(E)) \] is an isomorphism if \fA is stable and n\in\Z, and also if \fA=\C, n\ge 0, E is finite with no sinks, and \det(1-N_E^t)\ne 0.
