We study the structure of two-sided vector spaces over a perfect field K. In particular, we give a complete characterization of isomorphism classes of simple two-sided vector spaces which are left finite-dimensional. Using this description, we compute the Quillen K-theory of the category of left finite-dimensional, two-sided vector spaces over K. We also consider the closely related problem of describing homomorphisms \phi:K\to M_n(K).
