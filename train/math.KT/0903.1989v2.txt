Wagoner complexes are simplicial complexes associated to groups of Kac-Moody type. They admit interesting homotopy groups which are related to integral group homology if the root datum is of 2-spherical type. We give a general definition of Wagoner complexes, exhibit some simple properties and calculate low dimensional homotopy groups. In addition, we give a definition of affine Wagoner complexes related to groups admitting a root datum with valuation.
