We completely determine the 2-primary torsion subgroups of the hermitian K-groups of rings of 2-integers in totally real 2-regular number fields. The result is almost periodic with period 8. We also identify the homotopy fibers of the forgetful and hyperbolic maps relating hermitian and algebraic K-theory. The result is then exactly periodic of period 8. In both the orthogonal and symplectic cases, we prove the 2-primary hermitian Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture.
