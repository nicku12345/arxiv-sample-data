We verify a special case of a conjecture of G. Carlsson that describes the \l-adic K-theory of a field F of characteristic prime to \l in terms of the representation theory of the absolute Galois group G_F. This conjecture is known to hold in two cases; in this article we examine the second case, in which the field in question is the field of Laurent series over a finite field \FF_{p}((x)).
