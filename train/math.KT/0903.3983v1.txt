These notes evolved from the lecture notes of a minicourse given in Swisk, the Sedano Winter School on K-theory held in Sedano, Spain, during the week January 22--27 of 2007, and from those of a longer course given in the University of Buenos Aires, during the second half of 2006. They intend to be an introduction to K-theory, with emphasis in the comparison between its algebraic and topological variants. We have tried to keep as elementary as possible.
