We show that a cellular complex described by Floege allows to determine the integral homology of the Bianchi groups PSL_2(O_{-m}), where O_{-m} is the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic number field \rationals[\sqrt{-m}] for a square-free natural number m. We use this to compute in the cases m = 5, 6, 10, 13 and 15 with non-trivial class group the integral homology of PSL_2(O_{-m}), which before was known only in the cases m = 1, 2, 3, 7 and 11 with trivial class group.
