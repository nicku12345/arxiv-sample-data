In this work we compute the induced transfer map: \bar\tau^\ast: \func{Im}(res^\ast:H^\ast(G) \to H^\ast(V)) \to \func{Im}(res^\ast: H^\ast (\Sigma_{p^n}) \to H^\ast(V)) in \func{mod}p-cohomology. Here \Sigma_{p^{n}} is the symmetric group acting on an n-dimensional \mathbb F_p vector space V, G=\Sigma_{p^{n},p} a p-Sylow subgroup, \Sigma_{p^{n-1}}\int \Sigma_{p}, or \Sigma_{p}\int \Sigma_{p^{n-1}}. Some answers are given by natural invariants which are related to certain parabolic subgroups. We also compute a free module basis for certain rings of invariants over the classical Dickson algebra. This provides a computation of the image of the appropriate restriction map. Finally, if  \xi :\func{Im}(res^\ast:H^\ast(G) \to H^\ast(V)) \to \func{Im}(res^\ast}: H^\ast(\Sigma_{p^n}) \to H^\ast(V))  is the natural epimorphism, then we prove that \bar\tau^\ast=\xi in the ideal generated by the top Dickson algebra generator.
