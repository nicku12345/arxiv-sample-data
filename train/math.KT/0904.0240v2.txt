This paper introduces a reformulation of the classical convergence theorem for spectral sequences of filtered complexes which provides an algorithm to effectively compute the induced filtration on the total (co)homology, as soon as the complex is of finite type, its filtration is finite, and the underlying ring is computable. So-called generalized maps play a decisive role in simplifying and streamlining all involved algorithms.
