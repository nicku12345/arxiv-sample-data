For a closed locally symmetric space M=\Gamma\G/K and a representation of G we consider the push-forward of the fundamental class in the homology of the linear group and a related invariant in algebraic K-theory. We discuss the nontriviality of this invariant and we generalize the construction to cusped locally symmetric spaces of R-rank one.
