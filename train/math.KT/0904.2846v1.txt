We prove rigidity type results on the vanishing of stable (co)homology for modules of finite complete intersection dimension, results which generalize and improve upon known results. We also introduce a notion of pre-rigidity, which generalizes phenomena for modules of finite complete intersection dimension and complexity one. Using this concept, we prove results on length and vanishing of homology modules.
