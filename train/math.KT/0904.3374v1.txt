We use the cylindrical homomorphism and a geometric construction introduced by J. Lewis to study the Lawson homology groups of certain hypersurfaces X\subset \mathbb{P}^{n+1} of degree d\leq n+1. As an application, we compute the rational semi-topological K-theory of a generic cubic of dimension 5, 6 and 8 and, using the Bloch-Kato conjecture, we prove Suslin's conjecture for these varieties. Using the generic cubic sevenfolds, we show that there are smooth projective varieties with the lowest non-trivial step in their s-filtration infinitely generated and undetected by the Abel-Jacobi map.
