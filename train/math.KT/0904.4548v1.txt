We investigate the higher-dimensional amenability of tensor products \A \ptp \B of Banach algebras \A and \B. We prove that the weak bidimension db_w of the tensor product \A \ptp \B of Banach algebras \A and \B with bounded approximate identities satisfies \[ db_w \A \ptp \B = db_w \A + db_w \B. \] We show that it cannot be extended to arbitrary Banach algebras. For example, for a biflat Banach algebra \A which has a left or right, but not two-sided, bounded approximate identity, we have db_w \A \ptp \A \le 1 and db_w \A + db_w \A =2. We describe explicitly the continuous Hochschild cohomology \H^n(\A \ptp \B, (X \ptp Y)^*) and the cyclic cohomology \H\C^n(\A \ptp \B) of certain tensor products \A \ptp \B of Banach algebras \A and \B with bounded approximate identities; here (X \ptp Y)^* is the dual bimodule of the tensor product of essential Banach bimodules X and Y over \A and \B respectively.
