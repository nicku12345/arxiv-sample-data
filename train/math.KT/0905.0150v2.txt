Let A(t) be an elliptic, product-type suspended (which is to say parameter-dependant in a symbolic way) family of pseudodifferential operators on the fibres of a fibration \phi with base Y. The standard example is A+it where A is a family, in the usual sense, of first order, self-adjoint and elliptic pseudodifferential operators and t\in\bbR is the `suspending' parameter. Let \pi_{\cA}:\cA(\phi)\longrightarrow Y be the infinite-dimensional bundle with fibre at y\in Y consisting of the Schwartz-smoothing perturbations, q, making A_y(t)+q(t) invertible for all t\in\bbR. The total eta form, \eta_{\cA}, as described here, is an even form on \cA(\phi) which has basic differential which is an explicit representative of the odd Chern character of the index of the family: % d\eta_{\cA}=\pi_{\cA}^*\gamma_A, \Ch(\ind(A))=[\gamma_{A}]\in H^{\odd}(Y). \tag{*}\label{efatoi.5} % The 1-form part of this identity may be interpreted in terms of the \tau invariant (exponentiated eta invariant) as the determinant of the family. The 2-form part of the eta form may be interpreted as a B-field on the K-theory gerbe for the family A with \eqref{efatoi.5} giving the `curving' as the 3-form part of the Chern character of the index. We also give `universal' versions of these constructions over a classifying space for odd K-theory. For Dirac-type operators, we relate \eta_{\cA} with the Bismut-Cheeger eta form.
