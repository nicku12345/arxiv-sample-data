We define and study the properties of the category {\sf FHS}_n of formal Hodge structure of level \le n following the ideas of L. Barbieri-Viale who discussed the case of level \le 1. As an application we describe the generalized Albanese variety of Esnault, Srinivas and Viehweg via the group \Ext^1 in {\sf FHS}_n. This formula generalizes the classical one to the case of proper but non necessarily smooth complex varieties.
