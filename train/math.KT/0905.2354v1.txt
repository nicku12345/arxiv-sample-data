We generalize and clarify Gerstenhaber and Schack's "Special Cohomology Comparison Theorem". More specifically we obtain a fully faithful functor between the derived categories of bimodules over a prestack over a small category U and the derived category of bimodules over its corresponding fibered category. In contrast to Gerstenhaber and Schack we do not have to assume that U is a poset.
