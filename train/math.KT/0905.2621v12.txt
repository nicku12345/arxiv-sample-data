This paper can be thought of as an extended introduction to arXiv:0708.3398; nevertheless, most of its results are not covered by loc. cit. We consider the derived categories of DG-modules, DG-comodules, and DG-contramodules, the coderived and contraderived categories of CDG-modules, the coderived categories of CDG-comodules, and the contraderived categories of CDG-contramodules. The equivalence between the latter two categories (the comodule-contramodule correspondence) is established. Nonhomogeneous Koszul duality or "triality" (an equivalence between exotic derived categories corresponding to Koszul dual (C)DG-algebra and CDG-coalgebra) is obtained in the conilpotent and nonconilpotent versions. Various A_\infty-structures are considered, and a number of model category structures are described. Homogeneous Koszul duality and D-\Omega duality are discussed in the appendices.
