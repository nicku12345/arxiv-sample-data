Let T_R be a right n-tilting module over an arbitrary associative ring R. In this paper we prove that there exists a n-tilting module T'_R equivalent to T_R which induces a derived equivalence between the unbounded derived category \D(R) and a triangulated subcategory \mathcal E_{\perp} of \D(\End(T')) equivalent to the quotient category of \D(\End(T')) modulo the kernel of the total left derived functor -\otimes^{\mathbb L}_{S'}T'. In case T_R is a classical n-tilting module, we get again the Cline-Parshall-Scott and Happel's results.
