Let k be a field and let E be a finite quiver. We study the structure of the finitely presented modules of finite length over the Leavitt path algebra L_k (E) and show its close relationship with the finite-dimensional representations of the inverse quiver \overline{E} of E, as well as with the class of finitely generated P_k(E)-modules M such that {\rm Tor}_q^{P_k (E)}(k^{|E^0|},M)=0 for all q, where P_k(E) is the usual path algebra of E. By using these results we compute the higher K-theory of the von Neumann regular algebra Q_k (E)=L_k (E)\Sigma^{-1}, where \Sigma  is the set of all square matrices over P_k (E) which are sent to invertible matrices by the augmentation map \epsilon \colon P_k (E)\to k^{|E^0|}.
