We construct differential equivariant K-theory of representable smooth orbifolds as a ring valued functor with the usual properties of a differential extension of a cohomology theory. For proper submersions (with smooth fibres) we construct a push-forward map in differential equivariant K-theory. Finally, we construct a non-degenerate intersection pairing with values in C/Z for the subclass of smooth orbifolds which can be written as global quotients by a finite group action. We construct a real subfunctor of our theory, where the pairing restricts to a non-degenerate R/Z-valued pairing.
