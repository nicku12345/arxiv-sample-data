The aim of this note is to show that the generalized supertrace, constructed in another paper of the author, inducing an isomorphism between the Hochschild homology of a superalgebra and that of the superalgebra of square supermatrices of a given type over A, induces, also, an isomorphism between the cyclic homologies of the two superalgebras.
