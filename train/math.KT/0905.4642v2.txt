Let R be the homogeneous coordinate ring of a smooth projective variety X over a field \k of characteristic~0. We calculate the K-theory of R in terms of the geometry of the projective embedding of X. In particular, if X is a curve then we calculate K_0(R) and K_1(R), and prove that K_{-1}(R)=\oplus H^1(C,\cO(n)). The formula for K_0(R) involves the Zariski cohomology of twisted K\"ahler differentials on the variety.
