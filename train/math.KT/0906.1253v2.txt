Let R be a left and right Noetherian ring. We introduce the notion of the torsionfree dimension of finitely generated R-modules. For any n\geq 0, we prove that R is a Gorenstein ring with self-injective dimension at most n if and only if every finitely generated left R-module and every finitely generated right R-module have torsionfree dimension at most n, if and only if every finitely generated left (or right) R-module has Gorenstein dimension at most n. For any n \geq 1, we study the properties of the finitely generated R-modules M with \Ext_R^i(M, R)=0 for any 1\leq i \leq n. Then we investigate the relation between these properties and the self-injective dimension of R.
