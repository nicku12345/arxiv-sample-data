We construct Adams operations on the rational higher arithmetic K-groups of a proper arithmetic variety. The definition applies to the higher arithmetic K-groups given by Takeda as well as to the groups suggested by Deligne and Soule, by means of the homotopy groups of the homotopy fiber of the regulator map. They are compatible with the Adams operations on algebraic K-theory. The definition relies on the chain morphism representing Adams operations in higher algebraic K-theory given previously by the author. In this paper it is shown that a slight modification of this chain morphism commutes strictly with the representative of the Beilinson regulator given by Burgos and Wang.
