The aim of this article is to compute the Hochschild and cyclic homology groups of Yang-Mills algebras, that have been defined by A. Connes and M. Dubois-Violette. We proceed here the study of these algebras that we have initiated in a previous article. The computation involves the use of a spectral sequence associated to the natural filtration on the enveloping algebra of the Lie Yang-Mills algebra. This filtration in provided by a Lie ideal which is free as Lie algebra.
