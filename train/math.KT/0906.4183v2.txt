In this paper we improve recent results dealing with cellular covers of R-modules. Cellular covers (sometimes called co-localizations) come up in the context of homotopical localization of topological spaces. They are related to idempotent cotriples, idempotent comonads or coreflectors in category theory.   Recall that a homomorphism of R-modules \pi: G\to H is called a {\it cellular cover} over H if \pi induces an isomorphism \pi_*: \Hom_R(G,G)\cong \Hom_R(G,H), where \pi_*(\phi)= \pi \phi for each \phi \in \Hom_R(G,G) (where maps are acting on the left). On the one hand, we show that every cotorsion-free R-module of rank \kappa<\Cont is realizable as the kernel of some cellular cover G\to H where the rank of G is 3\kappa +1 (or 3, if \kappa=1). The proof is based on Corner's classical idea of how to construct torsion-free abelian groups with prescribed countable endomorphism rings. This complements results by Buckner--Dugas \cite{BD}. On the other hand, we prove that every cotorsion-free R-module H that satisfies some rigid conditions admits arbitrarily large cellular covers G\to H. This improves results by Fuchs-G\"obel \cite{FG} and Farjoun-G\"obel-Segev-Shelah \cite{FGSS07}.
