We prove the existence of a Quillen Flat Model Structure in the category of unbounded complexes of h-unitary modules over a nonunital ring (or a k-algebra, with k a field). This model structure provides a natural framework where a Morita-invariant homological algebra for these nonunital rings can be developed. And it is compatible with the usual tensor product of complexes. The Waldhausen category associated to its cofibrations allows to develop a Morita invariant excisive higher K-theory for nonunital algebras.
