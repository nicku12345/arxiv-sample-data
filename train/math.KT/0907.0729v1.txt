Based on results by S.K. Roushon (math.KT/0408243 and math.KT/0405211) this thesis summarizes in an axiomatic way when a Meta-Isomorphism-Conjecture in the sense of Lueck and Reich (math.KT/0402405) is true for fundamental groups of 3-dimensional manifolds. In particular we prove that the fibered Farrell-Jones isomorphism conjectures for L-theory and algebraic K-theory are true for this class of groups if they are true for semidirect products of \mathbb{Z^2} with \mathbb{Z}.
