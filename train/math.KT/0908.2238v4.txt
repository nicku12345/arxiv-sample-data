We give a simple explicit construction of the Grassmannian n-logarithm, which is a multivalued analytic function on the quotient of the Grassmannian of generic n-dimensional subspaces in 2n-dimensional coordinate complex vector space by the action of the 2n-dimensional coordinate torus.   We study Tate iterated integrals, which are homotopy invariant integrals of 1-forms dlog(rational functions). We introduce the Hopf algebra of integrable symbols related to an algebraic variety, which controls the Tate iterated integrals We give a simple explicit formula for the Tate iterated integrals related to the Grassmannian polylogarithms.
