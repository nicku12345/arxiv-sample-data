We establish the analogue of the Friedlander-Mazur conjecture for Teh's reduced Lawson homology groups of real varieties, which says that the reduced Lawson homology of a real quasi-projective variety X vanishes in homological degrees larger than the dimension of X in all weights. As an application we obtain a vanishing of homotopy groups of the mod-2 topological groups of averaged cycles and a characterization in a range of indices of the motivic cohomology of a real variety as homotopy groups of the complex of averaged equidimensional cycles. We also establish an equivariant Poincare duality between equivariant Friedlander-Walker real morphic cohomology and dos Santos' real Lawson homology. We use this together with an equivariant extension of the mod-2 Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjecture to compute some real Lawson homology groups in terms of Bredon cohomology.
