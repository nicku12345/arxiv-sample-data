We characterize left Noetherian rings in terms of the duality property of injective preenvelopes and flat precovers. For a left and right Noetherian ring R, we prove that the flat dimension of the injective envelope of any (Gorenstein) flat left R-module is at most the flat dimension of the injective envelope of _RR. Then we get that the injective envelope of _RR is (Gorenstein) flat if and only if the injective envelope of every Gorenstein flat left R-module is (Gorenstein) flat, if and only if the injective envelope of every flat left R-module is (Gorenstein) flat, if and only if the (Gorenstein) flat cover of every injective left R-module is injective, and if and only if the opposite version of one of these conditions is satisfied.
