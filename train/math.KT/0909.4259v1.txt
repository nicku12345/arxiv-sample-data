This paper deals with two aspects of the theory of characteristic classes of star products: first, on an arbitrary Poisson manifold, we describe Morita equivalent star products in terms of their Kontsevich classes; second, on symplectic manifolds, we describe the relationship between Kontsevich's and Fedosov's characteristic classes of star products.
