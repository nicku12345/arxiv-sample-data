It is a deep fact that the homotopy classification of topological manifolds is convariantly functorial. In other words, a map from a topological manifold M to another N naturally induces a map from the structure set S(M) to S(N). We extend the fact to the isovariant structure set S_G(M, rel M_s) of G-equivariant topological manifolds isovariantly homotopy equivalent to M and restricts to homormorphism on the singular part M_s, consisting of those points fixed by some non-trivial elements of G. We further explain that the structure set S_G(M, rel M_s) is the fibre of the assembly map for the generalized homology theory with the L-spectrum as the coefficient. This relates our result to the Farrell-Jones Conjecture for L-theory.
