There exists two types of nonassociative algebras whose associator satisfies a symmetric relation associated with a 1-dimensional invariant vector space with respect to the natural action of the symmetric group on three elements. The first one corresponds to the Lie-admissible algebras that we studied in a previous paper. Here we are interested by the second one corresponding to the third power associative algebras.
