We generalize the notion of identities among relations, well known for presentations of groups, to presentations of n-categories by polygraphs. To each polygraph, we associate a track n-category, generalizing the notion of crossed module for groups, in order to define the natural system of identities among relations. We relate the facts that this natural system is finitely generated and that the polygraph has finite derivation type.
