Let X be a connected, noetherian scheme and \mathcal{A} be a sheaf of Azumaya algebras on X which is a locally free \mathcal{O}_{X}-module of rank a. We show that the kernel and cokernel of K_{i}(X) \to K_{i}(\mathcal{A})  are torsion groups with exponent a^{m} for some m and any i\geq 0, when X is regular or X is of dimension d with an ample sheaf (in this case m\leq d+1). As a consequence, K_{i}(X,\mathbb Z/m)\cong K_{i}(\mA,\mathbb Z/m), for any m relatively prime to a.
