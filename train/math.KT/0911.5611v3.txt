Over a subfield of the field of complex numbers, the Hodge realization of a geometrical motive is defined and represented as the cohomology of a mixed Hodge DG-complex in the sense of Deligne. Both filtrations are represented by truncation functors, on a Bondarko weight complex for the weight filtration and on the De Rham motivic complex for the Hodge one. The Deligne-Beilinson realization is also constructed. This preprint partially replaces the former "R\'ealisation des complexes motiviques de Voevodsky".
