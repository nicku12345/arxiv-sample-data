We discuss Suslin's singular homology and cohomology. In the first half we examine the p-part in characteristic p, and the situation over non-algebraically closed fields. In the second half we focus on finite base fields. We study finite generation properties, and give a modified definition which behaves like a homology theory: in degree zero it is a copy of Z for each connected component, in degree one it is related to the abelianized (tame) fundamental group, even for singular schemes, and it is expected to be finitely generated in general.
