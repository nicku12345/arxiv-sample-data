We study the twisted cohomology groups of A_\infty-algebras defined by twisting elements and their behavior under morphisms and homotopies using the bar construction. We define higher Massey products on the cohomology groups of general A_\infty-algebras and establish the naturality under morphisms and their dependency on defining systems. The above constructions are also considered for C_\infty-algebras. We construct a spectral sequence converging to the twisted cohomology groups an show that the higher differentials are given by the A_\infty-algebraic Massey products.
