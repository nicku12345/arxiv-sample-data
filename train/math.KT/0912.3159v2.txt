We study formal deformations of a crossed product S(V)#_f G, of a polynomial algebra with a group, induced from a universal deformation formula introduced by Witherspoon. These deformations arise from braided actions of Hopf algebras generated by automorphisms and skew derivations. We show that they are nontrivial in the characteristic free context, even if G is infinite, by showing that their infinitesimals are not coboundaries. For this we construct a new complex which computes the Hochschild cohomology of S(V)#_f G.
