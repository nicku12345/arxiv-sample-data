Let \Uq be a quantum group. Regarding a (noncommutative) space with \Uq-symmetry as a \Uq-module algebra A, we may think of equivariant vector bundles on A as projective A-modules with compatible \Uq-action. We construct an equivariant K-theory of such quantum vector bundles using Quillen's exact categories, and provide means for its compution. The equivariant K-groups of quantum homogeneous spaces and quantum symmetric algebras of classical type are computed.
