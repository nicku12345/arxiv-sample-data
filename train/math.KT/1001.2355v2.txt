We study algebraic varieties parametrized by topological spaces and enlarge the domains of Lawson homology and morphic cohomology to this category. We prove a Lawson suspension theorem and splitting theorem. A version of Friedlander-Lawson moving is obtained to prove a duality theorem between Lawson homology and morphic for smooth semi-topological projective varieties. K-groups for semi-topological projective varieties and Chern classes are also constructed.
