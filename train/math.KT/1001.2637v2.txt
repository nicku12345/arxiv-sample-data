We present some results on equivariant KK-theory in the context of tensor triangular geometry. More specifically, for G a finite group, we show that the spectrum of the tensor triangulated subcategory of KK^G generated by the tensor unit contains as a retract a canonical copy of the Zariski spectrum of the complex character ring of G. For G trivial, this inclusion is a homeomorphism.   We also prove a general criterion for a support theory on a compactly generated tensor triangulated category to provide the universal support datum, in the sense of Paul Balmer, on its subcategory of compact objects.
