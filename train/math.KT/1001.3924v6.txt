In this paper, we compute the entire cyclic cohomology of noncommutative 3-spheres. First of all, we verify the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence of entire cyclic cohomology in the framework of Fr\'echet ^*-algebras. Applying it to their noncommutative Heegaard decomposition, we deduce that their entire cyclic cohomology is isomorphic to the d'Rham homology of the ordinary 3-sphere with the complex coefficients.
