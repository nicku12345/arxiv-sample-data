For a Grothendieck category C which, via a Z-generating sequence (O(n))_{n in Z}, is equivalent to the category of "quasi-coherent modules" over an associated Z-algebra A, we show that under suitable cohomological conditions "taking quasi-coherent modules" defines an equivalence between linear deformations of A and abelian deformations of C. If (O(n))_{n in Z} is at the same time a geometric helix in the derived category, we show that restricting a (deformed) Z-algebra to a "thread" of objects defines a further equivalence with linear deformations of the associated matrix algebra.
