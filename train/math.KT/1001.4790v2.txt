In this paper, we recall the definition of twisted K-theory in various settings. We prove that for a twist \tau corresponding to a three dimensional integral cohomology class of a space X, there exist a "universal coefficient" isomorphism K_{*}^{\tau}(X)\cong K_{*}(P_{\tau})\otimes_{K_{*}(\mathbb{C}P^{\infty})} \hat{K}_{*} where P_\tau is the total space of the principal \mathbb{C}P^{\infty}-bundle induced over X by \tau and \hat K_* is obtained form the action of \mathbb{C}P^{\infty} on K-theory.
