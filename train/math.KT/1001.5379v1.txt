J. Przytycki has established a connection between the Hochschild homology of an algebra A and the chromatic graph homology of a polygon graph with coefficients in A. In general the chromatic graph homology is not defined in the case where the coefficient ring is a non-commutative algebra. In this paper we define a new homology theory for directed graphs which takes coefficients in an arbitrary A-A bimodule, for A possibly non-commutative, which on polygons agrees with Hochschild homology through a range of dimensions.
