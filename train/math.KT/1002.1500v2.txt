The double point relation defines a natural theory of algebraic cobordism for bundles on varieties. We construct a simple basis (over the rationals) of the corresponding cobordism groups over Spec(C) for all dimensions of varieties and ranks of bundles. The basis consists of split bundles over products of projective spaces. Moreover, we prove the full theory for bundles on varieties is an extension of scalars of standard algebraic cobordism.
