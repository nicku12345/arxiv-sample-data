We make some computations in stable motivic homotopy theory over Spec \mathbb{C}, completed at 2. Using homotopy fixed points and the algebraic K-theory spectrum, we construct a motivic analogue of the real K-theory spectrum KO. We also establish a theory of connective covers to obtain a motivic version of ko. We establish an Adams spectral sequence for computing motivic ko-homology. The E_2-term of this spectral sequence involves Ext groups over the subalgebra A(1) of the motivic Steenrod algebra. We make several explicit computations of these E_2-terms in interesting special cases.
