The main goal of this paper is to deduce (from a recent resolution of singularities result of Gabber) the following fact: (effective) Chow motives with Z[1/p]-coefficients over a perfect field k of characteristic p generate the category DM^{eff}_{gm}[1/p] (of effective geometric Voevodsky's motives with Z[1/p]-coefficients). It follows that DM^{eff}_{gm}[1/p] could be endowed with a Chow weight structure w_{Chow} whose heart is Chow^{eff}[1/p] (weight structures were introduced in a preceding paper, where the existence of w_{Chow} for DM^{eff}_{gm}Q was also proved). As shown in previous papers, this statement immediately yields the existence of a conservative weight complex functor DM^{eff}_{gm}[1/p]\to K^b(Chow^{eff}[1/p]) (which induces an isomorphism on K_0-groups), as well as the existence of canonical and functorial (Chow)-weight spectral sequences and weight filtrations for any cohomology theory on DM^{eff}_{gm}[1/p]. We also define a certain Chow t-structure for DM_{-}^{eff}[1/p] and relate it with unramified cohomology. To this end we study birational motives and birational homotopy invariant sheaves with transfers.
