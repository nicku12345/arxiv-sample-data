For each K-homolgy element of the Sierpinski gasket we construct a spectral triple which will generate that element. We show that there must be certain limits on the choice of the K-homology element if the geometric properties of the gasket shall be recoverable from that spectral triple. For a big subgroup of the K-homology group we show that our spectral triples will recover the metric, the dimension and the Hausdorff measure on the gaket.
