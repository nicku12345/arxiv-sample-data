We use controlled topology applied to the action of the infinite dihedral group on a partially compactified plane and deduce two consequences for algebraic K-theory. The first is that the family in the K-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture can be reduced to only those virtually cyclic groups which admit a surjection with finite kernel onto a cyclic group. The second is that the Waldhausen Nil groups for a group which maps epimorphically onto the infinite dihedral group can be computed in terms of the Farrell-Bass Nil groups of the index two subgroup which maps surjectively to the infinite cyclic group.
