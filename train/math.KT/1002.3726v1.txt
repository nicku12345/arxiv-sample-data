The Chern character maps are one of the most important working tools in mathematics. Although they admit numerous different constructions, they are not yet fully understood at the conceptual level. In this note we eliminate this gap by characterizing the Chern character maps, from the Grothendieck group to the (negative) cyclic homology groups, in terms of simple universal properties.
