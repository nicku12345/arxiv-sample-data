We construct C^\ast-categories that are anologues of the categories used in controlled algebraic K-theory. We then show that the reduced C^\ast-algebra of a finitely presented group and an associated controlled C^\ast-category have equivalent K-theory spectra, and that, at least in certain special cases, the associated C^\ast-category depends functorially on the group. Thus in these cases the K-theory spectrum of the reduced group C^\ast-algebra is a functor.
