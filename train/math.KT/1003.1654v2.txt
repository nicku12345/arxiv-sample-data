In this text, we compare several invariants of the reduced Whitehead group SK1 of a central simple algebra. For biquaternion algebras, we compare a generalised invariant of Suslin as constructed by the author in a previous article to an invariant introduced by Knus-Merkurjev-Rost-Tignol. Using explicit computations, we prove these invariants are essentially the same. We also prove the non-triviality of an invariant introduced by Kahn. To obtain this result, we compare Kahn's invariant to an invariant introduced by Suslin in 1991 which is non-trivial for Platonov's examples of non-trivial SK1. We also give a formula for the value on the centre of the tensor product of two symbol algebras which generalises a formula of Merkurjev for biquaternion algebras.
