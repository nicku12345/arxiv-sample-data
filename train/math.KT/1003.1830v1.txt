We study the slice filtration for S^1-spectra over a field k, and raise a number of questions regardings its properties. We show that the slices, except for the 0th slice, admit a further filtration whose layers are in a natural way the Eilenberg-Maclane spectra associated to a homotopy invariant complex of Nisnevic sheaves with transfer, i.e., an effective motive. We give an example to show that in general the 0th slice does not admit transfers.
