The aim of the present paper is to establish relations between Iwasawa and Bernoulli numbers based on some results by M. Kervaire and M. P. Murthy about the structure of the K_0 groups of the integer group rings of cyclic groups of prime power order p^n . In particular, we will prove that   1. \lambda_{i}\leq p-1 under assumption that the generalized Bernoulli number B_{1,\omega^{-i}} is not divisible by p^2. Here \omega is the Teichm\"{u}ller character of {\mathbb{Z}}/(p-1){\mathbb{Z}}.   2. \lambda_{i}=1 if B_{1,\omega^{-i}} is divisible by p^2.   3. We will prove that S_{n,i}\cong {\mathbb{Z}}/(p^{n+k_i}), where S_n is the Sylow p-subgroup of the class group of the field {\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_n). Here, \zeta_n is a primitive p^{n+1}-root of unity, \varepsilon_{i} are idempotents in the group ring {\mathbb{Z}}_{p}[{\rm Gal}({\mathbb{Q}} (\zeta_0) /{\mathbb{Q}})], S_{n,i}=\varepsilon_i (S_n), and k_i is the p-adic valuation of B_{1,\omega^{-i}}.   4. Throughout the paper we assume that p satisfies Vandiver's conjecture.
