The conditions for stability of the elements of linear groups over the associative rings with identity and their connection with the stability of rings are analyzed in the article. The stability of rings which are commutative, satisfy the conditions of stability of rank \geq 2, von Neumann regular, integer-algebraic, nearly local rings introduced by the author, is examined. The most important classical results of H. Bass, L. Vaserstein, S.H. Khlebutin, A.A. Suslin, J.S. Wilson, I.Z.Golubchik, are considered from the unified standpoint.
