The notion of charge deficiency from Avron, Seiler, Simon (Charge deficiency, charge transport and comparison of dimensions, Comm. Math. Phys. 159) is studied from the view of KK-theory and is applied to the Landau levels in \C^n. We calculate the charge deficiencies of the higher Landau levels in \C^n by means of an Atiyah-Singer type index theorem.
