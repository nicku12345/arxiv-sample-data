One of our main results is a classification all the weakly symmetric radical cube zero finite dimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field having a theory of support via the Hochschild cohomology ring satisfying Dade's Lemma. Along the way we give a characterization of when a finite dimensional Koszul algebra has such a theory of support in terms of the graded centre of the Koszul dual.
