The paper is a continuation of the authors' work in which we considered foliations formed by the maximal dimensional K-orbits (MD_5-foliations) of connected MD_5-groups such that their Lie algebras have 4-dimensional commutative derived ideals and give the topological classification of considered foliations. In this paper, we study K-theory for the leaf space of some from these MD_5-foliations and analytically describes and characterized Connes' C*-algebras of considered foliations by the method of K-functors.
