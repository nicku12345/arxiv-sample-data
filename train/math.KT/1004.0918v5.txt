This paper is to construct unstable, Morita stable and stable bivariant algebraic Kasparov K-theory spectra of k-algebras. These are shown to be homotopy invariant, excisive in each variable K-theories. We prove that the spectra represent universal unstable, Morita stable and stable bivariant homology theories respectively.
