The L^2-Index Theorem of Atiyah \cite{atiyah} expresses the index of an elliptic operator on a closed manifold M in terms of the G-equivariant index of some regular covering \widetilde{M} of M, with G the group of covering transformations. Atiyah's proof is analytic in nature. Our proof is algebraic and involves an embedding of a given group into an acyclic one, together with naturality properties of the indices.
