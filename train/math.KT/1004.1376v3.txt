Let G be a finite group and \Y a G-gerbe over an orbifold \B. A disconnected orbifold \hat{\Y} and a flat U(1)-gerbe c on \hat{\Y} is canonically constructed from \Y. Motivated by a proposal in physics, we study a mathematical duality between the geometry of the G-gerbe \Y and the geometry of \hat{\Y} {\em twisted by} c. We prove several results verifying this duality in the contexts of noncommutative geometry and symplectic topology. In particular, we prove that the category of sheaves on \Y is equivalent to the category of c-twisted sheaves on \hat{\Y}. When \Y is symplectic, we show, by a combination of techniques from noncommutative geometry and symplectic topology, that the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology of \Y is isomorphic to the c-twisted orbifold cohomology of \hat{\Y} as graded algebras.
