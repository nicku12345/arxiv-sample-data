Assume that abelian categories A, B over a field admit countable direct limits and that these limits are exact. Let F: D^+_{dg}(A) --> D^+_{dg}(B) be a DG quasi-functor such that the functor Ho(F): D^+(A) \to D^+(B) carries D^{\geq 0}(A) to D^{\geq 0}(B) and such that, for every i>0, the functor H^i F: A \to B is effaceable. We prove that F is canonically isomorphic to the right derived DG functor RH^0(F). We also prove a similar result for bounded derived DG categories in a more general setting. We give an example showing that the corresponding statements for triangulated functors are false. We prove a formula that expresses Hochschild cohomology of the categories  D^b_{dg}(A),  D^+_{dg}(A)  as the Ext groups in the abelian category of left exact functors A \to Ind B .
