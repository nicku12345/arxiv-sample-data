The unimodularity condition for a Poisson structure (ie., a Poisson structure with a trivial modular class) induces a Poincar\'e duality between its Poisson homology and its Poisson cohomology. Therefore an information about the Poisson homology of this kind Poisson structures induces by duality an information about its Poisson cohomology and vise versa. But this is not longer true in the case of a non trivial modular class. That is the case of Generalized Jacobian Poisson Structures (GJPS). In this paper, we consider certain GJPS in dimension 3 and obtain properties of their Poisson homological groups and their Poisson cohomological groups. More precisely, under some assumptions, we obtain the Poincar\'e series of these Poisson homological groups and we compute explicitly these Poisson cohomological groups, except the second group which seems more complicated to obtain.
