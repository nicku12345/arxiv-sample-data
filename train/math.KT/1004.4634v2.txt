We compute the space of Poisson traces on a classical W-algebra modulo an arbitrary central character, i.e., linear functionals on such an algebra invariant under Hamiltonian derivations. This space identifies with the top cohomology of the corresponding Springer fiber. As a consequence, we deduce that the zeroth Hochschild homology of the corresponding quantum W-algebra modulo a central character identifies with the top cohomology of the corresponding Springer fiber. This implies that the number of irreducible finite-dimensional representations of this algebra is bounded by the dimension of this top cohomology, which was established earlier by C. Dodd using reduction to positive characteristic. Finally, we prove that the entire cohomology of the Springer fiber identifies with the so-called Poisson-de Rham homology (defined previously by the authors) of the classical W-algebra modulo a central character.
