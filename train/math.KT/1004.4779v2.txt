Motivated by the splitting principle, we define certain simplicial complexes associated to an associative ring A, which have an action of the general linear group GL(A). This leads to an exact sequence, involving Quillen's algebraic K-groups of A and the symbol map. Computations in low degrees lead to another view on Suslin's theorem on the Bloch group, and perhaps show a way towards possible generalizations.
