We exhaustively classify topological equivariant complex vector bundles over two-sphere under a compact Lie group (not necessarily effective) action. It is shown that inequivariant Chern classes and isotropy representations at (at most) three points are sufficient to classify equivariant vector bundles except a few cases. To do it, we calculate equivariant homotopy of the set of equivariant clutching maps. Holomorphic version of this will be treated in other paper. Classification on two-torus, real projective plane, Klein bottle will appear soon.
