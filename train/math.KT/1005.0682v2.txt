We exhaustively classify topological equivariant complex vector bundles over two-torus under a compact Lie group (not necessarily effective) action. It is shown that inequivariant Chern classes and isotropy representations at (at most) six points are sufficient to classify equivariant vector bundles except a few cases. To do it, we calculate homotopy of the set of equivariant clutching maps. And, classification on real projective plane, Klein bottle will appear soon
