We compute the K-theory of comparison C^*-algebra associated to a manifold with corners. These comparison algebras are an example of the abstract pseudodifferential algebras introduced by Connes and Moscovici \cite{M3}. Our calculation is obtained by showing that the comparison algebras are a homomorphic image of a groupoid C^*-algebra. We then prove an index theorem with values in the K-theory groups of the comparison algebra.
