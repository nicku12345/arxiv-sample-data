We show how to construct a Gamma-bicategory from a symmetric monoidal bicategory, and use that to show that the classifying space is an infinite loop space upon group completion. We also show a way to relate this construction to the classic Gamma-category construction for a bipermutative category. As an example, we use this machinery to construct a delooping of the K-theory of a bimonoidal category as defined by Baas-Dundas-Rognes.
