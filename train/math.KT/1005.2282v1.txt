We compute the cyclic homology for the cross-product al- gebra A(M)\rtimes\Gamma of the algebra of complete symbols on a compact man- ifold M with action of a finite group \Gamma. A spectral sequence argument shows that these groups can be identified using deRham cohomology of the fixed point manifolds S ^*M ^g . In the process we obtain new re- sults about the homologies of general cross-product algebras and provide explicit identification of the homologies for C^{\infty}(M)\rtimes \Gamma.
