In this article we further the study of non-commutative motives. We prove that bivariant cyclic cohomology (and its variants) becomes representable in the category of non-commutative motives. Furthermore, Connes' bilinear pairings correspond to the composition operation. As an application, we obtain a simple model, given in terms of infinite matrices, for the (de)suspension of these bivariant cohomology theories.
