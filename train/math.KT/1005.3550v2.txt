The algebra \mS_n of one-sided inverses of a polynomial algebra P_n in n variables is obtained from P_n by adding commuting, {\em left} (but not two-sided) inverses of the canonical generators of the algebra P_n. The algebra \mS_n is a noncommutative, non-Noetherian algebra of classical Krull dimension 2n and of global dimension n which is not a domain. If the ground field K has characteristic zero then the algebra \mS_n is canonically isomorphic to the algebra K< \frac{\der}{\der x_1}, ..., frac{\der}{\der x_n}, \int_1, ..., \int_n> of scalar integro-differential operators. %Ignoring non-Noetherian % property, the algebra \mS_n belongs to a family of algebras % like the nth Weyl algebra A_n and the polynomial algebra %P_{2n}. It is proved that  {\rm K}_1(\mS_n)\simeq K^*. The main idea is to show that the group \GL_\infty (\mS_n) is generated by K^*, the group of elementary matrices E_\infty (\mS_n) and (n-2)2^{n-1}+1 explicit (tricky) matrices and then to prove that all the matrices are elementary. For each nonzero idempotent prime ideal \gp of height m of the algebra \mS_n, it is proved that  \rm K}_1(\mS_n, \gp)\simeq K^*, & \text{if}m=1, \Z^{\frac{m(m-1)}{2}}\times K^{*m}& \text{if}m> 1.
