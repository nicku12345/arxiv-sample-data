Let c:\mathcal{G}\to\R be a cocycle on a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid \mathcal{G} with Haar system. Under some mild conditions (satisfied by all integer valued cocycles on \'{e}tale groupoids), c gives rise to an unbounded odd \R-equivariant bimodule (\mathpzc{E},D) for the pair of C^{*}-algebras (C^{*}(\mathcal{G}),C^{*}(\mathcal{H})). If the cocycle comes from a continuous quasi-invariant measure on the unit space \mathcal{G}^{(0)}, the corresponding element in KK_{1}^{\R}(C^{*}(\mathcal{G}),C^{*}(\mathcal{H})) gives rise to an index map K_{1}^{\R}(C^{*}(\mathcal{G}))\to \C.
