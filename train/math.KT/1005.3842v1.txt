For a Lie groupoid G with a twisting (a PU(H)-principal bundle over G), we use the (geometric) deformation quantization techniques supplied by Connes tangent groupoids to define an analytic index morphism in twisted K-theory. In the case the twisting is trivial we recover the analytic index morphism of the groupoid.   For a smooth foliated manifold with twistings on the holonomy groupoid we prove the twisted analog of Connes-Skandalis longitudinal index theorem. When the foliation is given by fibers of a fibration, our index coincides with the one recently introduced by Mathai-Melrose-Singer.   We construct the pushforward map in twisted K-theory associated to any smooth (generalized) map f:W\longrightarrow M/F and a twisting \sigma on the holonomy groupoid M/F, next we use the longitudinal index theorem to prove the functoriality of this construction. We generalize in this way the wrong way functoriality results of Connes-Skandalis when the twisting is trivial and of Carey-Wang for manifolds.
