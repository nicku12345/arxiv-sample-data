We define a notion of complexity for modules over infinite groups. We show that if M is a module over the group ring kG, and M has complexity \leq f (where f is some complexity function) over some set of finite index subgroups of G, then M has complexity \leq f over G (up to a direct summand). This generalizes the Alperin-Evens Theorem, which states that if the group G is finite then the complexity of M over G is the maximal complexity of M over an elementary abelian subgroup of G. We also show how we can use this generalization in order to construct projective resolutions for the integral special linear groups, SL(n,\Z), where n\geq 2.
