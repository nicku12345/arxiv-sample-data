Let V=Spec(R) and R be a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic (0,p). For any flat R-scheme X we prove the compatibility of the de Rham fundamental class of the generic fiber and the rigid fundamental class of the special fiber. We use this result to construct a syntomic regulator map r:CH^i(X/V,2i-n)\to H^n_{syn}(X,i), when X is smooth over V, with values on the syntomic cohomology defined by A. Besser. Motivated by the previous result we also prove some of the Bloch-Ogus axioms for the syntomic cohomology theory, but viewed as an absolute cohomology theory.
