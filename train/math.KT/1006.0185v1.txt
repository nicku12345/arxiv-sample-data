In these survey lectures, we investigate the geometric and analytic properties of transverse Dirac operators. In particular, we define a transverse Dirac operator associated to a distribution that is essentially self-adjoint (Prokhorenkov-R result). We describe the Habib-R Theorem showing that the invariance of the spectrum of a basic Dirac operator on a Riemannian foliation. The Bruening-Kamber-R theorems give Atiyah-Singer type formulas for the equivariant index of transversally elliptic operators on G-manifolds and the index of basic Dirac operators on Riemannian foliations. These notes contain exercises at the end of each subsection and are meant to be accessible to graduate students.
