An analogue of Hilbert's Syzygy Theorem is proved for the algebra \mS_n (A) of one-sided inverses of the polynomial algebra A[x_1, ..., x_n] over an arbitrary ring A:  \lgldim (\mS_n(A))= \lgldim (A) +n. The algebra \mS_n(A) is noncommutative, neither left nor right Noetherian and not a domain. The proof is based on a generalization of the Theorem of Kaplansky (on the projective dimension) obtained in the paper. As a consequence it is proved that for a left or right Noetherian algebra A:  \wdim (\mS_n(A))= \wdim (A) +n.
