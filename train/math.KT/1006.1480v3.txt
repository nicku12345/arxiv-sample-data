We give a new construction of a weak form of Steenrod operations for Chow groups modulo a prime number p for a certain class of varieties. This class contains projective homogeneous varieties which are either split or over a field admitting some form of resolution of singularities, for example any field of characteristic not p. These reduced Steenrod operations are sufficient for some applications to the theory of quadratic forms.
