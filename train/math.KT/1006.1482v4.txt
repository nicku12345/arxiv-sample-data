We investigate some relations between the duality and the topological filtration in algebraic K-theory. As a result, we obtain a construction of the first Steenrod square for Chow groups modulo two of varieties over a field of arbitrary characteristic. This improves previously obtained results, in the sense that it is not anymore needed to mod out the image modulo two of torsion integral cycles. Along the way we construct a lifting of the first Steenrod square to algebraic connective K-theory with integral coefficients, and homological Adams operations in this theory. Finally we provide some applications to the Chow groups of quadrics.
