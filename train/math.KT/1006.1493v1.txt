Motivated by the theory of Coleman power series (reinterpreted via fields of norms by Fontaine) we construct a splitting of the natural map of K_1 groups arising from the mod p reduction map of the Iwasawa algebra of a pro-p Lie group. We also show the vanishing of SK_1 for certain unipotent groups.
