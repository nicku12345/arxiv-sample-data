We define n-angulated categories by modifying the axioms of triangulated categories in a natural way. We show that Heller's parametrization of pre-triangulations extends to pre-n-angulations. We obtain a large class of examples of n-angulated categories by considering (n-2)-cluster tilting subcategories of triangulated categories which are stable under the (n-2)nd power of the suspension functor. As an application, we show how n-angulated Calabi-Yau categories yield triangulated Calabi-Yau categories of higher Calabi-Yau dimension. Finally, we sketch a link to algebraic geometry and string theory.
