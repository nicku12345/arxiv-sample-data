For graded C^*-algebras A and B, we construct a semigroup {\cal AP}(A,B) out of asymptotic pairs. This semigroup is similar to the semigroup \Psi(A,B) of unbounded KK-modules defined by Baaj and Julg and there is a map \Psi(A,B) \to {\cal AP}(A,B) when B is stable. Furthermore, there is a natural semigroup homomorphism {\cal AP}(A,B) \to E(A,B), where E(A,B) is the E-theory group. We denote the image of this map E'(A,B) and prove both that E'(A,B) is a group and that the composition product of E-theory specializes to a composition product on these subgroups. Our main result is a formula for the composition product on E' under certain operator-theoretic hypotheses about the asymptotic pairs being composed. This result is complementary to known results about the Kasparov product of unbounded KK-modules.
