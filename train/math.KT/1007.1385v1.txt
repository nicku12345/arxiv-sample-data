In this thesis we construct a modified version of Karoubi's relative Chern character for smooth varieties over the complex numbers or the ring of integers in a p-adic number field. Comparison results with the Deligne-Beilinson Chern character and the p-adic Borel regulator constructed by Huber and Kings are proven. As a corollary we obtain a new proof of Burgos' theorem that Borel's regulator is twice Beilinson's regulator.
