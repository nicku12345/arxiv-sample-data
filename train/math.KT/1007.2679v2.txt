We study the Hochschild homology and cohomology of curved A-infinity algebras that arise in the study of Landau-Ginzburg (LG) models in physics. We show that the ordinary Hochschild homology and cohomology of these algebras vanish. To correct this we introduce modified versions of these theories, Borel-Moore Hochschild homology and compactly supported Hochschild cohomology. For LG models the new invariants yield the answer predicted by physics, shifts of the Jacobian ring. We also study the relationship between graded LG models and the geometry of hypersurfaces. We prove that Orlov's derived equivalence descends from an equivalence at the differential graded level, so in particular the CY/LG correspondence is a dg equivalence. This leads us to study the equivariant Hochschild homology of orbifold LG models. The results we get can be seen as noncommutative analogues of the Lefschetz hyperplane and Griffiths transversality theorems.
