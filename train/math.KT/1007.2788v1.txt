The proof of Theorem 7.12 of "Uniqueness of smooth cohomology theories" by the authors of this note is not correct. The said theorem identifies the flat part of a differential extension of a generalized cohomology theory E with ER/Z (there called "smooth extension"). In this note, we give a correct proof. Moreover, we prove slightly stronger versions of some of the other results of that paper.
