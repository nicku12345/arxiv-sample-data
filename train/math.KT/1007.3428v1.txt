We consider filtrations of objects in an abelian category \catA induced by a tilting object T of homological dimension at most two. We define three disjoint subcategories with no maps between them in one direction, such that each object has a unique filtation with factors in these categories. This filtration coincides with the the classical two-step filtration induced by torsion pairs in dimension one. We also give a refined filtration, using the derived equivalence between the derived categories of \catA and the module category of End_\catA (T)^{op}. The factors of this filtration consist of kernel and cokernels of maps between objects which are quasi-isomorphic to shifts of End_\catA (T)^{op}-modules via the derived equivalence \mathbb{R}Hom_\catA(T,-).
