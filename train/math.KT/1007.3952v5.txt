We calculate the K-theory of the Cuntz-Krieger algebra {\cal O}_E associated with an infinite, locally finite graph, via the Bass-Hashimoto operator. The formulae we get express the Grothendieck group and the Whitehead group in purely graph theoretic terms.   We consider the category of finite (black-and-white, bi-directed) subgraphs with certain graph homomorphisms and construct a continuous functor to abelian groups. In this category K_0 is an inductive limit of K-groups of finite graphs, which were calculated in \cite{MM}.   In the case of an infinite graph with the finite Betti number we obtain the formula for the Grothendieck group K_0({\cal O}_E)= {\mathbb Z}^{\beta(E)+\gamma(E)},\, where \beta(E) is the first Betti number and \gamma(E) is the valency number of the graph E. We note, that in the infinite case the torsion part of K_0, which is present in the case of a finite graph, vanishes. The Whitehead group depends only on the first Betti number: K_1({\cal O}_E)= {\mathbb Z}^{\beta(E)}. These allow us to provide a counterexample to the fact, which holds for finite graphs, that K_1({\cal O}_E) is the torsion free part of K_0({\cal O}_E).
