The main goal of this paper is to define the so-called Chow weight structure for the category of Beilinson motives over any 'reasonable' base scheme S (this is the version of Voevodsky's motives over S defined by Cisinski and Deglise). We also study the functoriality properties of the Chow weight structure (they are very similar to the well-known functoriality of weights for mixed complexes of sheaves). As shown in a preceding paper, the Chow weight structure automatically yields an exact conservative weight complex functor (with values in K^b(Chow(S))). Here Chow(S) is the heart of the Chow weight structure; it is 'generated' by motives of regular schemes that are projective over S. Besides, Grothendiek's group of S-motives is isomorphic to K_0(Chow(S)); we also define a certain 'motivic Euler characteristic' for S-schemes. We obtain (Chow)-weight spectral sequences and filtrations for any cohomology of motives; we discuss their relation to Beilinson's 'integral part' of motivic cohomology and to weights of mixed complexes of sheaves. For the study of the latter we introduce a new formalism of relative weight structures.
