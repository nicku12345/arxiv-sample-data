Let H be a Hopf algebra, A/B be an H-Galois extension. Let D(A) and D(B) be the derived categories of right A-modules and of right B-modules respectively. An object M^\cdot\in D(A) may be regarded as an object in D(B) via the restriction functor. We discuss the relations of the derived endomorphism rings E_A(M^\cdot)=\op_{i\in\mathbb{Z}}\Hom_{D(A)}(M^\cdot,M^\cdot[i]) and E_B(M^\cdot)=\op_{i\in\mathbb{Z}}\Hom_{D(B)}(M^\cdot,M^\cdot[i]). If H is a finite dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra, then E_A(M^\cdot) is a graded subalgebra of E_B(M^\cdot). In particular, if M is a usual A-module, a necessary and sufficient condition for E_B(M) to be an H^*-Galois graded extension of E_A(M) is obtained. As an application of the results, we show that the Koszul property is preserved under Hopf Galois graded extensions.
