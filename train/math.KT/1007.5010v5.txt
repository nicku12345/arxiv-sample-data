We prove that the algebra of closed differential forms in an (algebraic, formal, or analytic) disk with logarithmic singularities along several coordinate hyperplanes is (both nontopologically and topologically) Koszul. The connection with variations of mixed Hodge-Tate structures, based on a preprint by Andrey Levin, is discussed in the introduction.
