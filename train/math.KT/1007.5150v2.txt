We study a known filtration of the second cohomology of a finite dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} with coefficients in a finite dimensional nilpotent \mathfrak{g}-module M, that is based upon a refinement of the correspondence between \mathrm{H}^2(\mathfrak{g},M) and equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \mathfrak{g} by M. We give a different characterization of this filtration and as a corollary, we obtain an expression for the second Betti number of \mathfrak{g}. Using this expression, we find bounds for the second Betti number and derive a cohomological criterium for the existence of certain central extensions of \mathfrak{g}.
