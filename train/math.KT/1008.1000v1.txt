The Stickelberger splitting map in the case of abelian extensions F / \Q was defined in [Ba1, Chap. IV]. The construction used Stickelebrger's theorem. For abelian extensions F / K with an arbitrary totally real base field K the construction of \cite{Ba1} cannot be generalized since Brumer's conjecture (the analogue of Stickelberger's theorem) is not proved yet at that level of generality. In this paper, we construct a general Stickelberger splitting map under the assumption that the first Stickelberger elements annihilate the Quillen K--groups groups K_2 ({\mathcal O}_{F_{l^k}}) for the Iwasawa tower F_{l^k} := F(\mu_{l^k}), for k \geq 1. The results of [Po] give examples of CM abelian extensions F/K of general totally real base-fields K for which the first Stickelberger elements annihilate K_2 ({\mathcal O}_{F_{l^k}})_l for all k \geq 1, while this is proved in full generality in [GP], under the assumption that the Iwasawa \mu--invariant \mu_{F,l} vanishes. As a consequence, our Stickelberger splitting map leads to annihilation results as predicted by the original Coates-Sinnott conjecture for the subgroups div(K_{2n}(F)_l) of K_{2n}(O_F)_l consisting of all the l--divisible elements in the even Quillen K-groups of F, for all odd primes l and all n. } In \S6, we construct a Stickelberger splitting map for \'etale K--theory. Finally, we construct both the Quillen and \'etale Stickelberger splitting maps under the more general assumption that for some arbitrary but fixed natural number m>0, the corresponding m--th Stickelberger elements annihilate K_{2m} ({\mathcal O}_{F_k})_l (respectively K^{et}_{2m} ({\mathcal O}_{F_k})_l), for all k
