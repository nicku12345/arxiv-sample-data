We present 18 Introductory Lectures on K-Theory covering its basic three branches, namely topological, analytic (K-Homology) and Higher Algebraic K-Theory, 6 lectures on each branch. The skeleton of these notes was provided by the author's personal notes from a graduate summer school on K-Theory organised by the London Mathematical Society (LMS) back in 1995 in Lancaster, UK.
