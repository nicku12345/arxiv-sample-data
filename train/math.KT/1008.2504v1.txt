For any strong smash product algebra A\#_{_R}B of two algebras A and B with a bijective morphism R mapping from B\ot A to A\ot B, we construct a cylindrical module A\natural B whose diagonal cyclic module \Delta_{\bullet}(A\natural B) is graphically proven to be isomorphic to C_{\bullet}(A\#_{_R}B) the cyclic module of the algebra. A spectral sequence is established to converge to the cyclic homology of A\#_{_R}B. Examples are provided to show how our results work. Particularly, the cyclic homology of the Pareigis' Hopf algebra is obtained in the way.
