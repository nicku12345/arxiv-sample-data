The purpose of this paper is to give some solutions for the classification problem in fibration theory by using the homotopy sequences of fibrations (sequences of n-th homotopy groups  \pi_{n}(S,s_{o})  of total spaces of fibrations). In particular, to show the role of homotopy sequence of n-th homotopy to get the required fiber map in Fadell-Dold theorem such that the restriction of this fiber map on some fiber spaces is a homotopy equivalence.
