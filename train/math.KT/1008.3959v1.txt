Let f:E\longrightarrow O be a Hurewicz fibration with a fiber space F_{r_{o}} and a lifting function L_{f}. The \emph{Lf-function} \Theta_{L_{f}} of f is defined by the restriction map of L_{f} on the space \Omega(O,r_{o})\times F_{r_{o}}\times \{1\}. The purpose of this paper is to give some results which show the role of Lf-functions in finding a fiber homotopically equivalent relation between two fibrations, over a common polyhedron base. Furthermore we will prove the equivalently between our results and Dold's theorem in fiber bundles, over a common suspension base of polyhedron spaces.
