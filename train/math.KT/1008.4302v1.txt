Vakil studied the intersection theory of Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian in a very direct way: he degenerated the intersection of a Schubert variety X_mu and opposite Schubert variety X^nu to a union {X^lambda}, with repetition. This degeneration proceeds in stages, and along the way he met a collection of more complicated subvarieties, which he identified as the closures of certain locally closed sets.   We show that Vakil's varieties are _positroid varieties_, which in particular shows they are normal, Cohen-Macaulay, have rational singularities, and are defined by the vanishing of Pl\"ucker coordinates [Knutson-Lam-Speyer]. We determine the equations of the Vakil variety associated to a partially filled ``puzzle'' (building on the appendix to [Vakil]), and extend Vakil's proof to give a geometric proof of the puzzle rule from [Knutson-Tao '03] for equivariant Schubert calculus.   The recent paper [Anderson-Griffeth-Miller] establishes (abstractly; without a formula) three positivity results in equivariant K-theory of flag manifolds G/P. We demonstrate one of these concretely, giving a corresponding puzzle rule.
