Assume G is a polycyclic group and \phi:G\to G an endomorphism. Let G\ast_{\phi} be the ascending HNN extension of G with respect to \phi; that is, G\ast_{\phi} is given by the presentation G\ast_{\phi}= < G, t \ |\ t^{-1}gt = \phi(g)\ \{for all}\ g\in G >. Furthermore, let \hat{G\ast_{\phi}} be the profinite completion of G\ast_{\phi}. We prove that, for any finite discrete \hat{G\ast_{\phi}}-module A, the map H^*(\hat{G\ast_{\phi}}, A)\to H^*(G\ast_{\phi},A) induced by the canonical map G\ast_{\phi}\to \hat{G\ast_{\phi}} is an isomorphism.
