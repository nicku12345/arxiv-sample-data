Let A be a not necessarily commutative monoid with zero such that projective A-acts are free. This paper shows that the algebraic K-groups of A can be defined using the +-construction and the Q-construction. It is shown that these two constructions give the same K-groups. As an immediate application, the homotopy invariance of algebraic K-theory of certain affine \mathbb{F}_1-schemes is obtained. From the computation of K_2(A), where A is the monoid associated to a finitely generated abelian group, the universal central extension of certain groups are constructed.
