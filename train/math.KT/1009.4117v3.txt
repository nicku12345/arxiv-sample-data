Let X be a Noetherian separated scheme of finite Krull dimension. We show that the layers of the slice filtration in the motivic stable homotopy category \stablehomotopy are strict modules over Voevodsky's algebraic cobordism spectrum. We also show that the zero slice of any commutative ring spectrum in \stablehomotopy is an oriented ring spectrum in the sense of Morel, and that its associated formal group law is additive. As a consequence, we get that with rational coefficients the slices are in fact motives in the sense of Cisinski-D{\'e}glise \cite{mixedmotives}, and have transfers if the base scheme is excellent. This proves a conjecture of Voevodsky \cite[conjecture 11]{MR1977582}.
