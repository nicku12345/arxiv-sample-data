Let k be a field of characteristic p. We construct a new inflation functor for cohomological Mackey functors for finite groups over k. Using this inflation functor, we give an explicit presentation of the graded algebra of self extensions of the simple functor S_\un^G, when p is odd and G is an elementary abelian p-group.
