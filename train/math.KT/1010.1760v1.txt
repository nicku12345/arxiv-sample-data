Three kinds of universal central extension are considered for a perfect Lie algebra. More precisely, one can consider such a Lie algebra as a Lie triple system, or a Leibniz algebra and construct appropriate central extensions. We show that Lie triple system universal central extension is isomorphic either to Lie or Leibniz algebra universal central extension considered as a Lie triple system in appropriate way.
