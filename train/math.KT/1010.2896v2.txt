This paper is devoted to the open problem in \mathbb{F}_1-geometry of developing K-theory for \mathbb{F}_1-schemes. We provide all necessary facts from the theory of monoid actions on pointed sets and we introduce sheaves for \mathcal{M}_0-schemes and \mathbb{F}_1-schemes in the sense of Connes and Consani. A wide range of results hopefully lies the background for further developments of the algebraic geometry over \mathbb{F}_1. Special attention is paid to two aspects particular to \mathbb{F}_1-geometry, namely, normal morphisms and locally projective sheaves, which occur when we adopt Quillen's Q-construction to a definition of G-theory and K-theory for \mathbb{F}_1-schemes. A comparison with Waldhausen's S_{\bullet}-construction yields the ring structure of K-theory. In particular, we generalize Deitmar's K-theory of monoids and show that K_*(\Spec\mathbb{F}_1) realizes the stable homotopy of the spheres as a ring spectrum.
