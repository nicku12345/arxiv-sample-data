We compute the Picard group  Pic(A_q)  of the noncommutative algebraic 2-torus A_q, describe its action on the space  R(A_q)  of isomorphism classes of rk 1 projective modules and classify the algebras Morita equivalent to  A_q . Our computations are based on a quantum version of the Calogero-Moser correspondence relating projective A_q-modules to irreducible representations of the double affine Hecke algebras (DAHA)  H_{t, q^{-1/2}}(S_n)  at  t = 1 . We show that, under this correspondence, the action of  Pic(A_q)  on  R(A_q)  agrees with the action of  SL_2(Z)  on  H_{t, q^{-1/2}}(S_n)  constructed by I.Cherednik. We compare our results with smooth and analytic cases. In particular, when  |q| \not= 1 , we find that  Pic(A_q)  is isomorphic to the group of auto-equivalences  Auteq(D^b(X))/Z  of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on the elliptic curve  X = C*/Z  modulo translations.
