Bloch and Kriz construct an abelian category of mixed Tate motives as the category of comodules over a Hopf algebra obtained by the bar construction of the DGA of cycle complexes. In this paper we generalize their construction to give the definition of a category of mixed elliptic motives, i.e. a Tannakian category of mixed motives generated by an elliptic curve. We introduce the notion of a relative DGA over a reductive group. Then the category of mixed elliptic motives is defined as the category of comodules over the relative bar construction of a certain DGA A_{EM} which is constructed from cycle complexes. The elliptic polylogarithm of Beilinson-Levin gives an interesting object in this category.
