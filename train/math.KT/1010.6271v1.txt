Let X be a compact Hausdorff space, let \Gamma be a discrete group that acts continuously on X from the right, define \widetilde{X} = \{(x,\gamma) \in X \times \Gamma : x\cdot\gamma= x\}, and let \Gamma act on \widetilde{X} via the formula (x,\gamma)\cdot\alpha = (x\cdot\alpha, \alpha^{-1}\gamma\alpha). Results of P. Baum and A. Connes, along with facts about the Chern character, imply that K^i_\Gamma(X) \otimes \mathbb{C} \cong K^i(\widetilde{X}\slash\Gamma) \otimes \mathbb{C} for i = 0, -1. In this note, we present an example where the groups K^i_\Gamma(X) and K^i(\widetilde{X}\slash\Gamma) are not isomorphic.
