A spectral sequence for the computation of the Hochschild cohomology of a coconnective dga over a field is presented. This spectral sequence has a similar flavour to the spectral sequence constructed by Cohen, Jones and Yan for the computation of the loop homology of a closed orientable manifold. Using this spectral sequence we identify a class of spaces for which the Hochschild cohomology of their mod-p cochain algebra is Noetherian. This implies, among other things, that for such a space the derived category of mod-p chains on its loop-space carries a theory of support varieties.
