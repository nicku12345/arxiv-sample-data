We study certain 'weights' for triangulated categories endowed with t-structures. Our results axiomatize and describe in detail the relations between the Chow weight structure (introduced in a preceding paper), the (conjectural) motivic t-structure for Voevodsky's motives, and the conjectural weight filtration for them. This picture becomes non-conjectural when restricted to the derived categories of 1-motives (over a smooth base) and of Artin-Tate motives over number fields; other examples include Beilinson's derived category of graded polarizable mixed Hodge complexes and Saito's derived category of mixed Hodge modules. We also study weight filtrations for the heart of t and (the degeneration of) weight spectral sequences. In a subsequent paper we apply the results obtained in order to prove that (certain) 'standard' conjectures imply the existence of Beilinson's categories of mixed motivic sheaves endowed with weight filtrations.
