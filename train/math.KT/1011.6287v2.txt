The C*-algebras called Quantum Heisenberg Manifolds (QHM) were introduced by Rieffel in 1989 as strict deformation quantizations of Heisenberg manifolds. In this article, we compute the pairings of K-theory and cyclic cohomology on the QHM. Combining these calculations with other results proved elsewhere, we also determine the periodic cyclic homology and cohomology of these algebras, and obtain explicit bases of the periodic cyclic cohomology of the QHM. We further isolate bases of periodic cyclic homology, expressed as Chern characters of the K-theory.
