Let \calA_+ denote the set of Laplace transforms of complex Borel measures \mu on [0,+\infty) such that \mu does not have a singular non-atomic part. In \cite{BalSas}, an extension of the classical \nu-metric of Vinnicombe was given, which allowed one to address robust stabilization problems for unstable plants over \calA_+. In this article, we show that this new \nu-metric gives a topology on unstable plants which coincides with the classical gap topology for unstable plants over \calA_+ with a single input and a single output.
