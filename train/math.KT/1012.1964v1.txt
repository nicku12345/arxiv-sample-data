We explicitly compute the 2-group of self-equivalences and (homotopy classes of) chain homotopies between them for any {\it split} chain complex A_{\bullet} in an arbitrary \kb-linear abelian category (\kb any commutative ring with unit). In particular, it is shown that it is a {\it split} 2-group whose equivalence class depends only on the homology of A_{\bullet}, and that it is equivalent to the trivial 2-group when A_\bullet is a split exact sequence. This provides a description of the {\it general linear 2-group} of a Baez and Crans 2-vector space over an arbitrary field \mathbb{F} and of its generalization to chain complexes of vector spaces of arbitrary length.
