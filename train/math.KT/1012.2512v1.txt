We offer here a more direct approach to twisted K-theory, based on the notion of twisted vector bundles (of finite or infinite dimension) and of twisted principal bundles. This is closeely related to the classical notion ot torsors and bundles of modules over an algebra bundle.   Twisted K-theory is simply defined as the Grothendieck group of twisted vector bundles (with a given twist). The usual operations on vector bundles (exterior powers, Adams operations) are easily extended to this twisted framework. Graded twisted K-theory, which is important for the definition and proof of the Thom isomorphism in this framework, is defined with the same formalism.   We also define a twisted Chern character with target "twisted cohomology". Although there are many definitions of this character in the literature, our method is more elementary and is based on the classical definitions of the Chern-Weil theory, via connections and curvatures. In this way, we get explicit formulas very much in the spirit of Steenrod's coordinate bundles.
