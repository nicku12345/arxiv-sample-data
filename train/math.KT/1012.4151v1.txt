In this paper, the second of a series of two, we continue the study of higher index theory for expanders. We prove that if a sequence of graphs has girth tending to infinity, then the maximal coarse Baum-Connes assembly map is an isomorphism for the associated metric space X. As discussed in the first paper in this series, this has applications to the Baum-Connes conjecture for `Gromov monster' groups.   We also introduce a new property, `geometric property (T)'. For the metric space associated to a sequence of graphs, this property is an obstruction to the maximal coarse assembly map being an isomorphism. This enables us to distinguish between expanders with girth tending to infinity, and, for example, those constructed from property (T) groups.
