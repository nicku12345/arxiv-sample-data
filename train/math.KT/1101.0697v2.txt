We construct a Baum-Douglas type model for K-homology with coefficients in \mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}. The basic geometric object in a cycle is a spin^c \mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}-manifold. The relationship between these cycles and the topological side of the Freed-Melrose index theorem is discussed in detail. Finally, using inductive limits, we construct geometric models for K-homology with coefficients in any countable abelian group.
