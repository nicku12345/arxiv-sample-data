We discuss the analytic aspects of the geometric model for K-homology with coefficients in \mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z} constructed in "Geometric K-homology with coefficients I". In particular, using results of Rosenberg and Schochet, we construct a map from this geometric model to its analytic counterpart. Moreover, we show that this map is an isomorphism in the case of a finite CW-complex. The relationship between this map and the Freed-Melrose index theorem is also discussed. Many of these results are analogous to those of Baum and Douglas in the case of spin^c manifolds, geometric K-homology, and Atiyah-Singer index theorem.
