We prove a formula expressing the motivic integral (\cite{ls}) of a K3 surface over \bC((t)) with semi-stable reduction in terms of the associated limit Hodge structure. Secondly, for every smooth variety over a non-archimedean field we define an analogue of the monodromy pairing, constructed by Grothendieck in the case of Abelian varieties, and prove that our monodromy pairing is a birational invariant of the variety. Finally, we propose a conjectural formula for the motivic integral of maximally degenerated K3 surfaces over an arbitrary non-archimedean field and prove this conjecture for Kummer K3 surfaces.
