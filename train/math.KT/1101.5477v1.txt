We conjecture the existence of special elements in odd degree higher algebraic K-groups of number fields that are related in a precise way to the values at strictly negative integers of the derivatives of Artin L-functions of finite dimensional complex representations. We prove this conjecture in certain important cases and also provide other evidence (both theoretical and numerical) in its support.
