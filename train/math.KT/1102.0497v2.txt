Given a bounding class B, we construct a bounded refinement BK(-) of Quillen's K-theory functor from rings to spaces. BK(-) is a functor from weighted rings to spaces, and is equipped with a comparison map BK \to K induced by "forgetting control". In contrast to the situation with B-bounded cohomology, there is a functorial splitting BK(-) \simeq K(-) \times BK^{rel}(-) where BK^{rel}(-) is the homotopy fiber of the comparison map.
