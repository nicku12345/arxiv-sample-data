We construct new indecomposable elements in the higher Chow group CH2(A,1) of a principally polarized Abelian surface over a non Archimedean local field, which generalize an element constructed by Collino. These elements are constructed using a generalization, due to Birkenhake and Wilhelm, of a classical construction of Humbert, along with some recent work of Bogomolov, Hassett and Tschinkel on deformations of rational curves on a K3 surface. They can be used to prove the non-Archimedean Hodge-D-conjecture - namely, the surjectivity of the boundary map in the localization sequence - in the case when the Abelian surface has good and ordinary reduction. This is a revised and updated version of an earlier preprint with the name `Abelian surfaces, Kummer surfaces and the non-Archimedean Hodge-D-conjecture.'
