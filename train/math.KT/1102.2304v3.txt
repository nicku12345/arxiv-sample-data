In [P. Niroomand, R. Rezaei, On the exterior degree of finite groups, Comm. Algebra 39 (2011), 335-343] it is introduced a group invariant, related to the number of elements x and y of a finite group G, such that x \wedge y = 1_{G \wedge G} in the exterior square G \wedge G of G. This number gives restrictions on the Schur multiplier of G and, consequently, large classes of groups can be described. In the present paper we generalize the previous investigations on the topic, focusing on the number of elements of the form h^m \wedge k of H \wedge K such that h^m \wedge k = 1_{H \wedge K}, where m \ge 1 and H and K are arbitrary subgroups of G.
