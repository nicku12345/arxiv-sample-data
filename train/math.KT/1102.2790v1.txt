In this article, a new construction of derived equivalences is given. It relates different endomorphism rings and more generally cohomological endomorphism rings - including higher extensions - of objects in triangulated categories. These objects need to be connected by certain universal maps that are cohomological approximations and that exist in very general circumstances. The construction turns out to be applicable in a wide variety of situations, covering finite dimensional algebras as well as certain infinite dimensional algebras, Frobenius categories and n-Calabi-Yau categories.
