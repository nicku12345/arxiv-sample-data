We prove a Godbillon-Vey index formula for longitudinal Dirac operators on a foliated bundle with boundary; in particular, we define a Godbillon-Vey eta invariant on the boundary-foliation; this is a secondary invariant for longitudinal Dirac operators on type-III foliations. Moreover, employing the Godbillon-Vey index as a pivotal example, we explain a new approach to higher index theory on geometric structures with boundary. This is heavily based on the interplay between the absolute and relative pairings of K-theory and cyclic cohomology for an exact sequence of Banach algebras which in the present context takes the form 0\to J\to A\to B\to 0, with J dense and holomorphically closed in the C^*-algebra of the foliation and B depending only on boundary data. Of particular importance is the definition of a relative cyclic cocycle (\tau_{GV}^r,\sigma_{GV}) for the pair A\to B; \tau_{GV}^r is a cyclic cochain on A defined through a regularization, \`a la Melrose, of the usual Godbillon-Vey cyclic cocycle \tau_{GV}; \sigma_{GV} is a cyclic cocycle on B, obtained through a suspension procedure involving \tau_{GV} and a specific 1-cyclic cocycle (Roe's 1-cocycle). We call \sigma_{GV} the eta cocycle associated to \tau_{GV}. The Atiyah-Patodi-Singer formula is obtained by defining a relative index class \Ind (D,D^\partial)\in K_* (A,B) and establishing the equality <\Ind (D),[\tau_{GV}]>=<\Ind (D,D^\partial), [\tau^r_{GV}, \sigma_{GV}]>. The Godbillon-Vey eta invariant \eta_{GV} is obtained through the eta cocycle \sigma_{GV}.
