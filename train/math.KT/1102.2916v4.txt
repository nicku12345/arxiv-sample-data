Conjecture 1 of Stanley Chang: "Positive scalar curvature of totally nonspin manifolds" asserts that a closed smooth manifold M with non-spin universal covering admits a metric of positive scalar curvature if and only if a certain homological condition is satisfied. We present a counterexample to this conjecture, based on the counterexample to the unstable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture given in Schick: "A counterexample to the (unstable) Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture".
