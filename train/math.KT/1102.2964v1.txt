We show the characterization analogous to dimension groups of partially ordered real vector spaces with interpolation works, but sequential direct limits of simplicial vector spaces only under strong assumptions. We also provide and generalize a proof of a result of Fuchs asserting that the real polynomial algebra with pointwise ordering coming from an interval satisfies Riesz interpolation
