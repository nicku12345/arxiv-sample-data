We prove for a large family of rings R that their lambda-pure global dimension is greater than one for each infinite regular cardinal lambda. This answers in negative a problem posed by Rosicky. The derived categories of such rings then do not satisfy the Adams lambda-representability for morphisms for any lambda. Equivalently, they are examples of well generated triangulated categories whose lambda-abelianization in the sense of Neeman is not a full functor for any lambda. In particular we show that given a compactly generated triangulated category, one may not be able to find a Rosicky functor among the lambda-abelianization functors.
