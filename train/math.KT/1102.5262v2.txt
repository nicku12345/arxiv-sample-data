We show that the Chern-Connes character from Kasparov's bivariant K-theory to bivariant local cyclic cohomology is not always rationally injective. Counterexamples are provided by the reduced group C^*-algebras of word-hyperbolic groups with Kazhdan's property (T). The proof makes essential use of Skandalis' work on K-nuclearity and of Lafforgue's recent demonstration of the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients for word-hyperbolic groups.
