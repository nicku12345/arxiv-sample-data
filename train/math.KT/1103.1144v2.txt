We reveal a correspondence between the homological torsion of the Bianchi groups and new geometric invariants, which are effectively computable thanks to their action on hyperbolic space. We use it to explicitly compute their integral group homology and equivariant K-homology. By the Baum/Connes conjecture, which holds for the Bianchi groups, we obtain the K-theory of their reduced C^*-algebras in terms of isomorphic images of the computed K-homology. We further find an application to Chen/Ruan orbifold cohomology. % {\it To cite this article: Alexander D. Rahm, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I +++ (2011).}
