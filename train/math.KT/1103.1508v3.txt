Let q=p^s be a prime power, F a field containing a root of unity of order q, and G_F its absolute Galois group. We determine a new canonical quotient \mathrm{Gal}(F_{(3)}/F) of G_F which encodes the full mod-q cohomology ring H^*(G_F,\mathbb{Z}/q) and is minimal with respect to this property. We prove some fundamental structure theorems related to these quotients. In particular, it is shown that when q=p is an odd prime, F_{(3)} is the compositum of all Galois extensions E of F such that \mathrm{Gal}(E/F) is isomorphic to \{1\}, \mathbb{Z}/p or to the nonabelian group H_{p^3} of order p^3 and exponent p.
