We compare the second adjoint and trivial Leibniz cohomology spaces of a Lie algebra to the usual ones by a very elementary approach. The comparison gives some conditions, which are easy to verify for a given Lie algebra, for deciding whether it has more Leibniz deformations than just the Lie ones. We also give the complete description of a Leibniz (and Lie) versal deformation of the 4-dimensional diamond Lie algebra, and study the case of its 5-dimensional analogue.
