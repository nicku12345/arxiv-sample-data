In our earlier work we studied Koszulity of a family of operads depending on a natural number n and on the degree d of the generating operation. While we proved that, for n < 8, this operad is Koszul if and only if d is even, and while it follows from a work of Hoffbeck that it is Koszul for d even and arbitrary n, its (non)Koszulity for d odd and n > 7 remains an open problem. In this note, we describe some related numerical experiments, and formulate a conjecture suggested by the results of these computations.
