We prove that for an inclusion of unital associative but not necessarily commutative algebras B\subseteq A we have long exact sequences in Hochschild homology and cyclic (co)homology akin to the Jacobi-Zariski sequence in Andr\'e-Quillen homology, provided that the quotient B-bimodule A/B is flat. We also prove that for an arbitrary r-flat morphism f:B\to A with an H-unital kernel, one can express the Wodzicki excision sequence and the corresponding Jacobi-Zariski sequence in Hochschild homology and cyclic (co)homology as a single long exact sequence.
