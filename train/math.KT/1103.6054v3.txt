We investigate a set of functional equations defining a projection in the noncommutative 2-torus algebra A_{\theta}. The exact solutions of these provide various generalisations of the Powers-Rieffel projection. By identifying the corresponding K_0(A_{\theta}) classes we get an insight into the structure of projections in A_{\theta}.
