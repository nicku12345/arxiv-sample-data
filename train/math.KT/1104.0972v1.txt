Presented is a structure theorem for the Leibniz Homology, HL_*, of an Abelian extension of a simple real Lie algebra g. As applications, results are stated for affine extensions of the classical Lie algebras sl_n(R), so_n(R), and sp_n(R). Furthermore, HL_*(h) is calculated when h is the Lie algebra of the Poincare group as well as the Lie algebra of the affine Lorentz group. The general theorem identifies all of these in terms of g-invariants.
