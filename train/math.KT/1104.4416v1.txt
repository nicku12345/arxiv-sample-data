Let \Gamma be an \widetilde A_2 subgroup of \PGL_3(\mathbb K), where \mathbb K is a local field with residue field of order q. The module of coinvariants C(\mathbb P^2_{\mathbb K},\mathbb Z)_{\Gamma} is shown to be finite, where \mathbb P^2_{\mathbb K} is the projective plane over \mathbb K. If the group \Gamma is of Tits type and if q \not\equiv 1 \pmod {3} then the exact value of the order of the class [I]_{K_0} in the K-theory of the (full) crossed product C^*-algebra C(\Omega)\rtimes\Gamma is determined, where \Omega is the Furstenberg boundary of \PGL_3(\mathbb K). For groups of Tits type, this verifies a conjecture of G. Robertson and T. Steger.
