The goal of this paper is to prove: if certain 'standard' conjectures on motives over algebraically closed fields hold, then over any 'reasonable' S there exists a motivic t-structure for the category of Voevodsky's S-motives (as constructed by Cisinski and Deglise). If S is 'very reasonable' (for example, of finite type over a field) then the heart of this t-structure (the category of mixed motivic sheaves over S) is endowed with a weight filtration with semi-simple factors. We also prove a certain 'motivic decomposition theorem' (assuming the conjectures mentioned) and characterize semi-simple motivic sheaves over S in terms of those over its residue fields. Our main tool is the theory of weight structures. We actually prove somewhat more than the existence of a weight filtration for mixed motivic sheaves: we prove that the motivic t-structure is transversal to the Chow weight structure for S-motives (that was introduced previously and independently by D. Hebert and the author; weight structures and their transversality with t-structures were also defined by the author in recent papers). We also deduce several properties of mixed motivic sheaves from this fact. Our reasoning relies on the degeneration of Chow-weight spectral sequences for 'perverse 'etale homology' (that we prove unconditionally); this statement also yields the existence of the Chow-weight filtration for such (co)homology that is strictly restricted by ('motivic') morphisms.
