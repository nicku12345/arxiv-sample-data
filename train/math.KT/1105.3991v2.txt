The generating series of the Bass numbers \mu^i_R=\mathrm{rank}_k \mathrm{Ext}^i_R(k,R) of local rings R with residue field k are computed in closed rational form, in case the embedding dimension e of R and its depth d satisfy e-d\le 3. For each such R it is proved that there is a real number \gamma>1, such that \mu^{d+i}_R\ge\gamma\mu^{d+i-1}_R holds for all i\ge 0, except for i=2 in two explicitly described cases, where \mu^{d+2}_R=\mu^{d+1}_R=2. New restrictions are obtained on the multiplicative structures of minimal free resolutions of length 3 over regular local rings.
