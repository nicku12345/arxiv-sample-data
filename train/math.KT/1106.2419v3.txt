In this paper, we develop a quantitative K-theory for filtered C*-algebras. Particularly interesting examples of filtered C*-algebras include group C*-algebras, crossed product C*-algebras and Roe algebras. We prove a quantitative version of the six term exact sequence and a quantitative Bott periodicity. We apply the quantitative K-theory to formulate a quantitative version of the Baum-Connes conjecture and prove that the quantitative Baum-Connes conjecture holds for a large class of groups.
