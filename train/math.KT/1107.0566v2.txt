In this paper we introduce a common framework for describing the topological part of the Baum-Connes conjecture for a wide class of groups. We compute the Bredon homology for groups with aspherical presentation, one-relator quotients of products of locally indicable groups, extensions of \mathbb{Z}^n by cyclic groups, and fuchsian groups. We take advantage of the torsion structure of these groups to use appropriate models of the universal space for proper actions which allow us, in turn, to extend some technology defined by Mislin in the case of one-relator groups.
