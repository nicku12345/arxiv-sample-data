We prove that any countable discrete and torsion free subgroup of a general linear group over an arbitrary field or a similar subgroup of an almost connected Lie group satisfies the integral algebraic K-theoretic (split) Novikov conjecture over \cpt and \S, where \cpt denotes the C^*-algebra of compact operators and \S denotes the algebra of Schatten class operators. We introduce assembly maps with finite coefficients and under an additional hypothesis, we prove that such a group also satisfies the algebraic K-theoretic Novikov conjecture over \bar{\mathbb{Q}} and \mathbb{C} with finite coefficients. For all torsion free Gromov hyperbolic groups G, we demonstrate that the canonical algebra homomorphism \cpt[G]\map C^*_r(G)\hat{\otimes}\cpt induces an isomorphism between their algebraic K-theory groups.
