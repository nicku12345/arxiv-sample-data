Let G be a compact Lie group, H a closed subgroup of maximal rank and X a topological G-space. We obtain a variety of results concerning the structure of the H-equivariant K-ring K_H^*(X) viewed as a module over the G-equivariant K-ring K_G^*(X). One result is that the module has a nonsingular bilinear pairing; another is that the module contains multiplets which are analogous to the Gross-Kostant-Ramond-Sternberg multiplets of representation theory.
