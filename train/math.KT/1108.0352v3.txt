We compute the Hochschild homology of Leavitt path algebras over a field k. As an application, we show that L_2 and L_2\otimes L_2 have different Hochschild homologies, and so they are not Morita equivalent; in particular they are not isomorphic. Similarly, L_\infty and L_\infty\otimes L_\infty are distinguished by their Hochschild homologies and so they are not Morita equivalent either. By contrast, we show that K-theory cannot distinguish these algebras; we have K_*(L_2)=K_*(L_2\otimes L_2)=0 and K_*(L_\infty)=K_*(L_\infty\otimes L_\infty)=K_*(k).
