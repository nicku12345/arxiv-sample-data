The purpose of this article is to study the space of stability conditions \stab(P_n) on the bounded derived category \D^b(P_n) of finite dimensional representations of a quiver P_n with two vertices and n parallel arrows. There is a local homeomorphism \z:\stab(P_n)\rightarrow\C^2. We show that, when the number of arrows is one or two, the map is a covering map if we restrict it to the complement of a line arrangement. When the number of arrows is greater than two we need to remove uncountably many lines to obtain a covering map.
