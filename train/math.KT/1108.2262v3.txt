We show that the technical condition of solvable conjugacy bound, introduced in \cite{JOR1}, can be removed without affecting the main results of that paper. The result is a Burghelea-type description of the summands HH_*^t(\BG)_{<x>} and HC_*^t(\BG)_{<x>} for any bounding class \B, discrete group with word-length (G,L) and conjugacy class <x>\in <G>. We use this description to prove the conjecture \B-SrBC of \cite{JOR1} for a class of groups that goes well beyond the cases considered in that paper. In particular, we show that the conjecture \ell^1-SrBC (the Strong Bass Conjecture for the topological K-theory of \ell^1(G)) is true for all semihyperbolic groups which satisfy SrBC, a statement consistent with the rationalized Bost conjecture for such groups.
