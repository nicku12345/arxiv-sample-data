We decompose the twisted index obstruction \theta(M) against positive scalar curvature metrics for oriented manifolds with spin universal cover into a pairing of a twisted K-homology with a twisted K-theory class and prove that \theta(M) does not vanish if M is an orientable enlargeable manifold with spin universal cover.
