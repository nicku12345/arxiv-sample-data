It is known that, for an infinite field F, the indecomposable part of K_3(F) and the third homology of SL_2(F) are closely related. In fact, there is a canonical map \alpha: H_3(SL_2(F),Z)_F* --> K_3(F)^ind. Suslin has raised the question that, is \alpha an isomorphism? Recently Hutchinson and Tao have shown that this map is surjective. They also gave some arguments about its injectivity. In this article, we improve their arguments and show that \alpha is bijective if and only if the natural maps H_3(GL_2(F), Z)--> H_3(GL_3(F), Z) and H_3(SL_2(F), Z)_F* --> H_3(GL_2(F), Z) are injective.
