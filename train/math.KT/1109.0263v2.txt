This paper is a first of a series of three papers which study eta invariants for laminations. In this first paper, we extend the results of Higson and Roe to deal with regular (unbounded) operators and more importantly to take into account Morita equivalence of underlying C^*-algebras. Given an oriented leafwise map between leafwise oriented laminations on compact spaces, satisfying some natural assumptions, we construct a pull-back morphism between the de Rham HP complexes and prove their expected functoriality. As a byproduct, when two leafwise oriented laminations are leafwise homotopy equivalent, our construction allows to deduce an explicit path joining the leafwise signature operators and hence the famous Large Time Path appearing in the proof of the homotopy invariance of the measured Cheeger-Gromov number.
