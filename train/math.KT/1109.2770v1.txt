Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p> 0. For a basic classical Lie superalgebra, we show its restricted cohomology algebra is a finitely generated algebra. Thus the cohomological support theory can be established. As a consequence, we show that the restricted enveloping algebra of a basic classical Lie superalgebra g is always wild except g=sl(2) or g=osp(1|2) or g=C(2). Moreover, all finite dimensional indecomposable restricted representations of u(osp(1|2)), the restricted enveloping algebra of Lie superalgebra osp(1|2), are determined.
