We prove the deformation invariance of the quantum homogeneous spaces of the q-deformation of simply connected simple compact Lie groups over the Poisson-Lie quantum subgroups, in the equivariant KK-theory with respect to the translation action by maximal tori. This extends a result of Neshveyev-Tuset to the equivariant setting. As applications, we prove the ring isomorphism of the K-group of Gq with respect to the coproduct of C(Gq), and an analogue of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem for quantum spheres.
