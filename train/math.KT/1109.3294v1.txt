The Milnor conjecture has been a driving force in the theory of quadratic forms over fields, guiding the development of the theory of cohomological invariants, ushering in the theory of motivic cohomology, and touching on questions ranging from sums of squares to the structure of absolute Galois groups. Here, we survey some recent work on generalizations of the Milnor conjecture to the context of schemes (mostly smooth varieties over fields of characteristic not 2). Surprisingly, a version of the Milnor conjecture fails to hold for certain smooth complete p-adic curves with no rational theta characteristic (this is the work of Parimala, Scharlau, and Sridharan). We explain how these examples fit into the larger context of an unramified Milnor question, offer a new approach to the question, and discuss new results in the case of curves over local fields and surfaces over finite fields.
