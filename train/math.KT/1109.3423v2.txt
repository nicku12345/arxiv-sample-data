Let B=A[[t;\sigma,\delta]] be a skew power series ring such that \sigma is given by an inner automorphism of B. We show that a certain Waldhausen localisation sequence involving the K-theory of B splits into short split exact sequences. In the case that A is noetherian we show that this sequence is given by the localisation sequence for a left denominator set S in B. If B=Z_p[[G]] happens to be the Iwasawa algebra of a p-adic Lie group G\isomorph H\rtimes Z_p, this set S is Venjakob's canonical Ore set. In particular, our result implies that    0--> K_{n+1}(Z_p[[G]])--> K_{n+1}(Z_p[[G]]_S)--> K_n(Z_p[[G]],Z_p[[G]]_S)--> 0  is split exact for each n\geq 0. We also prove the corresponding result for the localisation of Z_p[[G]][\frac{1}{p}] with respect to the Ore set S^*. Both sequences play a major role in non-commutative Iwasawa theory.
