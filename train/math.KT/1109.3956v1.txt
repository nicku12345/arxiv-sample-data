In this paper we provide more counterexamples to Happel's question and Snashall-Solberg's conjecture which generalize many counterexamples to these conjectures studied in the literature. In particular, we show that a family of \mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_n-Galois covering algebras of quantized exterior algebra A_q in two variables answer negatively to Happel's question, and meanwhile, the one-point coextensions of \mathbb{Z}_n and \mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_m-Galois covering algebras of A_q negate the Snashall-Solberg's conjecture.
