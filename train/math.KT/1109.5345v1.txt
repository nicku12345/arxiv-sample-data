Motivated by the second author's construction of a classifying space for the group of pure symmetric automorphisms of a free product, we introduce and study a family of topological operads, the operads of based cacti, defined for every pointed topological space (Y,\bullet). These operads also admit linear versions, which are defined for every augmented graded cocommutative coalgebra C. We show that the homology of the topological operad of based Y-cacti is the linear operad of based H_*(Y)-cacti. In addition, we show that for every coalgebra C the operad of based C-cacti is Koszul. To prove the latter result, we use the criterion of Koszulness for operads due to the first author, utilising the notion of a filtered distributive law between two quadratic operads. We also present a new proof of that criterion which works over the ground field of arbitrary characteristic.
