The notion of Igusa-Todorov classes is introduced in connection with the finitistic dimension conjecture. As application we consider conditions on special ideals which imply the Igusa-Todorov and other finiteness conditions on modules proving the finitistic dimension conjecture and related conjectures in those cases.
