We introduce syzygies for derived categories and study their properties. Using these, we prove the derived invariance of the following classes of artin algebras: (1) syzygy-finite algebras, (2) Igusa-Todorov algebras, (3) AC algebras, (4) algebras satisfying the finitistic Auslander conjecture, and (5) algebras satisfying the generalized Auslander-Reiten conjecture. In particular, Gorenstein CM-finite algebras are derived invariants.
