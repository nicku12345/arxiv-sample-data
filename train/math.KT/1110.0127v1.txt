We show that the Strong Novikov Conjecture for the maximal C*-algebra C*(G) of a discrete group G is equivalent to a statement in topological K-theory for which the corresponding statement in algebraic K-theory is always true. We also show that for any group G, rational injectivity of the full assembly map for the topological K-theory of C*(G) follows from rational injectivity of the restricted assembly map.
