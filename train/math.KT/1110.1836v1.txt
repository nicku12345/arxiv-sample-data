We demonstrate that a conjecture of Teh which relates the niveau filtration on Borel-Moore homology of real varieties and the images of generalized cycle maps from reduced Lawson homology is false. We show that the niveau filtration on reduced Lawson homology is trivial and construct an explicit class of examples for which Teh's conjecture fails by generalizing a result of Schulting. We compare various cycle maps and in particular we show that the Borel-Haeflinger cycle map naturally factors through the reduced Lawson homology cycle map.
