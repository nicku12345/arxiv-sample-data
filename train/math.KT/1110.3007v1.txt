We give an interpretation of the Brauer group of a purely inseparable extension of exponent 1, in terms of restricted Lie-Rinehart cohomology. In particular, we define and study the category p-\rm{LR}(A) of restricted Lie-Rinehart algebras over a commutative algebra A. We define cotriple cohomology groups H_{p-LR}(L,M) for L\in p-\rm{LR}(A) and M a Beck L-module. We classify restricted Lie-Rinehart extensions. Thus, we obtain a classification theorem for regular extensions considered by Hoshschild.
