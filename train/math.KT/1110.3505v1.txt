In this paper we introduce the Fourier-Mukai transform for Lawson homology of abelian varieties and prove an inversion theorem for the Lawson homology as well as the morphic cohomology of abelian varieties. As applications, we obtain the direct sum decomposition of the Lawson homology and the morphic cohomology groups with rational coefficients, inspired by Beauville's works on the Chow theory. An analogue of the Beauville conjecture for Chow groups is proposed and is shown to be equivalent to the (weak) Suslin conjecture for Lawson homology. A filtration on Lawson homology is proposed and conjecturally it coincides to the filtration given by the direct sum decomposition of Lawson homology for abelian varieties. Moreover, a refined Friedlander-Lawson duality theorem is obtained for abelian varieties. We summarize several related conjectures in Lawson homology theory in the appendix for convenience.
