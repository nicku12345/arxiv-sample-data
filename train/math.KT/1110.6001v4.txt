We develop a version of \mathrm{G}-theory for an \mathbb{F}_1-algebra (i.e., the \mathrm{K}-theory of pointed G-sets for a pointed monoid G) and establish its first properties. We construct a Cartan assembly map to compare the Chu--Morava \mathrm{K}-theory for finite pointed groups with our \mathrm{G}-theory. We compute the \mathrm{G}-theory groups for finite pointed groups in terms of stable homotopy of some classifying spaces. We introduce certain Loday--Whitehead groups over \mathbb{F}_1 that admit functorial maps into classical Whitehead groups under some reasonable hypotheses. We initiate a conjectural formalism using combinatorial Grayson operations to address the Equivariant Nishida Problem - it asks whether \mathbb{S}^G admits operations that endow \oplus_n\pi_{2n}(\mathbb{S}^G) with a pre-\lambda-ring structure, where G is a finite group and \mathbb{S}^G is the G-fixed point spectrum of the equivariant sphere spectrum.
