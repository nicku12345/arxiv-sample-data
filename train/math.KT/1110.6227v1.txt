A noncommutative solenoid is the C*-algebra C^\ast(\Q_N^2,\sigma) where \Q_N is the group of the N-adic rationals twisted and \sigma is a multiplier of \Q_N^2. In this paper, we use techniques from noncommutative topology to classify these C*-algebras up to *-isomorphism in terms of the multipliers of \Q_N^2. We also establish a necessary and sufficient condition for simplicity of noncommutative solenoids, compute their K-theory and show that the K_0 groups of noncommutative solenoids are given by the extensions of \Z by \Q_N. We give a concrete description of non-simple noncommutative solenoids as bundle of matrices over solenoid groups, and we show that irrational noncommutative solenoids are real rank zero AT C*-algebras.
