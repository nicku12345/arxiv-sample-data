This paper contains a detailed exposition of the content of section five in Kakde's paper arXiv:1008.0142. We proceed in a slightly more axiomatic way to pin down the exact requirements on the p-adic Lie group under consideration. We also make use of our conceptual theory of the completed localization of an Iwasawa algebra as developed in arXiv:0711.2669. This simplifies some of the arguments. Otherwise, with the exception of the notation at certain places, we follow Kakde's paper.
