B-fields over a groupoid with involution are defined as Real graded Dixmier-Douady bundles. We use these to introduce the Real graded Brauer group which constitutes the set of twistings for Atiyah's KR-functor in the category of locally compact groupoids with involutions. We interpret this group in terms of groupoid extensions and elements of some equivariant Cech cohomology theory. The construction of the twisted KR-functor is outlined.
