It is shown that, for any field F \subseteq R, any ordered vector space structure of F^n with Riesz interpolation is given by an inductive limit of sequence with finite stages (F^n,\F_{>= 0}^n) (where n does not change). This relates to a conjecture of Effros and Shen, since disproven, which is given by the same statement, except with F replaced by the integers, Z. Indeed, it shows that although Effros and Shen's conjecture is false, it is true after tensoring with Q.
