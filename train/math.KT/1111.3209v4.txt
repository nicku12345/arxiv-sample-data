This is the first of a series of papers about \emph{quantization} in the context of \emph{derived algebraic geometry}. In this first part, we introduce the notion of \emph{n-shifted symplectic structures}, a generalization of the notion of symplectic structures on smooth varieties and schemes, meaningful in the setting of derived Artin n-stacks. We prove that classifying stacks of reductive groups, as well as the derived stack of perfect complexes, carry canonical 2-shifted symplectic structures. Our main existence theorem states that for any derived Artin stack F equipped with an n-shifted symplectic structure, the derived mapping stack \textbf{Map}(X,F) is equipped with a canonical (n-d)-shifted symplectic structure as soon a X satisfies a Calabi-Yau condition in dimension d. These two results imply the existence of many examples of derived moduli stacks equipped with n-shifted symplectic structures, such as the derived moduli of perfect complexes on Calabi-Yau varieties, or the derived moduli stack of perfect complexes of local systems on a compact and oriented topological manifold. We also show that Lagrangian intersections carry canonical (-1)-shifted symplectic structures.
