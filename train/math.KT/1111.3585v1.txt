We compute the Hochschild homology and cohomology, and cyclic homology, of almost Calabi-Yau algebras for SU(3) ADE graphs. These almost Calabi-Yau algebras are a higher rank analogue of the pre-projective algebras for Dynkin diagrams, which are SU(2)-related constructions. The Hochschild (co)homology and cyclic homology of A can be regarded as invariants for the braided subfactors associated to the SU(3) modular invariants.
