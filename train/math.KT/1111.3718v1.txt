Recently, Levine constructed a DG category whose homotopy category is equivalent to the full subcategory of motives over a base-scheme S generated by the motives of smooth projective S-schemes, assuming that S is itself smooth over a perfect field. In his construction, the tensor structure required \mathbb{Q}-coefficients. The author has previously shown how to provide a tensor structure on the homotopy category mentioned above, when S is semi-local and essentially smooth over a field of characteristic zero, extending Levine's tensor structure with \mathbb{Q}-coefficients. In this article, it is shown that, under these conditions, the fully faithful functor \rho_S that Levine constructed from his category of smooth motives to the category DM_S of motives over a base (defined by Cisinski-D\'{e}glise) is a tensor functor.
