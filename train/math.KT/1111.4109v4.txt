We construct a variant of Karoubi's relative Chern character for smooth, separated schemes over the ring of integers in a p-adic field and prove a comparison with the rigid syntomic regulator. For smooth projective schemes we further relate the relative Chern character to the etale p-adic regulator via the Bloch-Kato exponential map. This reproves a result of Huber and Kings for the spectrum of the ring of integers and generalizes it to all smooth projective schemes as above.
