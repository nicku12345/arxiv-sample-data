This paper studies Moore's measurable cohomology theory for locally compact groups and Polish modules. An elementary dimension-shifting argument is used to show that all classes in that theory have representatives with considerable extra topological structure beyond measurability. Using this, for certain target modules one can also construct a direct comparison map with a different cohomology theory for topological groups defined by Segal, and show that this map is an isomorphism.
