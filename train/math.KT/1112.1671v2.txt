It is well known that the positive degree cohomology of a finite group G is annihilated by |G|. We improve on this bound in the case of odd degree elements in the integer cohomology ring and show that e_{odd}(G), the exponent of the \oplus_{k=0}^{\infty} H^{2k+1}(G,\mathbb{Z}) satisfies e_{odd}(G)^2 divides 2|G| and in particular e_{odd}(G) \leq \sqrt{2|G|}. We also provide examples to show this bound for e_{odd}(G) is sharp as a general bound over all finite groups G.   The result comes from a fact about zero divisors having "complementary exponent" which we prove using duality in Tate cohomology. More particularly if \alpha, \beta are elements of positive degree in H^*(G,\mathbb{Z}) satisfying \alpha \beta = 0 then the order of \beta, o(\beta) divides \frac{|G|}{o(\alpha)}.   We also apply this fact to get some results on elements of exceptionally high exponent in the cohomology ring.
