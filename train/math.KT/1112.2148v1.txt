We compute the Chern-Connes character (a map from the K-theory of a C^*-algebra under the action of a Lie group to the cohomology of its Lie algebra) for the L^2-norm closure of the algebra of all classical zero-order pseudodifferential operators on the sphere under the canonical action of {\rm SO}(3). We show that its image is \mathbb{R} if the trace is the integral of the principal symbol.
