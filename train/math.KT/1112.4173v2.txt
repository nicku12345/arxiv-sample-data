In this paper it is shown that multiplicative cohomology theories that are rationally even -- a technical condition that is often satisfied -- the Hopkins-Singer construction of generalized differential cohomology has a unital, graded commutative multiplicative structure. To this end, an explicit integration and a differential cohomology theory for pairs are also developed.
