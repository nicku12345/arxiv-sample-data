We consider groups G which have a cocompact, 3-manifold model for the classifying space \underline{E}G. We provide an algorithm for computing the rationalized equivariant K-homology of \underline{E}G. Under the additional hypothesis that the quotient 3-orbifold \underline{E}G/G is geometrizable, the rationalized K-homology groups coincide with the rationalized K-theory of the reduced C*-algebra of G. We illustrate our algorithm on some concrete examples.
