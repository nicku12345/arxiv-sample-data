We give an elementary solution of the index problem for elliptic operators associated with the shift operator along the trajectories of an isometric diffeomorphism of a closed smooth manifold. This solution is based on a reduction (which preserves the index) of the operator to an elliptic pseudodifferential operator on a manifold of a higher dimension and an application of an Atiyah--Singer type formula. The final index formula is given in terms of the symbol of the operator on the original manifold.
