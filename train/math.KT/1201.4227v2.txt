We consider an algebraic variety X together with the choice of a subvariety Z. We show that any coherent sheaf on X can be constructed out of a coherent sheaf on the formal neighborhood of Z, a coherent sheaf on the complement of Z, and an isomorphism between certain representative images of these two sheaves in the category of coherent sheaves on a Berkovich analytic space W which we define.
