We compute the K-theory of C*-algebras generated by the left regular representation of left Ore semigroups satisfying certain regularity conditions. Our result describes the K-theory of these semigroup C*-algebras in terms of the K-theory for the reduced group C*-algebras of certain groups which are typically easier to handle. Then we apply our result to specific semigroups from algebraic number theory.
