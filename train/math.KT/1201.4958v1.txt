Generalizing Karoubi's multiplicative K-theory and multiplicative cohomology groups for smooth manifolds we define secondary theories and characteristic classes for smooth etale groupoids. As special cases we obtain versions of the groups of differential characters for smooth etale groupoids and for orbifolds.
