We show that the functor from curved differential graded algebras to differential graded categories, defined by the second author in [B], sends Cartesian diagrams to homotopy Cartesian diagrams, under certain reasonable hypotheses. This is an extension to the arena of dg categories of a construction of projective modules due to Milnor. As an example, we show that the functor satisfies descent for certain partitions of a complex manifold.
