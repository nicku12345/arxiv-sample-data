This preprint contains a part of the results of our earlier preprint arXiv:0907.3335v2 presented in a form suitable for journal publication.   It covers a construction of a 2-fold monoidal structure on the category of tetramodules, with all necessary definitions, and an overview of the results of R.Taillefer [Tai1,2] on tetramodules and the Gerstenhaber-Schack cohomology [GS] (formerly served as Appendix in arXiv:0907.3335v2), as well as a computation of the Gerstenhaber-Schack cohomology for the free commutative cocommutative bialgebra S(V), for a V is a vector space.
