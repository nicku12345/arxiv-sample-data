The goal of this paper is to present results which are consistent with conjectures about the Leibniz (co)homology for discrete groups stated by J. L. Loday. We show that rack cohomology has properties very close to the properties expected for the conjectural Leibniz cohomology. In particular, we prove the existence of a graded dendriform algebra structure on rack cohomology, and we construct a graded associative algebra morphism from group cohomology to rack cohomology which is injective in degree 1.
