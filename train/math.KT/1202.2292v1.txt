We construct a cycle in higher Hochschild homology associated to the 2-dimensional torus which represents 2-holonomy of a non-abelian gerbe in the same way the ordinary holonomy of a principal G-bundle gives rise to a cycle in ordinary Hochschild homology. This is done using the connection 1-form of Baez-Schreiber.   A crucial ingredient in our work is the possibility to arrange that in the structure crossed module mu: g -> h of the principal 2-bundle, the Lie algebra h is abelian, up to equivalence of crossed modules.
