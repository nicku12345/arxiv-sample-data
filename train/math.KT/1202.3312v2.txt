In this note the categories of coefficients for Hopf cyclic cohomology of comodule algebras and comodule coalgebras are extended. We show that these new categories have two proper different subcategories where the smallest one is the known category of stable anti Yetter-Drinfeld modules. We prove that components of Hopf cyclic cohomology such as cup products work well with these new coefficients.
