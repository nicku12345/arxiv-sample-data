In this note, we show that the algebraic K-theory of generalized archimedean valuation rings occurring in Durov's compactification of the spectrum of a number ring is given by stable homotopy groups of certain classifying spaces. We also show that the "residue field at infinity" is badly behaved from a K-theoretic point of view.
