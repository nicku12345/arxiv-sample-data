Following ideas of Graeme Segal, we construct an equivariant con- figuration space that is a model of equivariant connective K-homology spec- trum for finite groups, as a consequence we obtain an induction structure for equivariant connective K-homology. We describe explicitly the homology with complex coefficients for the fixed points of this configuration space as a Hopf algebra.
