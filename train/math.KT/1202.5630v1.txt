In our recent work with Mat Rogers on resolving some Boyd's conjectures on two-variate Mahler measures, a new analytical machinery was introduced to write the values L(E,2) of L-series of elliptic curves as periods in the sense of Kontsevich and Zagier. Here we outline, in slightly more general settings, the novelty of our method with Rogers, and provide a simple illustrative example.
