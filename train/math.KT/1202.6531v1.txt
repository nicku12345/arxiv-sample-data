We investigate when the group SL_n(\mathcal{O}(X)) of holomorphic maps from a Stein space X to SL_n (\C) has Kazhdan's property (T) for n\ge 3. This provides a new class of examples of non-locally compact groups having Kazhdan's property (T). In particular we prove that the holomorphic loop group of SL_n (\C) has Kazhdan's property (T) for n\ge 3. Our result relies on the method of Shalom to prove Kazhdan's property (T) and the solution to Gromov's Vaserstein problem by the authors.
