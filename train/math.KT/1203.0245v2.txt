A cocycle \Omega: P \times G \to H taking values in a Lie group H for a free right action of G on P defines a principal bundle Q with the structure group H over P/G. The Chern character of a vector bundle associated to Q defines then characteristic classes on X. This observation becomes useful in the case of infinite dimensional groups. It typically happens that a representation of G is not given by linear operators which differ from the indentity by a trace-class operator. For this reason the Chern character of a vector bundle associated to the principal fibration P \to P/G is ill-defined. But it may happen that the Lie algebra representations of the group H are given in terms of trace-class operators and therefore the Chern character is well-defined; this observation is useful especially if the map g\mapsto \Omega(p;g) is a homotopy equivalence on the image for any p\in P. We apply this method to the case P= \Cal A, the space of gauge connections in a finite-dimensional vector bundle, and G= \Cal G is the group of (based) gauge transformations. The method for constructing the appropriate cocycle \Omega comes from ideas in quantum field theory, used to define the renormalized gauge currents in a Fock space.
