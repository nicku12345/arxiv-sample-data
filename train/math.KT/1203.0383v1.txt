Let A \in M_{n}(\mathbb{R}) be an invertible matrix. Consider the semi-direct product \mathbb{R}^{n} \rtimes \mathbb{Z} where \mathbb{Z} acts on \mathbb{R}^{n} by matrix multiplication. Consider a strongly continuous action (\alpha,\tau) of \mathbb{R}^{n} \rtimes \mathbb{Z} on a C^{*}-algebra B where \alpha is a strongly continuous action of \mathbb{R}^{n} and \tau is an automorphism. The map \tau induces a map \widetilde{\tau} on B \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb{R}^{n}. We show that, at the K-theory level, \tau commutes with the Connes-Thom map if \det(A)>0 and anticommutes if \det(A)<0. As an application, we recompute the K-groups of the Cuntz-Li algebra associated to an integer dilation matrix.
