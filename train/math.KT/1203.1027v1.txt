Given a fiber bundle of GKM spaces, \pi\colon M\to B, we analyze the structure of the equivariant K-ring of M as a module over the equivariant K-ring of B by translating the fiber bundle, \pi, into a fiber bundle of GKM graphs and constructing, by combinatorial techniques, a basis of this module consisting of K-classes which are invariant under the natural holonomy action on the K-ring of M of the fundamental group of the GKM graph of B. We also discuss the implications of this result for fiber bundles \pi\colon M\to B where M and B are generalized partial flag varieties and show how our GKM description of the equivariant K-ring of a homogeneous GKM space is related to the Kostant-Kumar description of this ring.
