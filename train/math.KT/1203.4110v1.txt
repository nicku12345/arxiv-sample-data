Let \mathscr{A} be an abelian category and \mathscr{C} an additive full subcategory of \mathscr{A}. We provide a method to construct a proper \mathscr{C}-resolution (resp. coproper \mathscr{C}-coresolution) of one term in a short exact sequence in \mathscr{A} from that of the other two terms. By using these constructions, we answer affirmatively an open question on the stability of the Gorenstein category \mathcal{G}(\mathscr{C}) posed by Sather-Wagstaff, Sharif and White; and also prove that \mathcal{G}(\mathscr{C}) is closed under direct summands. In addition, we obtain some criteria for computing the \mathscr{C}-dimension and the \mathcal{G}(\mathscr{C)}-dimension of an object in \mathscr{A}.
