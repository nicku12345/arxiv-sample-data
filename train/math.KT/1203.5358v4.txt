We compute coherent presentations of Artin monoids, that is presentations by generators, relations, and relations between the relations. For that, we use methods of higher-dimensional rewriting that extend Squier's and Knuth-Bendix's completions into a homotopical completion-reduction, applied to Artin's and Garside's presentations. The main result of the paper states that the so-called Tits-Zamolodchikov 3-cells extend Artin's presentation into a coherent presentation. As a byproduct, we give a new constructive proof of a theorem of Deligne on the actions of an Artin monoid on a category.
