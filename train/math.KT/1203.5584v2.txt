We derive a version of the Rothenberg-Steenrod, fiber-to-base, spectral sequence for cohomology theories represented in model categories of simplicial presheaves. We then apply this spectral sequence to calculate the equivariant motivic cohomology of the general linear group with a general Gm-action, this coincides with the equivariant higher Chow groups. Some of the equivariant motivic cohomology of a Stiefel variety with a general Gm-action is deduced as a corollary.
