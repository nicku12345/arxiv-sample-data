We study the relationship between the twisted Orbifold K-theories {^{\alpha}}K_{orb}(\textsl{X}) and {^{\alpha'}}K_{orb}(\textsl{Y}) for two different twists \alpha\in Z^3(G;S^1) and \alpha'\in Z^3(G';S^1) of the Orbifolds \textsl{X}=[*/G] and \textsl{Y}=[*/G'] respectively, for G and G' finite groups. We prove that under suitable hypothesis over the twisting \alpha' and the group G' we obtain an isomorphism between these twisted K-theories.
