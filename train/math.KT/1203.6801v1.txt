The quotients of a (non-orientable) quantum Seifert manifold by circle actions are described. In this way quantum weighted real projective spaces that include the quantum disc and the quantum real projective space as special cases are obtained. Bounded irreducible representations of the coordinate algebras and the K-groups of the algebras of continuous functions on quantum weighted real projective spaces are presented.
