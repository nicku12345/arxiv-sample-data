We show that if A and H are Hopf algebras that have equivalent tensor categories of comodules, then one can transport what we call a free Yetter-Drinfeld resolution of the counit of A to the same kind of resolution for the counit of H, exhibiting in this way strong links between the Hochschild homologies of A and H. This enables us to get a finite free resolution of the counit of \mathcal B(E), the Hopf algebra of the bilinear form associated to an invertible matrix E, generalizing an ealier construction of Collins, Hartel and Thom in the orthogonal case E=I_n. It follows that \B(E) is smooth of dimension 3 and satisfies Poincar\'e duality. Combining this with results of Vergnioux, it also follows that when E is an antisymetric matrix, the L^2-Betti numbers of the associated discrete quantum group all vanish. We also use our resolution to compute the bialgebra cohomology of \B(E) in the cosemisimple case.
