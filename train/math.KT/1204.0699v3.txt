We study a modified version of Rognes' logarithmic structures on structured ring spectra. In our setup, we obtain canonical logarithmic structures on connective K-theory spectra which approximate the respective periodic spectra. The inclusion of the p-complete Adams summand into the p-complete connective complex K-theory spectrum is compatible with these logarithmic structures. The vanishing of appropriate logarithmic topological Andre-Quillen homology groups confirms that the inclusion of the Adams summand should be viewed as a tamely ramified extension of ring spectra.
