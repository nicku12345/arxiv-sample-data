We give a cohomological classification of vector bundles of rank 2 on a smooth affine threefold over an algebraically closed field having characteristic unequal to 2. As a consequence we deduce that cancellation holds for rank 2 vector bundles on such varieties. The proofs of these results involve three main ingredients. First, we give a description of the first non-stable {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy sheaf of the symplectic group. Second, these computations can be used in concert with F. Morel's {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy classification of vector bundles on smooth affine schemes and obstruction theoretic techniques (stemming from a version of the Postnikov tower in {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy theory) to reduce the classification results to cohomology vanishing statements. Third, we prove the required vanishing statements.
