It is well known that a foliation F of a smooth manifold M gives rise to a rich cohomological theory, its characteristic (i.e., leafwise) cohomology. Characteristic cohomologies of F may be interpreted, to some extent, as functions on the space P of integral manifolds (of any dimension) of the characteristic distribution C of F. Similarly, characteristic cohomologies with local coefficients in the normal bundle TM/C of F may be interpreted as vector fields on P. In particular, they possess a (graded) Lie bracket and act on characteristic cohomology H. In this paper, I discuss how both the Lie bracket and the action on H come from a strong homotopy structure at the level of cochains. Finally, I show that such a strong homotopy structure is canonical up to isomorphisms.
