We introduce in this note the notion of the category of twisted Chow-Witt correspondences CHW(k) over a field k of characteristic different from 2. Moreover, we show that over an infinite perfect field this category CHW(k) admits a fully faithful embedding into the geometric stable \A^1-derived category D_{\A^1,gm}(k) after taking \Q-localization. We also prove a conjecture of F. Morel about the rational splitting of stable \A^1-cohomology over an essentially smooth scheme S over a field k of char(k) \neq 2.
