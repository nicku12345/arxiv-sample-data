We determine the first non-stable {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy sheaf of SL_n. Using techniques of obstruction theory involving the {\mathbb A}^1-Postnikov tower, supported by some ideas from the theory of unimodular rows, we classify vector bundles of rank \geq d-1 on split smooth affine quadrics of dimension 2d-1. These computations allow us to answer a question posed by Nori, which gives a criterion for completability of certain unimodular rows. Furthermore, we study compatibility of our computations of {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy sheaves with real and complex realization.
