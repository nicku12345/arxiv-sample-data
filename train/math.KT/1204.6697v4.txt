We discuss several arithmetic aspects of Bianchi groups, especially from a computational point of view. In particular, we consider computing the homology of Bianchi groups together with the Hecke action, connections with automorphic forms, abelian varieties, Galois representations and the torsion in the homology of Bianchi groups. Along the way, we list several open problems and conjectures, survey the related literature, presenting concrete examples and numerical data.
