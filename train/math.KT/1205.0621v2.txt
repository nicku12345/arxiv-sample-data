The object of the paper is the dependence of Koszul complexes and dependence of dual Koszul complexes of two systems of non-homogeneous polynomials, when one system is a part of other system, in connection with the duality in a Koszul complex established by author earlier. Whence, the dependence of Koszul complexes and dependence of dual Koszul complexes follow when one system is linearly expressed through other system. Obtaned results are used in the proof of homotopic equivalence, formulated earlier by the author, of the Koszul complex and dual Koszul complex of a system of non-homogeneous polynomials, what happens when the ideal of these polynomials is 0-dimensional.
