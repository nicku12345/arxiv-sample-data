Let L be a finite dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0. Then by the original Levi theorem, L = B \oplus R where R is the solvable radical and B is some maximal semisimple subalgebra. We prove that if L is an H-(co)module algebra for a finite dimensional (co)semisimple Hopf algebra H, then R is H-(co)invariant and B can be chosen to be H-(co)invariant too. Moreover, the nilpotent radical N of L is H-(co)invariant and there exists an H-sub(co)module S\subseteq R such that R=S\oplus N and [B,S]=0. In addition, the H-(co)invariant analog of the Weyl theorem is proved.   In fact, under certain conditions, these results hold for an H-comodule Lie algebra L, even if H is infinite dimensional. In particular, if L is a Lie algebra graded by an arbitrary group G, then B can be chosen to be graded, and if L is a Lie algebra with a rational action of a reductive affine algebraic group G by automorphisms, then B can be chosen to be G-invariant.   Also we prove that every finite dimensional semisimple H-(co)module Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0 is a direct sum of its minimal H-(co)invariant ideals.
