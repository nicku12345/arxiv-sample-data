We prove that amenability of a discrete group is equivalent to dimension flatness of certain ring inclusions naturally associated with measure preserving actions of the group. This provides a group-measure space theoretic solution to a conjecture of L\"uck stating that amenability of a group is characterized by dimension flatness of the inclusion of its complex group algebra into the associated von Neumann algebra.
