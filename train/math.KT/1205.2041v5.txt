We describe the K-ring of the classifying space of the dihedral group in terms of generators and the minimal set of relations by emphasising the connection with the polynomials arising in the KO-rings of lens spaces and demonstrating the generators of the filtrations of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch Spectral Squence.
