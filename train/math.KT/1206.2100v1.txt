A map from the higher arithmetic K-group defined by the author to the higher arithmetic Chow group constructed by Burgos and Feliu is given. It is a higher extension of the arithmetic Chern character established by Gillet and Soul\'{e}, and it can also be regarded as an analogue of Beilinson's regulator in Arakelov geometry. It is shown that this map is compatible with the pull-back map and the product structure.
