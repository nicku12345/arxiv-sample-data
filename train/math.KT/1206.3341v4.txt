Let X be a real algebraic subset of R^n and M a smooth, closed manifold. We show that all continuous maps from M to X are homotopic (in X) to C^\infty maps. We apply this result to study characteristic classes of vector bundles associated to continuous families of complex group representations, and we establish lower bounds on the ranks of the homotopy groups of spaces of flat connections over aspherical manifolds.
