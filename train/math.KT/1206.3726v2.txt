In this article we obtain lower and upper bounds for global dimensions of a class of artinian algebras in terms of global dimensions of a finite subset of their artinian subalgebras. Finding these bounds for the global dimension of an artinian algebra A is realized via an explicit algorithm we develop. This algorithm is based on a directed graph (not the Auslander-Reiten quiver) we construct, and it allows us to decide whether an artinian algebra has finite global dimension in good number of cases.
