We show that, for a complete simplicial toric variety X, we can determine its homotopy \KH-theory entirely in terms of the torus pieces of open sets forming an open cover of X. We then construct conditions under which, given two complete simplicial toric varieties, the two spectra \KH(X) \otimes \Q and \KH(Y) \otimes \Q are weakly equivalent. We apply this result to determine the rational \KH-theory of weighted projective spaces. We next examine \K-regularity for complete toric surfaces; in particular, we show that complete toric surfaces are \K_{0}-regular. We then determine conditions under which our approach for dimension 2 works in arbitrary dimensions, before demonstrating that weighted projective spaces are not \K_{1}-regular, and for dimensions bigger than 2 are also not in general \K_{0}-regular.
