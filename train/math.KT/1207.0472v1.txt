In this paper we show that for a n-Filippov algebra \g, the tensor power \g^{\otimes n-1} is endowed with a structure of anti-symmetric co-representation over the Leibniz algebra \g^{\wedge n-1}. This co-representation is used to define two relative theories for Leibniz n-algebras with n>2 and obtain exact sequences relating them. As a result, we construct a spectral sequence for the Leibniz homology of Filippov algebras.
