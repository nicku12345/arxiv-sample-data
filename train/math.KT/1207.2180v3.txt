We study categorial properties of the operadic twisting functor Tw. In particular, we show that Tw is a comonad. Coalgebras of this comonad are operads for which a natural notion of twisting by Maurer-Cartan elements exists. We give a large class of examples, including the classical cases of the Lie, associative and Gerstenhaber operads, and their infinity-counterparts L-infinity, A-infinity, G-infinity. We also show that Tw is well behaved with respect to the homotopy theory of operads. As an application we show that every solution of Deligne's conjecture is homotopic to a solution that is compatible with twisting.
