For an isotropic reductive group G satisfying a suitable rank condition over an infinite field k, we show that the sections of the \mathbb{A}^1-fundamental group sheaf of G over an extension field L/k can be identified with the second group homology of G(L). For a split group G, we provide explicit loops representing all elements in the \mathbb{A}^1-fundamental group. Using \mathbb{A}^1-homotopy theory, we deduce a Steinberg relation for these explicit loops.
