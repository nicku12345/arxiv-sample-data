For E a presheaf of spectra on the category of smooth k-schemes satisfying Nisnevich excision, we prove that the canonical map from the algebraic singular complex of the theory E with quasi-finite supports to the theory E with supports intersecting all the faces properly is a weak equivalence on smooth k-schemes that are affine or projective. This establishes some cases of a conjecture of Marc Levine.
