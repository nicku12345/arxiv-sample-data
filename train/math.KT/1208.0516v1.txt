Let C be a curve defined over a discrete valuation field of characteristic zero where the residue field has positive characteristic. Assuming that C has good reduction over the residue field, we compute the syntomic regulator on a certain part of K_4^[(3)}(C). The result can be expressed in terms of p-adic polylogarithms and Coleman integration. We also compute the syntomic regulator on a certain part of K_4^[(3)}(F) for the function field F of C. The result can be expressed in terms of p-adic polylogarithms and Coleman integration, or by using a trilinear map ("triple index") on certain functions.
