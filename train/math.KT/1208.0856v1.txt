We construct a family of odd, finitely summable Fredholm modules over the crossed product C*-algebra C(\bd \G)\rtimes \G associated to the action of a non-elementary hyperbolic group \G on its Gromov boundary \bd \G. These Fredholm modules all represent the same, distinguished class in K-homology, namely that of the `boundary extension' of C(\bd \G)\rtimes \G associated to the Gromov compactification of \G, and is typically nonzero. Their summability is closely related to the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary. We use these results to compute the Connes-Chern character of the boundary extension in cyclic cohomology.
