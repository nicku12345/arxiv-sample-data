We establish formulas for computation of the higher algebraic K-groups of the endomorphism rings of objects linked by a morphism in an additive category. Let {\mathcal C} be an additive category, and let Y\ra X be a covariant morphism of objects in {\mathcal C}. Then K_n\big(_{\mathcal C}(X\oplus Y)\big)\simeq K_n\big(_{{\mathcal C},Y}(X)\big)\oplus K_n\big(_{\mathcal C}(Y)\big) for all 1\le n\in \mathbb{N}, where _{{\mathcal C},Y}(X) is the quotient ring of the endomorphism ring _{\mathcal C}(X) of X modulo the ideal generated by all those endomorphisms of X which factorize through Y. Moreover, let R be a ring with identity, and let e be an idempotent element in R. If J:=ReR is homological and _RJ has a finite projective resolution by finitely generated projective R-modules, then K_n(R)\simeq K_n(R/J)\oplus K_n(eRe) for all n\in \mathbb{N}. This reduces calculations of the higher algebraic K-groups of R to those of the quotient ring R/J and the corner ring eRe, and can be applied to a large variety of rings: Standardly stratified rings, hereditary orders, affine cellular algebras and extended affine Hecke algebras of type \tilde{A}.
