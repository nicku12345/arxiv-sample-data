We introduce cohomology and homology theories for small categories with general coefficient systems from simplex categories first studied by Thomason. These theories generalize at once Baues-Wirsching cohomology and homology and other more classical theories. We analyze naturality and functoriality properties of these theories and construct associated spectral sequences for functors between small categories.
