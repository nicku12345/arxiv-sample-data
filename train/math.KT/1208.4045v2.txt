Let G be a simply connected solvable Lie group with a lattice \Gamma and N the nilradical of G. For a complex valued representation \rho: G\to GL(V_{\rho}) such that the restriction \rho_{|_{N}} is unipotent, as an advanced variation of cohomology computation of solvmanifolds by using Lie algebra cohomology, we construct a explicit finite dimensional cochain complex whose cohomology is isomorphic to the cohomology of G/\Gamma with twisted by \rho.
