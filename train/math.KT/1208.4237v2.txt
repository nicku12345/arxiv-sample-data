We introduce a new variant of the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture designed to tackle coarsely disconnected metric spaces called the boundary coarse Baum-Connes conjecture. We prove this conjecture for many coarsely disconnected spaces that are known to be counterexamples to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture. In particular, we give a geometric proof of this conjecture for spaces of graphs that have large girth and bounded vertex degree. We then connect the boundary conjecture to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture using homological methods, which allows us to exhibit all the current uniformly discrete counterexamples to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture in an elementary way.
