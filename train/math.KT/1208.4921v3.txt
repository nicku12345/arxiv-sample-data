Twisted K-theory on a manifold X, with twisting in the 3rd integral cohomology, is dis- cussed in the case when X is a product of a circle T and a manifold M. The twist is assumed to be decomposable as a cup product of the basic integral one form on T and an integral class in H2(M,Z). This case was studied some time ago by V. Mathai, R. Melrose, and I.M. Singer. Our aim is to give an explicit construction for the twisted K-theory classes using a quantum field theory model, in the same spirit as the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino-Witten model is used for constructing (equivariant) twisted K-theory classes on compact Lie groups.
