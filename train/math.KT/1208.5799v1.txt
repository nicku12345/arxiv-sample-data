We prove in this paper a Borel-Weil-Bott type theorem for the coHochschild homology of a quantum shuffle algebra associated with quantum group datum taking coefficients in some well-chosen bicomodules, which can be looked as an analogue of equivariant line bundles over flag varieties in the non-commutative case.
