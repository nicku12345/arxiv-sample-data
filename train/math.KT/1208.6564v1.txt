Transitive Lie algebroids have specific properties that allow to look at the transitive Lie algebroid as an element of the object of a homotopy functor. Roughly speaking each transitive Lie algebroids can be described as a vector bundle over the tangent bundle of the manifold which is endowed with additional structures. Therefore transitive Lie algebroids admits a construction of inverse image generated by a smooth mapping of smooth manifolds. Due to to K.Mackenzie (2005) the construction can be managed as a homotopy functor \mathcal{TLA}_{\rg} from category of smooth manifolds to the transitive Lie algebroids. The functor \mathcal{TLA}_{\rg} associates with each smooth manifold M the set \mathcal{TLA}_{\rg}(M) of all transitive algebroids with fixed structural finite dimensional Lie algebra \rg. Hence one can construct a classifying space \cB_{\rg} such that the family of all transitive Lie algebroids with fixed Lie algebra \rg over the manifold M has one-to-one correspondence with the family of homotopy classes of continuous maps [M,\cB_{\rg}]: \mathcal{TLA}_{\rg}(M)\approx [M,\cB_{\rg}].   It allows to describe characteristic classes of transitive Lie algebroids from the point of view a natural transformation of functors similar to the classical abstract characteristic classes for vector bundles and to compare them with that derived from the Chern-Weil homomorphism by J.Kubarski. As a matter of fact we show that the Chern-Weil homomorphism does not cover all characteristic classes from categorical point of view.
