Within the framework of dg categories with weak equivalences and duality that have uniquely 2-divisible mapping complexes, we show that higher Grothendieck-Witt groups (aka. hermitian K-groups) are invariant under derived equivalences and that Morita exact sequences induce long exact sequences of Grothendieck-Witt groups. This implies an algebraic Bott sequence and a new proof and generalization of Karoubi's Fundamental Theorem. For the higher Grothendieck-Witt groups of vector bundles of (possibly singular) schemes with an ample family of line-bundles such that 2 is invertible in the ring of regular functions, we obtain Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequences for Nisnevich coverings and blow-ups along regularly embedded centers, projective bundle formulas, and a Bass fundamental theorem. For coherent Grothendieck-Witt groups, we obtain a localization theorem analogous to Quillen's K'-localization theorem.
