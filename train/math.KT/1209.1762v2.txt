We study the characteristic map of algebraic oriented cohomology of complete spin-flags and the ideal of invariants of formal group algebra. As an application, we provide an annihilator of the torsion part of the \gamma-filtration. Moreover, if the formal group law determined by the oriented cohomology is congruent to the additive formal group law modulo 2, then at degree 2 and 3, the \gamma-filtration of complete spin-flags is torsion free.
