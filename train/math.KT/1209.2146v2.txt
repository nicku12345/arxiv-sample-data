Given a cluster-tilted algebra B we study its first Hochschild cohomology group HH1(B) with coefficients in the B-B-bimodule B. If C is a tilted algebra such that B is the relation extension of C by E= Ext2(DC,C), then we prove that HH1(B) is isomorphic, as a vector space, to the direct sum of HH1(C) with HH1(B,E). This yields homological interpretations for results of the first and the fourth author with M.J. Redondo.
