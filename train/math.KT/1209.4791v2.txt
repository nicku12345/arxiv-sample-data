We study K-theoretical aspects of the braid groups B\_n(\mathbb{S}^{2}) on n strings of the 2-sphere, which by results of the second two authors, are known to satisfy the Farrell-Jones fibred isomorphism conjecture~\cite{JM}. In light of this, in order to determine the algebraic K-theory of the group ring \mathbb{Z}[B\_n(\mathbb{S}^{2})], one should first compute that of its virtually cyclic subgroups, which were classified by D.~L.~Gon{\c c}alves and the first author. We calculate the Whitehead and K\_{-1}-groups of the group rings of the finite subgroups (dicyclic and binary polyhedral) of B\_n(\mathbb{S}^{2}) for all 4\leq n\leq 11. Some new phenomena occur, such as the appearance of torsion for the K\_{-1}-groups. We then go on to study the case n=4 in detail, which is the smallest value of n for which B\_n(\mathbb{S}^{2}) is infinite. We show that B\_n(\mathbb{S}^{2}) is an amalgamated product of two finite groups, from which we are able to determine a universal space for proper actions of the group B\_n(\mathbb{S}^{2}). We also calculate the algebraic K-theory of the infinite virtually cyclic subgroups of B\_n(\mathbb{S}^{2}), including the Nil groups of the quaternion group of order 8. This enables us to determine the lower algebraic K-theory of \mathbb{Z}[B\_n(\mathbb{S}^{2})].
