Regularity, complete intersection and Gorenstein properties of a local ring can be characterized by homological conditions on the canonical homomorphism into its residue field (Serre, Avramov, Auslander). It is also known that in positive characteristic, the Frobenius endomorphism can also be used for these characterizations (Kunz, ...), and more generally any contracting endomorphism. We introduce here a class of local homomorphisms, in some sense larger than all above, for which these characterizations still hold, providing an unified treatment for this class of homomorphisms.
