We discuss the relationship between the {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy sheaves of {\mathbb A}^n \setminus 0 and the problem of splitting off a trivial rank 1 summand from a rank n-vector bundle. We begin by computing \pi_3^{{\mathbb A}^1}({\mathbb A}^3 \setminus 0), and providing a host of related computations of "non-stable" {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy sheaves. We then use our computation to deduce that a rank 3 vector bundle on a smooth affine 4-fold over an algebraically closed field having characteristic unequal to 2 splits off a trivial rank 1 summand if and only if its third Chern class (in Chow theory) is trivial. This result provides a positive answer to a case of a conjecture of M.P. Murthy.
