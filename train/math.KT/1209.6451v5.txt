We develop differential algebraic K-theory of regular arithmetic schemes. Our approach is based on a new construction of a functorial, spectrum level Beilinson regulator using differential forms. We construct a cycle map which represents differential algebraic K-theory classes by geometric vector bundles. As an application we derive Lott's relation between short exact sequences of geometric bundles with a higher analytic torsion form.
