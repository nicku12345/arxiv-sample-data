We show that the Fr\"olicher spectral sequence of a complex parallelizable solvmanifold is degenerate at E_{2}-term. For a semi-direct product G=\C^{n}\ltimes_{\phi}N of Lie-groups with lattice \Gamma=\Gamma^{\prime}\ltimes \Gamma^{\prime\prime} such that N is a nilpotent Lie-group with a left-invariant complex structure and \phi is a semi-simple action, we also show that, if the Fr\"olicher spectral sequence of the nilmanifold N/\Gamma^{\prime\prime} is degenerate at E_{r}-term for r\ge 2, then the Fr\"olicher spectral sequence of the solvmanifold G/\Gamma is also degenerate at E_{r}-term.
