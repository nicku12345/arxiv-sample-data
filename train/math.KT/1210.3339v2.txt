We construct quasi-phantom admissible subcategories in the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Beauville surface S. These quasi-phantoms subcategories appear as right orthogonals to subcategories generated by exceptional collections of maximal possible length 4 on S. We prove that there are exactly 6 exceptional collections consisting of line bundles (up to a twist) and these collections are spires of two helices.
