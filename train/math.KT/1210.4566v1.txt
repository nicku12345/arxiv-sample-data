In this paper, we introduce and investigate a new notion of exact sequences of semimodules over semirings relative to the canonical image factorization. Several homological results are proved using the new notion of exactness including some restricted versions of the Short Five Lemma and the Snake Lemma opening the door for introducing and investigating homology objects in such categories. Our results apply in particular to the variety of commutative monoids extending results in homological varieties.
