Under mild assumptions, we characterise modules with projective resolutions of length n in the target category of filtrated K-theory over a finite topological space in terms of two conditions involving certain Tor-groups. We show that the filtrated K-theory of any separable C*-algebra over any topological space with at most four points has projective dimension 2 or less. We observe that this implies a universal coefficient theorem for rational equivariant KK-theory over these spaces. As a contrasting example, we find a separable C*-algebra in the bootstrap class over a certain five-point space, the filtrated K-theory of which has projective dimension 3. Finally, as an application of our investigations, we exhibit Cuntz-Krieger algebras which have projective dimension 2 in filtrated K-theory over their respective primitive spectrum.
