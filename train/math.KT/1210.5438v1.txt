Given an algebra A, presented by generators and relations, i.e. as a quotient of a tensor algebra by an ideal, we construct a free algebra resolution of A, i.e. a differential graded algebra which is quasi-isomorphic to A and which is itself a tensor algebra. The construction rests combinatorially on the set of bracketings that arise naturally in the description of a free contractible differential graded algebra with given generators.
