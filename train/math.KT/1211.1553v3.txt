A geometric model for twisted K-homology is introduced. It is modeled after the Mathai-Melrose-Singer fractional analytic index theorem in the same way as the Baum-Douglas model of K-homology was modeled after the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. A natural transformation from twisted geometric K-homology to the new geometric model is constructed. The analytic assembly mapping to analytic twisted K-homology in this model is an isomorphism for torsion twists on a finite CW-complex. For a general twist on a smooth manifold the analytic assembly mapping is a surjection. Beyond the aforementioned fractional invariants, we study T-duality for geometric cycles.
