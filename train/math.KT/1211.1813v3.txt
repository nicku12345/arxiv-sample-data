In this paper we prove that cyclic homology, topological cyclic homology, and algebraic K-theory satisfy a pro Mayer--Vietoris property with respect to abstract blow-up squares of varieties, in both zero and finite characteristic. This may be interpreted as the well-definedness of K-theory with compact support.
