It is well known that strict \omega-categories, strict \omega-functors, strict natural \omega-transformations, and so on, form a strict \omega-category. A similar property for weak \omega-categories is one of the main hypotheses in higher category theory in the globular setting. In this paper we show that there is a natural globular \omega-operad which acts on the globular set of weak \omega-categories, weak \omega-functors, weak natural \omega-transformations, and so on. Thus to prove the hypothesis it remains to prove that this \omega-operad is contractible in Batanin's sense. To construct such an \omega-operad we introduce more general technology and suggest a definition of \omega-operad with the \textit{fractal property}. If an \omega-operad B^{0}_{P} has this property then one can define a globular set of all higher B^{0}_{P}-transformations and, moreover, this globular set has a B^{0}_{P}-algebra structure.
