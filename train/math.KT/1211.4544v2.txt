We consider the equivariant K-theory of a real semisimple Lie group which acts on the (complex) flag variety of its complexification group. We construct an assemble map in the framework of KK-theory and then we prove that it is an isomorphism. The prove relies on a careful study of the orbits of the real group action on the flag variety and then piecing together different orbits. This result is a special case of the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients.
