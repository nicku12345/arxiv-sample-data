This paper explores a refinement of homological mirror symmetry which relates exact symplectic topology to arithmetic algebraic geometry. We establish a derived equivalence of the Fukaya category of the 2-torus, relative to a basepoint, with the category of perfect complexes of coherent sheaves on the Tate curve over the "formal disc" Spec Z[[q]]. It specializes to a derived equivalence, over Z, of the Fukaya category of the punctured torus with perfect complexes on the curve y^2+xy=x^3 over Spec Z, the central fibre of the Tate curve; and, over the "punctured disc" Spec Z((q)), to an integral refinement of the known statement of homological mirror symmetry for the 2-torus. We also prove that the wrapped Fukaya category of the punctured torus is derived-equivalent over Z to bounded complexes of coherent sheaves on the central fiber of the Tate curve.
