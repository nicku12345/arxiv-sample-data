The aim of this paper is to show that Besser syntomic cohomology is representable by a rational ring spectrum in the motivic homotopical sense. In fact, extending previous constructions, we exhibit a simple representability criterion and we apply it to several cohomologies in order to get our central result. This theorem gives new results for syntomic cohomology such as h-descent and the compatibility of cycle classes with Gysin morphisms. Along the way, we prove that motivic ring spectra induces a complete Bloch-Ogus cohomological formalism and even more. Finally, following a general motivic homotopical philosophy, we exhibit a natural notion of syntomic coefficients.
