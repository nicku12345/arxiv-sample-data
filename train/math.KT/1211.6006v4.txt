Let X be a smooth projective R-scheme, where R is a smooth \Z-algebra. As constructed by Hesselholt, we have the absolute big de Rham-Witt complex \W\Omega^*_X of X at our disposal. There is also a relative version \W\Omega^*_{X/R} with \W(R)-linear differential. In this paper we study the hypercohomology of the relative (big) de Rham-Witt complex after truncation with finite truncation sets S. We show that it is a projective \W_S(R)-module, provided that the de Rham cohomology is a flat R-module. In addition, we establish a Poincar\'e duality theorem.
