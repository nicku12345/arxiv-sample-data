This is a study of twisted K-theory on a product space T \times M. The twisting comes from a decomposable cup product class which applies the 1-cohomology of T and the 2-cohomology of M. In the case of a topological product, we give a concrete realization for the gerbe associated to a cup product characteristic class and use this to realize twisted K^1-theory elements in terms of supercharge sections in a Fredholm bundle. The nontriviality of this construction is proved. Equivariant twisted K-theory and gerbes are studied in the product case as well. This part applies Lie groupoid theory. Superconnection formalism is used to provide a construction for characteristic polynomials which are used to extract information from the twisted K-theory classes.
