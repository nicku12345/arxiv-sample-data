We establish an Excision type theorem for niceness of group structure on the orbit space of unimodular rows of length n modulo elementary action. This permits us to establish niceness for relative versions of results for the cases when n = d+1, d being the dimension of the base algebra. We then study and establish niceness for the case when n = d, and also establish a relative version, when the base ring is a smooth affine algebra over an algebraically closed field.
