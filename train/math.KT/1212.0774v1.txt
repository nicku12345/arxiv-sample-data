We show that the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring HH^*(RG,RG) of a finite group algebra RG is isomorphic to a direct sum of the Tate cohomology rings of the centralizers of conjugacy class representatives of G. Moreover, our main result provides an explicit formula for the cup product in HH^*(RG,RG) with respect to this decomposition. As an example, this formula helps us to compute the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring of the symmetric group S_3 with coefficients in a field of characteristic 3.
