An involutive distribution C on a smooth manifold M is a Lie-algebroid acting on sections of the normal bundle TM/C. It is known that the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex associated to this representation of C possesses the structure \mathbb{X} of a strong homotopy Lie-Rinehart algebra. It is natural to interpret \mathbb{X} as the (derived) Lie-Rinehart algebra of vector fields on the space \mathbb{P} of integral manifolds of C. In this paper, I show that \mathbb{X} is embedded in a strong homotopy associative algebra \mathbb{D} of (normal) differential operators. It is natural to interpret \mathbb{D} as the (derived) associative algebra of differential operators on \mathbb{P}. Finally, I speculate about the interpretation of \mathbb{D} as the universal enveloping strong homotopy algebra of \mathbb{X}.
