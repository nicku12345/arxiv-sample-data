We give an equivalent definition of the stable Calabi--Yau dimension in terms of bimodule syzygies and so-called stably inner automorphisms. Using it, we complete the computation of the stable Calabi--Yau dimensions of the self-injective algebras of finite representation type which was started by K. Erdmann, A. Skowro\'nski, J. Bia\lkowski and A. Dugas.
