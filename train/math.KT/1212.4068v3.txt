To develop a constructive description of \mathrm{Ext} in categories of coherent sheaves over certain schemes, we establish a binatural isomorphism between the \mathrm{Ext}-groups in Serre quotient categories \mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C} and a direct limit of \mathrm{Ext}-groups in the ambient Abelian category \mathcal{A}. For \mathrm{Ext}^1 the isomorphism follows if the thick subcategory \mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{A} is localizing. For the higher extension groups we need further assumptions on \mathcal{C}. With these categories in mind we cannot assume \mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C} to have enough projectives or injectives and therefore use Yoneda's description of \mathrm{Ext}.
