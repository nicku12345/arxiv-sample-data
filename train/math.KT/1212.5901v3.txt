We associate an algebra \Gami(\fA) to each bornological algebra \fA. The algebra \Gami(\fA) contains a two-sided ideal I_{S(\fA)} for each symmetric ideal S\triqui\elli of bounded sequences of complex numbers. In the case of \Gami=\Gami(\C), these are all the two-sided ideals, and I_S\mapsto J_S=\cB I_S\cB gives a bijection between the two-sided ideals of \Gami and those of \cB=\cB(\ell^2). We prove that Weibel's K-theory groups KH_*(I_{S(\fA)}) are homotopy invariant for certain ideals S including c_0 and \ell^p. Moreover, if either S=c_0 and \fA is a local C^*-algebra or S=\ell^p,\ell^{p\pm} and \fA is a local Banach algebra, then KH_*(I_{S(\fA)}) contains K_*^{\top}(\fA) as a direct summand. Furthermore, we prove that for S\in\{c_0,\ell^p,\ell^{p\pm}\} the map K_*(\Gamma^\infty(\fA):I_{S(\fA)})\to KH_*(I_{S(\fA)}) fits into a long exact sequence with the relative cyclic homology groups HC_*(\Gamma^\infty(\fA):I_{S(\fA)}). Thus the latter groups measure the failure of the former map to be an isomorphism.
