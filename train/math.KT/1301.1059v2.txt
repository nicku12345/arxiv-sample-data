We compute the equivariant K-homology of the groups PSL_2 of imaginary quadratic integers with trivial and non-trivial class-group. This was done before only for cases of trivial class number. We rely on reduction theory in the form of the \Gamma-CW-complex defined by Fl\"oge. We show that the difficulty arising from the non-proper action of \Gamma on this complex can be overcome by considering a natural short exact sequence of C^\ast-algebras associated to the universal cover of the Borel-Serre compactification of the locally symmetric space associated to \Gamma. We use rather elementary C^\ast-algebraic techniques including a slightly modified Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence as well as several 6-term sequences. This computes the K-theory of the reduced and full group C^\ast-algebras of the Bianchi groups.
