Making use of the recent theory of noncommutative motives, we prove that every additive invariant satisfies Galois descent. Examples include mixed complexes, Hochschild homology, cyclic homology, periodic cyclic homology, negative cyclic homology, connective algebraic K-theory, mod-l algebraic K-theory, nonconnective algebraic K-theory, homotopy K-theory, topological Hochschild homology, and topological cyclic homology.
