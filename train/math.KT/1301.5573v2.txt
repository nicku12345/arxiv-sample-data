A left R-module M is called two-degree Ding projective if there exists an exact sequence ...\longrightarrow D_{1}\longrightarrow D_{0}\longrightarrow D_{-1}\longrightarrow D_{-2}\longrightarrow... of Ding projective left R-modules such that M\cong\ker (D_{0}\longrightarrow D_{-1}) and \Hom_{R} (-, F) leaves the sequence exact for any flat (or Gorenstein flat) left R-module F. In this paper, we show that the two-degree Ding projective modules are nothing more than the Ding projective modules.
