In this paper, we formulate axioms of certain graded cohomology theory for which Chern class maps from higher K-theory are defined, following the method of Gillet [Gi1]. We will not include homotopy invariance nor purity in our axioms. It will turn out that the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem and the Riemann-Roch theorem without denominators hold for our higher Chern classes. We will also give two applications of our Riemann-Roch results.
