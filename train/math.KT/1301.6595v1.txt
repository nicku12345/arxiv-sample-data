The notion of an \mathcal{L} complex (for a given class of R-modules \mathcal{L}) was introduced by Gillespie: a complex C is called \mathcal{L} complex if C is exact and \Z_{i}(C) is in \mathcal{L} for all i\in \mathbb{Z}. Let \widetilde{\mathcal{L}} stand for the class of all \mathcal{L} complexes. In this paper, we give sufficient condition on a class of R-modules such that every complex has a special \widetilde{\mathcal{L}}-precover (resp., \widetilde{\mathcal{L}}-preenvelope). As applications, we obtain that every complex has a special projective precover and a special injective preenvelope, over a coherent ring every complex has a special FP-injective preenvelope, and over a noetherian ring every complex has a special \widetilde{\mathcal{GI}}-preenvelope, where \mathcal{GI} denotes the class of Gorenstein injective modules.
