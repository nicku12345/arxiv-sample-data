We give a sufficient and necessary condition of the fundamental group homomorphism of a map between manifolds to induce homology equivalences. Moreover, a classification of one-sided h-cobordism of manifolds up to diffeomorphisms is obtained, based on Quillen's plus construction with Whitehead torsions.
