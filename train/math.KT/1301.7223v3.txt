We show that filtered K-theory is equivalent to a substantially smaller invariant for all real-rank-zero C*-algebras with certain primitive ideal spaces -- including the infinitely many so-called accordion spaces for which filtered K-theory is known to be a complete invariant. As a consequence, we give a characterization of purely infinite Cuntz-Krieger algebras whose primitive ideal space is an accordion space.
