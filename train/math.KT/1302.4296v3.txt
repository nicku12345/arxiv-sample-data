Index maps taking values in the K-theory of a mapping cone are defined and discussed. The resulting index theorem can be viewed in analogy with the Freed-Melrose index theorem. The framework of geometric K-homology is used in a fundamental way. In particular, an explicit isomorphism from a geometric model for K-homology with coefficients in a mapping cone, C_{\phi}, to KK(C(X),C_{\phi}) is constructed.
