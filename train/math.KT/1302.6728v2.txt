A Lie algebra L of dimension n \ge1  may be classified, looking for restrictions of the size on its second integral homology Lie algebra H_2(L,\mathbb{Z}), denoted by M(L) and often called Schur multiplier of L. In case L is nilpotent, we proved that \mathrm{dim} \ M(L) \leq \frac{1}{2}(n+m-2)(n-m-1)+1, where \mathrm{dim} \ L^2=m \ge 1, and worked on this bound under various perspectives. In the present paper, we estimate the previous bound for \mathrm{dim} \ M(L)  with respect to other inequalities of the same nature. Finally, we provide new upper bounds for the Schur multipliers of pairs and triples of nilpotent Lie algebras, by means of certain exact sequences due to Ganea and Stallings in their original form.
