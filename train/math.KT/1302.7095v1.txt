It is shown that Hattori-Stallings trace induces a homomorphism of abelian groups, called Hattori-Stallings character, from the K_1-group of endomorphisms of the perfect derived category of an algebra to its zero-th Hochschild homology, which provides a new proof of Igusa-Liu-Paquette Theorem, i.e., the strong no loop conjecture for finite-dimensional elementary algebras, on the level of complexes. Moreover, the Hattori-Stallings traces of projective bimodules and one-sided projective bimodules are studied, which provides another proof of Igusa-Liu-Paquette Theorem on the level of modules.
