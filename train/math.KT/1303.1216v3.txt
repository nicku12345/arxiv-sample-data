We introduce a notion of ellipticity of complexes of linear pseudodifferential operators acting on sections of A-Hilbert bundles over smooth manifolds, A being a Banach C^*-algebra. We prove that the cohomology groups of an A-elliptic pseudodifferential complex in finitely generated projective A-Hilbert bundles over a compact manifold are norm complete finitely generated A-modules if the images of the associated Laplacians are closed. This establishes a Hodge theory for these structures.
