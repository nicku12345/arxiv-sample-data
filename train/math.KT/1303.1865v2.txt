We construct a corona of a relatively hyperbolic group by blowing-up all parabolic points of its Bowditch boundary. We relate the K-homology of the corona with the K-theory of the Roe algebra, via the coarse assembly map. We also establish a dual theory, that is, we relate the K-theory of the corona with the K-theory of the reduced stable Higson corona via the coarse co-assembly map. For that purpose, we formulate generalized coarse cohomology theories. As an application, we give an explicit computation of the K-theory of the Roe-algebra and that of the reduced stable Higson corona of the fundamental groups of closed 3-dimensional manifolds and of pinched negatively curved complete Riemannian manifolds with finite volume.
