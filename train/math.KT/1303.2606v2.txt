Let X and Y be Banach spaces such that the ideal of operators which factor through Y has codimension one in the Banach algebra \mathscr{B}(X) of all bounded operators on X, and suppose that Y contains a complemented subspace which is isomorphic to Y\oplus Y and that X is isomorphic to X\oplus Z for every complemented subspace Z of Y. Then the K_0-group of \mathscr{B}(X) is isomorphic to the additive group \mathbb{Z} of integers.   A number of Banach spaces which satisfy the above conditions are identified. Notably, it follows that K_0(\mathscr{B}(C([0,\omega_1])))\cong\mathbb{Z}, where C([0,\omega_1]) denotes the Banach space of scalar-valued, continuous functions defined on the compact Hausdorff space of ordinals not exceeding the first uncountable ordinal \omega_1, endowed with the order topology.
