The main objective of this paper is to propose a definition of non-connective K-theory for a wide class of relative exact categories which, in general, do not satisfy the factorization axiom and confirm that it agrees with the non-connective K-theory for exact categories and complicial exact categories with weak equivalences. The main application is to study the topological filtrations of non-connective K-theory of a noetherian commutative ring with unit in terms of Koszul cubes.
