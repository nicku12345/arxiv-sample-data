We compute the trace of an endomorphism in equivariant bivariant K-theory for a compact group G in several ways: geometrically using geometric correspondences, algebraically using localisation, and as a Hattori-Stallings trace. This results in an equivariant version of the classical Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, which applies to arbitrary equivariant correspondences, not just maps.
