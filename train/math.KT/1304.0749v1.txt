Twisted Calabi-Yau algebras are a generalisation of Ginzburg's notion of Calabi-Yau algebras. Such algebras A come equipped with a modular automorphism \sigma \in Aut(A), the case \sigma = id being precisely the original class of Calabi-Yau algebras. Here we prove that every twisted Calabi-Yau algebra may be extended to a Calabi-Yau algebra. More precisely, we show that if A is a twisted Calabi-Yau algebra with modular automorphism \sigma, then the smash product algebras A \rtimes_\sigma N and A \rtimes_\sigma Z are Calabi-Yau.
