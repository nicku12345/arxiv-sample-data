Replaces Previous version. Includes comments on poincare duality for twisted equivariant in the context of proper and discrete actions and the Baum-Connes Conjecture. We use a spectral sequence proposed by C. Dwyer and previous work by Sanchez-Garcia and Soule to compute Twisted Equivariant K-theory groups of the classifying space for proper actions of Sl3(Z). After proving a Universal coefficient theorem in Bredon Cohomology with specific coefficients, we compute the twisted equivariant K-homology and state a relation to the Baum-Connes Conjecture with coefficients.
