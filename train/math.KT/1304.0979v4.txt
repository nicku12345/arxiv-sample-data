We prove that a right R-module M is \Sigma-pure injective if and only if \mathrm{Add}(M)\subseteq \mathrm{Prod}(M). Consequently, if R is a unital ring, the homotopy category \mathbf{K}({\mathrm{Mod}\text{-} R}) satisfies the Brown Representability Theorem if and only if the dual category has the same property. We also apply the main result to provide new characterizations for right pure-semisimple rings or to give a partial positive answer to a question of G. Bergman.
