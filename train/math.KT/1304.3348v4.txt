The connection between the coarse geometry of metric spaces and analytic properties of topological groupoids is well known. One of the main results of Skandalis, Tu and Yu is that a space admits a coarse embedding into Hilbert space if and only if a certain associated topological groupoid is a-T-menable. This groupoid characterisation then reduces the proof that the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for a coarsely embeddable space to known results for a-T-menable groupoids. The property of admitting a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space was introduced by Chen, Wang and Yu to provide a property that is sufficient for the maximal analogue to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture and in this paper we connect this property to the traditional coarse Baum-Connes conjecture using a restriction of the coarse groupoid and homological algebra. Additionally we use this results to give a characterisation of the a-T-menability for residually finite discrete groups.
