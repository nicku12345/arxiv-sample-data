It is proved that the assembly map in algebraic K- and L-theory with respect to the family of finite subgroups is injective for groups \Gamma with finite quotient finite decomposition complexity (a strengthening of finite decomposition complexity introduced by Guentner, Tesser and Yu) that admit a finite dimensional model for \underbar E\Gamma and have an upper bound on the order of their finite subgroups. In particular this applies to finitely generated linear groups over fields with characteristic zero with a finite dimensional model for \underbar E\Gamma.
