In an earlier paper, the authors introduced partial translation algebras as a generalisation of group C*-algebras. Here we establish an extension of partial translation algebras, which may be viewed as an excision theorem in this context. We apply this general framework to compute the K-theory of partial translation algebras and group C*-algebras in the context of almost invariant subspaces of discrete groups. This generalises the work of Cuntz, Lance, Pimsner and Voiculescu. In particular we provide a new perspective on Pimsner's calculation of the K-theory for a graph product of groups.
