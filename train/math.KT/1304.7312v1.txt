Consider the wrapped Fukaya category W of a collection of exact Lagrangians in a Liouville manifold. Under a non-degeneracy condition implying the existence of enough Lagrangians, we show that natural geometric maps from the Hochschild homology of W to symplectic cohomology and from symplectic cohomology to the Hochschild cohomology of W are isomorphisms, in a manner compatible with ring and module structures. This is a consequence of a more general duality for the wrapped Fukaya category, which should be thought of as a non-compact version of a Calabi-Yau structure. The new ingredients are: (1) Fourier-Mukai theory for W via a wrapped version of holomorphic quilts, (2) new geometric operations, coming from discs with two negative punctures and arbitrary many positive punctures, (3) a generalization of the Cardy condition, and (4) the use of homotopy units and A-infinity shuffle products to relate non-degeneracy to a resolution of the diagonal.
