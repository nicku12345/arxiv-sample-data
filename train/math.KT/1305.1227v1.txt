For groups with a uniform bound on the length of chains of finite subgroups, we study the relationship between the Bredon cohomological dimension for proper actions and the notions of cohomological dimension one obtains by restricting the coefficients of Bredon cohomology to (cohomological) Mackey functors or fixed point functors. We also investigate the closure properties of the class of groups with finite Bredon cohomological dimension for Mackey functors.
