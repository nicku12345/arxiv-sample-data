Given an exact sequence of restricted Lie algebras using Duskin's torsors theory, we establish an eight term exact sequence for Quillen-Barr-Beck cohomology of restricted Lie algebras. As an application we obtain for any extension of algebraic groups over an algebraic closed field of prime characteristic an eight term exact sequence for the corresponding restricted Lie algebras extension.
