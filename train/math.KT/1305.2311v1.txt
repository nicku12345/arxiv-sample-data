We study Artin algebras A and commutative Noetherian complete local rings R in connection with the following decomposition property of Gorenstein-projective modules: (*) any Gorenstein-projective module is a direct sum of finitely generated modules. We show that this direct decomposition property is related to the property of the algebra A, or the ring R, being (virtually) Gorenstein of finite Cohen-Macaquly type. Along the way we generalize classical results of Auslander and Ringel-Tachikawa from the early seventies, and results of Chen and Yoshino on the structure of Gorenstein-projective modules. Finally we study homological properties of (stable) relative Auslander algebras of virtually Gorenstein algebras of finite Cohen-Macaulay type and, under the presence of a cluster-tilting object, we give descriptions of the stable category of Gorenstein-projective modules in terms of suitable cluster categories.
