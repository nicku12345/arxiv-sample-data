We develop equivariant KK-theory for locally compact groupoid actions by Morita equivalences on real and complex graded C*-algebras. Functoriality with respect to generalised morphisms and Bott periodicity are discussed. We introduce Stiefel-Whitney classes for real or complex equivariant vector bundles over locally compact groupoids to establish the Thom isomorphism theorem in twisted groupoid K-theory.
