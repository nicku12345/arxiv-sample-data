In this article, we extend our preceding studies on higher algebraic structures of (co)homology theories defined by a left bialgebroid (U,A). For a braided commutative Yetter-Drinfel'd algebra N, explicit expressions for the canonical Gerstenhaber algebra structure on Ext_U(A,N) are given. Similarly, if (U,A) is a left Hopf algebroid where A is an anti Yetter-Drinfel'd module over U, it is shown that the cochain complex computing Cotor_U(A,N) defines a cyclic operad with multiplication and hence the groups Cotor_U(A,N) form a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra. In the second part of this article, Poisson structures and the Poisson bicomplex for bialgebroids are introduced, which simultaneously generalise, for example, classical Poisson as well as cyclic homology. In case the bialgebroid U is commutative, a Poisson structure on U leads to a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structure on Tor_U(A,A). As an illustration, we show how this generalises the classical Koszul bracket on differential forms, and conclude by indicating how classical Lie-Rinehart bialgebras (or, geometrically, Lie bialgebroids) arise from left bialgebroids.
