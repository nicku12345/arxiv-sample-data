A DG algebras A over a field k with H(A) connected and H_{<0}(A)=0 has a unique up to isomorphism DG module K with H(K)\cong k. It is proved that if H(A) is degreewise finite, then RHom_A(?,K): D^{df}_{+}(A)^{op} \equiv D_{df}^{+}}(RHom_A(K,K)) is an exact equivalence of derived categories of DG modules with degreewise finite-dimensional homology. It induces an equivalences of D^{df}_{b}(A)^{op} and the category of perfect DG RHom_A(K,K)-modules, and vice-versa. Corresponding statements are proved also when H(A) is simply connected and H^{<0}(A)=0.
