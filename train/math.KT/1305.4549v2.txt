A minifold is a smooth projective n-dimensional variety such that its bounded derived category of coherent sheaves \D^b(X) admits a semi-orthogonal decomposition into an exceptional collection of n+1 exceptional objects. In this paper we classify minifolds of dimension n \leq 4. We conjecture that the derived category of fake projective spaces have a similar semi-orthogonal decomposition into a collection of n+1 exceptional objects and a category with vanishing Hochschild homology. We prove this for fake projective planes with non-abelian automorphism group. We construct new examples of phantom categories with both Hochschild homology and Grothendieck group vanishing.
