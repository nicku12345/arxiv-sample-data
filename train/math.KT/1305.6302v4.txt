We prove a 'Darboux theorem' for derived schemes with symplectic forms of degree k<0, in the sense of Pantev, Toen, Vaquie and Vezzosi arXiv:1111.3209. More precisely, we show that a derived scheme X with symplectic form \omega of degree k is locally equivalent to (Spec A,\omega') for Spec A an affine derived scheme whose cdga A has Darboux-like coordinates in which the symplectic form \omega' is standard, and the differential in A is given by Poisson bracket with a Hamiltonian function H in A of degree k+1.   When k=-1, this implies that a -1-shifted symplectic derived scheme (X,\omega) is Zariski locally equivalent to the derived critical locus Crit(H) of a regular function H:U\to{\mathbb A}^1 on a smooth scheme U. We use this to show that the underlying classical scheme of X has the structure of an 'algebraic d-critical locus', in the sense of Joyce arXiv:1304.4508.   In the sequels arXiv:1211.3259, arXiv:1305.6428, arXiv:1312.0090, arXiv:1504.00690, 1506.04024 we will discuss applications of these results to categorified and motivic Donaldson-Thomas theory of Calabi-Yau 3-folds, and to defining new Donaldson-Thomas type invariants of Calabi-Yau 4-folds, and to defining 'Fukaya categories' of Lagrangians in algebraic symplectic manifolds using perverse sheaves, and we will extend the results of this paper and arXiv:1211.3259, arXiv:1305.6428 from (derived) schemes to (derived) Artin stacks, and to give local descriptions of Lagrangians in k-shifted symplectic derived schemes.   Bouaziz and Grojnowski arXiv:1309.2197 independently prove a similar 'Darboux Theorem'.
