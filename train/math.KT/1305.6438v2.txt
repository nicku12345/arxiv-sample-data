We use the methods of topological Hochschild homology to shed new light on the groups satisfying the Bass trace conjecture. We show that the factorization of the Hattori-Stallings rank map through the Bokstedt-Hsiang-Madsen cyclotomic trace map leads to Linnell's restriction on such groups. As a new consequence of this restriction, we show that the conjecture holds for any group G with the property that every subgroup that is isomorphic to the additive group of rational numbers has nontrivial and central image in some quotient of G.
