A categorical approach to linear control systems is introduced. Feedback actions on linear systems arises as a symmetric monoidal category. Stable feedback isomorphisms generalize enlargement of pairs of matrices. Subcategory of locally Brunovsky linear systems is studied and the stable feedback isomorphisms of locally Brunovsky linear systems are characterized by the K_0 group of the (monoidal) category. Hence a link from linear dynamical systems to algebraic K-theory is stablished.
