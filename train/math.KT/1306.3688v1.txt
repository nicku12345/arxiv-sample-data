Let X be an n-dimensional variety over a field k of characteristic zero, regular in codimension 1 with singular locus Z. In this paper we study the negative K-theory of X, showing that when Z is sufficiently nice, K_{1-n}(X) is an extension of KH_{1-n}(X) by a finite dimensional vector space, which we compute explicitly. We also show that KH_{1-n}(X) almost has a geometric structure. Specifically, we give an explicit 1-motive [L \rightarrow G] and a map G(k) \rightarrow KH_{1-n}(X) whose kernel and cokernel are finitely generated abelian groups.
