We continue the work initiated in arXiv:1206.3645, where we introduced a new stable symmetric monoidal (\infty,1)-category SH_{nc} encoding a motivic stable homotopy theory for the noncommutative spaces of Kontsevich and obtained a canonical monoidal colimit-preserving functor SH\to SH_{nc} relating this new theory to the (\infty,1)-category encoding the stable motivic \mathbb{A}^1 theory of Morel-Voevodsky. For a scheme X this map recovers the dg-derived category of perfect complexes L_{pe}(X).   In this sequel we address the study of the different flavours of algebraic K-theory of dg-categories. As in the commutative case, these can be understood as spectral valued \infty-presheaves over the category of noncommutative smooth spaces and therefore provide objects in SH_{nc} once properly localized. Our first main result is the description of non-connective K-theory of dg-categories introduced by Schlichting as the noncommutative Nisnevich sheafification of connective K-theory. In particular it follows that its further \mathbb{A}^1-localization is an object in SH_{nc}. As a corollary of the recent result in A. Blanc Phd thesis, we prove that this object is a unit for the monoidal structure.   Using this, we obtain a precise proof for a conjecture of Kontsevich claiming that K-theory gives the correct mapping spaces in noncommutative motives. As a second corollary we obtain a factorization of our comparison map SH\to SH_{nc} through Mod_{KH}(SH) - the (\infty,1)-category of modules over the commutative algebra object KH representing homotopy invariant algebraic K-theory of schemes in SH. If k is a field admitting resolutions of singularities, this factorization is fully faithful, so that, at the motivic level, no information (below K-theory) is lost by passing to the noncommutative world.
