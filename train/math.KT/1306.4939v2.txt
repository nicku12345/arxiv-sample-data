Those elements of the second de Rham cohomology group of a connected, oriented Riemannian manifold which map its second homotopy group to zero or to a discrete subgroup of the reals induce deformations of the path algebra of the manifold. If the image is not identically zero then the induced deformations are quantized. We examine the simplest examples, namely, the torus and the 2-sphere, and consider possible physical interpretations of the deformations of their path algebras.
