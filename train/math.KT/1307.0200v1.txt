For a cellular variety X over a field k of characteristic 0 and an algebraic oriented cohomology theory \hh of Levine-Morel we construct a filtration on the cohomology ring \hh(X) such that the associated graded ring is isomorphic to the Chow ring of X. Taking X to be the variety of Borel subgroups of a split semisimple linear algebraic group G over k we apply this filtration to relate the oriented cohomology of G to its Chow ring. As an immediate application we compute the algebraic cobordism ring of a group of type G_2, of groups SO_n and Spin_m for n=3,4 and m=3,4,5,6 and PGL_k for k\geqslant 2.   Using this filtration we also establish the following comparison result between Chow motives and \hh-motives of generically cellular varieties: any irreducible Chow-motivic decomposition of a generically split variety Y gives rise to a \hh-motivic decomposition of Y with the same generating function. Moreover, under some conditions on the coefficient ring of \hh the obtained \hh-motivic decomposition will be irreducible. We also prove that if Chow motives of two twisted forms of Y coincide, then their \hh-motives coincide as well.
