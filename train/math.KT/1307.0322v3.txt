Using factorization homology techniques, we give a simple proof of the action of Kontsevich and Soibelman operad on the pair consisting of Hochschild cohomology and Hochschild homology. The proof obviously extends to higher Hochschild cohomology and factorization (also called chiral) homology. Note that our result works in categories of chain complexes but also in categories of modules over a commutative ring spectrum.
