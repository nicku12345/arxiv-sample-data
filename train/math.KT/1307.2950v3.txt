The classifying space BG of a topological group G can be filtered by a sequence of subspaces B(q,G), using the descending central series of free groups. If G is finite, describing them as homotopy colimits is convenient when applying homotopy theoretic methods. In this paper we introduce natural subspaces B(q,G)_p of B(q,G) defined for a fixed prime p. We show that B(q,G) is stably homotopy equivalent to a wedge of B(q,G)_p as p runs over the primes dividing the order of G. Colimits of abelian groups play an important role in understanding the homotopy type of these spaces. Extraspecial 2-groups are key examples, for which these colimits turn out to be finite. We prove that for extraspecial 2-groups, B(2,G) does not have the homotopy type of a K(\pi,1) space. For a finite group G, we compute the complex K-theory of B(2,G) modulo torsion.
