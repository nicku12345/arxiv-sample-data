Building on a construction of J-P. Serre, we associate to any graph of C*-algebras a maximal and a reduced fundamental C*-algebra and use this theory to construct the fundamental quantum group of a graph of discrete quantum groups. This construction naturally gives rise to a quantum Bass-Serre tree which can be used to study the K-theory of the fundamental quantum group. To illustrate the properties of this construction, we prove that if all the vertex qantum groups are amenable, then the fundamental quantum group is K-amenable. This generalizes previous results of P. Julg, A. Valette, R. Vergnioux and the first author.
