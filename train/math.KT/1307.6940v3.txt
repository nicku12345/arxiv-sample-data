The current paper is dedicated to the study of the classical K_1 groups of graded rings. Let A be a \Gamma graded ring with identity 1, where the grading \Gamma is an abelian group. We associate a category with suspension to the \Gamma graded ring A. This allows us to construct the group valued functor K_1 of graded rings. It will be denoted by K_1^{gr}. It is not only an abelian group but also a \mathbb Z[\Gamma]-module. From the construction, it follows that there exists "locally" a matrix description of K_1^{gr} of graded rings. The matrix description makes it possible to compute K_1^{gr} of various types of graded rings. The K_1^{gr} satisfies the well known K-theory exact sequence  K_{1}^{gr}(A,I)\to K_1^{gr}(A)\to K_1^{gr}(A/I)  for any graded ideal I of A. The above is used to compute K^{gr}_1 of cross products.
