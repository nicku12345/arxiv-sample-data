In this paper, we establish an infinitesimal equivariant index formula in the noncommutative geometry framework using Greiner's approach to heat kernel asymptotics. An infinitesimal equivariant index formula for odd dimensional manifolds is also given. We define infinitesimal equivariant eta cochains, prove their regularity and give an explicit formula for them. We also establish an infinitesimal equivariant family index formula and introduce the infinitesimal equivariant eta forms as well as compare them with the equivariant eta forms.
