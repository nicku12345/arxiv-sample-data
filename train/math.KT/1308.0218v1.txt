Let M be a closed manifold and \alpha : \pi_1(M)\to U_n a representation. We give a purely K-theoretic description of the associated element [\alpha] in the K-theory of M with \R/\Z-coefficients. To that end, it is convenient to describe the \R/\Z-K-theory as a relative K-theory with respect to the inclusion of \C in a finite von Neumann algebra B. We use the following fact: there is, associated with \alpha, a finite von Neumann algebra B together with a flat bundle \cE\to M with fibers B, such that E_\a\otimes \cE is canonically isomorphic with \C^n\otimes \cE, where E_\alpha denotes the flat bundle with fiber \C^n associated with \alpha. We also discuss the spectral flow and rho type description of the pairing of the class [\alpha] with the K-homology class of an elliptic selfadjoint (pseudo)-differential operator D of order 1.
