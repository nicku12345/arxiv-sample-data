Let \Delta be a building of type \widetilde A_2 and order q, with maximal boundary \Omega. Let \Gamma be a group of type preserving automorphisms of \Delta which acts regularly on the chambers of \Delta. Then the crossed product C^*-algebra C(\Omega) \rtimes \Gamma is isomorphic to M_{3(q+1)} \otimes\cl O_{q^2}\otimes\cl O_{q^2}, where \cl O_n denotes the Cuntz algebra generated by n isometries whose range projections sum to the identity operator.
