Twisted supercharge families on product manifolds \mathbb{T} \times M have been applied in the analysis of the odd twisted K-theory. We shall suspend these families to the even twisted K-theory and solve their twisted families index problem. This is applied to give analytic representatives of the twisted K-theory classes on tori - including all the torsion classes.
