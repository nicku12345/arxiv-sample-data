Extension conjecture states that if a simple module over an artin algebra has nonzero first self-extension group then it has nonzero i-th self-extension group for infinitely many positive integers i. It is shown by recollement of triangulated categories and differential graded homological algebra approach that extension conjecture is true for finite-dimensional elementary algebras over a field, particularly, for finite-dimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field. Moreover, bimodule approach is introduced to strong no loop conjecture, which provides two new proofs of Igusa-Liu-Paquette theorem.
