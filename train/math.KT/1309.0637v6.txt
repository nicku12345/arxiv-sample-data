We consider the effect of t-structures on the Tannaka duality theory for dg categories developed in our previous paper. We associate non-negative dg coalgebras C to dg functors on the hearts of t-structures, and relate dg C-comodules to the original dg category. We give several applications for pro-algebraic homotopy types associated to various cohomology theories, and for motivic Galois groups.
