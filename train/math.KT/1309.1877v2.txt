We study the asymptotic growth of homology groups and the cellular volume of classifying spaces as one passes to normal subgroups G_n<G of increasing finite index in a fixed finitely generated group G, assuming \bigcap_n G_n =1. We focus in particular on finitely presented residually free groups, calculating their \ell_2 betti numbers, rank gradient and asymptotic deficiency.   If G is a limit group and K is any field, then for all j\ge 1 the limit of \dim H_j(G_n,K)/[G,G_n] as n\to\infty exists and is zero except for j=1, where it equals -\chi(G). We prove a homotopical version of this theorem in which the dimension of \dim H_j(G_n,K) is replaced by the minimal number of j-cells in a K(G_n,1); this includes a calculation of the rank gradient and the asymptotic deficiency of G. Both the homological and homotopical versions are special cases of general results about the fundamental groups of graphs of {\em{slow}} groups.   We prove that if a residually free group G is of type \rm{FP}_m but not of type \rm{FP}_{\infty}, then there exists an exhausting filtration by normal subgroups of finite index G_n so that \lim_n \dim H_j (G_n, K) / [G : G_n] = 0 \hbox{for} j \leq m. If G is of type \rm{FP}_{\infty}, then the limit exists in all dimensions and we calculate it.
