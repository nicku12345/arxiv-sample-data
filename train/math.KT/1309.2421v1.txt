In this article we compute the {\em local algebraic K-theory},  i = 0, 1, of the algebra of complex numbers \mathbb{C} endowed with the trivial filtration, i.e. \mathbb{C}_{\mu}= \mathbb{C}, for any \mu \in \mathbb{N}; {\em local algebras} and {\em local} algebraic K^{loc}_{i}-theory were introduced in \cite{Teleman_arXiv_IV}. \par Theorem 3 states the result. \par This case corresponds in the simplest case to the Alexander-Spanier {\em local K-theory} over the point. \par This article is part of a comprehensive program aimed at re-stating the index theorem, see \cite{Teleman_arXiv_III}.
