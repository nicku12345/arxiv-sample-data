We prove that the shifted Hochschild chain complex C\_*(A,A)[m] of a symmetric open Frobenius algebra A of degree m has a natural homotopy coBV-algebra structure. As a consequence HH\_*(A,A)[m] and HH^*(A,A^\vee)[-m] are respectively coBV and BV algebras. The underlying coalgebra and algebra structure may not be resp. counital and unital. We also introduce a natural homotopy BV-algebra structure on C\_*(A,A)[m] hence a BV-structure on HH\_*(A,A)[m]. Moreover we prove that the product and coproduct on HH\_*(A,A)[m] satisfy the Frobenius compatibility condition i.e. HH\_*(A,A)[m] is an open Frobenius algebras. If A is commutative, we also introduce a natural BV structure on the shifted relative Hochschild homology \widetilde{HH}\_*(A)[m-1]. We conjecture that the product of this BV structure is identical to the Goresky-Hingston\cite{GH} product on the cohomology of free loop spaces when A is a commutative cochain algebra model for M.
