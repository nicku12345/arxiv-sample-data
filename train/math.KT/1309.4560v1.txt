For a certain class of complexes of pre-Hilbert A-modules, we prove that their cohomology groups equipped with a canonical quotient structure are again pre-Hilbert A-modules and derive the Hodge decomposition for them. We call these complexes self-adjoint parametrix possessing. We show that A-elliptic complexes of differential operator acting on sections of finitely generated projective A-Hilbert bundles over compact manifolds have this property if the images of certain extensions of their Laplacians are closed.
