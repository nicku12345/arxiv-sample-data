We had previously defined the rho invariant \rho_{spin}(Y,E,H, g) for the twisted Dirac operator \not\partial^E_H on a closed odd dimensional Riemannian spin manifold (Y, g), acting on sections of a flat hermitian vector bundle E over Y, where H = \sum i^{j+1} H_{2j+1}  is an odd-degree differential form on Y and H_{2j+1} is a real-valued differential form of degree {2j+1}. Here we show that it is a conformal invariant of the pair (H, g). In this paper we express the defect integer \rho_{spin}(Y,E,H, g) - \rho_{spin}(Y,E, g) in terms of spectral flows and prove that \rho_{spin}(Y,E,H, g)\in \mathbb Q, whenever g is a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature. In addition, if the maximal Baum-Connes conjecture holds for \pi_1(Y) (which is assumed to be torsion-free), then we show that \rho_{spin}(Y,E,H, rg) =0 for all r\gg 0, significantly generalizing our earlier results. These results are proved using the Bismut-Weitzenb\"ock formula, a scaling trick, the technique of noncommutative spectral sections, and the Higson-Roe approach.
