We show that the higher Grothendieck-Witt groups, a.k.a. algebraic hermitian K-groups, are represented by an infinite orthogonal Grassmannian in the A1-homotopy category of smooth schemes over a regular base for which 2 is a unit in the ring of regular functions. We also give geometric models for various P1- and S1-loop spaces of hermitian K-theory.
