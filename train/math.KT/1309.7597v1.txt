This thesis establishes the equivalence of Grayson and Friedlander-Suslin spectral sequences, that was previously only known for the respective E_2-terms. We develop the necessary techniques regarding K_0-presheaves of spectra, building on the work of M. Walker and construct certain filtrations on the K-theory presheaf of spectra that we use as intermediate steps in obtaining the equivalence of the filtrations.
