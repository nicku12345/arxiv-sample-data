In our previous paper (arXiv:1306.5449) we have given a sufficient and necessary condition when the coupling between Lie algebra bundle (LAB) and the tangent bundle exists in the sense of Mackenzie (\cite{Mck-2005}, Definition 7.2.2) for the theory of transitive Lie algebroids. Namely we have defined a new topology on the group \Aut(\rg) of all automorphisms of the Lie algebra \rg, say \Aut(\rg)^{\delta}, and show that tangent bundle TM can be coupled with the Lie algebra bundle L if and only if the Lie algebra bundle L admits a local trivial structure with structural group endowed with such new topology.   But the question how many couplings exist under these conditions still remains open. Here we make the result more accurate and prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the family Coup(L) of all coupling of the Lie algebra bundle L with fixed finite dimensional Lie algebra \rg as the fiber and the structural group \Aut(\rg) of all automorphisms of Lie algebra \rg and the tangent bundle TM and the family LAB^{\delta}(L) of equivalent classes of local trivial structures with structural group \Aut(\rg) endowed with new topology \Aut(\rg)^{\delta}.   This result gives a way for geometric construction of the classifying space for transitive Lie algebroids with fixed structural finite dimensiaonal Lie algebra \rg. Hence we can clarify a categorical description of the characteristic classes for transitive Lie algebroids and a comparison with that by J. Kubarski.
