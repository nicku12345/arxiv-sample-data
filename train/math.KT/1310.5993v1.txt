We give a construction allowing to lift spectral triples to crossed products by Hilbert bimodules. The spectral triple one obtains is a concrete unbounded representative of the Kasparov product of the spectral triple and the Pimsner-Toeplitz extension associated to the crossed product by the Hilbert bimodule. To prove that the lifted spectral triple is the above-mentioned Kasparov product, we rely on operator-*-algebras and connexions.
