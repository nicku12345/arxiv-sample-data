Let G be a compact connected Lie group with a maximal torus T. Let A, B be G-\mathrm{C}^\ast-algebras. We define certain divided difference operators on Kasparov's T-equivariant KK-group KK_T(A,B) and show that KK_G(A,B) is a direct summand of KK_T(A,B). More precisely, a T-equivariant KK-class is G-equivariant if and only if it is annihilated by an ideal of divided difference operators. This result is a generalization of work done by Atiyah, Harada, Landweber and Sjamaar.
