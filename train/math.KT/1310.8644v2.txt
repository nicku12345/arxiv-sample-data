In a previous paper I gave a presentation for the Quillen higher algebraic K-groups of an exact category in terms of "acyclic binary multicomplexes". In this paper I take that presentation as a definition of the higher K-groups, generalize it to the relative K-groups of an exact functor between exact categories, and produce the corresponding long exact sequence by elementary means, without homotopy theory.
