Based on Balmer's tensor triangular Chow group, we propose K-theoretic Chow groups of derived categories of noetherian schemes and their Milnor variants for regular schemes and their thickenings. We discuss functoriality and show that our Chow groups agree with the classical ones for regular schemes. Moreover, we also define tangent spaces to our Chow groups as usually and identify them with cohomology groups of differentials. As an application, we extend Bloch-Quillen identification and soule's variant from regular schemes to their thickenings. This gives a positive answer to a question by Green-Griffiths.
