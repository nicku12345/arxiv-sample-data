We show that the group cohomology of torsion-free virtually polycyclic groups and the continuous cohomology of simply connected solvable Lie groups can be computed by the rational cohomology of algebraic groups. Our results are generalizations of certian results on the cohomology of solvmanifolds and infra-solvmanifolds. Moreover as an application of our results, we give a simple proof of the surprising cohomology vanishing theorem given by Dekimpe-Igodt.
