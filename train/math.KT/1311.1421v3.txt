We construct a version of Beilinson's regulator as a map of sheaves of commutative ring spectra and use it to define a multiplicative variant of differential algebraic K-theory. We use this theory to give an interpretation of Bloch's construction of K_3-classes and the relation with dilogarithms. Furthermore, we provide a relation to Arakelov theory via the arithmetic degree of metrized line bundles, and we give a proof of the formality of the algebraic K-theory of number rings.
