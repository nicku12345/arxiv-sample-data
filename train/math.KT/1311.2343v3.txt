We reformulate the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients by introducing a new crossed product functor for C*-algebras. All confirming examples for the original Baum-Connes conjecture remain confirming examples for the reformulated conjecture, and at present there are no known counterexamples to the reformulated conjecture. Moreover, some of the known expander-based counterexamples to the original Baum-Connes conjecture become confirming examples for our reformulated conjecture.
