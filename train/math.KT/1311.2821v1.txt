We prove a strong classification result for a certain class of C^{*}-algebras with primitive ideal space \widetilde{\mathbb{N}}, where \widetilde{\mathbb{N}} is the one-point compactification of \mathbb{N}. This class contains the class of graph C^{*}-algebras with primitive ideal space \widetilde{\mathbb{N}}. Along the way, we prove a universal coefficient theorem with ideal-related K-theory for C^{*}-algebras over \widetilde{\mathbb{N}} whose \infty fiber has torsion-free K-theory.
