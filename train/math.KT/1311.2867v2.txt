This survey is based on lectures given by the authors during the program "Noncommutative algebraic geometry and representation theory" at the MSRI, Berkeley, in the spring of 2013. It covers the recent work of the authors on noncommutative motives and their applications, and is intended for a broad mathematical audience.
