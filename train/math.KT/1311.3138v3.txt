We develop an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence to compute Bredon cohomology of spaces with an action of a group given as a pullback. Using several other spectral sequences, and positive results on the Baum-Connes Conjecture, we are able to compute Equivariant K-theory and K-Homology of the reduced group C*-algebra of a 6-dimensional crystallographic group \Gamma introduced by Vafa and Witten. We also use positive results on the Farrell-Jones Conjecture to give a vanishing result for the negative algebraic K-theory of the integral group ring of \Gamma.
