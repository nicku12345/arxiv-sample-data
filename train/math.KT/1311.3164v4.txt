We show how a suitably twisted Spin-cobordism spectrum connects to the question of existence of metrics of positive scalar curvature on closed, smooth manifolds by building on fundamental work of Gromov, Lawson, Rosenberg, Stolz and others. We then investigate this parametrised spectrum, compute its mod~2-cohomology and generalise the Anderson-Brown-Peterson splitting of the regular Spin-cobordism spectrum to the twisted case. Along the way we also describe the mod~2-cohomology of various twisted, connective covers of real K-theory.
