Jake Goodman and Ulrich Kr\"ahmer have recently shown that a twisted Calabi-Yau algebra A with modular automorphism \sigma and dimension d can be "untwisted," in the sense that the Ore extensions A[X;\sigma] and A[X^{\pm1};\sigma] are Calabi-Yau algebras of dimension d+1. In this note we show that this in fact extends more generally to the case where we start with an algebra with van den Bergh duality.
