We develop an algebraic formalism for topological \mathbb{T}-duality. More precisely, we show that topological \mathbb{T}-duality actually induces an isomorphism between noncommutative motives that in turn implements the well-known isomorphism between twisted K-theories (up to a shift). In order to establish this result we model topological K-theory by algebraic K-theory. We also construct an E_\infty-operad starting from any strongly self-absorbing C^*-algebra \mathcal{D}. Then we show that there is a functorial topological K-theory symmetric spectrum construction {\bf K}_\Sigma^{top}(-) on the category of separable C^*-algebras, such that {\bf K}_\Sigma^{top}(\mathcal{D}) is an algebra over this operad; moreover, {\bf K}_\Sigma^{top}(A\hat{\otimes}\mathcal{D}) is a module over this algebra. Along the way we obtain a new symmetric spectra valued functorial model for the (connective) topological K-theory of C^*-algebras. We also show that \mathcal{O}_\infty-stable C^*-algebras are K-regular providing evidence for a conjecture of Rosenberg. We conclude with an explicit description of the algebraic K-theory of ax+b-semigroup C^*-algebras coming from number theory and that of \mathcal{O}_\infty-stabilized noncommutative tori.
