We compare twisted Equivariant K-theory of Sl3Z with untwisted equivariant K-Theory of its universal central extension, St3Z. Using universal coefficient theorems by the authors, the computations explained here give the domain of Baum-Connes assembly maps landing on the topological K-theory of twisted group C*-algebras related to Sl3Z, for which a version of Poincar\'e Duality studied previously by Echterhoff, Emerson and Kim is verified.
