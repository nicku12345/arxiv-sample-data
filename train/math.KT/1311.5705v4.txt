This work is NOT to be used as reference. First, because as C.F.~B\"odigheimer and M.~Korkmaz pointed to us the computation of the \mathbf{Z}_2 factor that remained undecided in M.~Korkmaz and A. Stipsicz, {\em The second homology groups of mapping class groups of orientable surfaces.} Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., was shown to exist by Skasai, see hi Theorem 4.9 and Corollary 4.10 in {\em Lagrangian mapping class groups from a group homological point of view.} Algebr. Geom. Topol. 12 (2012), no. 1, 267--291. Second, because one could obtain this result by gathering old results in the literature, first by noticing as Korkmaz kindly reminded me, that D.~Johnson, in \emph{Homeomorphisms of a surface which act trivially on homology} Porc. AMS Volume 75, Number 1, 1979. proved that the quotient of the Torelli group \mathcal{T}_g/[\mathcal{T}_g,\mathcal{M}_g] is trivial for g\geq 3, the five term exact sequence then implies that the \mathbf{Z}_2 factor in Stein's computation of H_2(Sp(6,\mathbf{Z});\mathbf{Z}) = \mathbf{Z}\oplus\mathbf{Z}_2 (see his {\em The Schur Multipliers of Sp_6(\mathbf{Z}), Spin_8(\mathbf{Z}), Spin_7(\mathbf{Z}), and F_4(\mathbf{Z}).} Math. Ann. 215 (1975), 173--193. ), detects the undecided \mathbf{Z}_2 factor in H_2(\mathbf{M}_3;\mathbf{Z}).
