We prove the K-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture for groups as in the title with coefficient rings and C^*-algebras which are stable with respect to compact operators. We use this and Higson-Kasparov's result that the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients holds for such groups, to show that if G is as in the title then the algebraic and the C^*-crossed products of G with a stable C^*-algebra have the same K-theory.
