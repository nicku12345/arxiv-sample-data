We show that the universal odd Chern form, defined on the stable unitary group U, extends to the loop group LU in a way that is closed with respect to an equivariant-type differential. This provides an odd analogue to the Bismut-Chern form. We also describe the associated transgression form, the so-called Bismut-Chern-Simons form, and explicate some properties it inherits as a differential form on the space of maps of a cylinder into the stable unitary group. As a corollary, we obtain the Chern character homomorphism from odd K-theory to the periodic cohomology of the free loop space, represented geometrically on the level of differential forms.
