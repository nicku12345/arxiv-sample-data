In 2009 Ekedahl introduced certain cohomological invariants of finite groups which are naturally related to the Noether Problem. We show that these invariants are trivial for every finite group in GL_3(k) and for the fifth discrete Heisenberg group H_5. Moreover in the case of finite linear groups with abelian projective reduction, these invariants satisfy a recurrence relation in a certain Grothendieck group for abelian groups.
