Let A be a finite dimensional algebra and D^b(A) be the bounded derived category of finitely generated left A-modules. In this paper we consider lengths of compact exceptional objects in D^b(A), proving a sufficient condition such that these lengths are bounded by the number of isomorphism classes of simple A-modules. Moreover, we show that algebras satisfying this condition is bounded derived simple.
