We show that for an associative algebra A and its ideal I such that the I-adic topology on A coincides with the p-adic topology, the relative continuous K-theory pro-spectrum "lim"K(A_i, IA_i), where A_i :=A/p^i A, is naturally isogenous to the cyclic chain pro-complex "lim"CC(A_i) (subject to minor conditions on A). This identification is a continuous version of the classical Goodwillie isomorphism. The work comes from an attempt to understand the article of Bloch, Esnault, and Kerz "p-adic deformations of algebraic cycle classes".
