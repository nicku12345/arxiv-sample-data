We consider commutative DG rings (better known as nonpositive strongly commutative associative unital DG algebras). For such a DG ring A we define the notions of perfect, tilting, dualizing, Cohen-Macaulay and rigid DG A-modules. Geometrically perfect DG modules are defined by a local condition on \operatorname{Spec} \bar{A}, where \bar{A} := \operatorname{Spec} \, \operatorname{H}^0(A). Algebraically perfect DG modules are those that can be obtained from A by finitely many shifts, direct summands and cones. Tilting DG modules are those that have inverses w.r.t. the derived tensor product; their isomorphism classes form the derived Picard group \operatorname{DPic}(A). Dualizing DG modules are a generalization of Grothendieck's original definition (and here A has to be cohomologically pseudo-noetherian). Cohen-Macaulay DG modules are the duals (w.r.t. a given dualizing DG module) of finite \bar{A}-modules. Rigid DG A-modules, relative to a commutative base ring K, are defined using the squaring operation, and this is a generalization of Van den Bergh's original definition.   The techniques we use are the standard ones of derived categories, with a few improvements. We introduce a new method for studying DG A-modules: Cech resolutions of DG A-modules corresponding to open coverings of \operatorname{Spec} \bar{A}.   Here are some of the new results obtained in this paper:... [truncated]   The functorial properties of Cohen-Macaulay DG modules that we establish here are needed for our work on rigid dualizing complexes over commutative rings, schemes and Deligne-Mumford stacks.   We pose several conjectures regarding existence and uniqueness of rigid DG modules over commutative DG rings.
