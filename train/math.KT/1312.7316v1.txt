We construct a new effective orbifold \widehat{\Y} with an S^1-gerbe c to study an S^1-gerbe \mathfrak{t} on a G-gerbe \Y over an orbifold \B. We view the former as the relative dual, relative to \B, of the latter. We show that the two pairs (\Y, \mathfrak{t}) and (\widehat{\Y}, c) have isomorphic categories of sheaves, and also the associated twisted groupoid algebras are Morita equivalent. As a corollary, the K-theory and cohomology groups of (\Y, \mathfrak{t}) and (\widehat{\Y}, c) are isomorphic.
