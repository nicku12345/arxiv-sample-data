For any cohomology theory H that can be factorized through (the Morel-Voevodsky's triangulated motivic homotopy category) SH^{S^1}(k) (or through SH(k)) we establish the SH^{S^1}(k)-functorialty (resp. SH(k)-one) of coniveau spectral sequences for H. We also prove: for any affine essentially smooth semi-local S the Cousin complex for H^*(S) splits; if H also factorizes through SH^+(k) or SH^{MGL}(k), then this is also true for any primitive S. Moreover, the cohomology of such an S is a direct summand of the cohomology of any its open dense subscheme. This is a vast generalization of the results of a previous paper. In order to prove these results we consider certain categories of motivic pro-spectra, and introduce Gersten weight structures for them. Our results rely on several interesting statements on weight structures in cocompactly cogenerated triangulated categories and on the 'SH^+(k)-acyclity' of primitive schemes. .
