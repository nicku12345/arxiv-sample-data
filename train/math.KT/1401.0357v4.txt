Using a theorem of L\"uck-Reich-Rognes-Varisco, we show that the Whitehead group of Thompson's group T is infinitely generated, even when tensored with the rationals. To this end we describe the structure of the centralizers and normalizers of the finite cyclic subgroups of T, via a direct geometric approach based on rotation numbers. This also leads to an explicit computation of the source of the Farrell-Jones assembly map for the rationalized higher algebraic K-theory of the integral group ring of T.
