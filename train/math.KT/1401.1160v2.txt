This paper provides an isomorphism K_n (\mathscr{A}) \cong K_n (\mathscr{A}_1) \times_{K_n(\mathscr{A}_0)} K_n(\mathscr{A}_2) of K-groups, i.e., an exact sequence 0 \to K_n(\mathscr{A}) \to K_n(\mathscr{A}_1)\times K_n(\mathscr{A}_2) \to K_n(\mathscr{A}_0) corresponding to a 2-fiber product of abelian categories, taken with respect to exact functors. Using recent patching results of D. Harbater, J. Hartmann and D. Krashen, given fields F_1, F_2 \leq F_0 and F= F_1 \cap F_2 which satisfy a simple matrix factorization criterion, our isomorphism relates the K-groups of the fields F and F_i (i = 0, 1, 2). In particular, we establish a local-global principle for K-theory of function fields of curves defined over a complete discretely valued field.
