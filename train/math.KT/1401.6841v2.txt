We present a geometric approach to the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients for Gromov monster groups via a theorem of Khoskham and Skandalis. Secondly, we use recent results concerning the a-T-menability at infinity of large girth expanders to exhibit a family of coefficients for a Gromov monster group for which the Baum-Connes conjecture is an isomorphism.
