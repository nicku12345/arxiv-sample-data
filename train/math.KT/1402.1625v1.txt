This article presents results being consistent with conjectures of J.-L. Loday about the existence and properties of a Leibniz homology for groups. Introducing L-sets we prove that (pointed) rack homology has properties this conjectural Leibniz homology should satisfy, namely the existence of a coZinbiel coalgebra structure on rack homology and the existence of a non trivial natural cocommutative coalgebra morphism from the rack homology of a group to its Eilenberg-MacLane homology. The end of the paper treats the particular cases of the linear group and of abelian groups. We prove the existence of a connected coZinbiel-associative bialgebra structure on their rack homology.
