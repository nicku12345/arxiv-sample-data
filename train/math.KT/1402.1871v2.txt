We define a K-theory for pointed right derivators and show that it agrees with Waldhausen K-theory in the case where the derivator arises from a good Waldhausen category. This K-theory is not invariant under general equivalences of derivators, but only under a stronger notion of equivalence that is defined by considering a simplicial enrichment of the category of derivators. We show that derivator K-theory, as originally defined, is the best approximation to Waldhausen K-theory by a functor that is invariant under equivalences of derivators.
