Goodwillie's rational isomorphism between relative algebraic K-theory and relative cyclic homology, together with the lambda decomposition of cyclic homology, illustrates the close relationships among algebraic K-theory, cyclic homology, and differential forms. In this paper, I prove a Goodwillie-type theorem for relative Milnor K-theory, working over a very general class of commutative rings, defined via the stability criterion of Van der Kallen. Early results of Van der Kallen and Bloch are special cases. The result likely generalizes in terms of de Rahm-Witt complexes, by weakening some invertibility assumptions, but the class of rings considered is already more than sufficiently general for the intended applications. The main motivation for this paper arises from applications to the infinitesimal theory of Chow groups, first pointed out by Bloch in the 1970's, and prominent in recent work of Green and Griffiths. Related results and geometric applications are discussed in the final section.
