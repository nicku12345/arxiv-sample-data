Let F/K be an abelian extension of number fields with F either CM or totally real and K totally real. If F is CM and the Brumer-Stark conjecture holds for F/K, we construct a family of G(F/K)--equivariant Hecke characters for F with infinite type equal to a special value of certain G(F/K)--equivariant L-functions. Using results of Greither-Popescu on the Brumer-Stark conjecture we construct l-adic imprimitive versions of these characters, for primes l> 2. Further, the special values of these l-adic Hecke characters are used to construct G(F/K)-equivariant Stickelberger-splitting maps in the l-primary Quillen localization sequence for F, extending the results obtained in 1990 by Banaszak for K = \Bbb Q. We also apply the Stickelberger-splitting maps to construct special elements in the l-primary piece K_{2n}(F)_l of K_{2n}(F) and analyze the Galois module structure of the group D(n)_l of divisible elements in K_{2n}(F)_l, for all n>0. If n is odd and coprime to l and F = K is a fairly general totally real number field, we study the cyclicity of D(n)_l in relation to the classical conjecture of Iwasawa on class groups of cyclotomic fields and its potential generalization to a wider class of number fields. Finally, if F is CM, special values of our l-adic Hecke characters are used to construct Euler systems in the odd K-groups with coefficients K_{2n+1}(F, \Bbb Z/l^k), for all n>0. These are vast generalizations of Kolyvagin's Euler system of Gauss sums and of the K-theoretic Euler systems constructed in Banaszak-Gajda when K = \Bbb Q.
