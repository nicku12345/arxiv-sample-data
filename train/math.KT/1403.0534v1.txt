The goal of this paper is to establish fundamental properties of the Hochschild, topological Hochschild, and topological cyclic homologies of commutative, Noetherian rings, which are assumed only to be F-finite in the majority of our results. This mild hypothesis is satisfied in all cases of interest in finite and mixed characteristic algebraic geometry. We prove firstly that the topological Hochschild homology groups, and the homotopy groups of the fixed point spectra TR^r, are finitely generated modules. We use this to establish the continuity of these homology theories for any given ideal. A consequence of such continuity results is the pro Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem for topological Hochschild and cyclic homology. Finally, we show more generally that the aforementioned finite generation and continuity properties remain true for any proper scheme over such a ring.
