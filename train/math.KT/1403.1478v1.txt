Milnor-Thurston homology theory is a construction of homology theory that is based on measures. It is known that it is equivalent to singular homology theory in case of manifolds and complexes. Its behaviour for non-tame spaces is still unknown. This paper provides results in this direction. We prove that Milnor-Thurston homology groups for the Warsaw Circle are trivial except for the zeroth homology group which is uncountable dimensional. Additionally, we prove that the zeroth homology group is non-Hausdorff for this space with respect a natural topology that was proposed by Berlanga.
