This paper continues our investigation into the question of when a homotopy \omega = \{\omega_t\}_{t \in [0,1]} of 2-cocycles on a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid \mathcal{G} gives rise to an isomorphism of the K-theory groups of the twisted groupoid C^*-algebras: K_*(C^*(\mathcal{G}, \omega_0)) \cong K_*(C^*(\mathcal{G}, \omega_1)). In particular, we build on work by Kumjian, Pask, and Sims to show that if \mathcal{G} = \mathcal{G}_\Lambda is the infinite path groupoid associated to a row-finite higher-rank graph \Lambda with no sources, and \{c_t\}_{t \in [0,1]} is a homotopy of 2-cocycles on \Lambda, then K_*(C^*(\mathcal{G}_\Lambda, \sigma_{c_0})) \cong K_*(C^*(\mathcal{G}_\Lambda, \sigma_{c_1})), where \sigma_{c_t} denotes the 2-cocycle on \mathcal{G}_\Lambda associated to the 2-cocycle c_t on \Lambda. We also prove a technical result (Theorem 3.3), namely that a homotopy of 2-cocycles on a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid \mathcal{G} gives rise to an upper semi-continuous C^*-bundle.
