Continuing our project on noncommutative (stable) homotopy we construct symmetric monoidal \infty-categorical models for separable C^*-algebras \mathtt{SC^*_\infty} and noncommutative spectra \mathtt{NSp} using the framework of Higher Algebra due to Lurie. We study smashing (co)localizations of \mathtt{SC^*_\infty} and \mathtt{NSp} with respect to strongly self-absorbing C^*-algebras. We analyse the homotopy categories of the localizations of \mathtt{SC^*_\infty} and give universal characterizations thereof. We construct a stable \infty-categorical model for bivariant connective E-theory and compute the connective E-theory groups of \mathcal{O}_\infty-stable C^*-algebras. We also introduce and study the nonconnective version of Quillen's nonunital K'-theory in the framework of stable \infty-categories. This is done in order to promote our earlier result relating topological \mathbb{T}-duality to noncommutative motives to the \infty-categorical setup. Finally, we carry out some computations in the case of stable and \mathcal{O}_\infty-stable C^*-algebras.
