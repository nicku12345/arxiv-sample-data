The goal of this note is to study the analog in unstable {{\mathbb A}^1}-homotopy theory of the unit map from the motivic sphere spectrum to the Hermitian K-theory spectrum, i.e., the degree map in Hermitian K-theory. We show that "Suslin matrices", which are explicit maps from odd dimensional split smooth affine quadrics to geometric models of the spaces appearing in Bott periodicity in Hermitian K-theory, stabilize in a suitable sense to the unit map. As applications, we deduce that K^{MW}_i(F) = GW^i_i(F) for i \leq 3, which can be thought of as an extension of Matsumoto's celebrated theorem describing K_2 of a field. These results provide the first step in a program aimed at computing the sheaf \pi_{n}^{{\mathbb A}^1}({\mathbb A}^n \setminus 0) for n \geq 4.
