Let \Gamma \subset SL(2, \mathbb Z) be a finite subgroup acting on the irrational rotational algebra \mathcal A_\theta via the restriction of the canonical action of SL(2,\mathbb Z). Consider the crossed product algebra \mathcal A_\theta^{alg} \rtimes \Gamma obtained by the restriction of the \Gamma action on the algberaic irrational rotational algebra. In this paper we prove many results on the homology group of the crossed product algebra \mathcal A_\theta^{alg} \rtimes \Gamma. We also analyse the case of the smooth crossed product algebra, \mathcal A_\theta \rtimes \Gamma and calculate some of its homology groups.
