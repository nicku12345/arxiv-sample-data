HC_*(A \rtimes G) is the cyclic homology of the crossed product algebra A \rtimes G. For any g \epsilon G we will define a homomorphism from HC_*^g(A), the twisted cylic homology of A with respect to g, to HC_*(A \rtimes G). If G is the finite cyclic group generated by g and |G|=r is invertible in k, then HC_*(A \rtimes G) will be isomorphic to a direct sum of r copies of HC_*^g(A). For the case where |G| is finite and Q \subset k we will generalize the Karoubi and Connes periodicity exact sequences for HC_*^g(A) to Karoubi and Connes periodicity exact sequences for HC_*(A \rtimes G) .
