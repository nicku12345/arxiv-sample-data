While chain complexes are equipped with a differential d satisfying d^2 = 0, their generalizations called N-complexes have a differential d satisfying d^N = 0. In this paper we show that the lax nerve of the category of chain complexes is pointwise adjoint equivalent to the d\'ecalage of the simplicial category of N-complexes. This reveals additional simplicial structure on the lax nerve of the category of chain complexes which provides a categorfication of the triangulated homotopy category of chain complexes. We study this phenomena in general and present evidence that the axioms of triangulated categories have simplicial origin.
