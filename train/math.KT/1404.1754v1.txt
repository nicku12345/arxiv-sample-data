We introduce a Banach Lie group G of unitary operators subject to a natural trace condition. We compute the homotopy groups of G, describe its cohomology and construct an S^1-central extension. We show that the central extension determines a non-trivial gerbe on the action Lie groupoid G\ltimes \mathfrak{k}, where \mathfrak{k} denotes the Hilbert space of self-adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt operators. With an eye towards constructing elements in twisted K-theory, we prove the existence of a cubic Dirac operator \mathbb{D} in a suitable completion of the quantum Weil algebra \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g}) \otimes Cl(\mathfrak{k}), which is subsequently extended to a projective family of self-adjoint operators \mathbb{D}_A on G\ltimes \frak{k}. While the kernel of \mathbb{D}_A is infinite-dimensional, we show that there is still a notion of finite reducibility at every point, which suggests a generalized definition of twisted K-theory for action Lie groupoids.
