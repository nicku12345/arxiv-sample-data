We study pro excision in algebraic K-theory, following Suslin--Wodzicki, Cuntz--Quillen, Corti\~nas, and Geisser--Hesselholt, as well as Artin--Rees and continuity properties of Andr\'e--Quillen, Hochschild, and cyclic homology. Our key tool is to first establish the equivalence of various pro Tor vanishing conditions which appear in the literature. Using this we prove that all ideals of commutative, Noetherian rings are pro unital in a certain sense, and show that such ideals satisfy pro excision in K-theory as well as in cyclic and topological cyclic homology. In addition, our techniques yield a strong form of the pro Hochschild--Kostant--Rosenberg theorem, an extension to general base rings of the Cuntz--Quillen excision theorem in periodic cyclic homology, and a generalisation of the Fe\u{\i}gin--Tsygan theorem.
