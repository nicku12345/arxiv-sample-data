We establish a dictionary between the Cacti algebra axioms on a Cacti algebra structure with underlying free associative algebra, under suitable good behavior with degrees. Using these ideas, for an associative algebra A and a bialgebra H, we also translate Cacti algebra maps \Omega(H)\to C^\bullet(A) (where \Omega(H) stands for the cobar construction on H and C^\bullet(A) is the Hochschild cohomology complex) with H-module algebra structures on A, and illustrate with examples of applications.
