This is an enhanced version of the author's 1998 Harvard Ph.D. thesis, as published by IMRN in 2005. We propose an extension of Bogomolov's conjecture about commutator subgroups of Galois groups to arbitrary fields. A somewhat weaker conjecture is then shown to follow, together with the famous Milnor-Bloch-Kato conjecture, from a certain hypothesis about homological properties of the Milnor K-theory algebras.
