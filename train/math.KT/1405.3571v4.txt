Let G be a compact, connected, and simply-connected Lie group, equipped with an anti-involution a_G which is the composition of a Lie group involutive automorphism \sigma_G and the group inversion. We view (G, a_G) as a Real (G, \sigma_G)-space via the conjugation action. In this note, we exploit the notion of Real equivariant formality discussed in \cite{Fo} to compute the ring structure of the equivariant KR-theory of G. In particular, we show that when G does not have Real representations of complex type, the equivariant KR-theory is the ring of Grothendieck differentials of the coefficient ring of equivariant KR-theory over the coefficient ring of ordinary KR-theory, thereby generalizing a result of Brylinski-Zhang's (\cite{BZ}) for the complex K-theory case.
