In this survey article, given a smooth closed manifold M we study the space of Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature on M. A long-standing question is: when is this space non-empty (i.e. when does M admit a metric of positive scalar curvature)? More generally: what is the topology of this space? For example, what are its homotopy groups?   Higher index theory of the Dirac operator is the basic tool to address these questions. This has seen tremendous development in recent years, and in this survey we will discuss some of the most pertinent examples.   In particular, we will show how advancements of large scale index theory (also called coarse index theory) give rise to new types of obstructions, and provide the tools for a systematic study of the existence and classification problem via the K-theory of C*-algebras. This is part of a program "mapping the topology of positive scalar curvature to analysis".   In addition, we will show how advanced surgery theory and smoothing theory can be used to construct the first elements of infinite order in the k-th homotopy groups of the space of metrics of positive scalar curvature for arbitrarily large k. Moreover, these examples are the first ones which remain non-trivial in the moduli space of such metrics.
