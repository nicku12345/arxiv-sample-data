We solve a classical problem of centrality of symplectic \mathrm K_2, namely we show that for an arbitrary commutative ring R, l\geq3 the symplectic Steinberg group \mathrm{StSp}(2l,\,R) as an extension of the elementary symplectic group \mathrm{Ep}(2l,\,R) is a central extension. This allows to conclude that the explicit definition of symplectic \mathrm{K_2Sp}(2l,\,R) as a kernel of this extension, i.e. as a group of non-elementary relations among symplectic transvections, coincides with the usual implicit definition via plus-construction. We proceed from van der Kallen's classical paper, where he shows an analogous result for linear K-theory. We find a new set of generators for the symplectic Steinberg group and a defining system of relations among them. In this new presentation it is obvious that the symplectic Steinberg group is a central extension.
