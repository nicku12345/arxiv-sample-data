We prove the equivalence between the category \mathbf{RigDM}_{et}^{eff}(K,\mathbb{Q}) of effective motives of rigid analytic varieties over a perfect complete non-archimedean field K and the category \mathbf{RigDM}_{Frobet}^{eff}(K,\mathbb{Q}) which is obtained by localizing the category of motives without transfers \mathbf{RigDA}_{et}^{eff}(K,\mathbb{Q}) over purely inseparable maps. In particular, we obtain an equivalence between \mathbf{RigDM}_{et}^{eff}(K,\mathbb{Q}) and \mathbf{RigDA}_{et}^{eff}(K,\mathbb{Q}) in the characteristic 0 case and an equivalence between \mathbf{DM}_{et}^{eff}(K,\mathbb{Q}) and \mathbf{DA}_{Frobet}^{eff}(K,\mathbb{Q}) of motives of algebraic varieties over a perfect field K. We also show a relative and a stable version of the main statement.
