Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold and assume that M is partitioned by a hypersurface N. In this paper we introduce a novel class of functions C_{\mathrm{w}}(M) on noncompact manifolds, which is slightly larger than the algebra of Higson functions. Out of \phi that belongs to C_{\mathrm{w}}(M) we construct an index class \mathrm{Ind}(\phi , D) in K_{1}-group of the Roe algebra of M by using the Kasparov product. It is supposed to be a counterpart of Roe's odd index class. We finally prove that Connes' pairing of \mathrm{Ind}(\phi , D) and Roe's cyclic 1-cocycle is equal to the Fredholm index of a Toeplitz operator on N. This is an extension of the Roe-Higson index theorem to even-dimensional partitioned manifold.
