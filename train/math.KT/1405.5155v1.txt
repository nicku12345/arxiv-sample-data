For a finite-dimensional Frobenius k-algebra R with the Nakayama automorphism \nu we define an algebra {\rm HH}^*(R)^{\nu\uparrow}. If the order of \nu is not divisible by the characteristic of k, this algebra is isomorphic to the Hochschild cohomology algebra of R.. We prove that this algebra is a BV-algebra. We use this fact to calculate the Gerstenhaber algebra structure and BV-structure on the Hochschild cohomology algebras of a family of self-injective algebras of tree type D_n.
