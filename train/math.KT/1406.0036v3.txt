We define Gerstenhaber's graded Lie bracket directly on complexes other than the bar complex, under some conditions. The Koszul complex of a Koszul algebra in particular satisfies our conditions. As examples we recover the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket for a polynomial ring and the Gerstenhaber bracket for a group algebra of a cyclic group of prime order.
