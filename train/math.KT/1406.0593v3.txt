For a Cohen-Macaulay ring R, we exhibit the equivalence of the bounded derived categories of certain resolving subcategories, which, amongst other results, yields an equivalence of the bounded derived category of finite length and finite projective dimension modules with the bounded derived category of projective modules with finite length homologies. This yields isomorphisms of various generalized cohomology groups (like K-theory) and improves on terms of a spectral sequence and Gersten complexes.
