kk^{\text{ban}} is a bivariant K-theory for Banach algebras that has reasonable homological properties, a product and is Morita invariant in a very general sense. We define it here by a universal property and ensure its existence in a rather abstract manner using triangulated categories. The definition ensures that there is a natural transformation from Lafforgue's theory KK^{\text{ban}} into it so that one can take products of elements in KK^{\text{ban}} that lie in kk^{\text{ban}}.
