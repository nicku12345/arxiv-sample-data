Consider a Grothendieck category \mathcal{G} along with a choice of generator G, or equivalently a generating set \{G_i\}. We introduce the derived category \mathcal{D}(G), which kills all G-acyclic complexes, by putting a suitable model structure on the category of chain complexes. It follows that the category \mathcal{D}(G) is always a well-generated triangulated category. It is compactly generated whenever the generating set \{G_i\} has each G_i finitely presented, and in this case we show that two recollement situations hold. The first is when passing from the homotopy category K(\mathcal{G}) to \mathcal{D}(G). The second is a G-derived analog to the recollement of Krause. We illustrate with several examples ranging from pure and clean derived categories to quasi-coherent sheaves on the projective line P^1(k).
