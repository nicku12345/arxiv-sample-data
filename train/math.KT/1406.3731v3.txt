We define a class \mathcal{U} of solvable groups of finite abelian section rank which includes all such groups that are virtually torsion-free as well as those that are finitely generated. Assume that G is a group in \mathcal{U} and A a \mathbb ZG-module. If A is \mathbb Z-torsion-free and has finite \mathbb Z-rank, we stipulate a condition on A that guarantees that H^n(G,A) and H_n(G,A) must be finite for n\geq 0. Moreover, if the underlying abelian group of A is a \v{C}ernikov group, we identify a similar condition on A that ensures that H^n(G,A) must be a \v{C}ernikov group for all n\geq 0.
