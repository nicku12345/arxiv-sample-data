Given a map f: X\rightarrow Y of simply connected spaces of finite type such. The space of based loops at f of the space of maps between X and Y is denoted by \Omega_{f} Map(X,Y). For n> 0, we give a model categorical interpretation of the existence (in functorial way) of an injective map of \mathbb{Q}-vector spaces \pi_{n} \Omega_{f}Map(X,Y_{\mathbb{Q}}) \rightarrow HH^{-n}(C^{\ast}(Y),C^{\ast}(X)_{f}), where HH^{\ast} is the (negative) Hochschild cohomology and C^{\ast}(X)_{f} is the rational cochain complex associated to X equipped with a structure of C^{\ast}(Y)-differential graded bimodule via the induced map of differential graded algebras f^{\ast}: C^{\ast}(Y)\rightarrow C^{\ast}(X). Moreover, we identifiy the image in presice way by using the Hodge filtration on Hochschild cohomology. In particular, when X=Y, we describe the fundamental group of the identity component of the monoid of self equivalence of a (rationalization of) space X i.e., \pi_{1} Aut(X_{\mathbb{Q}})_{id}.
