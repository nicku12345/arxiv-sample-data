We clarify the relationship between works of Lee-Szczarba and Ash-Rudolph on the homology of the Steinberg module of a linear Tits building. This yields a simple proof of the Solomon-Tits theorem in this special case. We also give a (weak) relationship between this combinatorics and the one studied by van der Kallen, Suslin and Nesterenko to compute the homology of the general linear group with constant coefficients.
