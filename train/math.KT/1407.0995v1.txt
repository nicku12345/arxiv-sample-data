If \mathscr{M} is a model category and \mathcal{U}: \mathscr{A} \rightarrow \mathscr{M} is a functor, we defined a Quillen-Segal \mathcal{U}-object as a weak equivalence \mathscr{F}: s(\mathscr{F}) \xrightarrow{\sim} t(\mathscr{F}) such that t(\mathscr{F})=\mathcal{U}(b) for some b\in \mathscr{A}. If \mathcal{U} is the nerve functor \mathcal{U}: \mathbf{Cat} \rightarrow \mathbf{sSet}_J, with the Joyal model structure on \mathbf{sSet}, then studying the comma category (\mathbf{sSet}_J \downarrow \mathcal{U}) leads naturally to concepts, such as Lurie's \infty-operad. It also gives simple examples of presentable, stable \infty-category, and higher topos. If we consider the \textit{coherent nerve} \mathcal{U}: \mathbf{sCat}_B \rightarrow \mathbf{sSet}_J, then the theory of QS-objects directly connects with the program of Riehl and Verity. If we apply our main result when \mathcal{U} is the identity Id: \mathbf{sSet}_Q \rightarrow \mathbf{sSet}_Q, with the Quillen model structure, the homotopy theory of QS-objects is equivalent to that of Kan complexes and we believe that this is an \textit{avatar} of Voevodsky's \textit{Univalence axiom}. This equivalence holds for any combinatorial and left proper \mathscr{M}. This result agrees with our intuition, since by essence the `\textit{Quillen-Segal type}' is the \textit{Equivalence type}
