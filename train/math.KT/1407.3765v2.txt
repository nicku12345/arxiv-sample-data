We give an elementary introduction to the theory of triangulated categories covering their axioms, homological algebra in triangulated categories, triangulated subcategories, and Verdier localization. We try to use a minimal set of axioms for triangulated categories and derive all other statements from these, including the existence of biproducts. We conclude with a list of examples.
