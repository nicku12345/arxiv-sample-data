It is shown that the Hochschild Cohomological dimension of an associative algebra is not an upper-semi continuous function, showing the semi-continuity theorem is no longer valid for non-commutative algebras. A family of \mathbb{C} exhibits this-algebras parameterized by \mathbb{C} all but one of which has Hochschild cohomological dimension 2 and the other having Hochschild cohomological dimension 1.
