We calculate \pi_*K(\mathbb S)[1/2], the homotopy groups of K(\mathbb S) away from 2, in terms of the homotopy groups of K(\mathbb Z), the homotopy groups of {\mathbb C}P^\infty_{-1}, and the homotopy groups of \mathbb S. This builds on the work of Waldhausen, who computed the rational homotopy groups (building on work of Quillen and Borel) and Rognes, who calculated the groups at regular primes in terms of the homotopy groups of {\mathbb C}P^\infty_{-1}, and the homotopy groups of \mathbb S.
