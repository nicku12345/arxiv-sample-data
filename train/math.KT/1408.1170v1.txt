We associate to each unital C^*-algebra A a geometric object---a diagram of topological spaces representing quotient spaces of the noncommutative space underlying A---meant to serve the role of a generalized Gel'fand spectrum. After showing that any functor F from compact Hausdorff spaces to a suitable target category can be applied directly to these geometric objects to automatically yield an extension \tilde{F} which acts on all unital C^*-algebras, we compare a novel formulation of the operator K_0 functor to the extension \tilde K of the topological K-functor.
