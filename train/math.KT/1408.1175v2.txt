This paper continues the author's program to investigate the question of when a homotopy of 2-cocycles \Omega = \{\omega_t\}_{t \in [0,1]} on a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid \mathcal{G} induces an isomorphism of the K-theory groups of the twisted groupoid C^*-algebras: K_*(C^*(\mathcal{G}, \omega_0)) \cong K_*(C^*(\mathcal{G}, \omega_1)). Building on our earlier work, we show that if \pi: \mathcal{G} \to M is a locally trivial bundle of amenable groups over a locally compact Hausdorff space M, a homotopy \Omega = \{\omega_t\}_{t \in [0,1]} of 2-cocycles on \mathcal{G}  gives rise to an isomorphism K_*(C^*(\mathcal{G}, \omega_0)) \cong K_*(C^*(\mathcal{G}, \omega_1)).
