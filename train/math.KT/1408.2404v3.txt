We compare different algebraic structures in twisted equivariant K-Theory for proper actions of discrete groups. After the construction of a module structure over untwisted equivariant K-Theory, we prove a completion Theorem of Atiyah-Segal type for twisted equivariant K-Theory. Using a Universal coefficient Theorem, we prove a cocompletion Theorem for Twisted Borel K-Homology for discrete Groups.
