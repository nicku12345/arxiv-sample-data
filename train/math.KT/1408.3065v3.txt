We define a functorial spectrum-level filtration on the topological Hochschild homology of any commutative ring spectrum R, and more generally the factorization homology R \otimes X for any space X, echoing algebraic constructions of Loday and Pirashvili. We investigate the properties of this filtration and show that it breaks THH up into common eigenspectra of the Adams operations.
