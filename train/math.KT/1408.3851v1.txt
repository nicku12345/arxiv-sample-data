We investigate determinants of Koszul complexes of holomorphic functions of a commuting tuple of bounded operators acting on a Hilbert space. Our main result shows that the analytic joint torsion, which compares two such determinants, can be computed by a local formula which involves a tame symbol of the involved holomorphic functions. As an application we are able to extend the classical tame symbol of meromorphic functions on a Riemann surface to the more involved setting of transversal functions on a complex analytic curve. This follows by spelling out our main result in the case of Toeplitz operators acting on the Hardy space over the polydisc.
