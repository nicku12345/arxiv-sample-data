We introduce and study a new mathematical structure in the generalised (quantum) cohomology theory for Grassmannians. Namely, we relate the Schubert calculus to a quantum integrable system known in the physics literature as the asymmetric six-vertex model. Our approach offers a new perspective on already established and well-studied special cases, for example equivariant K-theory, and in addition allows us to formulate a conjecture on the so-far unknown case of quantum equivariant K-theory.
