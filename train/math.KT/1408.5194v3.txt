In this paper, we develop the main step in the global theory for the mod-\ell analogue of Bogomolov's program in birational anabelian geometry for higher-dimensional function fields over algebraically closed fields. More precisely, we show how to reconstruct a function field K of transcendence degree \geq 5 over an algebraically closed field, up-to inseparable extensions, from the mod-\ell abelian-by-central Galois group of K endowed with the collection of mod-\ell rational quotients.
