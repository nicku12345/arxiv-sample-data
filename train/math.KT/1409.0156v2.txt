In this paper we study the structure of the Algebraic Cobordism ring of a variety as a module over the Lazard ring, and show that it has relations in positive codimensions. We actually prove the stronger graded version. This extends the result of M.Levine-F.Morel claiming that this module has generators in non-negative codimensions. As an application we compute the Algebraic Cobordism ring of a curve. The main tool is Symmetric Operations in Algebraic Cobordism.
