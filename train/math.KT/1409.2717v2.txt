The goal of this paper is to solve the problem of existence of an \ell^2 relative eta morphism on the Higson-Roe structure group. Using the Cheeger-Gromov \ell^2 eta invariant, we construct a group morphism from the Higson-Roe maximal structure group constructed in [HiRo:10] to the reals. When we apply this morphism to the structure class associated with the spin Dirac operator for a metric of positive scalar curvature, we get the spin \ell^2 rho invariant. When we apply this morphism to the structure class associated with an oriented homotopy equivalence, we get the difference of the \ell^2 rho invariants of the corresponding signature operators. We thus get new proofs for the classical \ell^2 rigidity theorems of Keswani obtained in [Ke:00].
