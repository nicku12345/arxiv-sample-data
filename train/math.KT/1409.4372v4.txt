Using the theory of framed correspondences developed by Voevodsky, we introduce and study framed motives of algebraic varieties. They are the major computational tool for constructing an explicit quasi-fibrant motivic replacement of the suspension \mathbb P^1-spectrum of any smooth scheme X\in Sm/k. Moreover, it is shown that the bispectrum (M_{fr}(X),M_{fr}(X)(1),M_{fr}(X)(2),\ldots), each term of which is a twisted framed motive of X, has motivic homotopy type of the suspension bispectrum of X. Furthermore, an explicit computation of infinite \mathbb P^1-loop motivic spaces is given in terms of spaces with framed correspondences. We also introduce big framed motives of bispectra and show that they convert the classical Morel--Voevodsky motivic stable homotopy theory into an equivalent local theory of framed bispectra. As a topological application, it is proved that the framed motive M_{fr}(pt)(pt) of the point pt=Spec(k) evaluated at pt is a quasi-fibrant model of the classical sphere spectrum whenever the base field k is algebraically closed of characteristic zero.
