For a quasi-projective scheme M which carries a perfect obstruction theory, we construct the virtual cobordism class of M. If M is projective, we prove that the corresponding Chern numbers of the virtual cobordism class are given by integrals of the Chern classes of the virtual tangent bundle. Further, we study cobordism invariants of the moduli space of stable pairs introduced by Pandharipande-Thomas. Rationality of the partition function is conjectured together with a functional equation, which can be regarded as a generalization of the rationality and 1/q <-> q symmetry of the Calabi-Yau case. We prove rationality for nonsingular projective toric 3-folds by the theory of descendents.
