We study the Koszul duality between augmented E_n-algebras and augmented E_n-coalgebras in a symmetric monoidal stable infinity 1-category equipped with a filtration in a suitable sense. We obtain that the Koszul duality constructions restrict to an equivalence between augmented algebras and coalgebras which have some positivity and completeness with respect to the filtration. We also obtain that the Koszul duality construction is functorial between carefully constructed generalized Morita categories consisting of those algebras/coalgebras in each dimension.
