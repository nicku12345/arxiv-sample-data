We study descent properties of Jacob Lurie's topological chiral homology. We prove that this homology theory satisfies descent for a factorizing cover, as defined by Kevin Costello and Owen Gwilliam. We also obtain a generalization of Lurie's approach to this homology theory, which leads to a product formula for the infinity 1-category of factorization algebras, and its twisted generalization.
