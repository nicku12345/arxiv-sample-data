Generalising Jacob Lurie's idea on the relation between the Verdier duality and the iterated loop space theory, we study the Koszul duality for locally constant factorisation algebras. We formulate an analogue of Lurie's "nonabelian Poincare duality" theorem (which is closely related to earlier results of Graeme Segal, of Dusa McDuff, and of Paolo Salvatore) in a symmetric monoidal stable infinity category carefully, using John Francis' notion of excision. Its proof depends on our earlier study of the Koszul duality for E_n-algebras. As a consequence, we obtain a Verdier type equivalence for factorisation algebras by a Koszul duality construction.
