Given a smooth one parameter deformation of associative topological algebras, we define Getzler's Gauss-Manin connection on both the periodic cyclic homology and cohomology of the corresponding smooth field of algebras and investigate some basic properties. We use the Gauss-Manin connection to prove a rigidity result for periodic cyclic cohomology of Banach algebras with finite weak bidimension.
