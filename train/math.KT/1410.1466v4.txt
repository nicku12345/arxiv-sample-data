For a ring R, we construct a universal K_R-torsor \mathcal{T}_R\to K_{Tate(R)} on the K-theory space of Tate R-modules. This torsor is closely related to canonical central extensions of loop groups. Just like classical loop group theory has features of K-theory (e.g. determinant bundles, tame symbol cocycle for Kac-Moody extension), the K-theory torsor relates higher loop groups with higher K-theory. We study the classifying "index" map of this torsor in detail. We explain how it arises in analogy with the classical index map of Fredholm operators, and we relate the K-theory torsor to previously studied dimension and determinant torsors.
