In this paper we continue our study of logarithmic topological Hochschild homology. We show that the inclusion of the connective Adams summand into the p-local complex connective K-theory spectrum, equipped with suitable log structures, is a formally log THH-etale map, and compute the V(1)-homotopy of their logarithmic topological Hochschild homology spectra. As an application, we recover Ausoni's computation of the V(1)-homotopy of the ordinary THH of ku.
