We study the problem of classifying projectivizations of rank-two vector bundles over {\mathbb P}^2 up to various notions of equivalence that arise naturally in {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy theory, namely {\mathbb A}^1-weak equivalence and {\mathbb A}^1-h-cobordism.   First, we classify such varieties up to {\mathbb A}^1-weak equivalence: over algebraically closed fields having characteristic unequal to two the classification can be given in terms of characteristic classes of the underlying vector bundle. When the base field is {\mathbb C}, this classification result can be compared to a corresponding topological result and we find that the algebraic and topological homotopy classifications agree.   Second, we study the problem of classifying such varieties up to {\mathbb A}^1-h-cobordism using techniques of deformation theory. To this end, we establish a deformation rigidity result for {\mathbb P}^1-bundles over {\mathbb P}^2 which links {\mathbb A}^1-h-cobordisms to deformations of the underlying vector bundles. Using results from the deformation theory of vector bundles we show that if X is a {\mathbb P}^1-bundle over {\mathbb P}^2 and Y is the projectivization of a direct sum of line bundles on {\mathbb P}^2, then if X is {\mathbb A}^1-weakly equivalent to Y, X is also {\mathbb A}^1-h-cobordant to Y.   Finally, we discuss some subtleties inherent in the definition of {\mathbb A}^1-h-cobordism. We show, for instance, that direct {\mathbb A}^1-h-cobordism fails to be an equivalence relation.
