We generalize the theory of Contou-Carr\`ere symbols to higher dimensions. To an (n+1)-tuple f_0,\dots,f_n \in A((t_1))\cdots((t_n))^{\times}, where A denotes a commutative algebra over a field k, we associate an element (f_0,\dots,f_n) \in A^{\times}, compatible with the higher tame symbol for k = A, and earlier constructions for n = 1, by Contou-Carr\`ere, and n = 2 by Osipov--Zhu. Our definition is based on the notion of \emph{higher commutators} for central extensions of groups by spectra, thereby extending the approach of Arbarello--de Concini--Kac and Anderson--Pablos Romo. Following Beilinson--Bloch--Esnault for the case n=1, we allow A to be arbitrary, and do not restrict to artinian A. Previous work of the authors on Tate objects in exact categories, and the index map in algebraic K-theory is essential in anchoring our approach to its predecessors. We also revisit categorical formal completions, in the context of stable \infty-categories. Using these tools, we describe the higher Contou-Carr\`ere symbol as a composition of boundary maps in algebraic K-theory, and conclude the article by proving a version of Parshin--Kato reciprocity for higher Contou-Carr\`ere symbols.
