For T a compact torus and E_T^* a generalized T-equivariant cohomology theory, we provide a systematic framework for computing E_T^* in the context of equivariantly stratified smooth complex projective varieties. This allows us to explicitly compute E_T^*(X) as an E_T^*(\text{pt})-module when X is a direct limit of smooth complex projective T_{\mathbb{C}}-varieties with finitely many T-fixed points and E_T^* is one of H_T^*(\cdot;\mathbb{Z}), K_T^*, and MU_T^*. We perform this computation on the affine Grassmannian of a complex semisimple group.
