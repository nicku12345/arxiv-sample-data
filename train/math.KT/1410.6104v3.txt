In characteristic 0 there are essentially two approaches to the conjectural theory of mixed motives, one due to Nori and the other one due to, independently, Hanamura, Levine, and Voevodsky. Although these approaches are apriori quite different it is expected that ultimately they can be reduced to one another. In this article we provide some evidence for this belief by proving that their associated motivic Galois groups are canonically isomorphic.
