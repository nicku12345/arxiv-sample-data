Let \Gamma be a finitely generated discrete group satisfying the rapid decay condition. We give a new proof of the higher Atiyah-Patodi-Singer theorem on a Galois \Gamma-coverings, thus providing an explicit formula for the higher index associated to a group cocycle c\in Z^k (\Gamma;\mathbb{C}) which is of polynomial growth with respect to a word-metric. Our new proof employs relative K-theory and relative cyclic cohomology in an essential way.
