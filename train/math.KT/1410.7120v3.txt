We introduce a Grothendieck group E_n for bounded polytopes in \mathbb R^n. It differs from the usual Euclidean scissors congruence group in that lower-dimensional polytopes are not ignored. We also define an analogous group L_n using germs of polytopes at a point, which is related to spherical scissors congruence. This provides a setting for a generalization of the Dehn invariant.
