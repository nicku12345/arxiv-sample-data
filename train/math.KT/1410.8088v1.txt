In this paper, combining Kirillov's method of orbits with Connes' method in Differential Geometry, we study the so-called MD(5,3C)-foliations, i.e. the orbit foliations of the co-adjoint action of MD(5,3C)-groups. First, we classify topologically MD(5,3C)-foliations based on the classification of all MD(5,3C)-algebras in [22] and the picture of co-adjoint orbits (K-orbits) of all MD(5,3C)-groups in [23]. Finally, we study K-theory for leaf space of MD(5,3C)-foliations and describe analytically or characterize Connes' C*-algebras of the considered foliations by KK-functors.
