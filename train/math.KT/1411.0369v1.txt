Let R be a commutative ring of dimension d, S = R[X] or R[X, 1/X] and P a finitely generated projective S module of rank r. Then P is cancellative if P has a unimodular element and r \geq d + 1. Moreover if r \geq \dim (S) then P has a unimodular element and therefore P is cancellative. As an application we have proved that if R is a ring of dimension d of finite type over a Pr\"{u}fer domain and P is a projective R[X] or R[X, 1/X] module of rank at least d + 1, then P has a unimodular element and is cancellative.
