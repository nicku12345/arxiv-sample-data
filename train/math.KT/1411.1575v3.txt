Twisted K-homology corresponds to D-branes in string theory. In this paper we compare two different models of geometric twisted K-homology and get their equivalence. Moreover, we give another description of geometric twisted K-homology using bundle gerbes. We establish some properties of geometric twisted K-homology. In the last part we construct T-duality isomorphism for geometric twisted K-homology.
