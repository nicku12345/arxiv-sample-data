In this paper, we study K-theory of spectral schemes by using locally free sheaves. Let us regard the K-theory as a functor K on affine spectral schemes. Then, we prove that the group completion \Omega B^{\mathcal{G}}(B^{\mathcal{G}}GL) represents the sheafification of K with respect to Zariski (resp. Nisnevich) topology \mathcal{G}, where B^{\mathcal{G}}GL is a classifying space of a colimit of affine spectral schemes GL_n.
