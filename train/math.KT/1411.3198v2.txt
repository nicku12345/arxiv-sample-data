The K-ring of symmetric vector bundles over a scheme X, the so-called Grothendieck-Witt ring of X, can be endowed with the structure of a (special) \lambda-ring. The associated \gamma-filtration generalizes the fundamental filtration on the (Grothendieck-)Witt ring of a field and is closely related to the "classical" filtration by the kernels of the first two Stiefel-Whitney classes.
