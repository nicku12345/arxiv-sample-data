It seems that the index theory for non-compact spaces has found its ultimate formulation in realm of coarse spaces and K-theory of related operator algebras. Relative and partitioned index theorems may be mentioned as two important and interesting examples of this program. In this paper we formulate a combination of these two theorems and establish a partitioned-relative index theorem.
