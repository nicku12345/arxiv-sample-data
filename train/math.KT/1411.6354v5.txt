We describe certain criteria for a motif M to be r-effective, i.e., to belong to the rth Tate twist Obj DM^{eff}_{gm,R}(r)=Obj DM^{eff}_{gm,R} \otimes L^{\otimes r} of effective Voevodsky motives (for r\ge 1; R is the coefficient ring). In particular, M is 1-effective if and only if a complex whose terms are certain Chow groups of zero-cycles is acyclic.   The dual to this statement checks whether an effective motif M belongs to the subcategory of DM^{eff}_{gm,R} generated by motives of varieties of dimension \le r. These criteria are formulated in terms of the Chow-weight (co)homology of M. These (co)homology theories are introduced in the current paper and have several (other) remarkable properties: they yield a bound on the "weights" of M (in the sense of the Chow weight structure defined by the first author) and detect the effectivity of "the lower weight pieces" of M. We also calculate the "connectivity" of M (in the sense of Voevodsky's homotopy t-structure) and prove that the exponents of the higher motivic homology groups (of an "integral" motif) are bounded whenever these groups are torsion. These motivic properties of M have important consequences for its cohomology. As a corollary, we prove that if Chow groups of an arbitrary variety X vanish up to dimension r-1 then the highest Deligne weight factors of the (singular or \'etale) cohomology of X with compact support are r-effective in the naturally defined sense.   Our results yield a vast generalization of the so-called "decomposition of the diagonal" statements.
