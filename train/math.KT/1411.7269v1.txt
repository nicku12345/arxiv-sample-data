We study the connection between Gabor frames for quasicrystals, the topology of the hull of a quasicrystal \Lambda, and the K-theory of the twisted groupoid C^*-algebra \mathcal{A}_\sigma arising from a quasicrystal. In particular, we construct a finitely generated projective module \mathcal{H}_\L over \mathcal{A}_\sigma related to time-frequency analysis, and any multiwindow Gabor frame for \Lambda can be used to construct an idempotent in M_N(\mathcal{A}_\sigma) representing \mathcal{H}_\L in K_0(\mathcal{A}_\sigma). We show for lattice subsets in dimension two, this element corresponds to the Bott element in K_0(\mathcal{A}_\sigma), allowing us to prove a twisted version of Bellissard's gap labeling theorem.
