We prove the bulk-edge correspondence in K-theory for the quantum Hall effect by constructing an unbounded Kasparov module from a short exact sequence that links the bulk and boundary algebras. This approach allows us to represent bulk topological invariants explicitly as a Kasparov product of boundary invariants with the extension class linking the algebras. This paper focuses on the example of the discrete integer quantum Hall effect, though our general method potentially has much wider applications.
