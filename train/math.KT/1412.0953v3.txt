We calculate the structure of the finitely-generated groups H_2(SL_2(Z[1/m])) when m is a multiple of 6. We construct explicit homology classes which generate these groups and have prescribed orders. When n is at least 2 and m is the product of the first n primes, we combine our results with those of Jun Morita to deduce that the projection St(2, Z[1/m]) --> SL_2(Z[1/m]) is a universal central extension, where St(2,-) is the rank one Steinberg group. The main structure theorem applies more generally to rings of S-integers with sufficiently many units. For a wide class of rings, the explicit homology classes we construct map to symbols in rank one K_2 of the ring.
