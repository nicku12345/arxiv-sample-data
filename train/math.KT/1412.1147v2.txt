Let X be a an affine smooth symplectic variety over \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}, and A be its deformation quantization over the p-adic integers. We prove that for all n\geq 1, the Hochschild cohomogy of A/p^nA is isomorphic to the de Rham-Witt complex of X over \mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}. We also compute centers of deformations of certain affine Poisson varieties over \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}.
