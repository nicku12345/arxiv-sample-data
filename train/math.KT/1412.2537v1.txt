For an additive Waldhausen category linear over a ring k, the corresponding K-theory spectrum is a module spectrum over the K-theory spectrum of k. Thus if k is a finite field of characteristic p, then after localization at p, we obtain an Eilenberg-Maclane spectrum -- in other words, a chain complex. We propose an elementary and direct construction of this chain complex that behaves well in families and uses only method of homological algebra (in particular, the notions of a ring spectrum and a module spectrum are not used).
