We develop the Witt group for certain braided monoidal categories with duality. In case of a braided fusion category over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, we explicitly describe this structure. We then use this description to prove that this tool provides an invariant for finite isocategorical groups. As an application, we show that all groups of order less than 64 are categorically rigid.
