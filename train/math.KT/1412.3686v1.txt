We introduce C^*-algebras associated to the foliation structure of a quantum flag manifold. We use these to construct SL_q(3,\mathbb{C})-equivariant Fredholm modules for the full quantum flag manifold X_q = SU_q(3)/T of SU_q(3), based on an analytical version of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand complex. As a consequence we deduce that the flag manifold  X_q  satisfies Poincar\'e duality in equivariant  KK -theory. Moreover, we show that the Baum-Connes conjecture with trivial coefficients holds for the discrete quantum group dual to SU_q(3).
