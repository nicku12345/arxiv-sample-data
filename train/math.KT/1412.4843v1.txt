There are two established ways to introduce geometric control in the category of free modules---the bounded control and the continuous control at infinity. Both types of control can be generalized to arbitrary modules over a noetherian ring and applied to study algebraic K-theory of infinite groups. This was accomplished for bounded control in part I of the present paper and the subsequent work of G.~Carlsson and the first author, in the context of spaces of finite asymptotic dimension. This part II develops the theory of filtered modules over a proper metric space with a good compactification. It is applicable in particular to CAT(0) groups which do not necessarily have finite asymptotic dimension.
