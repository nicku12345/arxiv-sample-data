Let R be a Koszul algebra over a field k and M be a linear R-module. We study a graded subalgebra \Delta_M of the Ext-algebra \operatorname{Ext}_R^*(M,M) called the diagonal subalgebra and its properties. Applications to the Hochschild cohomology ring of R and to periodicity of linear modules are given. Viewing R as a linear module over its enveloping algebra, we also show that \Delta_R is isomorphic to the graded center of the Koszul dual of R.
