We show that the higher Chow groups with modulus of Binda-Kerz-Saito for a smooth quasi-projective scheme X is a module over the Chow ring of X. From this, we deduce certain pull-backs, the projective bundle formula, and the blow-up formula for higher Chow groups with modulus.   We prove vanishing of 0-cycles of higher Chow groups with modulus on various affine varieties of dimension at least two. This shows in particular that the multivariate analogue of Bloch-Esnault--R\"ulling computations of additive higher Chow groups of 0-cycles vanishes.
