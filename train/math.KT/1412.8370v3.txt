We construct a compactly generated and closed symmetric monoidal stable \infty-category \mathtt{NSp'} and show that \mathtt{hNSp'}^{op} contains the suspension stable homotopy category of separable C^*-algebras \mathtt{\Sigma Ho^{C^*}} constructed by Cuntz-Meyer-Rosenberg as a fully faithful triangulated subcategory. Then we construct two colocalizations of \mathtt{NSp'}, namely, \mathtt{NSp'}[\mathbb{K}^{-1}] and \mathtt{NSp'}[\mathcal{Z}^{-1}], both of which are shown to be compactly generated and closed symmetric monoidal. We prove that Kasparov KK-category of separable C^*-algebras sits inside the homotopy category of \mathtt{KK_\infty} := \mathtt{NSp'}[\mathbb{K}^{-1}]^{op} as a fully faithful triangulated subcategory. Hence \mathtt{KK_\infty} should be viewed as the stable \infty-categorical incarnation of Kasparov KK-category for arbitrary pointed noncommutative spaces (including nonseparable C^*-algebras). As an application we find that the bootstrap category in \mathtt{hNSp'}[\mathbb{K}^{-1}] admits a completely algebraic description. We also construct a K-theoretic bootstrap category in \mathtt{hKK_\infty} that extends the construction of the UCT class by Rosenberg-Schochet. Motivated by the algebraization problem we finally analyse a couple of equivalence relations on separable C^*-algebras that are introduced via the bootstrap categories in various colocalizations of \mathtt{NSp'}.
