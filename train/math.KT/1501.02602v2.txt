We show that the relative Farrell-Jones assembly map from the family of finite subgroups to the family of virtually cyclic subgroups for algebraic K-theory is split injective in the setting where the coefficients are additive categories with group action. This generalizes a result of Bartels for rings as coefficients. We give an explicit description of the relative term. This enables us to show that it vanishes rationally if we take coefficients in a regular ring. Moreover, it is, considered as a Z[Z/2]-module by the involution coming from taking dual modules, an extended module and in particular all its Tate cohomology groups vanish, provided that the infinite virtually cyclic subgroups of type I of G are orientable. The latter condition is for instance satisfied for torsionfree hyperbolic groups.
