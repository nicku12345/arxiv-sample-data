It is shown that for a normal subgroup N of a group G, G/N cyclic, the kernel of the map N^{\mathrm{ab}}\to G^{\mathrm{ab}} satisfies the classical Hilbert 90 property (cf. Thm. A). As a consequence, if G is finitely generated, |G:N|<\infty, and all abelian groups H^{\mathrm{ab}}, N\subseteq H\subseteq G, are torsion free, then N^{\mathrm{ab}} must be a pseudo permutation module for G/N (cf. Thm. B). From Theorem A one also deduces a non-trivial relation between the order of the transfer kernel and co-kernel which determines the Hilbert-Suzuki multiplier (cf. Thm. C). Translated into a number theoretic context one obtains a strong form of Hilbert's theorem 94. In case that G is finitely generated and N has prime index p in G there holds a "generalized Schreier formula" involving the torsion free ranks of G and N and the ratio of the order of the transfer kernel and co-kernel (cf. Thm. D).
