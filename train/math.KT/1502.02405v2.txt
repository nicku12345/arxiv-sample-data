Let R be a noetherian ring of dimension d and let n be an integer so that n \leq d\leq 2n-3. Let (a_1,...,a_{n+1}) be a unimodular row so that the ideal J=(a_1,...,a_n) has height n. Jean Fasel has associated to this row an element [(J,\omega_J)] in the Euler class group E^n(R), with \omega_J:(R/J)^n\to J/J^2 given by (a_1,...,a_{n-1},a_n a_{n+1}). If R contains an infinite field F then we show that the rule of Fasel defines a homomorphism from WMS_{n+1}(R)=Um_{n+1}(R)/E_{n+1}(R) to E^n(R). The main problem is to get a well defined map on all of Um_{n+1}(R). Similar results have been obtained by Mrinal Kanti Das and MD Ali Zinna, with a different proof. Our proof uses that every Zariski open subset of SL_{n+1}(F) is path connected for walks made up of elementary matrices.
