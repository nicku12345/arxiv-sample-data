We develop a operator algebraic model for twisted K-theory, which includes the most general twistings as a generalized cohomology theory (i.e. all those classified by the unit spectrum bgl_1(KU)). Our model is based on strongly self-absorbing C^*-algebras. We compare it with the known homotopy theoretic descriptions in the literature, which either use parametrized stable homotopy theory or \infty-categories. We derive a similar comparison of analytic twisted K-homology with its topological counterpart based on generalized Thom spectra. Our model also works for twisted versions of localizations of the K-theory spectrum, like KU[1/n] or KU_{\mathbb{Q}}.
