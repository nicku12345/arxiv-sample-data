In this article, we suggest a categorification procedure in order to capture an analogy between Crystalline Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula and the cyclotomic trace map K\rightarrow TC from the algebraic K-theory to the topological cyclic homology TC. First, we categorify the category of schemes to the (2, \infty)-category of noncommuatative schemes a la Kontsevich. This gives a categorification of the set of rational points of a scheme. Then, we categorify the Crystalline Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula and find an analogue to the Crystalline cohomology in the setting of noncommuative schemes over \mathbf{F}_{p}. Our analogy suggests the existence of a categorification of the l-adic cohomology trace formula in the noncommutative setting for l\neq p. Finally, we write down the corresponding dictionary.
