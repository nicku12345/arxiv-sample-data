Quillen introduced a new K'_0-theory of nonunital rings and showed that, under some assumptions (weaker than the existence of unity), this new theory agrees with the usual algebraic K^{alg}_0-theory. For a field k of characteristic 0, we introduce higher nonunital K-theory of k-algebras, denoted KQ, which extends Quillen's original definition of the K'_0 functor. We show that the KQ-theory is Morita invariant and satisfies excision connectively, in a suitable sense, on the category of idempotent k-algebras. Using these two properties we show that the KQ-theory agrees with the topological K-theory of stable C^*-algebras. The machinery enables us to produce a DG categorical formalism of topological homological \mathbb{T}-duality using bivariant K-theory classes. A connection with strong deformations of C^*-algebras and some other potential applications to topological field theories are discussed towards the end.
