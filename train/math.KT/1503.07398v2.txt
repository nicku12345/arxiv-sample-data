We consider Hilsum's notion of bordism as an equivalence relation on unbounded KK-cycles and study the equivalence classes. Upon fixing two C^*-algebras, and a *-subalgebra dense in the first C^*-algebra, a \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}-graded abelian group is obtained; it maps to the Kasparov KK-group of the two C^*-algebras via the bounded transform. We study properties of this map both in general and in specific examples. In particular, it is an isomorphism if the first C^*-algebra is the complex numbers (i.e., for K-theory) and is a split surjection if the first C^*-algebra is the continuous functions on a compact manifold with boundary when one uses the Lipschitz functions as the dense *-subalgebra.
