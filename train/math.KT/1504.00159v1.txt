In the paper, we introduce the terminology equivariant pointwise clutching map. By using this, we give details on how to glue an equivariant vector bundle over a finite set so as to obtain a new Lie group representation such that the quotient map from the bundle to the representation is equivariant. Then, we investigate the topology of the set of all equivariant pointwise clutching maps with respect to an equivariant vector bundle over a finite set. Results of the paper play a key role in classifying equivariant vector bundles over two-surfaces in other papers.
