We prove that all eight KO groups for a real C*-algebra can be constructed from homotopy classes of unitary matrices that respect a variety of symmetries. In this manifestation of the KO groups, all eight boundary maps in the 24-term exact sequence associated to an ideal in a real C*-algebra can be computed as exponential or index maps with formulas that are nearly identical to the complex case.
