Koszul pairs were introduced in [arXiv:1011.4243] as an instrument for the study of Koszul rings. In this paper, we continue the enquiry of such pairs, focusing on the description of the second component, as a follow-up of the study in [arXiv:1605.05458]. As such, we introduce Koszul corings and prove several equivalent characterizations for them. As applications, in the case of locally finite R-rings, we show that a graded R-ring is Koszul if and only if its left (or right) graded dual coring is Koszul. Finally, for finite graded posets, we obtain that the respective incidence ring is Koszul if and only if the incidence coring is so.
