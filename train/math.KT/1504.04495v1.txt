We construct equivariant KK-theory with coefficients in \mathbb{R} and \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} as suitable inductive limits over {\rm II}_1-factors. We show that the Kasparov product, together with its usual functorial properties, extends to KK-theory with real coefficients.   Let \Gamma be a group. We define a \Gamma-algebra A to be K-theoretically free and proper (KFP) if the group trace {\bf tr} of \Gamma acts as the unit element in KK^{\Gamma}_{\mathbb{R}}(A,A). We show that free and proper \Gamma-algebras (in the sense of Kasparov) have the (KFP) property. Moreover, if \Gamma is torsion free and satisfies the KK^\Gamma-form of the Baum-Connes conjecture, then every \Gamma-algebra satisfies (KFP).   If \alpha:\Gamma\to U_n is a unitary representation and A satisfies property (KFP), we construct in a canonical way a rho class \rho_\alpha^A\in KK_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}^{1,\Gamma}(A,A). This construction generalizes the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer K-theory class with \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} coefficients associated to \alpha.
