The algebras of stable operations and cooperations in derived Witt theory with rational coefficients are computed and an additive description of cooperations in derived Witt theory is given. The answer is parallel to the well-known case of K-theory of real vector bundles in topology. In particular, we show that stable operations in derived Witt theory with rational coefficients are given by the values on the powers of Bott element.
