Ananyevsky has recently computed the stable operations and cooperations of rational Witt theory. These computations enable us to show a motivic analog of Serre's finiteness result:   Theorem: Let k be a field. Then \pi^{\mathbb{A}^1}_ n(\mathbb{S}^- _k )_* is torsion for n > 0.   As an application we define a category of Witt motives over k and show that rationally this category is equivalent to the minus part of SH(k)_\mathbb{Q}.
