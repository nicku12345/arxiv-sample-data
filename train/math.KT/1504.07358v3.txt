Let G be an infinite discrete group and let \underline{E}G be a classifying space for proper actions of G. Every G-equivariant vector bundle over \underline{E}G gives rise to a compatible collection of representations of the finite subgroups of G. We give the first examples of groups G with a cocompact classifying space for proper actions \underline{E}G admitting a compatible collection of representations of the finite subgroups of G that does not come from a G-equivariant (virtual) vector bundle over \underline{E}G. This implies that the Atiyah-Hirzeburch spectral sequence computing the G-equivariant topological K-theory of \underline{E}G has non-zero differentials. On the other hand, we show that for right angled Coxeter groups this spectral sequence always collapes at the second page and compute the K-theory of the classifying space of a right angled Coxeter group.
