This paper is our first step in establishing a de Rham model for equivariant twisted K-theory using machinery from noncommutative geometry. Let G be a compact Lie group, M a compact manifold on which G acts smoothly. For any \alpha \in H^3_G (M, {\mathbb Z}) we introduce a notion of localized equivariant twisted cohomology H^\bullet ({\bar{\Omega}}^\bullet (M, G, L)_g, d^\alpha_{G^g}), indexed by g\in G. We prove that there exists a natural family of chain maps, indexed by g\in G, inducing a family of morphisms from the equivariant periodic cyclic homology HP^G_\bullet ( C^\infty (M, \alpha ) ), where C^\infty (M, \alpha ) is a certain smooth algebra constructed from an equivariant bundle gerbe defined by \alpha \in H^3_G (M,{\mathbb Z} ), to H^\bullet ( {\bar{\Omega}}^\bullet (M, G, L)_g, d^\alpha_{G^g}). We formulate a conjecture of Atiyah-Hirzebruch type theorem for equivariant twisted K-theory.
