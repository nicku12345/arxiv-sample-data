We show that the multivariate additive higher Chow groups of a smooth affine k-scheme \Spec (R) essentially of finite type over a perfect field k of characteristic \not = 2 form a differential graded module over the big de Rham-Witt complex \W_m\Omega^{\bullet}_{R}. In the univariate case, we show that additive higher Chow groups of \Spec (R) form a Witt-complex over R. We use these structures to prove an \'etale descent for multivariate additive higher Chow groups.
