Inspired by recent papers on twisted K-theory, we consider in this article the question of when a twist \mathcal{R} over a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid \mathcal{G} (with unit space a CW-complex) admits a twisted vector bundle, and we relate this question to the Brauer group of \mathcal{G}.   We show that the twists which admit twisted vector bundles give rise to a subgroup of the Brauer group of \mathcal{G}. When \mathcal{G} is an \'etale groupoid, we establish conditions (involving the classifying space B\mathcal{G} of \mathcal{G}) which imply that a torsion twist \mathcal{R} over \mathcal{G} admits a twisted vector bundle.
