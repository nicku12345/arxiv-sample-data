Using a construction closely related to Waldhausen's S_\bullet-construction, we produce a spectrum K(\mathbf{Var}_{/k}) whose components model the Grothendieck ring of varieties (over a field k) K_0 (\mathbf{Var}_{/k}). We then produce liftings of various motivic measures to spectrum-level maps, including maps into Waldhausen's K-theory of spaces A(\ast) and to K(\mathbf{Q}). We end with a conjecture relating K(\mathbf{Var}_{/k}) and the doubly-iterated K-theory of the sphere spectrum.
