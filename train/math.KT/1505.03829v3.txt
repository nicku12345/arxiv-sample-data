We construct a higher-dimensional Contou-Carr\`ere symbol and we study its various fundamental properties. The higher-dimensional Contou-Carr\`ere symbol is defined by means of the boundary map for K-groups. We prove its universal property. We provide an explicit formula for the higher-dimensional Contou-Carr\`ere symbol over \mathbb Q and we prove integrality of this formula. A relation with the higher-dimensional Witt pairing is also studied.
