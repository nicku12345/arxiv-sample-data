For a flat commutative k-algebra A such that the enveloping algebra A\otimes_k A is noetherian, given a finitely generated bimodule M, we show that the adic completion of the Hochschild cohomology module HH^n(A/k,M) is naturally isomorphic to HH^n(\widehat{A}/k,\widehat{M}). To show this, we (1) make a detailed study of derived completion as a functor D(A) \to D(\widehat{A}) over a non-noetherian ring A; (2) prove a flat base change result for weakly proregular ideals; and (3) Prove that Hochschild cohomology and analytic Hochschild cohomology of complete noetherian local rings are isomorphic, answering a question of Buchweitz and Flenner. Our results makes it possible for the first time to compute the Hochschild cohomology of k[[t_1,\dots,t_n]] over any noetherian ring k, and open the door for a theory of Hochschild cohomology over formal schemes.
