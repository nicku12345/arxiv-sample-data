We introduce the concept of quasirational relation modules for discrete (pro- p) presentations of discrete (pro-p) groups. It is shown, that this class of presentations for discrete groups contains CA-presentations and their subpresentations. For pro-p-groups we see that all presentations of pro-p-groups with a single defining relation are quasirational. We offer definitions of p- adic G(p)-completion and p-adic rationalization of relation modules which are adjusted to quasirational pro-p-presentations. p-adic rationalizations of quasirational relation modules of pro-p-groups are isomorphic to abelianized p-adic Malcev completions.
