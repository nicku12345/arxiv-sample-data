We show that, for a right exact functor from an abelian category to abelian groups, Yoneda's isomorphism commutes with homology and, hence, with functor derivation. Then we extend this result to semiabelian domains. An interpretation in terms of satellites and higher central extensions follows. As an application, we develop semiabelian (higher) torsion theories and the associated theory of (higher) universal (central) extensions.
