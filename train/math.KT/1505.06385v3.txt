We calculate the topological Hochschild homology groups of a maximal order in a central algebra over the rationals. Since the positive-dimensional THH groups consist only of torsion, we do this one prime ideal at a time for all the nonzero prime ideals in the center of the maximal order. This allows us to reduce the problem to studying the THH groups of maximal orders A in simple algebras over Q_p. We show that the topological Hochschild homology of A/(p) splits as the tensor product of its Hochschild homology and the topological Hochschild homology of F_p. We use this result in Brun's spectral sequence to calculate THH(A; A/(p)), and then we analyze the torsion to get the homotopy groups of the completion at p of THH(A).
