The following natural question arises from Shalom's innovational work (1999, Publ. IHES): "Can we establish an intrinsic criterion to synthesize relative fixed point properties into the whole fixed point property without assuming Bounded Generation?" This paper resolves this question in the affirmative. Our criterion works for ones with respect to certain classes of Busemann NPC spaces. It, moreover, suggests a further step toward constructing super-expanders from finite simple groups of Lie type.
