Let X be a finite CW complex, and let DX be its dual in the category of spectra. We demonstrate that the Poincar\'e/Koszul duality between THH(DX) and the free loop space \Sigma^\infty_+ LX is in fact a genuinely S^1-equivariant duality that preserves the C_n-fixed points. Our proof uses an elementary but surprisingly useful rigidity theorem for the geometric fixed point functor \Phi^G of orthogonal G-spectra.
