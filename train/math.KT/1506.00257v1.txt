In this paper we investigate the connection between the Mac Lane (co)homology and Wieferich primes in finite localizations of global number rings. Following the ideas of Polishchuk-Positselski \cite{PP}, we define the Mac Lane (co)homology of the second kind of an associative ring with a central element. We compute this invariants for finite localizations of global number rings with an element w and obtain that the result is closely related with the Wieferich primes to the base w. In particular, for a given non-zero integer w, the infiniteness of Wieferich primes to the base w turns out to be equivalent to the following: for any positive integer n, we have HML^{II,0}(\mathbb{Z}[\frac1{n!}],w)\ne\mathbb{Q}.   As an application of our technique, we identify the ring structure on the Mac Lane cohomology of a global number ring and compute the Adams operations (introduced in this case by McCarthy \cite{McC}) on its Mac Lane homology.
