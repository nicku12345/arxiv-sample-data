The aim of this article is to study the Ext ring associated to a Koszul R-ring and to use it to provide further characterisations of the former. As such, for R being a semisimple ring and A a graded Koszul R-ring, we will prove that there is an isomorphism of DG rings between \mathcal{E}(A):=\mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_A(R,R) and ^{\ast-\text{gr}}\mathrm{T}(A) \simeq \mathrm{E}(^{\ast-\text{gr}\!} A). Also, the Ext R-ring will prove to be isomorphic to the shriek ring of the left graded dual of A, namely \mathcal{E}(A) \simeq (^{\ast-\text{gr}\!} A)^!. As an application, these isomorphisms will be studied in the context of incidence R-(co)rings for Koszul posets. Thus, we will obtain a description and method of computing the shriek ring for \Bbbk^c[\mathcal{P}], the incidence R-coring of a Koszul poset. Another application is provided for monoid rings associated to submonoids of \mathbb{Z}^n.
