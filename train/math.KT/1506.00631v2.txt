The main goal of this paper is to define a certain Chow weight structure w_{Chow} on the category DM_c(S) of (constructible) cdh-motives over an equicharacteristic scheme S. In contrast to the previous papers of D. H\'ebert and the first author on weights for relative motives (with rational coefficients), we can achieve our goal for motives with integral coefficients (if \operatorname{char}S=0; if \operatorname{char}S=p>0 then we consider motives with \mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{p}]-coefficients). We prove that the properties of the Chow weight structures that were previously established for \mathbb{Q}-linear motives can be carried over to this "integral" context (and we generalize some of them using certain new methods). In this paper we mostly study the version of w_{Chow} defined via "gluing from strata"; this enables us to define Chow weight structures for a wide class of base schemes.   As a consequence, we certainly obtain certain (Chow)-weight spectral sequences and filtrations for any (co)homology of motives.
