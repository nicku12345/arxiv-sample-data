We combine results about Whitehead groups of finite groups with results about genetic bases of finite p-groups to compute the Whitehead groups of some metacyclic p-groups. Let C_{p^n} denote a cyclic group of order p^n for p an odd prime and n a positive integer. We present a conjecture for the torsion part of the Whitehead group of C_{p^n}\times C_{p^n} and we show that torsion part of the Whitehead group of the semidirect product of C_{p^{n-1}} by C_p is isomorphic to C_p^{(n-2)(p-1)}. The techniques we use can be applied to any abelian p-group and to many other p-groups for p odd.
