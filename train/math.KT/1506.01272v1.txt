It was recently shown that each C*-algebra generated by a faithful irreducible representation of a finitely generated, torsion free nilpotent group is classified by its ordered K-theory. For the three step nilpotent group UT(4,\mathbb{Z}) we calculate the ordered K-theory of each C*-algebra generated by a faithful irreducible representation of UT(4,\mathbb{Z}) and see that they are all simple A\mathbb{T} algebras. We also point out that there are many simple non A\mathbb{T} algebras generated by irreducible representations of nilpotent groups.
