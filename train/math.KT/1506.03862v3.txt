Let V be an algebraic variety over \mathbb R. The purpose of this paper is to compare its algebraic Witt group W(V) with a new topological invariant WR(V_{\mathbb C}), based on symmetric forms on Real vector bundles (in the sense of Atiyah) on the space of complex points of V, This invariant lies between W(V) and the group KO(V_{\mathbb R}) of \mathbb R-linear topological vector bundles on V_{\mathbb R}, the set of real points of V.   We show that the comparison maps W(V)\to WR(V_{\mathbb C}) and WR(V_{\mathbb C})\to KO(V_{\mathbb R}) that we define are isomorphisms modulo bounded 2-primary torsion. We give precise bounds for the exponent of the kernel and cokernel of these maps, depending upon the dimension of V. These results improve theorems of Knebusch, Brumfiel and Mah\'e.   Along the way, we prove a comparison theorem between algebraic and topological Hermitian K-theory, and homotopy fixed point theorems for the latter. We also give a new proof (and a generalization) of a theorem of Brumfiel.
