We establish formulae for the part due to torsion of the equivariant K-homology of all the Bianchi groups (PSL\_2 of the imaginary quadratic integers), in terms of elementary number-theoretic quantities. To achieve this, we introduce a novel technique in the computation of Bredon homology: representation ring splitting, which allows us to adapt the recent technique of torsion subcomplex reduction from group homology to Bredon homology.
