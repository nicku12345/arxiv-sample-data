Suppose an amenable group G is acting freely on a simply connected simplicial complex \tilde X with compact quotient X. Fix n \geq 1, assume H_n(\tilde X, \mathbb{Z})=0 and let (H_i) be a Farber chain in G. We prove that the torsion of the integral homology in dimension n of \tilde{X}/H_i grows subexponentially in [G:H_i]. By way of contrast, if X is not compact, there are solvable groups of derived length 3 for which torsion in homology can grow faster than any given function.
