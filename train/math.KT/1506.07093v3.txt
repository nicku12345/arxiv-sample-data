We establish a general "affine representability" result in {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy theory over a general base. We apply this result to obtain representability results for vector bundles in {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy theory. Our results simplify and significantly generalize F. Morel's {\mathbb A}^1-representability theorem for vector bundles.
