Given a 0-connective motivic spectrum E \in SH(k) over a perfect field k, we determine h_0 of the associated motive M E \in DM(k) in terms of \pi_0 (E). Using this we show that if k has finite 2-\'etale cohomological dimension, then the functor M is conservative when restricted to the subcategory of compact spectra, and induces an injection on Picard groups. We extend the conservativity result to fields of finite virtual 2-\'etale cohomological dimension by considering what we call "real motives".   As a by-product we reprove a variant of a rigidity Theorem of R\"ondings-{\O}stv{\ae}r.
