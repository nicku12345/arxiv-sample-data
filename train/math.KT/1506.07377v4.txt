We show that the reduced motive of a smooth affine quadric is invertible as an object of the triangulated category of motives DM(k, ZZ[1/e]) (where k is a perfect field of exponential characteristic e). We also establish a motivic version of the conjectures of Po Hu on products of certain affine Pfister quadrics. Both of these results are obtained by studying a novel conservative functor on (a subcategory of) DM(k, ZZ[1/e]), the construction of which constitutes the main part of this work.
