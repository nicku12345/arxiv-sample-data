Meyer and Nest showed that the Baum--Connes map is equivalent to a map on K-theory of two different crossed products. This approach is strongly categorial in method since its bases is to regard Kasparov's theory KK^G as a triangulated category. We have tried to translate this approach to the realm of inverse semigroup equivariant C^*-algebras but can prove the existence of a Baum--Connes map only under some unverified additional assumptions which we however strongly motivate. Some of our results may be of independent interest, for example Bott periodicity, the definition of induction functors, the definition of a completely novel compatible L^2(G)-space, a Cuntz picture of KK^G, and the verification that KK^G is a triangulated category.
