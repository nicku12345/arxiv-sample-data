In this paper we define odd dimensional unitary groups U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta). These groups contain as special cases the odd dimensional general linear groups GL_{2n+1}(R) where R is any ring, the odd dimensional orthogonal and symplectic groups O_{2n+1}(R) and Sp_{2n+1}(R) where R is any commutative ring and further the first author's even dimensional unitary groups U_{2n}(R,\Lambda) where (R,\Lambda) is any form ring. We classify the E-normal subgroups of the groups U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta) (i.e. the subgroups which are normalized by the elementary subgroup EU_{2n+1}(R,\Delta)), under the condition that R is either a semilocal or quasifinite ring with involution and n\geq 3. Further we investigate the action of U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta) by conjugation on the set of all E-normal subgroups.
