A global action is an algebraic analogue of a topological space. It consists of group actions G_\alpha\curvearrowright X_\alpha, (\alpha\in\Phi), which fulfill a certain compatibility condition. We investigate the homotopy theory of global actions. The main result establishes a Galois type correspondence between connected coverings of a given connected global action and subgroups of the fundamental group of that action.
