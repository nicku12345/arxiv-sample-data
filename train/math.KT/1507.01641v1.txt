Let k be a commutative algebra with the field of the rational numbers included in k and let (E,p,i) be a cleft extension of A. We obtain a new mixed complex, simpler than the canonical one, giving the Hochschild and cyclic homologies of E relative to ker(p). This complex resembles the canonical reduced mixed complex of an augmented algebra. We begin the study of our complex showing that it has a harmonic decomposition like to the one considered by Cuntz and Quillen for the normalized mixed complex of an algebra.
