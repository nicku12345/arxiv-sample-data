We construct a model of differential K-theory, using the geometrically defined Chern forms, whose cocycles are certain equivalence classes of maps into the Grassmannians and unitary groups. In particular, we produce the circle-integration maps for these models using classical homotopy-theoretic constructions, by incorporating certain differential forms which reconcile the incompatibility between these even and odd Chern forms. By the uniqueness theorem of Bunke and Schick, this model agrees with the spectrum-based models in the literature whose abstract Chern cocycles are compatible with the delooping maps on the nose.
