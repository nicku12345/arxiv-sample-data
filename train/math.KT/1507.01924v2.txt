We develop a version of Hodge theory for a large class of smooth cohomologically proper quotient stacks X/G analogous to Hodge theory for smooth projective schemes. We show that the noncommutative Hodge-de Rham sequence for the category of equivariant coherent sheaves degenerates. This spectral sequence converges to the periodic cyclic homology, which we canonically identify with the topological equivariant K-theory of X with respect to a maximal compact subgroup M \subset G. The result is a natural pure Hodge structure of weight n on K^n_M(X^{an}). We also treat categories of matrix factorizations for equivariant Landau-Ginzburg models.
