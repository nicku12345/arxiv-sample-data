Fix a symbol \underline{a} in the mod-\ell Milnor K-theory of a field k, and a norm variety X for \underline{a}. We show that the ideal generated by \underline{a} is the kernel of the K-theory map induced by k\subset k(X) and give generators for the annihilator of the ideal. When \ell=2, this was done by Orlov, Vishik and Voevodsky.
