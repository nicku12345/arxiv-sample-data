In this article we continue our investigation of the Derived Equivalences over noetherian quasi-projective schemes X, over affine schemes \spec{A}. For integers k\geq 0, let C{\mathbb M}^k(X) denote the category of coherent {\CO}_X-modules {\mathcal F}, with locally free dimension proj\dim(\CF)=k=grade({\mathcal F}). We prove that there is a zig-zag equivalence {\mathcal D}}^b\left(C{\mathbb M}^k(X)\right) \to {\mathcal D}^k\left({\mathcal V}(X)\right) of the derived categories. It follows that there is a sequence of zig-zag maps {\mathbb K}\left(C{\mathbb M}^{k+1}(X)\right) \to {\mathbb K}\left(C{\mathbb M}^{k}(X)\right) \to \coprod_{x\in X^{(k)}} {\mathbb K}\left(C{\mathbb M}^{k}(X_x)\right) \\ of the \K-theory spectra that is a homotopy fibration. In fact, this is analogous to the fibrations of the G-theory spaces of Quillen (see proof of \cite[Theorem 5.4]{Q}). We also establish similar homotopy fibrations of {\bf GW}-spectra and {\mathbb G}W-bispectra.
