This paper is a greatly expanded version of Section 9.11 in arXiv:1006.4343. A series of definitions and results illustrating the thesis in the title (where quasi-formality means vanishing of a certain kind of Massey multiplications in the cohomology) is presented. In particular, we include a categorical interpretation of the "Koszulity implies K(\pi,1)" claim, discuss the differences between two versions of Massey operations, and apply the derived nonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory in order to deduce the main theorem. In the end we demonstrate a counterexample providing a negative answer to a question of Hopkins and Wickelgren about formality of the cochain DG-algebras of absolute Galois groups, thus showing that quasi-formality cannot be strengthened to formality in the title assertion.
