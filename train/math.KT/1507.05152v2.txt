We study a version of the James model for the loop space of a suspension in unstable {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy theory. We use this model to establish an analog of G.W. Whitehead's classical refinement of the Freudenthal suspension theorem in {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy theory: our result refines F. Morel's {\mathbb A}^1-simplicial suspension theorem. We then describe some E_1-differentials in the EHP sequence in {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy theory. These results are analogous to classical results of G.W. Whitehead's. Using these tools, we deduce some new results about unstable {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy sheaves of motivic spheres, including the counterpart of a classical rational non-vanishing result.
