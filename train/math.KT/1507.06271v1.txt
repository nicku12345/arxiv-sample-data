We present a research programme aimed at constructing classifying toposes of Weil-type cohomology theories and associated categories of motives, and introduce a number of notions and preliminary results already obtained in this direction. In order to analyze the properties of Weil-type cohomology theories and their relations, we propose a framework based on atomic two-valued toposes and homogeneous models. Lastly, we construct a syntactic triangulated category whose dual maps to the derived categories of all the usual cohomology theories.
