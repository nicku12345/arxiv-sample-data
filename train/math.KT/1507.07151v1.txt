Generalizing a concept of Lipshitz, Ozsv\'ath and Thurs-ton from Bordered Floer homology, we define D-structures on algebras of unital operads, which can also be interpreted as a generalization of a seemingly unrelated concept of Getzler and Jones. This construction gives rise to an equivalence of derived categories, which can be thought of as a unital version of Koszul duality using non-unital Quillen homology. We also discuss a multi-sorted version of the construction, which provides a framework for unifying the known algebraic contexts of Koszul duality.
