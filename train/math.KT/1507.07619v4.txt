We prove a moving lemma which implies the contravariance of Bloch-Esnault's additive higher Chow group in smooth affine varieties and Binda-Saito's higher Chow group (taken in the Nisnevich topology) in smooth varieties equipped with effective Cartier divisors. The new ingredients in the moving method are parallel translation {\em with modulus} in the affine space that involves a new integer parameter, and Noether's normalization lemma over a Dedekind base.
