We establish a relative version of the abstract "affine representability" theorem in {\mathbb A}^1--homotopy theory from Part I of this paper. We then prove some {\mathbb A}^1--invariance statements for generically trivial torsors under isotropic reductive groups over infinite fields analogous to the Bass--Quillen conjecture for vector bundles. Putting these ingredients together, we deduce representability theorems for generically trivial torsors under isotropic reductive groups and for associated homogeneous spaces in {\mathbb A}^1--homotopy theory.
