We prove that the (logarithmic) Mahler measure m(P) of P(x,y)=x+1/x+y+1/y+3 is equal to the L-value 2L'(E,0) attached to the elliptic curve E:P(x,y)=0 of conductor 21. In order to do this we investigate the measure of a more general Laurent polynomial P_{a,b,c}(x,y)=a(x+1/x)+b(y+1/y)+c and show that the wanted quantity m(P) is related to a "half-Mahler" measure of \tilde P(x,y)=P_{\sqrt{7},1,3}(x,y). In the finale we use the modular parametrization of the elliptic curve \tilde P(x,y)=0, again of conductor 21, due to Ramanujan and the Mellit--Brunault formula for the regulator of modular units.
