Let p\in \mathbb{Z} be an odd prime. We prove a spectral version of Tate-Poitou duality for the algebraic K-theory spectra of number rings with p inverted. This identifies the homotopy type of the fiber of the cyclotomic trace K(\mathcal{O}_{F})^{\scriptscriptstyle\wedge}_{p} \to TC(\mathcal{O}_{F})^{\wedge}_{p} after taking a suitably connective cover. As an application, we identify the homotopy type at odd primes of the homotopy fiber of the cyclotomic trace for the sphere spectrum in terms of the algebraic K-theory of \mathbb{Z}.
