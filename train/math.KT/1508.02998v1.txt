In this note we extend the classical result by G. G. Kasparov that the Kasparov groups KK_1(A,B) can be identified with the extension groups \mbox{Ext}(A,B) to the inverse semigroup equivariant setting. More precisely, we show that KK_G^1(A,B) \cong \mbox{Ext}_G(A \otimes {\cal K}_G,B \otimes {\cal K}_G) for every countable, E-continuous inverse semigroup G. For locally compact second countable groups G this was proved by K. Thomsen, and technically this note presents an adaption of his proof.
