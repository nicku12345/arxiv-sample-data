Using the machinery of weak fibration categories due to Schlank and the first author, we construct a convenient model structure on the pro-category of separable C^*-algebras \mathrm{Pro}(\mathtt{SC^*}). The opposite of this model category models the \infty-category of pointed noncommutative spaces \mathtt{N}\mathcal{S_*} defined by the third author. Our model structure on \mathrm{Pro}(\mathtt{SC^*}) extends the well-known category of fibrant objects structure on \mathtt{SC^*}. We show that the pro-category \mathrm{Pro}(\mathtt{SC^*}) also contains, as a full coreflective subcategory, the category of pro-C^*-algebras that are cofiltered limits of separable C^*-algebras. By stabilizing our model category we produce a general model categorical formalism for triangulated and bivariant homology theories of C^*-algebras (or, more generally, that of pointed noncommutative spaces), whose stable \infty-categorical counterparts were constructed earlier by the third author. Finally, we use our model structure to develop a bivariant \mathrm{K}-theory for all projective systems of separable C^*-algebras generalizing the construction of Bonkat and show that our theory naturally agrees with that of Bonkat under some reasonable assumptions.
