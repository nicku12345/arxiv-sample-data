The main goal of this paper is to prove the following: for a triangulated category  \underline{C} and E\subset \operatorname{Obj} \underline{C} there exists a cohomological functor F (with values in some abelian category) such that E is its set of zeros if (and only if) E is closed with respect to retracts and extensions (so, we obtain a certain Nullstellensatz for functors of this type). Moreover, for  \underline{C} being an R-linear category (where R is a commutative ring) this is also equivalent to the existence of an R-linear F: \underline{C}^{op}\to R-\operatorname{mod} satisfying this property.   As a corollary, we prove that an object Y belongs to the corresponding "envelope" of some D\subset \operatorname{Obj} \underline{C} whenever the same is true for the images of Y and D in all the categories  \underline{C}_p obtained from  \underline{C} by means of "localizing the coefficients" at maximal ideals p\triangleleft R. Moreover, to prove our theorem we develop certain new methods for relating triangulated categories to their (non-full) countable triangulated subcategories.   The results of this paper can be applied to the study of weight structures and of triangulated categories of motives.
