Extending earlier work on supertropical adjoints and applying symmetrization, we provide a symmetric supertropical version \operatorname {SLS}_n of the special linear group, which we partition into submonoids, based on "quasi-identity" matrices, and we display maximal sub-semigroups of \operatorname {SLS}_n. We also study the monoid generated by \operatorname {SLS}_n. Several illustrative examples are given of unexpected behavior. We describe the action of elementary matrices on \operatorname {SLS}_n, which enables one to connect different matrices in \operatorname {SLS}_n, but in a weaker sense than the classical situation.
