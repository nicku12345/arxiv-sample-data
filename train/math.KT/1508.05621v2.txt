We formulate analogues, for Noetherian local \mathbb Q-algebras which are not necessarily regular, of the injectivity part of Gersten's conjecture in algebraic K-theory, and prove them in various cases. Our results suggest that the algebraic K-theory of such a ring should be detected by combining the algebraic K-theory of both its regular locus and the infinitesimal thickenings of its singular locus.
