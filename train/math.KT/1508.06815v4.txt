We investigate the homological ideal \mathfrak{J}_G^H, the kernel of the restriction functors in compact Lie group equivariant Kasparov categories. Applying the relative homological algebra developed by Meyer and Nest, we relate the Atiyah-Segal completion theorem with the comparison of \mathfrak{J}_G^H with the augmentation ideal of the representation ring.   In relation to it, we study on the Atiyah-Segal completion theorem for groupoid equivariant \mathrm{KK}-theory, McClure's restriction map theorem, permanence property of the Baum-Connes conjecture under extensions of groups and a class of \mathfrak{J}_G-injective objects coming from \mathrm{C}^*-dynamical systems, continuous Rokhlin property.
