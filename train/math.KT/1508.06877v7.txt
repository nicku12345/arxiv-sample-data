In this article, we generalize Richardson's example of a rigid Lie algebra with non-trivial H^2 to the Leibniz setting. Namely, we consider the hemisemidirect product {\mathfrak h} of a semidirect product Lie algebra M_k\rtimes{\mathfrak g} of a simple Lie algebra {\mathfrak g} with some non-trivial irreducible {\mathfrak g}-module M_k with a non-trivial irreducible {\mathfrak g}-module I_l. Then for {\mathfrak g}={\mathfrak s}{\mathfrak l}_2({\mathbb C}), we take M_k (resp. I_l) to be the standard irreducible {\mathfrak s}{\mathfrak l}_2({\mathbb C})-module of dimension k+1 (resp. l+1). Assume \frac{k}{2}>5 is an odd integer and l>2 is odd, then we show that the Leibniz algebra {\mathfrak h} is geometrically rigid and has non-trivial HL^2 with adjoint coefficients. We close the article with an appendix where we record further results on the question whether H^2({\mathfrak g},{\mathfrak g})=0 implies HL^2({\mathfrak g},{\mathfrak g})=0.
