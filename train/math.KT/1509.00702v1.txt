We define for every dendroidal set X a chain complex and show that this assignment determines a left Quillen functor. Then we define the homology groups H_n(X) as the homology groups of this chain complex. This generalizes the homology of simplicial sets. Our main result is that the homology of X is isomorphic to the homology of the associated spectrum K(X) as discussed in earlier work of the authors. Since these homology groups are sometimes computable we can identify some spectra K(X) which we could not identify before.
