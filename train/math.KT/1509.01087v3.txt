Consider a complete discrete valuation ring \mathcal{O} with quotient field F and finite residue field. Then the inclusion map \mathcal{O} \hookrightarrow F induces a map \hat{\mathrm{K}}^\mathrm{M}_*\mathcal{O} \to \hat{\mathrm{K}}^\mathrm{M}_*F on improved Milnor K-theory. We show that this map is an isomorphism in degrees bigger or equal to 3. This implies the Gersten conjecture for improved Milnor K-theory. This result is new in the p-adic case.
