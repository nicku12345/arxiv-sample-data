Let (R, \mathfrak{m}, k) denote a local Cohen-Macaulay ring such that the category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules \textbf{mcm}\ R contains an n-cluster tilting object L. In this paper, we compute G_1(R) := K_1(\textbf{mod}\ R) explicitly as a direct sum of a free group and a specified quotient of \text{aut}_R(L)_{\text{ab}} when R is a k-algebra and k is algebraically closed (and \text{char}(k)\neq 2). Moreover, we give some explicit computations of \text{aut}_R(L)_{\text{ab}} and G_1(R) for certain hypersurface singularities.
