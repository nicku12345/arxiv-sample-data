Let {\mathcal E} be a Frobenius category, {\mathcal P} its subcategory of projective objects and F:{\mathcal E} \to {\mathcal E} an exact automorphism. We prove that there is a fully faithful functor from the orbit category {\mathcal E}/F into \operatorname{gpr}({\mathcal P}/F), the category of finitely-generated Gorenstein-projective modules over {\mathcal P}/F. We give sufficient conditions to ensure that the essential image of {\mathcal E}/F is an extension-closed subcategory of \operatorname{gpr}({\mathcal P}/F). If {\mathcal E} is in addition Krull-Schmidt, we give sufficient conditions to ensure that the completed orbit category {\mathcal E} \ \widehat{\!\! /} F is a Krull-Schmidt Frobenius category. Finally, we apply our results on completed orbit categories to the context of Nakajima categories associated to Dynkin quivers and sketch applications to cluster algebras.
