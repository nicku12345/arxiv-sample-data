We prove that the degree r(2p-3) cohomology of any (untwisted) finite group of Lie type over \mathbb{F}_{p^r}, with coefficients in characteristic p, is nonzero as long as its Coxeter number is at most p. We do this by providing a simple explicit construction of a nonzero element. Furthermore, for the groups GL_n\mathbb{F}_{p^r}, when p=2 or r=1, we calculate the cohomology in degree r(2p-3), for all n.
