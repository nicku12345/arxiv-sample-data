We extend the scope of Balmer's tensor triangular Chow groups to compactly generated triangulated categories \mathcal{K} that only admit an action by a compactly-rigidly generated tensor triangulated category \mathcal{T} as opposed to having a compatible monoidal structure themselves. The additional flexibility allows us to recover the Chow groups of a possibly singular algebraic variety X from the homotopy category of quasi-coherent injective sheaves on X. We are also able to construct localization sequences associated to restricting to an open subset of \mathrm{Spc}(\mathcal{T}^c), the Balmer spectrum of the subcategory of compact objects \mathcal{T}^c \subset \mathcal{T}. This should be viewed in analogy to the exact sequences for the cycle and Chow groups of an algebraic variety associated to the restriction to an open subset.
