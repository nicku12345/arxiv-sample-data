We study criteria for a ring - or more generally, for a small category - to be Gorenstein and for a module over it to be of finite projective dimension. The goal is to unify the universal coefficient theorems found in the literature and to develop a machinery for proving new ones.   Among the universal coefficient theorems covered by our methods we find, besides all the classic examples, several exotic examples arising from the KK-theory of C*-algebras and also Neeman's Brown-Adams representability theorem for compactly generated categories.
