The main objective of this paper is to connect the theory of Gr\"obner bases to concepts of homological algebra. Gr\"obner bases, an important tool in algebraic system and in linear algebra help us to understand the structure of an algebra presented by its generators and relations by constructing a basis of its set of relations. In this paper we mainly deal with graded augmented algebras. Given a graded augmented algebra with its generators and relations, it is possible to construct a free resolution from its Gr\"obner basis, known as Anick's resolution. Though rarely minimal, this resolution helps us to understand combinatorial properties of the algebra. The notion of a K_2 algebra was recently introduced by Cassidy and Shelton as a generalization of the notion of a Koszul algebra. We compute the Anick's resolution of K_2 algebra which shows several nice combinatorial properties. Later we compute some derived functors from Anick's resolution and outline how to construct A_\infty-algebra structure on Ext-algebra from a minimal graded projective resolution in which we can use Anick's resolution as a tool. Thus this paper provides an unique platform to connect concepts of linear algebra with homological algebra and homotopical algebra with the help of Gr\"obner bases.
