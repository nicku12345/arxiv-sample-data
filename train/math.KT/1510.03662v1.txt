We investigate base change and automorphic induction \mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R} at the level of K-theory for the general linear group GL_n(\mathbb{R}). In the course of this study, we compute in detail the C*-algebra K-theory of this disconnected group. We investigate the interaction of base change with the Baum-Connes correspondence for GL_n(\mathbb{R}) and GL_n(\mathbb{C}). This article is the archimedean companion of our previous article in the Journal of Noncommutative Geometry.
