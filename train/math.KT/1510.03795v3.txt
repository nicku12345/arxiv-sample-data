We prove that the cyclic homology of a saturated A_\infty category admits the structure of a `polarized variation of Hodge structures', building heavily on the work of many authors: the main point of the paper is to present complete proofs, and also explicit formulae for all of the relevant structures. This forms part of a project of Ganatra, Perutz and the author, to prove that homological mirror symmetry implies enumerative mirror symmetry.
