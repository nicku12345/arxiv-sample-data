Pursuing conjectures of John Roe, we use the stable Higson corona of foliated cones to construct a new K-theory model for the leaf space of a foliation. This new K-theory model is -- in contrast to Alain Connes' K-theory model -- a ring. We show that Connes' K-theory model is a module over this ring and develop an interpretation of the module multiplication in terms of indices of twisted longitudinally elliptic operators.
