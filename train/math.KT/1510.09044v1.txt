This text is based on lectures given by authors in summer 2015. It contains an introduction to the theory of limits over the category of presentations, with examples of different well-known functors like homology or derived functors of non-additive functors in a form of derived limits. The theory of so-called {\bf fr}-codes also is developed. This is a method how different functors from the category of groups to the category of abelian groups, such as group homology, tensor products of abelianization, can be coded as sentences in the alphabet with two symbols {\bf f} and {\bf r}.
