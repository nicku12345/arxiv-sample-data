We introduce higher-order support varieties for pairs of modules over a commutative local complete intersection ring, and give a complete description of which varieties occur as such support varieties. In the context of a group algebra of a finite elementary abelian group, we also prove a higher-order Avrunin-Scott-type theorem, linking higher-order support varieties and higher-order rank varieties for pairs of modules.
