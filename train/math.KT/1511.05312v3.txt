In this paper, we study a generalization of twisted (groupoid) equivariant \mathrm{K}-theory in the sense of Freed-Moore for \mathbb{Z}_2-graded \mathrm{C}^*-algebras. It is defined by using Fredholm operators on Hilbert modules with twisted representations. We compare it with another description using odd symmetries, which is a generalization of van Daele's \mathrm{K}-theory for \mathbb{Z}_2-graded Banach algebras. In particular, we obtain a simple presentation of the twisted equivariant \mathrm{K}-group when the \mathrm{C}^*-algebra is trivially graded. It is applied for the bulk-edge correspondence of topological insulators with CT-type symmetries.
