We investigate the properties of relative analogues of admissible Ind, Pro, and elementary Tate objects for pairs of exact categories, and give criteria for those categories to be abelian. A relative index map is introduced, and as an application we deduce a description for boundary morphisms in the K-theory of coherent sheaves on Noetherian schemes.
