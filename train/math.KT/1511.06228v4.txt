Let G be a compact connected Lie group and K a connected Lie subgroup. In this paper, we collect an assortment of results on equivariant formality of the isotropy action of K on G/K and thus improving those from previous work. We show that if the isotropy action of K on G/K is equivariantly formal, then G/K is formal in the sense of rational homotopy theory. This enables us to strengthen Shiga-Takahashi's theorem to a cohomological characterization of equivariant formality of isotropy actions. Using an analogue of equivariant formality in K-theory introduced by the second author and shown to be equivalent to equivariant formality in the usual sense, we provide a representation theoretic characterization of equivariant formality of isotropy actions, and give a new, uniform proof of equivariant formality for previously known examples of homogeneous spaces.
