Let G be a compact and connected Lie group and PU(\mathcal H) be the group of projective unitary operators on a separable Hilbert space \mathcal H endowed with the strong operator topology. We study the space hom_{st}(G, PU(\mathcal H)) of continuous homomorphisms from G to PU(\mathcal H) which are stable, namely the homomorphisms whose induced representation contains each irreducible representation an infinitely number of times. We show that the connected components of hom_{st}(G, PU(\mathcal H)) are parametrized by the isomorphism classes of S^1-central extensions of G, and that each connected component has the group hom(G,S^1) for fundamental group and trivial higher homotopy groups. We study the conjugation map PU(\mathcal H) \to hom_{st}(G, PU(\mathcal H)), F \mapsto F\alpha F^{-1}, we show that it has no local cross sections and we prove that for a map B \to hom_{st}(G, PU(\mathcal H)) with B paracompact of finite covering dimension, local lifts to PU(\mathcal H) do exist.
