We construct and study a triangulated category of motives with modulus \mathbf{MDM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}} over a field k that extends Voevodsky's category \mathbf{DM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}} in such a way as to encompass non-homotopy invariant phenomena. In a similar way as \mathbf{DM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}} is constructed out of smooth k-varieties, \mathbf{MDM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}} is constructed out of \emph{proper modulus pairs}, that is, pairs of a proper k-variety X and an effective divisor D on X such that X \setminus |D| is smooth. To a modulus pair (X, D) we associate its motive M(X, D) \in \mathbf{MDM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}}. In some cases the Hom group in \mathbf{MDM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}} between the motives of two modulus pairs can be described in terms of Bloch's higher Chow groups.
