We discuss some results and conjectures related to the existence of the non-nilpotent motivic maps \eta and \mu_9. To this purpose, we establish a theory of power operations for motivic H_{\infty}-spectra. Using this, we show that the naive motivic analogue of the unstable Kahn-Priddy theorem fails. Over the complex numbers, we show that the motivic T-spectrum S[\eta^{-1},\mu_9^{-1}] is closely related to higher Witt groups, where S is the motivic sphere spectrum and \eta, \sigma and \mu_9 are explicit elements in \pi_{**}(S).
