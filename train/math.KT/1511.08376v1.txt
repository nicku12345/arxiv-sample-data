We prove a non-linear version of a theorem of Grayson which is an analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebraic K-theory and identify the K-theory of the endomorphism category over a space X in terms of reduced K-theory of a certain localisation of the category of \NN-spaces over X. In particular we generalise the result of Klein and Williams describing the nil-terms of A-theory in terms of K-theory of nilpotent endomorphisms.
