If R is a commutative ring, I an ideal of R and v, w \in Um_{2n}(R, I) then we show that v, w are in the same orbit of elementary action if and only if they are in the same orbit of elementary symplectic action. We also show that if A is a non-singular affine algebra of dimension d over an algebraically closed field k such that d! A = A, d \equiv 2 \pmod 4 and I an ideal of A, then Um_d(A, I) = e_1{Sp}_d(A, I). As a consequence it is proved that if A is a non-singular affine algebra of dimension d over an algebraically closed field k such that (d + 1)!A = A, d \equiv 1 \pmod 4 and I a principal ideal then Sp_{d-1}(A, I) \cap {ESp}_{d+1}(A, I) = {ESp}_{d -1}(A, I). We give an example to show that the above result does not hold true for an affine algebra over a C_2 field and also show by an example that the above stability estimate is optimal.
