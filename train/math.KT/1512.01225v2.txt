We call a group FJ if it satisfies the K- and L-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture with coefficients in \mathbb Z. We show that if G is FJ, then the simple Borel conjecture (in dimensions \ge 5) holds for every group of the form G\rtimes\mathbb Z. If in addition Wh(G\times \mathbb Z)=0, which is true for all known torsion free FJ groups, then the bordism Borel conjecture (in dimensions n\ge 5) holds for G\rtimes\mathbb Z. One of the key ingredients in proving these rigidity results is another main result, which says that if a torsion free group G satisfies the L-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture with coefficients in \mathbb Z, then any semi-direct product G\rtimes\mathbb Z also satisfies the L-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture with coefficients in \mathbb Z. Our result is indeed more general and implies the L-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture with coefficients in additive categories is closed under extensions of torsion free groups. This enables us to extend the class of groups which satisfy the Novikov conjecture.
