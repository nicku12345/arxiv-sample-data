For a symplectic manifold satisfying some topological condition,we define a special class of modules over the deformation quantization algebra. For any two such modules we construct an infinity local system of morphisms. We construct such special module starting from a Lagrangian submanifold satisfying a topological condition. We compare the result to Morse theory, to the microlocal category of sheaves recently defined by Tamarkin, and to the Fukaya category of the two-dimensional torus. Several appendices explain the motivations that come from asymptotic analysis of pseudo-differential operators and distributions.
