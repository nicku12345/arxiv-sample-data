The aim of this note is to introduce the notion of a \operatorname{D}-Lie algebra and to prove some elementary properties of \operatorname{D}-Lie algebras, the category of \operatorname{D}-Lie algebras, the category of modules on a \operatorname{D}-Lie algebra and extensions of \operatorname{D}-Lie algebras. A \operatorname{D}-Lie algebra is an A/k-Lie-Rinehart algebra equipped with an A\otimes_k A-module structure and a canonical central element D and a compatibility property between the k-Lie algebra structure and the A\otimes_k A-module structure. Several authors have studied non-abelian extensions of Lie algebras, super Lie algebras, Lie algebroids and holomorphic Lie algebroids and we give in this note an explicit constructions of all non-abelian extensions a \operatorname{D}-Lie algebra \tilde{L} by an A-Lie algebra (W,[,]) where \tilde{L} is projective as left A-module and W is an A\otimes_k A-module with IW=0 for I the kernel of the multiplication map. As a corollary we get an explicit construction of all non-abelian extensions of an A/k-Lie-Rinehart algebra (L,\alpha) by an A-Lie algebra (W,[,]) where L is projective as left A-module.
