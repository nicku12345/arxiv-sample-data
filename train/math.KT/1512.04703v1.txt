We describe the mod p^r pro K-groups \{K_n(A/I^s)/p^r\}_s of a regular local \mathbb F_p-algebra A modulo powers of a suitable ideal I, in terms of logarithmic Hodge-Witt groups, by proving pro analogues of the theorems of Geisser-Levine and Bloch-Kato-Gabber. This is achieved by combining the pro Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem in topological cyclic homology with the development of the theory of de Rham-Witt complexes and logarithmic Hodge-Witt sheaves on formal schemes in characteristic p.   Applications include the following: the infinitesimal part of the weak Lefschetz conjecture for Chow groups; a p-adic version of Kato-Saito's conjecture that their Zariski and Nisnevich higher dimensional class groups are isomorphic; continuity results in K-theory; and criteria, in terms of integral or torsion \'etale-motivic cycle classes, for algebraic cycles on formal schemes to admit infinitesimal deformations.   Moreover, in the case n=1, we compare the \'etale cohomology of W_r\Omega^1_\text{log} and the fppf cohomology of \mathbf\mu_{p^r} on a formal scheme, and thus present equivalent conditions for line bundles to deform in terms of their classes in either of these cohomologies.
