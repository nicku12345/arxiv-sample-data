In this paper, we study continuous Rokhlin property of \mathrm{C}^*-dynamical systems using techniques of equivariant \mathrm{KK}-theory and quantum group theory. In particular, we determine the \mathrm{KK}-equivalence class and give a classification of Kirchberg G-algebras when the G is a compact Lie group with Hodgkin condition.
