In an earlier paper the notion of a filtered derived equivalence was introduced, and it was shown that if two K3 surfaces admit such an equivalence then they are isomorphic. In this paper we study more refined aspects of filtered derived equivalences related to the action on the cohomological realizations of the Mukai motive. It is shown that if a filtered derived equivalence between K3 surfaces also preserves ample cones then one can find an isomorphism that induces the same map as the equivalence on the cohomological realizations.
