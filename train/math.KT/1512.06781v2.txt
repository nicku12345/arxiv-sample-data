We exhibit geometric situations, where higher indices of the spinor Dirac operator on a spin manifold N are obstructions to positive scalar curvature on an ambient manifold M that contains N as a submanifold. In the main result of this note, we show that the Rosenberg index of N is an obstruction to positive scalar curvature on M if N \hookrightarrow M \twoheadrightarrow B is a fiber bundle of spin manifolds with B aspherical and \pi_1(B) of finite asymptotic dimension. The proof is based on a new variant of the multi-partitioned manifold index theorem which might be of independent interest. Moreover, we present an analogous statement for codimension one submanifolds. We also discuss some elementary obstructions using the \hat{A}-genus of certain submanifolds.
