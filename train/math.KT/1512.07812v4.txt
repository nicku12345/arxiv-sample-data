We generalise the Atiyah-Segal-Singer fixed point theorem to noncompact manifolds. Using KK-theory, we extend the equivariant index to the noncompact setting, and obtain a fixed point formula for it. The fixed point formula is the explicit cohomological expression from Atiyah-Segal-Singer's result. In the noncompact case, however, we show in examples that this expression yields characters of infinite-dimensional representations. In one example, we realise characters of discrete series representations on the regular elements of a maximal torus, in terms of the index we define. Further results are a fixed point formula for the index pairing between equivariant K-theory and K-homology, and a non-localised expression for the index we use, in terms of deformations of principal symbols. The latter result is one of several links we find to indices of deformed symbols and operators studied by various authors.
