In 'Hochschild (co)homology of exterior algebras' (Han, Xu, 2007), the authors computed the additive and multiplicative structure of H\!H^\ast\!(A;\!A), where A is the n-th exterior algebra over a field. In this paper, we derive all their results using a different method (AMT), as well as calculate the additive structure of H\!H_k\!(A;\!A) and H\!H^k\!(A;\!A) over \mathbb{Z}. We provide concise presentations of algebras H\!H_\ast\!(A;\!A) and H\!H^\ast\!(A;\!A), as well as determine their generators in the Hochschild complex. Lastly, we compute an explicit free resolution (spanned by multisets) of the A^e-module A and describe the homotopy equivalence to its bar resolution.
