In this paper we give a complete description of K-theory groups for Cuntz-Krieger C*-algebras associated to general locally-finite (topologically connected) graphs via Bass-Hashimoto operator. Our result generalizes the one obtained by the second author for the case of graphs with not necessarily finite first Betti numbers. On the basis of purely graph-theoretical method introduced by G. Cornelissen, O. Lorscheid, M. Marcolli and developed further by N.Iyudu, we prove that for the algebra O_E associated to an infinite graph E of the above form holds K_0(O_E)=Z^{\beta(E)} \oplus Z^{\gamma(E)} and K_1(O_E) = Z^{\gamma(E)}, where \beta(E)=\dim H_1(E) and \gamma(E) stands for the cardinality of the valency set of E, defined in the paper.
