We equip the multi-pullback C^*-algebra C(S^5_H) of a noncommutative-deformation of the 5-sphere with a free U(1)-action, and show that its fixed-point subalgebra is isomorphic with the C^*-algebra of the multi-pullback quantum complex projective plane. Our main result is the stable non-triviality of the dual tautological line bundle associated to the action. We prove it by combining Chern-Galois theory with the Milnor connecting homomorphism in K-theory. Using the Mayer-Vietoris six-term exact sequences and the functoriality of the K\"unneth formula, we also compute the K-groups of C(S^5_H).
