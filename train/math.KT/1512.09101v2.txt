We develop a general theory which enables the computation of the Picard group of a symmetric monoidal triangulated category, equipped with a weight structure, in terms of the Picard group of the associated heart. As an application, we compute the Picard group of several categories of motivic nature - mixed Artin motives, mixed Artin-Tate motives, motivic spectra, noncommutative mixed Artin motives, noncommutative mixed motives of central simple algebras, noncommutative mixed motives of separable algebras - as well as the Picard group of the derived categories of symmetric ring spectra.
