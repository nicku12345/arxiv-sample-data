We compare derived categories of the category of strict polynomial functors over a finite field and the category of ordinary endofunctors on the category of vector spaces. We introduce two intermediate categories: the category of \infty--affine strict polynomial functors and the category of spectra of strict polynomial functors. They provide a conceptual framework for compuational theorems of Franjou--Friedlander--Scorichenko--Suslin and clarify the role of inverting Frobenius morphism in comparing rational and discrete cohomology.
