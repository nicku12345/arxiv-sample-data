We study the relationship between several notions of connectedness arising in {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy theory of smooth schemes over a field k: {\mathbb A}^1-connectedness, stable {\mathbb A}^1-connectedness and motivic connectedness, and we discuss the relationship between these notations and rationality properties of algebraic varieties. Motivically connected smooth proper k-varieties are precisely those with universally trivial CH_0. We show that stable {\mathbb A}^1-connectedness coincides with motivic connectedness, under suitable hypotheses on k. Then, we observe that there exist stably {\mathbb A}^1-connected smooth proper varieties over the field of complex numbers that are not {\mathbb A}^1-connected.
