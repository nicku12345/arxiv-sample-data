Keller proved in 1999 that the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on the Hochschild cohomology of an algebra is an invariant of the derived category. In this paper, we adapt his approach to show that the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on the Tate-Hochschild cohomology of an algebra is preserved under singular equivalences of Morita type with level, a notion introduced by the author in previous work.
