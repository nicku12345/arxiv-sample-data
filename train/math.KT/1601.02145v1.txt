Let SL_{2n}, Sp_{2n}, E_6 = G^{sc}(E_6), F_4 = G(F_4) be simply connected split algebraic groups over an arbitrary field F. Algebraic K-theory of affine homogeneous varieties SL_{2n}/Sp_{2n} and E_6/F_4 is computed. Moreover, explicit elements that generate K_*(SL_{2n}/Sp_{2n}) and K_*(E_6/F_4) as K_*(F)-algebras are provided. For some twisted forms of these varieties K-theory is also computed.
