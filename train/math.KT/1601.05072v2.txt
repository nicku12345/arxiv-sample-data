Let Q be a commutative, Noetherian ring and Z \subseteq \operatorname{Spec}(Q) a closed subset. Define K_0^Z(Q) to be the Grothendieck group of those bounded complexes of finitely generated projective Q-modules that have homology supported on Z. We develop "cyclic" Adams operations on K_0^Z(Q) and we prove these operations satisfy the four axioms used by Gillet and Soul\'e in their paper "Intersection Theory Using Adams Operations". From this we recover a shorter proof of Serre's Vanishing Conjecture. We also show our cyclic Adams operations agree with the Adams operations defined by Gillet and Soul\'e in certain cases.
