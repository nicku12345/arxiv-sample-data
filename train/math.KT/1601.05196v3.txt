We describe the derived Picard group of an Azumaya algebra A on an affine scheme X in terms of global sections of the constant sheaf of integers on X, the Picard group of X, and the stabilizer of the Brauer class of A under the action of Aut(X). In particular, we find that the derived Picard group of an Azumaya algebra is generally not isomorphic to that of the underlying scheme. In the case of the trivial Azumaya algebra, our result refines Yekutieli's description of the derived Picard group of a commutative algebra. We also get, as a corollary, an alternate proof of a result of Antieau which relates derived equivalences to Brauer equivalences for affine Azumaya algebras. The example of a Weyl algebra in finite characteristic is examined in some detail.
