For a nontrivial finite Galois extension L/k (where the characteristic of k is different from 2) with Galois group G, we prove that the Dress map h_{L/k}: A(G) \to GW(k) is injective if and only if L=k(\sqrt{\alpha}) where \alpha is not a sum of squares in k^\times. Furthermore, we prove that h_{L/k} is surjective if and only if k is quadratically closed in L. As a consequence, we give strong necessary conditions for faithfulness of the Heller-Ormsby functor c_{L/k}^* : \text{SH}_G\to \text{SH}_k, as well as strong necessary conditions for fullness of c_{L/k}^*.
