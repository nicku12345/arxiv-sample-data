This is half an overview article since what we describe here is essentially known. We describe KK-theory by generators and relations in a formal sum of formal products of *-homomorphisms and some synthetical morphisms. What comes out is a category. The Kasparov product is then just the composition of morphisms. This description may be interesting to anyone who wants a quick and elementary definition of KK-theory. The description could also be used for other categories of algebras than C^*-algebras endowed with group actions, for example, C^*-algebras equipped with an action by a semigroup, a category et cetera.
