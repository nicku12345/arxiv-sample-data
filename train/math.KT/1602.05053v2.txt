Considering a (co)homology theory \mathbb{T} on a base category \mathcal{C} as a fragment of a first-order logical theory we here construct an abelian category \mathcal{A}[\mathbb{T}] which is universal with respect to models of \mathbb{T} in abelian categories. Under mild conditions on the base category \mathcal{C}, e.g. for the category of algebraic schemes, we get a functor from \mathcal{C} to {\rm Ch}({\rm Ind}(\mathcal{A}[\mathbb{T}])) the category of chain complexes of ind-objects of \mathcal{A}[\mathbb{T}]. This functor lifts Nori's motivic functor for algebraic schemes defined over a subfield of the complex numbers. Furthermore, we construct a triangulated functor from D({\rm Ind}(\mathcal{A}[\mathbb{T}])) to Voevodsky's motivic complexes.
