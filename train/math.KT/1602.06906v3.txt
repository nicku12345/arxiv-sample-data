Let Wh^w(G) be the K_1-group of square matrices over the integral group ring ZG which are not necessarily invertible but induce weak isomorphisms after passing to Hilbert space completions. Let D(G) be the division closure of ZG in the algebra U(G) of operators affiliated to the group von Neumann algebra. Let C be the smallest class of groups which contains all free groups and is closed under directed unions and extensions with elementary amenable quotients. Let G be a torsionfree group which belongs to C. Then we prove that Wh^w(G) is isomorphic to K_1(D(G)). Furthermore we show that D(G) is a skew field and henc K_1(\D(G)) is the abelianization of the multiplicative group of units in D(G).
