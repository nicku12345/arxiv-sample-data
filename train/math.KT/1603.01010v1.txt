WeintroducethenotionofderivedformalnoncommutativeZariski immersion for differential graded algebra with examples from topology. We il- lustrate the importance of such notion by reformulating the Friedlander-Milnor conjecture in terms of formal noncommutative Zariski immersions. This paper is based on the language developed by Dwyer, Greenless and Iyendar.
