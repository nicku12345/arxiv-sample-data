We present a description of the equivariant K-theory of a smooth projective spherical variety. This provides an integral K-theory version of Brion's calculation of equivariant Chow-cohomology of such varieties. We consider the equivariant K-theory of wonderful compactifications of minimal rank symmetric varieties. We obtain a formula for their structure constants in terms of certain lower dimensional Schubert classes. This generalizes results of Uma on equivariant compactifications of adjoint groups.
