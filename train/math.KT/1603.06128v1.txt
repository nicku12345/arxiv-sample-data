We introduce and study a Serre functor in the category {\cal P}_d of strict polynomial functors over a field of positive characteristic. By using it we obtain the Poincar\'e duality formula for Ext--groups from [C3] in elementary way. We also show that the derived category of the category of affine strct polynomial functors in some cases carries the structure of Calabi-Yau category.
