We prove that, for smooth quasi-projective varieties over a field, the K-theory K(X) of vector bundles is the universal cohomology theory where c_1(L\otimes \bar L)=c_1(L)+c_1(\bar L)-c_1(L)c_1(\bar L). Then, we show that Grothendieck's Riemann-Roch theorem is a direct consequence of this universal property, as well as the universal property of the graded K-theory GK^\bullet (X)\otimes \mathbb{Q}.
