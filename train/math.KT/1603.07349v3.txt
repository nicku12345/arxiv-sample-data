We prove that the covolume of any quasi-arithmetic hyperbolic lattice (a notion that generalizes the definition of arithmetic subgroups) is a rational multiple of the covolume of an arithmetic subgroup. As a corollary, we obtain a good description for the shape of the volumes of most of the known hyperbolic n-manifolds with n>3.
