In this paper we prove that the intersections of the levels of the dimension filtration on Voevodsky's motivic complexes over a field k with the levels of the slice one are "as small as possible", i.e., that Obj d_{\le m}DM^{eff}_{-,R} \cap Obj DM^{eff}_{-,R} (i)=Obj d_{\le m-i} DM^{eff}_{-,R} (i) (for m,i\ge 0 and R being any coefficient ring in which the exponential characteristic of k invertible). This statement is applied to prove that a conjecture of J. Ayoub is equivalent to a certain orthogonality assumption. We also establish a vast generalization of our intersection result to relative motivic categories (that are required to fulfil a certain list of "axioms"). In the process we prove several new properties of relative motives and of the so-called Chow weight structures for them.
