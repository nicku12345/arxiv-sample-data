We consider the question whether an orientable 5-manifold can be equipped with a rank two distribution of Cartan type and what 2-plane bundles can be realized. We obtain a complete answer for open manifolds. In the closed case, we settle the topological part of this problem and present partial results concerning its geometric aspects and new examples.
