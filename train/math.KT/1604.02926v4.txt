We study 2-representations, i.e., actions of 2-groups on 2-vector spaces. Our main focus is character theory for 2-representations. To this end we employ the technique of extended Burnside rings. Our main theorem is that the Ganter-Kapranov 2-character is a particular mark homomorphism of the Burnside ring. As an application we give a new proof of Osorno formula for the Ganter-Kapranov 2-character of a finite group.
