For any perfect fibration E \rightarrow B, there is a "free loop transfer map" LB_+ \rightarrow LE_+, defined using topological Hochschild homology. We prove that this transfer is compatible with the Becker-Gottlieb transfer, allowing us to extend a result of Dorabia\l{}a and Johnson on the transfer map in Waldhausen's A-theory. In the case where E \rightarrow B is a smooth fiber bundle, we also give a concrete geometric model for the free loop transfer in terms of Pontryagin-Thom collapse maps. We recover the previously known computations of the free loop transfer due to Schlichtkrull, and make a few new computations as well.
