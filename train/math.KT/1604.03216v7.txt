This paper is the continuation of the paper arXiv:1509.06950, which is Part I under the same title. In this paper, we prove a generalized Cauchy formula for the integrals of logarithmic forms on products of projective lines, and give an application to the construction of Hodge realization of mixed Tate motives.
