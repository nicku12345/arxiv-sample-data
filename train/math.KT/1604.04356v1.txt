The moving lemma of Suslin states that a cycle on X\times \mathbb{A} ^n meeting all faces properly can be moved so that it becomes equidimensional over \mathbb{A}^n. This leads to an isomorphism of motivic Borel-Moore homology and higher Chow groups.   In this short paper we formulate and prove a variant of this. It leads to an isomorphism of Suslin homology with modulus and higher Chow groups with modulus, in an appropriate pro setting.
