We show that certain isomorphisms of (twisted) KR-groups that underlie T-dualities of torus orientifold string theories have purely algebraic analogues in terms of algebraic K-theory of real varieties and equivalences of derived categories of (twisted) coherent sheaves. The most interesting conclusion is a kind of Mukai duality in which the "dual abelian variety" to a smooth projective genus-1 curve over R with no real points is (mildly) noncommutative.
