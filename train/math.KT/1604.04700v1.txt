In this paper, we calculate the differential d^1 of the rank spectral sequence. We generalize Quillen's spectral sequence from Dedekind domain to general integral Noetherian ring A by considering the Q-construction Q^{tf}(A) of the category of finitely generated torsion-free modules. In particular, by resolution theorem, if A is regular, then Q^{tf}(A) is homotopy equivalent to QP(A) where P(A) is the category of finitely generated projective A-modules. We deduce the differential d^1 by using Tits buildings, Steinberg modules, and modular symbols in the sense of Ash-Rudolph. The spirit of Quillen's categorical homotopy theory will be used intensively throughout this paper.
