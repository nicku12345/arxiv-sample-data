We study the relative Picard group Pic(f) of a map f:X\to S of schemes. If f is faithful affine, it is the relative Cartier divisor group I(f). The relative group K_0(f) has a \gamma-filtration, and Pic(f) is the top quotient for the \gamma-filtration. When f is induced by a ring homomorphism A\to B, we show that the relative "nil" groups NPic(f) and NK_n(f) are continuous W(A)-modules.
