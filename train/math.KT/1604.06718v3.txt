For a C^*-algebra A, it is an important problem to determine the Cuntz semigroup \mathrm{Cu}(A\otimes\mathcal{Z}) in terms of \mathrm{Cu}(A). We approach this problem from the point of view of semigroup tensor products in the category of abstract Cuntz semigroups, by analysing the passage of significant properties from \mathrm{Cu}(A) to \mathrm{Cu}(A)\otimes_\mathrm{Cu}\mathrm{Cu}(\mathcal{Z}). We describe the effect of the natural map \mathrm{Cu}(A)\to\mathrm{Cu}(A)\otimes_\mathrm{Cu}\mathrm{Cu}(\mathcal{Z}) in the order of \mathrm{Cu}(A), and show that, if A has real rank zero and no elementary subquotients, \mathrm{Cu}(A)\otimes_\mathrm{Cu}\mathrm{Cu}(\mathcal{Z}) enjoys the corresponding property of having a dense set of (equivalence classes of) projections. In the simple, nonelementary, real rank zero and stable rank one situation, our investigations lead us to identify almost unperforation for projections with the fact that tensoring with \mathcal{Z} is inert at the level of the Cuntz semigroup.
