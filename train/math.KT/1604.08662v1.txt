Recently, Rizzardo and Van den Bergh constructed an example of a triangulated functor between the derived categories of coherent sheaves on smooth projective varieties over a field k of characteristic 0 which is not of the Fourier-Mukai type. The purpose of this note is to show that if char \, k =p then there are very simple examples of such functors. Namely, for a smooth projective Y over \mathbb Z_p with the special fiber i: X\hookrightarrow Y, we consider the functor L i^* \circ i_*: D^b(X) \to D^b(X) from the derived categories of coherent sheaves on X to itself. We show that if Y is a flag variety which is not isomorphic to \mathbb P^1 then L i^* \circ i_* is not of the Fourier-Mukai type. Note that by a theorem of Toen (\cite{t}, Theorem 8.15) the latter assertion is equivalent to saying that L i^* \circ i_* does not admit a lifting to a \mathbb F_p-linear DG quasi-functor D^b_{dg}(X) \to D^b_{dg}(X), where D^b_{dg}(X) is a (unique) DG enhancement of D^b(X). However, essentially by definition, L i^* \circ i_* lifts to a \mathbb Z_p-linear DG quasi-functor.
