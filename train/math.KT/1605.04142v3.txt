Stratifolds are considered from a categorical point of view. We show among others that the category of stratifolds fully faithfully embeds into the category of {\mathbb R}-algebras as does the category of smooth manifolds. We prove that a variant of the Serre-Swan theorem holds for stratifolds. In particular, the category of vector bundles over a stratifold is shown to be equivalent to the category of vector bundles over an associated affine scheme although the latter is in general larger than the stratifold itself.
