We prove in a unifying way several equivalent descriptions of Koszul rings, some of which being well known in the literature. Most of them are stated in terms of coring theoretical properties of \Tor_n^A(R,R). As an application of these characterizations we investigate the Koszulity of the incidence rings for finite graded posets. Based on these results, we describe an algorithm to produce new classes of Koszul posets (i.e. graded posets whose incidence rings are Koszul). Specific examples of Koszul posets are included.
