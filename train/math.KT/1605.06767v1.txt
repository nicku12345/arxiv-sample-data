We compute the Hochschild cohomology of the reduced incidence algebras such as the algebra of formal power series, the algebra of exponential power series, the algebra of Eulerian power series, and the algebra of formal Dirichlet series. We achieve the result by carrying out the computation on the coalgebra {\rm Cotor}-groups of their pre-dual coalgebras. Using the same coalgebraic machinery, we further identify the Hochschild cohomology groups of an incidence algebra associated to a quiver with the {\rm Ext}-groups of the incidence algebra associated to a suspension of the quiver.
