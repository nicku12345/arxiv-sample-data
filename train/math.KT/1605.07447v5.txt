Let \operatorname{CDG}_{cont} be the category whose objects are pairs (A,\bar{\mathfrak{a}}), where A is a commutative DG-algebra and \bar{\mathfrak{a}}\subseteq \mathrm{H}^0(A) is a finitely generated ideal, and whose morphisms f:(A,\bar{\mathfrak{a}}) \to (B,\bar{\mathfrak{b}}) are morphisms of DG-algebras A \to B, such that (\mathrm{H}^0(f)(\bar{\mathfrak{a}})) \subseteq \bar{\mathfrak{b}}. Letting \mathrm{Ho}(\operatorname{CDG}_{cont}) be its homotopy category, obtained by inverting adic quasi-isomorphisms, we construct a functor \mathrm{L}\Lambda:\mathrm{Ho}(\operatorname{CDG}_{cont}) \to \mathrm{Ho}(\operatorname{CDG}_{cont}) which takes a pair (A,\bar{\mathfrak{a}}) into its non-abelian derived \bar{\mathfrak{a}}-adic completion. We show that this operation has, in a derived sense, the usual properties of adic completion of commutative rings, and that if A = \mathrm{H}^0(A) is an ordinary noetherian ring, this operation coincides with ordinary adic completion. As an application, following a question of Buchweitz and Flenner, we show that if \Bbbk is a commutative ring, and A is a commutative \Bbbk-algebra which is \mathfrak{a}-adically complete with respect to a finitely generated ideal \mathfrak{a}\subseteq A, then the derived Hochschild cohomology modules \operatorname{Ext}^n_{A\otimes^{\mathrm{L}}_{\Bbbk} A} (A,A) and the derived complete Hochschild cohomology modules \operatorname{Ext}^n_{A\widehat{\otimes}^{\mathrm{L}}_{\Bbbk} A} (A,A) coincide, without assuming any finiteness or noetherian conditions on \Bbbk, A or on the map \Bbbk \to A.
