We describe a new method for constructing a weight structure w on a triangulated category C.   For a given C and w it allow us to give a fairly comprehensive (and new) description of those triangulated categories consisting of retracts of objects of C (i.e., of subcategories of the Karoubi envelope of C that contain C; we call them idempotent extensions of C) such that w extends to them. In particular, any bounded above or below w extends to any idempotent extension of C. We also discuss the applications of our results to certain triangulated categories of ("relative") motives.
