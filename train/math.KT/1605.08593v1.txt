For Cuntz-Pimsner algebras of bi-Hilbertian bimodules of finite Jones-Watatani index satisfying some side conditions, we give an explicit isomorphism between the K-theory exact sequences of the mapping cone of the inclusion of the coefficient algebra into a Cuntz-Pimsner algebra, and the Cuntz-Pimsner exact sequence. In the process we extend some results by the second author and collaborators from finite projective bimodules to finite index bimodules, and also clarify some aspects of Pimsner's `extension of scalars' construction.
