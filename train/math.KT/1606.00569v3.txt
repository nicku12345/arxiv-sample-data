Compact matrix quantum groups act naturally on Cuntz algebras. The first author isolated certain conditions under which the fixed point algebras under this action are Kirchberg algebras. Hence they are completely determined by their K-groups. Building on prior work by the second author, we prove that free easy quantum groups satisfy these conditions and we compute the K-groups of their fixed point algebras in a general form. We then turn to examples such as the quantum permutation group S_n^+, the free orthogonal quantum group O_n^+ and the quantum reflection groups H_n^{s+}. Our fixed point-algebra construction provides concrete examples of free actions of free orthogonal easy quantum groups, which are related to Hopf-Galois extensions.
