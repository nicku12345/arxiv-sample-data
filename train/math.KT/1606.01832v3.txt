We continue investigating the interaction between flatness and \mathfrak{a}-adic completion for infinitely generated modules over a commutative ring A. We introduce the concept of \mathfrak{a}-adic flatness, which is weaker than flatness. We prove that \mathfrak{a}-adic flatness is preserved under completion when the ideal \mathfrak{a} is weakly proregular. We also prove that when A is noetherian, \mathfrak{a}-adic flatness coincides with flatness (for complete modules). An example is worked out of a non-noetherian ring A, with a weakly proregular ideal \mathfrak{a}, for which the completion \hat{A} is not flat. We also study \mathfrak{a}-adic systems, and prove that if the ideal \mathfrak{a} is finitely generated, then the limit of any \mathfrak{a}-adic system is a complete module.
