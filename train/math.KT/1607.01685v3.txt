We use Grayson's binary multicomplex presentation of algebraic K-theory to give a new construction of exterior power operations on the higher K-groups of a (quasi-compact) scheme. We show that these operations satisfy the axioms of a \lambda-ring, including the product and composition laws. To prove the composition law we show that the Grothendieck group of the exact category of integral polynomial functors is the universal \lambda-ring on one generator.
