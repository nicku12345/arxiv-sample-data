Ulf Rehmann and Jun Morita, in their 1989 paper "A Matsumoto-type theorem for Kac-Moody groups", gave a presentation of K_2(A,F) for any generalised Cartan matrix A and field F. The purpose of this paper is to use this presentation to compute K_2(A,F) more explicitly in the case when A is hyperbolic. In particular, we shall show that these K_2(A,F) can always be expressed as a product of quotients of K_2(F) and K_2(2,F). Along the way, we shall also prove a similar result in the case when A has an odd entry in each column.
