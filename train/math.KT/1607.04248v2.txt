Given a gerbe L, on the holonomy groupoid \mathcal G of the foliation (M, \mathcal F), whose pull-back to M is torsion, we construct a Connes \Phi-map from the twisted Dupont-Sullivan bicomplex of \mathcal G to the cyclic complex of the L-projective leafwise smoothing operators on (M, \mathcal F). Our construction allows to couple the K-theory analytic indices of L-projective leafwise elliptic operators with the twisted cohomology of B\mathcal G producing scalar higher invariants. Finally by adapting the Bismut-Quillen superconnection approach, we compute these higher twisted indices as integrals over the ambiant manifold of the expected twisted characteristic classes.
