We show that classical Chern classes from higher (p-adic) K-theory to syntomic cohomology extend to logarithmic syntomic cohomology. These Chern classes are compatible -- in a suitable sense -- with addition, products, and \lambda-operations. They are also compatible with the canonical Gysin sequences and, via period maps, with logarithmic \'etale Chern classes. Moreover, they induce logarithmic crystalline Chern classes. This uses as a critical new ingredient the recent comparison of syntomic cohomology with p-adic nearby cycles and p-adic motivic cohomology.
