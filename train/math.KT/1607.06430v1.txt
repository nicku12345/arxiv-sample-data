Associated to each finite dimensional linear representation of a group G, there is a vector bundle over the classifying space BG. We introduce a framework for studying this construction in the context of infinite discrete groups, taking into account the topology of representation spaces.   This involves studying the homotopy group completion of the topological monoid formed by all unitary (or general linear) representations of G, under the monoid operation given by block sum. In order to work effectively with this object, we prove a general result showing that for certain homotopy commutative topological monoids M, the homotopy groups of \Omega BM can be described explicitly in terms of unbased homotopy classes of maps from spheres into M.   Several applications are developed. We relate our constructions to the Novikov conjecture; we show that the space of flat unitary connections over the 3-dimensional Heisenberg manifold has extremely large homotopy groups; and for groups that satisfy Kazhdan's property (T) and admit a finite classifying space, we show that the reduced K-theory class associated to a spherical family of finite dimensional unitary representations is always torsion.
