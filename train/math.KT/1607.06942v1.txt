This paper affirms a conjecture of MacPherson: that the derived category of cellular sheaves is equivalent to the derived category of cellular cosheaves. We give a self-contained treatment of cellular sheaves and cosheaves and note that certain classical dualities give rise to an exchange of sheaves with cosheaves. Following a result of Pitts that states that cosheaves are cocontinuous functors on the category of sheaves, we use the derived equivalence provided here to gain a novel description of compactly supported sheaf cohomology.
