Let M be an orientable topological manifold of dimension m, m greater or equal to 5, with fundamental group \Gamma. Let S(M) be the topological structure set, endowed with the group structure induced by its identification with Ranicki's algebraic structure set. We prove that the (rationalized) rho map \rho_\Gamma: S(M)\rightarrow K_{m+1} (D^*_\Gamma)\otimes \mathbb{Q} is a homomorphism of abelian groups.
