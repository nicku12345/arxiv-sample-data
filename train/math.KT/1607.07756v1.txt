We develop the Hochschild analogue of the coniveau spectral sequence and the Gersten complex. Since Hochschild homology does not have devissage or A^1-invariance, this is a little different from the K-theory story. In fact, the rows of our spectral sequence look a lot like the Cousin complexes in Hartshorne's 1966 "Residues & Duality". Note that these are for coherent cohomology. We prove that they agree by an 'HKR isomorphism with supports'.   Using the close ties of Hochschild homology to Lie algebra homology, this gives residue maps in Lie homology, which we show to agree with those \`a la Tate-Beilinson.
