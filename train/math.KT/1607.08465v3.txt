We consider cycles for graded C^{*,r}-algebras (Real C^{*}-algebras) which are compatible with the *-structure and the real structure. Their characters are cyclic cocycles. We define a Connes type pairing between such characters and elements of the van Daele K-groups of the C^{*,r}-algebra and its real subalgebra. This pairing vanishes on elements of finite order. We define a second type of pairing between characters and K-group elements which is derived from a unital inclusion of C^{*}-algebras. It is potentially non-trivial on elements of order two and torsion valued. Such torsion valued pairings yield topological invariants for insulators. The two-dimensional Kane-Mele and the three-dimensional Fu-Kane-Mele strong invariant are special cases of torsion valued pairings. We compute the pairings for a simple class of periodic models and establish structural results for two dimensional aperiodic models with odd time reversal invariance.
