In this paper, we study the K-theory on higher modules in spectral algebraic geometry. We relate the K-theory of an \infty-category of finitely generated projective modules on certain \mathbb{E}_{\infty}-rings with the K-theory of an ordinary category of finitely generated projective modules on ordinary rings.
