Let F be a field of characteristic different than 2. We establish surjectivity of Balmer's comparison map rho^* from the tensor triangular spectrum of the homotopy category of compact motivic spectra to the homogeneous Zariski spectrum of Milnor-Witt K-theory. We also comment on the tensor triangular geometry of compact cellular motivic spectra, producing in particular novel field spectra in this category. We conclude with a list of questions about the structure of the tensor triangular spectrum of the stable motivic homotopy category.
