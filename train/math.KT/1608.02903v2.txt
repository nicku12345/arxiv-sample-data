We prove the existence of a map of spectra \tau_A \colon kA \to lA between connective topological K-theory and connective algebraic L-theory of a complex C^*-algebra A which is natural in A and compatible with multiplicative structures. We determine its effect on homotopy groups and as a consequence obtain a natural equivalence KA[1/2] \to LA[1/2] of periodic K- and L-theory spectra after inverting 2. We show that this equivalence extends to K- and L-theory of real C^*-algebras. Using this we give a comparison between the real Baum-Connes conjecture and the L-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture. We conclude that these conjectures are equivalent after inverting 2 if and only if a certain completion conjecture in L-theory is true.
