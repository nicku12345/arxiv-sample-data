In this short paper we outline (mostly without proofs) our new approach to the derived category of sheaves of commutative DG rings. The proofs will appear in a subsequent paper.   Among other things, we explain how to form the derived intersection of two closed subschemes inside a given algebraic scheme X, without recourse to simplicial or higher homotopical methods, and without any global assumptions on X.
