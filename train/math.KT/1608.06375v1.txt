In this thesis, we investigate the proof of the Baum-Connes Conjecture with Coefficients for a-T-menable groups. We will mostly and essentially follow the argument employed by N. Higson and G. Kasparov in the paper [Nigel Higson and Gennadi Kasparov. E-theory and KK-theory for groups which act properly and isometrically on Hilbert space. Invent. Math., 144(1):23-74, 2001]. The crucial feature is as follows. One of the most important point of their proof is how to get the Dirac elements (the inverse of the Bott elements) in Equivariant KK-Theory. We prove that the group homomorphism used for the lifting of the Dirac elements is an isomorphism in the case of our interests. Hence, we get a clear and simple understanding of the lifting of the Dirac elements in the Higson-Kasparov Theorem. In the course of our investigation, on the other hand, we point out a problem and give a fixed precise definition for the non-commutative functional calculus which is defined in the paper In the final part, we mention that the C^*-algebra of (real) Hilbert space becomes a G-C^*-algebra naturally even when a group G acts on the Hilbert space by an affine action whose linear part is of the form an isometry times a scalar and prove the infinite dimensional Bott-Periodicity in this case by using Fell's absorption technique.
