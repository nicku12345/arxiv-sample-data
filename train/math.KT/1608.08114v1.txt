This article is the extended notes of my survey talk of Gersten's conjecture given at the workshop "Bousfield classes form a set: a workshop in a memory of Tetsusuke Ohkawa" at Nagoya University in August 2015. In the last section, I give an explanation of my recent work of motivic Gernsten's conjecture.
