Making use of Gruson-Raynaud's technique of "platification par eclatement", Kerz and Strunk proved that the negative homotopy K-theory groups of a Noetherian scheme X of Krull dimension d vanish below -d. In this note, making use of noncommutative algebraic geometry, we improve this result in the case of quotient singularities by proving that the negative homotopy K-theory groups vanish below -1. Furthermore, in the case of cyclic quotient singularities, we provide an explicit "upper bound" for the first negative homotopy K-theory group.
