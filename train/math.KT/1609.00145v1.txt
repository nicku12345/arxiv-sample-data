Given a ring object A in a symmetric monoidal category, we investigate what it means for the extension \mathbb{1}\rightarrow A to be (quasi-)Galois. In particular, we define splitting ring extensions and examine how they occur. Specializing to tensor-triangulated categories, we study how extension-of-scalars along a quasi-Galois ring object affects the Balmer spectrum. We define what it means for a separable ring to have constant degree, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a quasi-Galois closure. Finally, we illustrate the above for separable rings occurring in modular representation theory.
