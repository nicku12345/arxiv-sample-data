Let G denote a countable inverse semigroup. We construct a kind of a Baum--Connes map K(\tilde A \rtimes G) \rightarrow K(A \rtimes G) by a categorial approach via localization of triangulated categories, developed by R. Meyer and R. Nest for groups G. We allow the coefficient algebras A to be in a special class of algebras called fibered G-algebras. This note continues and fixes our preprint "Attempts to define a Baum--Connes map via localization of categories for inverse semigroups".
