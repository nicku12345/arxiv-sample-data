In this paper, we introduce a property of topological dynamical systems that we call finite dynamical complexity. For systems with this property, one can in principle compute the K-theory of the associated crossed product C^*-algebra by splitting it up into simpler pieces and using the methods of controlled K-theory. The main part of the paper illustrates this idea by giving a new proof of the Baum-Connes conjecture for actions with finite dynamical complexity.   We have tried to keep the paper as self-contained as possible: we hope the main part will be accessible to someone with the equivalent of a first course in operator K-theory. In particular, we do not assume prior knowledge of controlled K-theory, and use a new and concrete model for the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients that requires no bivariant K-theory to set up.
