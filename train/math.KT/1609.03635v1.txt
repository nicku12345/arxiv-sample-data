We compare several recent approaches to studying right Bousfield localization and algebras over monads. We prove these approaches are equivalent, and we apply this equivalence to obtain several new results regarding right Bousfield localizations (some classical, some new) for spectra, spaces, equivariant spaces, chain complexes, simplicial abelian groups, and the stable module category. En route, we provide conditions so that right Bousfield localization lifts to categories of algebras, so that right Bousfield localization preserves algebras over monads, and so that right Bousfield localization forms a compactly generated model category.
