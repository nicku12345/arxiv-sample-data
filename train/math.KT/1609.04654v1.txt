In a recent work Malkiewich and Merling proposed a definition of the equivariant K-theory of spaces for spaces equipped with an action of a finite group. We show that the fixed points of this spectrum admit a tom Dieck-type splitting. We also show that this splitting is compatible with the splitting of the equivariant suspension spectrum. The first of these results has been obtained independently by John Rognes.
