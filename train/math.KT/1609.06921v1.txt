K-Theory for hermitian symmetric spaces of non-compact type, as developed recently by the authors, allows to put Cartan's classification into a homological perspective. We apply this method to the case of inductive limits of finite dimensional hermitian symmetric spaces. This might be seen as an indication of how much more powerful the homological theory is in comparison to the more classical approach.   When seen from high above, we follow the path laid out by a similar result in the theory of C*-algebras. Important is a clear picture of the behavior of morphisms between bounded symmetric domains of finite dimensions, which is more complex than in the C*-case, as well as an accessible K-theory. We furthermore have to slightly modify the invariant from our previous work. Roughly, we use traces left by co-root lattices on K-groups, instead of co-roots themselves, which had been used previously.
