Let k be a number field. We describe the category of Laumon 1-isomotives over k as the universal category in the sense of Nori associated with a quiver representation built out of smooth proper k-curves with two disjoint effective divisors and a notion of H^1_\dR for such "curves with modulus". This result extends and relies on the theorem of J. Ayoub and L. Barbieri-Viale that describes Deligne's category of 1-isomotives in terms of Nori's Abelian category of motives.
