In this short note we study the cohomology algebra of saturated fusion systems using finite groups which realize saturated fusion systems and Hochschild cohomology of group algebras. A similar result to a theorem of Alperin is proved for varieties of cohomology algebras of fusions systems associated to block algebras of finite groups.
