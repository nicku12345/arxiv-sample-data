In this paper, we study the algebraic cobordism spectrum MSL in the motivic stable homotopy category of Voevodsky over an arbitrary perfect field k. Using the motivic Adams spectral sequence, we compute the geometric part of the \eta-completion of MSL (modulo the maximal subgroup that is l-divisble for all primes l\neq2, char k). As an application, we study the Krichever's elliptic genus with integral coefficients, restricted to MSL. We determine its image, and identify its kernel as the ideal generated by differences of SL-flops. This was proved by B. Totaro in the complex analytic setting. In the appendix, we prove some convergence properties of the motivic Adams spectral sequence.
