We describe quantum weighted lens spaces as total spaces of quantum principal circle bundles, using a Cuntz-Pimsner model. The corresponding Pimsner exact sequence is interpreted as a noncommutative analogue of the Gysin exact sequence. We use the sequence to compute the K-theory and K-homology groups of quantum weighted lens spaces, extending previous results and computations due to the author and collaborators.
