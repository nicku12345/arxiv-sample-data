We compute the generalized slices (as defined by Spitzweck-{\O}stv{\ae}r) of the motivic spectrum KO (representing hermitian K-theory) in terms of motivic cohomology and (a version of) generalized motivic cohomology, obtaining good agreement with the situation in classical topology and the results predicted by Markett-Schlichting. As an application, we compute the homotopy sheaves of (this version of) generalized motivic cohomology, which establishes a version of a conjecture of Morel.
