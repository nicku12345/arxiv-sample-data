We give a construction of an odd spectral triple on the Cuntz algebra O_{N}, whose K-homology class generates the odd K-homology group K^1(O_{N}). Using a metric measure space structure on the Cuntz-Renault groupoid, we introduce a singular integral operator which is the formal analogue of the logarithm of the Laplacian on a Riemannian manifold. Assembling this operator with the infinitesimal generator of the gauge action on O_{N} yields a \theta-summable spectral triple whose phase is finitely summable. The relation to previous constructions of Fredholm modules and spectral triples on O_{N} is discussed.
