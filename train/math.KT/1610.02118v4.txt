In this short note we compare Mishchenko's definition of noncommutative signature for a manifold with proper G-action of a discrete, countable group G with the (more analytical) counterpart defined by Higson and Roe in the series of articles "Mapping Surgery to Analysis". A generalization of the coarse index is also addressed.
