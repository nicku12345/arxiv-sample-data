In this paper, we construct an analytic model of equivariant differential K-theory for closed manifolds with almost free action, which is a ring valued functor with the usual properties of a differential extensions of a cohomology theory, using the equivariant Bismut-Cheeger eta forms with the equivariant version of spectral sections developed by Melrose-Piazza. In fact, it could also be regarded as an analytic model of differential K-theory for closed orbifolds. Furthermore, we construct a well-defined push-forward map in equivariant differential K-theory and prove the properties of it.   In order to do these, we extend the Melrose-Piazza spectral section to the equivariant case, introduce the equivariant version of higher spectral flow for arbitrary dimensional fibers and use them to prove the anomaly formula and the functoriality of the equivariant Bismut-Cheeger eta forms.
