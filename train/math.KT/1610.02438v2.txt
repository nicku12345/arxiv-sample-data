In this paper, which is mostly a research announcement, we give a new algebraic construction of knot contact homology in the sense of L. Ng [Ng05a]. For a link L in  {\mathbb R}^3 , we define a differential graded (DG) k-category  \tilde{\mathscr A}  with finitely many objects, whose quasi-equivalence class is a topological invariant of  L . In the case when L is a knot, the endomorphism algebra of a distinguished object of  \tilde{\mathscr A}  coincides with the fully noncommutative knot DGA as defined by Ekholm, Etnyre, Ng and Sullivan in [EENS13a]. The input of our construction is a natural action of the braid group B_n on the category of perverse sheaves on a two-dimensional disk with singularities at n marked points, studied by Gelfand, MacPherson and Vilonen in [GMV96]. As an application, we show that the category of finite-dimensional representations of the link k-category  \tilde{A} = H_0(\tilde{\mathscr A})  defined as the 0th homology of our DG category  \tilde{\mathscr A}  is equivalent to the category of perverse sheaves on  {\mathbb R}^3  which are singular along the link  L . We also obtain several generalizations of the category  \tilde{\mathscr A}  by extending the Gelfand-MacPherson-Vilonen braid action.
