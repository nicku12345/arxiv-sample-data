Let F be a finite group. We consider the lamplighter group L=F\wr\mathbb{Z} over F. We prove that L has a classifying space for proper actions \underline{E} L which is a complex of dimension two. We use this to give an explicit proof of the Baum-Connes conjecture (without coefficients), that states that the assembly map \mu_i^L:K_i^L(\underline{E} L)\rightarrow K_i(C^*L)\;(i=0,1) is an isomorphism. Actually, K_0(C^*L) is free abelian of countable rank, with an explicit basis consisting of projections in C^*L, while K_1(C^*L) is infinite cyclic, generated by the unitary of C^*L implementing the shift. Finally we show that, for F abelian, the C^*-algebra C^*L is completely characterized by |F| up to isomorphism.
