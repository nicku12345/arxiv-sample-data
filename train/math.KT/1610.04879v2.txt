Let O be a differential graded (possibly colored) operad defined over rationals. Let us assume that there exists a zig-zag of quasi-isomorphisms connecting O \otimes K to its cohomology, where K is any field extension of rationals. We show that for a large class of such dg operads, a formality quasi-isomorphism for O exists and can be constructed recursively. Every step of our recursive procedure involves a solution of a finite dimensional linear system and it requires no explicit knowledge about the zig-zag of quasi-isomorphisms connecting O \otimes K to its cohomology.
