Let \{A_m\} be a pro system of associative commutative, not necessarily unital, rings. Assume that the pro systems \{\mathrm{Tor}^{\mathbb{Z}\ltimes A_m}_i(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z})\}_m vanish for all i>0. Then we prove that the sequence \[   \{H_l(\mathrm{GL}_n(A_m))\}_m \to \{H_l(\mathrm{GL}_{n+1}(A_m))\}_m \to \{H_l(\mathrm{GL}_{n+2}(A_m)\}_m \to \cdots \] stabilizes up to pro isomorphisms for n large enough than l and the stable range of A_m's.
