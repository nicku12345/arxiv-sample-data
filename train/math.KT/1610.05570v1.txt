Mathai, Melrose, and Singer introduced the notion of projective elliptic operators on manifolds equipped with an Azumaya bundle. In this note we compute the equivariant index of transversally elliptic operators that are the pullback of projective elliptic operators on the trivialization of the Azumaya bundle. It encompasses the fractional index formula of projective elliptic operator by Mathai-Melrose-Singer.
