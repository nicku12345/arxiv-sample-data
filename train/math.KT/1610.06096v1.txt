A theorem of Albert-Draxl states that if a tensor product of two quaternion division algebras Q_1, Q_2 over a field F is not a division algebra, then there exists a separable quadratic extension of F that embeds as a subfield in Q_1 and in Q_2. We establish a modified version of this result where the tensor product of quaternion algebras is replaced by the corestriction of a single quaternion algebra over a separable field extension. As a tool in the proof, we show that if the transfer of a nonsingular quadratic form \varphi over a quadratic extension is isotropic for a linear functional s such that s(1)=0, then \varphi contains a nondegenerate subform defined over the base field.
