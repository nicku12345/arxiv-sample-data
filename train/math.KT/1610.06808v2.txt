Let \Gamma be a torsion-free arithmetic group acting on its associated global symmetric space X. Assume that X is of non-compact type and let \Gamma act on the geodesic boundary \partial X of X. Via general constructions in KK-theory, we endow the K-groups of the arithmetic manifold X/\Gamma, of the reduced group C*-algebra of \Gamma and of the boundary crossed product algebra associated to the action of \Gamma on \partial X, with Hecke operators. The K-theory and K-homology groups of these C*-algebras are related by a Gysin six-term exact sequence. In the case when \Gamma is a group of real hyperbolic isometries, we show that this Gysin sequence is Hecke equivariant. Finally, in the case when \Gamma is a subgroup of a Bianchi group, we construct explicit Hecke-equivariant maps between the integral cohomology of \Gamma and each of these K-groups. Our methods apply to torsion-free finite index subgroups of PSL(2,\mathbb{Z}) as well. These results are achieved in the context of unbounded Fredholm modules, shedding light on noncommutative geometric aspects of the purely infinite boundary crossed product algebra.
