We solve a problem proposed by Khovanov by constructing, for any set of primes S, a triangulated category (in fact a stable \infty-category) whose Grothendieck group is S^{-1}\mathbf{Z}. More generally, for any exact \infty-category E, we construct an exact \infty-category S^{-1}E of equivariant sheaves on the Cantor space with respect to an action of a dense subgroup of the circle. We show that this \infty-category is precisely the result of categorifying division by the primes in S. In particular, K_n(S^{-1}E)\cong S^{-1}K_n(E).
