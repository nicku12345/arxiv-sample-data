We define Adams operations on matrix factorizations, and we show these operations enjoy analogues of several key properties of the Adams operations on perfect complexes with support developed by Gillet-Soul\'e in their paper "Intersection Theory Using Adams Operations". As an application, we give a proof of a conjecture of Dao-Kurano concerning the vanishing of Hochster's theta invariant.
