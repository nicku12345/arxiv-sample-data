We compute the G-equivariant homotopy type of the real topological cyclic homology of spherical group rings with anti-involution induced by taking inverses in the group, where G denotes the group Gal(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}). The real topological Hochschild homology of a spherical group ring \mathbb{S}[\Gamma], with anti-involution as described, is an O(2)-cyclotomic spectrum and we construct a map commuting with the cyclotomic structures from the O(2)-equivariant suspension spectrum of the dihedral bar construction on \Gamma to the real topological Hochschild homology of \mathbb{S}[\Gamma], which induce isomorphisms on C_{p^n}- and D_{p^n}-homotopy groups for all n\in \mathbb{Z} and all primes p. Here C_{p^n} is the cyclic group of order p^n and D_{p^n} is the dihedral group of order 2p^n. Finally, we compute the G-equivariant homotopy type of the real topological cyclic homology of \mathbb{S}[\Gamma] at a prime p.
