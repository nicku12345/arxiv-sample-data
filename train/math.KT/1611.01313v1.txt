This paper is about application of various homological methods to classical problems in the theory of group rings. It is shown that the third homology of groups plays a key role in Narain Gupta's three normal subgroup problem. For a free group F and its normal subgroups R,\,S,\,T, and the corresponding ideals in the integral group ring \mathbb Z[F], {\bf r}=(R-1)\mathbb Z[F],\ {\bf s}=(S-1)\mathbb Z[F],\ {\bf t}=(T-1)\mathbb Z[F], a complete description of the normal subgroup F\cap (1+{\bf rst}) is given, provided R\subseteq T and the third and the fourth homology groups of R/R\cap S are torsion groups.
