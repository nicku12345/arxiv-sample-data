Let \mathbf{S}_k denote a maximal torus in the complex Lie group \mathbf{G} = \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{C})/C_k and let T_k denote a maximal torus in its compact real form \mathrm{SU}_n(\mathbb{C})/C_k, where k divides n. Let W denote the Weyl group of \mathbf{G}, namely the symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_n. We elucidate the structure of the extended quotient \mathbf{S}_k // W as an algebraic variety and of T_k // W as a topological space, in both cases describing them as bundles over unions of tori. Corresponding to the invariance of K-theory under Langlands duality, this calculation provides a homotopy equivalence between T_k // W and its dual T_{\frac{n}{k}} // W. Hence there is an isomorphism in cohomology for the extended quotients which is stratified as a direct sum over conjugacy classes of the Weyl group. We use our formula to compute a number of examples.
