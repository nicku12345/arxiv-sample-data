For simplicial modules, Eilenberg-Zilber's classical theorem states the existence of a product sh : M\otimes N\to M\times N (the shuffle) and a coproduct AW : M\times N\to M\otimes N (the Alexander-Whitney map), which are quasi-inverse of eachother. A cyclic version of this theorem was established in 1987 by Hood and Jones: they proved that sh and AW admit "coextensions" sh_\infty and AW_\infty, using an acyclic-model method. Besides, an explicit formula for sh_\infty has been discovered by several authors. But the question remained open of such an explicit formula for AW_\infty, and for the homotopies by which sh_\infty and AW_\infty are mutual quasi-inverses and are quasi-(co)-associative. We present a complete answer to this problem and show that all these -- now explicit -- maps extend continuously to entire cyclic complexes (associated to normed algebras).
