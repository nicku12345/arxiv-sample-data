We apply quantitative (or controlled) K-theory to prove that a certain L^p assembly map is an isomorphism for p\in[1,\infty) when an action of a countable discrete group \Gamma on a compact Hausdorff space X has finite dynamical complexity. When p=2, this is a model for the Baum-Connes assembly map for \Gamma with coefficients in C(X), and was shown to be an isomorphism by Guentner, Willett, and Yu.
