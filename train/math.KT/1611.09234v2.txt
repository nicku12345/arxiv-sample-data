We introduce a relative version of the 2-Segal simplicial spaces defined by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov and G\'{a}lvez-Carrillo, Kock and Tonks. Examples of relative 2-Segal spaces include the categorified unoriented cyclic nerve, real pseudoholomorphic polygons in almost complex manifolds and the \mathcal{R}_{\bullet}-construction from Grothendieck-Witt theory. We show that a relative 2-Segal space defines a categorical representation of the Hall algebra associated to the base 2-Segal space. In this way, after decategorification we recover a number of known constructions of Hall algebra representations. We also describe some higher categorical interpretations of relative 2-Segal spaces.
