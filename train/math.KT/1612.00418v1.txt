This note was prepared after the workshop on cdh descent and algebraic K-theory in Hara-mura, Japan (1 - 5 Sept. 2016), to complement the author's talk on the history and applications of pro cdh descent. In the final section pro cdh descent is used to define K-groups of rigid analytic varieties. This note was revised and released in light of Kerz, Strunk, and Tamme establishing pro cdh descent in general (arXiv:1611.08466).
