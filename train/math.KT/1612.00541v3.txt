Given a filtration of a commutative monoid A in a symmetric monoidal stable model category \mathcal{C}, we construct a spectral sequence analogous to the May spectral sequence whose input is the higher order topological Hochschild homology of the associated graded commutative monoid of A, and whose output is the higher order topological Hochschild homology of A. We then construct examples of such filtrations and derive some consequences: for example, given a connective commutative graded ring R, we get an upper bound on the size of the THH-groups of E_{\infty}-ring spectra A such that \pi_*(A) \cong R.
