We revisit the characterisation of modules over non-unital C^*-algebras analogous to modules of sections of vector bundles. A fullness condition on the associated multiplier module characterises a class of modules which closely mirror the commutative case. We also investigate the multiplier-module construction in the context of bi-Hilbertian bimodules, particularly those of finite numerical index and finite Watatani index.
