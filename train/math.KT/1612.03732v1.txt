Using Franke's methods we construct new examples of exotic equivalences. We show that for any symmetric ring spectrum R whose graded homotopy ring \pi_*R is concentrated in dimensions divisible by a natural number N \geq 5 and has homological dimension at most three, the homotopy category of R-modules is equivalent to the derived category of \pi_*R. The Johnson-Wilson spectrum E(3) and the truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum BP\langle 2 \rangle for any prime p \geq 5 are our main examples. If additionally the homological dimension of \pi_*R is equal to two, then the homotopy category of R-modules and the derived category of \pi_*R are triangulated equivalent. Here the main examples are E(2) and BP \langle 1 \rangle at p \geq 5. The last part of the paper discusses a triangulated equivalence between the homotopy category of E(1)-local spectra at a prime p \geq 5 and the derived category of Franke's model. This is a theorem of Franke and we fill a gap in the proof.
