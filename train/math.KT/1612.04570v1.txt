In this short note, we simply collect some known results about representing algebraic cycles by various kind of "nice" (e.g. smooth, local complete intersection, products of local complete intersection) algebraic cycles, up to rational equivalence. We also add a few elementary and easy observations on these representation problems that we were not able to locate in the literature.
