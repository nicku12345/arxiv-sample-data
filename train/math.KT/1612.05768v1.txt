Young tableaux carry an associative product, described by the Schensted algorithm. They thus form a monoid \mathbf{Pl}, called \emph{plactic}. It is central in numerous combinatorial and algebraic applications. In this paper, the tableaux product is shown to be completely determined by a braiding \sigma on the (much simpler!) set of columns \mathbf{Col}. Here a \emph{braiding} is a set-theoretic solution to the Yang--Baxter equation. As an application, we identify the Hochschild cohomology of \mathbf{Pl}, which resists classical approaches, with the more accessible braided cohomology of (\mathbf{Col},\sigma). The cohomological dimension of \mathbf{Pl} is obtained as a corollary. Also, the braiding~\sigma is proved to commute with the classical crystal reflection operators~s\_i.
