We develop a K-theoretic approach to multiparameter bifurcation theory of homoclinic solutions of discrete non-autonomous dynamical systems from a branch of stationary solutions. As a byproduct we obtain a family index theorem for asymptotically hyperbolic linear dynamical systems which is of independent interest. In the special case of a single parameter, our bifurcation theorem weakens the assumptions in previous work by Pejsachowicz and the first author.
