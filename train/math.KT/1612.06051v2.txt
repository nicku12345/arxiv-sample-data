We introduce the notions of a \mathbf{D}-standard abelian category and a \mathbf{K}-standard additive category. We prove that for a finite dimensional algebra A, its module category is \mathbf{D}-standard if and only if any derived autoequivalence on A is standard, that is, given by a two-sided tilting complex. We prove that if the subcategory of projective A-modules is \mathbf{K}-standard, then the module category is \mathbf{D}-standard. We provide new examples of \mathbf{D}-standard module categories.
