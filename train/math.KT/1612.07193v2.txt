We discuss a conjecture saying that derived equivalence of simply connected smooth projective varieties implies that the difference of their classes in the Grothendieck ring of varieties is annihilated by a power of the affine line class.   We support the conjecture with a number of known examples, and one new example. We consider a smooth complete intersection X of three quadrics in {\mathbf P}^5 and the corresponding double cover Y \to {\mathbf P}^2 branched over a sextic curve. We show that as soon as the natural Brauer class on Y vanishes, so that X and Y are derived equivalent, the difference [X] - [Y] is annihilated by the affine line class.
