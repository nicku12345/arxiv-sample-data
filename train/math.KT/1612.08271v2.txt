Let \varphi be a rational map \mathbb{P}^2 \dashrightarrow\mathbb{P}^2 that preserves the rational volume form \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x}\wedge\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{y}. Sergey Galkin conjectured that in this case \varphi is necessarily birational. We show that such a map preserves the element \{x,y\} of the second K-group K_2(\mathbf{k}(x,y)) up to multiplication by a constant, and restate this condition explicitly in terms of mutual intersections of the divisors of coordinates of \varphi in a way suitable for computations.
