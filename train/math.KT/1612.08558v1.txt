Given a graph of C*-algebras, we prove a long exact sequence in KK-theory for both the maximal and the vertex-reduced fundamental C*-algebras in the presence of possibly non GNS-faithful conditional expectations. We deduce from it the KK-equivalence between the full fundamental C*-algebra and the vertex-reduced fundamental C*-algebra even for non GNS-faithful conditional expectations. Our results unify, simplify and generalize all the previous results obtained before by Cuntz, Pimsner, Germain and Thomsen. It also generalizes the previous results of the authors on amalgamated free products.
