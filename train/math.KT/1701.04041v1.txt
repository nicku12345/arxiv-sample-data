We prove a {\Gamma}-equivariant version of the algebraic index theorem, where {\Gamma} is a discrete group of automorphisms of a formal deformation of a symplectic manifold. The particular cases of this result are the algebraic version of the transversal index theorem related to the theorem of A. Connes and H. Moscovici for hypoelliptic operators and the index theorem for the extension of the algebra of pseudodifferential operators by a group of diffeomorphisms of the underlying manifold due to A. Savin, B. Sternin, E. Schrohe and D. Perrot.
