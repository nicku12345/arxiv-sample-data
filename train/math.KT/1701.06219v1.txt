We lift to equivariant algebra three closely related classical algebraic concepts: abelian group objects in augmented commutative algebras, derivations, and K\"ahler differentials. We define Mackey functor objects in the category of Tambara functors augmented to a fixed Tambara functor \underline{R}, and we show that the usual square-zero extension gives an equivalence of categories between these Mackey functor objects and ordinary modules over \underline{R}. We then describe the natural generalization to Tambara functors of a derivation, building on the intuition that a Tambara functor has products twisted by arbitrary finite G-sets, and we connect this to square-zero extensions in the expected way. Finally, we show that there is an appropriate form of K\"ahler differentials which satisfy the classical relation that derivations out of \underline{R} are the same as maps out of the K\"ahler differentials.
