In this article, we study the relative negative K-groups K_{-n}(f) of a map f: X \to S  of schemes. We prove a relative version of the Weibel conjecture i.e. if f: X \to S is a smooth affine map of noetherian schemes with \dim S=d then K_{-n}(f)=0 for n> d+1 and the natural map K_{-n}(f) \to K_{-n}(f \times \mathbb{A}^{r}) is an isomorphism for all r>0 and n>d. We also prove a vanishing result for relative negative K-groups of a subintegral map.
