In this article we show how to build main aspects of our paper on globular weak (\infty,n)-categories, but now for the cubical geometry. Thus we define a monad on the category \mathbb{C}\mathbb{S}ets of cubical sets which algebras are models of cubical weak \infty-categories. Also for each n\in\mathbb{N} we define a monad on \mathbb{C}\mathbb{S}ets which algebras are models of cubical weak (\infty,n)-categories. And finally we define a monad on the category \mathbb{C}\mathbb{S}ets^2 which algebras are models of cubical weak \infty-functors, and a monad on the category \mathbb{C}\mathbb{S}ets^4 which algebras are models of cubical weak natural \infty-transformations.
