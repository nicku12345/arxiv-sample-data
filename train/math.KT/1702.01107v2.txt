Let A be a commutative noetherian ring, let \mathfrak{a}\subseteq A be an ideal, and let I be an injective A-module. A basic result in the structure theory of injective modules states that the A-module \Gamma_{\mathfrak{a}}(I) consisting of \mathfrak{a}-torsion elements is also an injective A-module. Recently, de Jong proved a dual result: If F is a flat A-module, then the \mathfrak{a}-adic completion of F is also a flat A-module. In this paper we generalize these facts to commutative noetherian DG-rings: let A be a commutative non-positive DG-ring such that \mathrm{H}^0(A) is a noetherian ring, and for each i<0, the \mathrm{H}^0(A)-module \mathrm{H}^i(A) is finitely generated. Given an ideal \bar{\mathfrak{a}} \subseteq \mathrm{H}^0(A), we show that the local cohomology functor \mathrm{R}\Gamma_{\bar{\mathfrak{a}}} associated to \bar{\mathfrak{a}} does not increase injective dimension. Dually, the derived \bar{\mathfrak{a}}-adic completion functor \mathrm{L}\Lambda_{\bar{\mathfrak{a}}} does not increase flat dimension.
