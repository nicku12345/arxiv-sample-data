We provide several ingredients towards a generalization of the Littlewood-Richardson rule from Chow groups to algebraic cobordism. In particular, we prove a simple product-formula for multiplying classes of smooth Schubert varieties with any Bott-Samelson class in algebraic cobordism of the grassmannian. We also establish some results for generalized Schubert polynomials for hyperbolic formal group laws.
