We provide a framework connecting several well known theories related to the linearity of graded modules over graded algebras. In the first part, we pay a particular attention to the tensor products of graded bimodules over graded algebras. Finally, we provide a tool to evaluate the possible degrees of a module appearing in a graded projective resolution once the generating degrees for the first term of some particular projective resolution are known.
