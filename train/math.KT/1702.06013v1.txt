The purpose of this article is to clarify the question what makes motives \mathbb{A}^1-homotopy invariance. we give construction of the stable model category of nilpotent invariant motives \mathcal{M}ot_{\operatorname{dg}}^{\operatorname{nilp}} and define the nilpotent invriant motives associated with schemes and relative exact categories. For a noetherian scheme X, there are two kind of motives associated with X in the homotopy category \operatorname{Ho}(\mathcal{M}ot^{\operatorname{nilp}}_{\operatorname{dg}}), namely M_{\operatorname{nilp}}(X) and M_{\operatorname{nilp}}'(X). In general M_{\operatorname{nilp}}(X) is not isomorphic to M'_{\operatorname{nilp}}(X_{\operatorname{red}}). But there exists a canonical isomorphism M_{\operatorname{nilp}}'(X)\simeq M_{\operatorname{nilp}}'(X_{\operatorname{red}}) and if X is regular noetherian separated, M(X) is canonically isomorphic to M'(X).
