The goal of this note is to describe a class of formal deformations of a symplectic manifold M in the case when the base ring of the deformation problem involves parameters of non-positive degrees. The interesting feature of such deformations is that these are deformations "in A_{\infty}-direction" and, in general, their description involves all cohomology classes of M of degrees \ge 2.
