We study the twisted Hochschild homology of quantum full flag manifolds, with the twist being the modular automorphism of the Haar state. We show that non-trivial 2-cycles can be constructed from appropriate invariant projections. The main result is that HH_2^\theta(\mathbb{C}_q[G / T]) is infinite-dimensional when \mathrm{rank}(\mathfrak{g}) > 1. We also discuss the case of generalized flag manifolds and present the example of quantum Grassmannians.
