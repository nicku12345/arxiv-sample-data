Let \mathcal H be the class of algebras verifying Han's conjecture. In this paper we analyse two types of algebras with the aim of providing an inductive step towards the proof of this conjecture. Firstly we show that if an algebra \Lambda is triangular with respect to a system of non necessarily primitive idempotents, and if the algebras at the idempotents belong to \mathcal H, then \Lambda is in \mathcal H. Secondly we consider a 2\times 2 matrix algebra, with two algebras on the diagonal, two projective bimodules in the corners, and zero corner products. They are not triangular with respect to the system of the two diagonal idempotents. However, the analogous result holds, namely if both algebras on the diagonal belong to \mathcal H, then the algebra itself is in \mathcal H.
