In this short note, we prove a comparision theorem between Levine-Serp\'e's equivariant higher Chow groups of an algebraic variety equipped with an action of a finite group and ordinary higher Chow groups of its fixed points. As a consequence, we show that the equivariant motivic spectral sequence degenerates rationally. This yields a Riemann-Roch Theorem for equivariant algebraic K-theory.
