We compute the group of K_1-zero-cycles on the second generalized involution variety for an algebra of degree 4 with symplectic involution. This description is given in terms of the group of multipliers of similitudes associated to the algebra with involution. Our method utilizes the framework of Chernousov and Merkurjev for computing K_1-zero-cycles in terms of R-equivalence classes of prescribed algebraic groups. This gives a computation of K_1-zero-cycles for some homogeneous varieties of type \mathsf{C}_2.
