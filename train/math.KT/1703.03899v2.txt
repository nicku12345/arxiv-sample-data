Given a differential graded (dg) symmetric Frobenius algebra A we construct an unbounded complex \mathcal{D}^{*}(A,A), called the Tate-Hochschild complex, which arises as a totalization of a double complex having Hochschild chains as negative columns and Hochschild cochains as non-negative columns. We prove that the complex \mathcal{D}^*(A,A) computes the singular Hochschild cohomology of A. We construct a cyclic (or Calabi-Yau) A-infinity algebra structure, which extends the classical Hochschild cup and cap products, and an L-infinity algebra structure extending the classical Gerstenhaber bracket, on \mathcal{D}^*(A,A). Moreover, we prove that the cohomology algebra H^*(\mathcal{D}^*(A,A)) is a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra with BV operator extending Connes' boundary operator. Finally, we show that if two Frobenius algebras are quasi-isomorphic as dg algebras then their Tate-Hochschild cohomologies are isomorphic and we use this invariance result to relate the Tate-Hochschild complex to string topology.
