Let (Q, q) be a quadratic space over a commutative ring R in which 2 is invertible, and consider the Dickson--Siegel--Eichler--Roy's subgroup EO_{R}(Q, H(R)^{m}) of the orthogonal group O_R(Q \perp H(R)^m), with rank Q= n \geq 1 and m\geq 2. We show that EO_{R}(Q, H(R)^{m}) is a normal subgroup of O_R(Q \perp H(R)^m), for all m\geq 2. We also prove that the DSER group EO_{R}(Q, H(P)) is a normal subgroup of O_{R}(Q \perp H(P)), where Q and H(P) are quadratic spaces over a commutative ring R, with rank (Q) \ge 1 and rank (P) \ge 2.
