Let K be a non-empty set of ideals of the commutative ring R, closed under taking smaller ideals. A subset X of the group ring R[\mathbb{Z}^s] is called a K-set if the ideal generated by the coefficients of the elements of X is in K. For X not a K-set we investigate the set of those homomorphisms p \colon \mathbb{Z}^s \to \mathbb{Z}^t such that p_*(X) is a K-set. We also consider corresponding notions of rank of matrices and Betti numbers of chain complexes; this includes an analysis of the case of McCoy rank. Our setup also recovers results on jump loci obtained by Kohno and Pajitnov as a special case.
