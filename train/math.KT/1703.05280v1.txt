There are two \mathbb Z_2 orbifolds of the Podle\'s quantum two-sphere, one being the quantum two-disc D_q and other the quantum two-dimensional real projective space \mathbb RP^2_q . In this article we calculate the Hochschild and cyclic homology and cohomology groups of these orbifolds and also the corresponding Chern-Connes indices.
