We prove that the arrow category of a monoidal model category, equipped with the pushout product monoidal structure and the projective model structure, is a monoidal model category. This answers a question posed by Mark Hovey, and has the important consequence that it allows for the consideration of a monoidal product in cubical homotopy theory. As illustrations we include numerous examples of non-cofibrantly generated monoidal model categories, including chain complexes, small categories, topological spaces, and pro-categories.
