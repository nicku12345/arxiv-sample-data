We compute the Hochschild cohomology ring of the algebras A= k\langle X, Y\rangle/ (X^a, XY-qYX, Y^a) over a field k where a\geq 2 and where q\in k is a primitive a-th root of unity. We find the the dimension of \mathrm{HH}^n(A) and show that it is independent of a. We compute explicitly the ring structure of the even part of the Hochschild cohomology modulo homogeneous nilpotent elements.
