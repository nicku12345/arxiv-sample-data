We show that if X is a toric scheme over a regular commutative ring k then the direct limit of the K-groups of X taken over any infinite sequence of nontrivial dilations is homotopy invariant. This theorem was previously known for regular commutative rings containing a field. The affine case of our result was conjectured by Gubeladze. We prove analogous results when k is replaced by an appropriate K-regular, not necessarily commutative k-algebra.
