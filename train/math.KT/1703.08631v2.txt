Let G:=\widehat{SL_2} denote the affine Kac-Moody group associated to SL_2 and \bar{\mathcal{X}} the associated affine Grassmannian. We determine an inductive formula for the Schubert basis structure constants in the torus-equivariant Grothendieck group of \bar{\mathcal{X}}. In the case of ordinary (non-equivariant) K-theory we find an explicit closed form for the structure constants. We also determine an inductive formula for the structure constants in the torus-equivariant cohomology ring, and use this formula to find closed forms for some of the structure constants.
