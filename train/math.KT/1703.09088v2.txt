Let L/K be a finite Galois extension of number fields with Galois group G. Let p be an odd prime and r>1 be an integer. Assuming a conjecture of Schneider, we formulate a conjecture that relates special values of equivariant Artin L-series at s=r to the compact support cohomology of the \'etale p-adic sheaf \mathbb Z_p(r). We show that our conjecture is essentially equivalent to the p-part of the equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture for the pair (h^0(\mathrm{Spec}(L))(r), \mathbb Z[G]). We derive from this explicit constraints on the Galois module structure of Banaszak's p-adic wild kernels.
