We relate the old and new cohomology monoids of an arbitrary monoid M with coefficients in semimodules over M, introduced in the author's previous papers, to monoid and group extensions. More precisely, the old and new second cohomology monoids describe Schreier extensions of semimodules by monoids, and the new third cohomology monoid is related to a certain group extension problem.
