We define a genuine \mathbb{Z}/2-equivariant real algebraic K-theory spectrum KR(A), for every genuine \mathbb{Z}/2-equivariant spectrum A equipped with a compatible multiplicative structure. This construction extends the real K-theory of Hesselholt-Madsen for discrete rings and the Hermitian K-theory of Burghelea-Fiedorowicz for simplicial rings. We construct a natural trace map of \mathbb{Z}/2-spectra tr\colon KR(A)\to THR(A) to the real topological Hochschild homology spectrum, which extends the K-theoretic trace of B\"okstedt-Hsiang-Madsen.   The trace provides a splitting of the real K-theory of the spherical group-ring. We use this splitting on the geometric fixed points of KR, which we regard as an L-theory of genuinely equivariant ring spectra, to reformulate the Novikov conjecture on the homotopy invariance of the higher signatures purely in terms of the module structure of the rational L-theory of the "Burnside group-ring".
