We show that a noetherian ring graded by an abelian group of finite rank satisfies the Auslander condition if and only if it satisfies the graded Auslander condition. In addition, we also study the injective dimension, the global dimension and the Cohen-Macaulay property from the same perspective of that for the Auslander condtion. A key step of our approach is to establish homological relations between a graded ring R, its quotient ring modulo the ideal \hbar R and its localization ring with respect to the Ore set \{\, \hbar^i\, \}_{i\geq0}, where \hbar is a homogeneous regular normal non-invertible element of R.
