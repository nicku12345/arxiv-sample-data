For a group G and R=\mathbb Z,\mathbb Z/p,\mathbb Q we denote by \hat G_R the R-completion of G. We study the map H_n(G,K)\to H_n(\hat G_R,K), where (R,K)=(\mathbb Z,\mathbb Z/p),(\mathbb Z/p,\mathbb Z/p),(\mathbb Q,\mathbb Q). We prove that H_2(G,K)\to H_2(\hat G_R,K) is an epimorphism for a finitely generated solvable group G of finite Pr\"ufer rank. In particular, Bousfield's HK-localisation of such groups coincides with the K-completion for K=\mathbb Z/p,\mathbb Q. Moreover, we prove that H_n(G,K)\to H_n(\hat G_R,K) is an epimorphism for any n if G is a finitely presented group of the form G=M\rtimes C, where C is the infinite cyclic group and M is a C-module.
