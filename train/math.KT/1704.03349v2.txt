Using Rieffel's construction of projective modules over higher dimensional noncommutative tori, we construct projective modules over some continuous field of C*-algebras whose fibers are noncommutative tori. Using a result of Echterhoff et al., our construction gives generators of K_0 of all noncommutative tori.
