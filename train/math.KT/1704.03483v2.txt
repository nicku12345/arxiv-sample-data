A rigidity property for the homotopy invariant stable linear framed presheaves is established. As a consequence a variant of Gabber rigidity theorem is obtained for a cohomology theory representable in the motivic stable homotopy category by a \phi-torsion spectrum with \phi\in\mathrm{GW}(k) of rank coprime to the (exponential) characteristic of the base field k. It is shown that the values of such cohomology theories at an essentially smooth Henselian ring and its residue field coincide. The result is applicable to cohomology theories representable by n-torsion spectra as well as to the ones representable by \eta-periodic spectra and spectra related to Witt groups.
