We show that outer approximately represenbtable actions of a finite cyclic group on UCT Kirchberg algebras satisfy a certain quasi-freeness type property if the corresponding crossed products satisfy the UCT and absorb a suitable UHF algebra tensorially. More concretely, we prove that for such an action there exists an inverse semigroup of homogeneous partial isometries that generates the ambient C*-algebra and whose idempotent semilattice generates a Cartan subalgebra. We prove a similar result for actions of finite cyclic groups with the Rokhlin property on UCT Kirchberg algebras absorbing a suitable UHF algebra. These results rely on a new construction of Cartan subalgebras in certain inductive limits of Cartan pairs. We also provide a characterisation of the UCT problem in terms of finite order automorphisms, Cartan subalgebras and inverse semigroups of partial isometries of the Cuntz algebra \mathcal{O}_2. This generalizes earlier work of the authors.
