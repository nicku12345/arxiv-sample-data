Let k be a finite base field. In this note, making use of topological periodic cyclic homology and of the theory of noncommutative motives, we prove that the numerical Grothendieck group of every smooth proper dg k-linear category is a finitely generated free abelian group. Along the way, we prove moreover that the category of noncommutative numerical motives over k is abelian semi-simple, as conjectured by Kontsevich. Furthermore, we show that the zeta functions of endomorphisms of noncommutative Chow motives are rational and satisfy a functional equation.
