We introduce in this work the notion of the category of pure \mathbf{E}-Motives, where \mathbf{E} is a motivic strict ring spectrum and construct twisted \mathbf{E}-cohomology by using six functors formalism of J. Ayoub. In particular, we construct the category of pure Chow-Witt motives CHW(k)_{\mathbb{Q}} over a field k and show that this category admits a fully faithful embedding into the geometric stable \mathbb{A}^1-derived category D_{\mathbb{A}^1,gm}(k)_{\mathbb{Q}}.
