The main purpose of this paper is to modify the orbit method for the Baum-Connes conjecture as developed by Chabert, Echterhoff and Nest in their proof of the Connes-Kasparov conjecture for almost connected groups \cite{MR2010742} in order to deal with linear algebraic groups over local function fields (i.e., non-archimedean local fields of positive characteristic). As a consequence, we verify the Baum-Connes conjecture for certain Levi-decomposable linear algebraic groups over local function fields. One of these is the Jacobi group, which is the semidirect product of the symplectic group and the Heisenberg group.
