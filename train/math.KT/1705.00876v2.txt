In this paper we study representation theory of the category FI^m introduced by Gadish which is a product of copies of the category FI, and show that quite a few interesting representational and homological properties of FI can be generalized to FI^m in a natural way. In particular, we prove the representation stability property of finitely generated FI^m-modules over fields of characteristic 0.
