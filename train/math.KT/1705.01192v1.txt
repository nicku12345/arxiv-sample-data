The zeta function of a motive over a finite field is multiplicative with respect to the direct sum of motives. It has beautiful analytic properties, as were predicted by the Weil conjectures. There is also a multiplicative zeta function, which instead respects the tensor product of motives. There is no analogue of the Weil conjectures, and we give a sufficient criterion for an analytic continuation to exist. This happens, for example, for cellular varieties, abelian varieties, or genus g > 1 curves with a supersingular Jacobian.
