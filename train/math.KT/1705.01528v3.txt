The purpose of this work is to study the notion of bivariant theory introduced by Fulton and MacPherson in the context of motivic stable homotopy theory, and more generally in the broader framework of Grothendieck six functors formalism. We introduce several kinds of bivariant theory associated with a suitable ring spectrum and we construct a system of orientations (called fundamental classes) for global complete intersection morphisms between arbitrary schemes. This fundamental classes satisfies all the expected properties from classical intersection theory and lead to Gysin morphisms, Riemann-Roch formulas as well as duality statements, valid for general schemes, including singular ones and without need of a base field.
