Using a recent computation of the rational minus part of SH(k) by Ananyevskiy-Levine-Panin, a theorem of Cisinski-Deglise and a version of the Roendigs-Ostvaer theorem, rational stable motivic homotopy theory over an infinite perfect field of characteristic different from 2 is recovered in this paper from finite Milnor-Witt correspondences in the sense of Calmes-Fasel.
