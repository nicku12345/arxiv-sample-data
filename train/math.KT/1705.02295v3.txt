We prove that the homotopy algebraic K-theory of tame quasi-DM stacks satisfies cdh-descent. We apply this descent result to prove that if X is a Noetherian tame quasi-DM stack and i < -dim(X), then K_i(X)[1/n] = 0 (resp. K_i(X, Z/n) = 0) provided that n is nilpotent on X (resp. is invertible on X). Our descent and vanishing results apply more generally to certain Artin stacks whose stabilizers are extensions of finite group schemes by group schemes of multiplicative type.
