Let n be a natural number greater or equal to 3, R a commutative ring and \sigma\in GL_n(R). We show that t_{kl}(\sigma_{ij}) (resp. t_{kl}(\sigma_{ii}-\sigma_{jj})) where i\neq j and k\neq l can be expressed as a product of 8 (resp. 24) matrices of the form ^{\epsilon}\sigma^{\pm 1} where \epsilon\in E_n(R). We prove similar results for the orthogonal groups O_{2n}(R) and the hyperbolic unitary groups U_{2n}(R,\Lambda) under the assumption that R is commutative and n\geq 3. This yields new, very short proofs of the Sandwich Classification Theorems for the groups GL_n(R), O_{2n}(R) and U_{2n}(R,\Lambda).
