We use descent theoretic methods to solve the homotopy limit problem for Hermitian K-theory over quasi-compact and quasi-separated base schemes. As another application of these descent theoretic methods, we compute the cellular Picard group of 2-complete Hermitian K-theory over \mathop{Spec}(\mathbb{C}), showing that the only invertible cellular spectra are suspensions of the tensor unit.
