We study two different flavours of A^1-homotopy theory in the setting of spectral algebraic geometry, and compare them to classical A^1-homotopy theory. As an application we show that the spectral analogue of Weibel's homotopy invariant K-theory collapses to the classical theory. Along the way we give a new construction of nonconnective algebraic K-theory of stable infinity-categories via a generalization of the Bass-Thomason-Trobaugh construction.
