Let k be an algebraically closed field of exponential characteristic p. Given any prime \ell\neq p, we construct a stable \'etale realization functor \underline{\text{\'Et}}_{\ell}:\text{Spt}(k)\rightarrow \text{Pro}(\text{Spt})^{H\mathbb{Z}/\ell} from the stable \infty-category of motivic \mathbb{P}^1-spectra over k to the stable \infty-category of (H\mathbb{Z}/\ell)^*-local pro-spectra (see section 3 for definition). This is induced by the \'etale topological realization functor \'a la Friedlander. The constant presheaf functor naturally induces the functor \[\text{SH}[1/p]\rightarrow\text{SH}(k)[1/p],\] where k and p are as above and \text{SH} and \text{SH}(k) are the classical and motivic stable homotopy categories, respectively. We use the stable \'etale realization functor to show that this functor is fully faithful. Furthermore, we conclude with a homotopy theoretic generalization of the \'etale version of the Suslin-Voevodsky theorem.
