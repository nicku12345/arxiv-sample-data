We discuss a new strategy for the computation of the Hopf-cyclic cohomology of the Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebra \mathcal{H}_n. More precisely, we introduce a multiplicative structure on the Hopf-cyclic complex of \mathcal{H}_n, and we show that the van Est type characteristic homomorphism from the Hopf-cyclic complex of \mathcal{H}_n to the Gelfand-Fuks cohomology of the Lie algebra W_n of formal vector fields on \mathbb{R}^n respects this multiplicative structure. We then illustrate the machinery for n=1.
