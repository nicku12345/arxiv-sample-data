We construct the strong weight complex functor (in the sense of Bondarko) for a stable infinity-category \underline{C} equipped with a bounded weight structure w. Along the way we prove that \underline{C} is determined by the infinity-categorical heart of w. This allows us to compare the K-theory of \underline{C} and the K-theory of \underline{Hw}, the classical heart of w. In particular, we prove that \operatorname{K}_{n}(\underline{C}) \to \operatorname{K}_{n}(\underline{Hw}) are isomorphisms for n \le 0.
