We study Chern characters and the assembly mapping for free actions using the framework of geometric K-homology. The focus is on the relative groups associated with a group homomorphism \phi:\Gamma_1\to \Gamma_2 along with applications to Novikov type properties. In particular, we prove a relative strong Novikov property for homomorphisms of hyperbolic groups and a relative strong \ell^1-Novikov property for polynomially bounded homomorphisms of groups with polynomially bounded cohomology in \C. As a corollary, relative higher signatures on a manifold with boundary W, with \pi_1(\partial W)\to \pi_1(W) belonging to the class above, are homotopy invariant.
