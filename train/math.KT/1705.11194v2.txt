In this article we describe extensions of some K-theory classes of Heisenberg modules over higher-dimensional noncommutative tori to projective modules over crossed products of noncommutative tori by finite cyclic groups, aka noncommutative orbifolds. The two dimensional case was treated by Echterhoff, L\"uck, Phillips and Walters. Our approach is based on the theory of metaplectic transformations of the representation theory of the Heisenberg group. We also describe the generators of the K-groups of the crossed products of flip actions by \mathbb{Z}_2 on 3-dimensional noncommutative tori.
