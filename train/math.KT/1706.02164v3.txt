For every strong coarse homology theory we construct a coarse assembly map as a natural transformation between coarse homology theories. We provide various conditions implying that this assembly map is an equivalence. These results generalize known results for the analytic coarse assembly map for K-homology to general coarse homology theories. Furthermore, we calculate the domain of the coarse assembly map explicitly in terms of locally finite homology theory.
