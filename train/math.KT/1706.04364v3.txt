For a commutative Noetherian ring R of dimension d and a commutative cancellative monoid M, the elementary action on unimodular n-rows over the monoid ring R[M] is transitive for n>=max(d+2,3). The starting point is the case of polynomial rings, considered by A. Suslin in the 1970s. The main result completes a project, initiated in the early 1990s, and suggests a new direction in the study of K-theory of monoid rings.
