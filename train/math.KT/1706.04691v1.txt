In this paper we provide descriptions of the Whitehead groups with coefficients in a ring of the Hilbert modular group and its reduced version, as well as for the topological K-theory of C^*-algebras, after tensoring with \mathbb{Q}, by computing the source of the assembly maps in the Farrell-Jones and the Baum-Connes conjecture respectively. We also construct a model for the classifying space of the Hilbert modular group for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups.
