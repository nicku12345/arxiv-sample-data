A smooth projective scheme X over a field k is said to satisfy the Rost nilpotence principle if any endomorphism of X in the category of Chow motives that vanishes on an extension of the base field k is nilpotent. We show that an \'etale motivic analogue of the Rost nilpotence principle holds for all smooth projective schemes over a perfect field. This provides a new approach to the question of Rost nilpotence and allows us to obtain an elegant proof of Rost nilpotence for surfaces, as well as for birationally ruled threefolds over a field of characteristic 0.
