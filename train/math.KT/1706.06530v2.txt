Let \mathcal{E} be a weakly idempotent complete exact category with enough injective and projective objects. Assume that \mathcal{M} \subseteq \mathcal{E} is a rigid, contravariantly finite subcategory of \mathcal{E} containing all the injective and projective objects, and stable under taking direct sums and summands. In this paper, \mathcal{E} is equipped with the structure of a prefibration category with cofibrant replacements. As a corollary, we show, using the results of Demonet and Liu in \cite{DL}, that the category of finite presentation modules on the costable category \overline{\mathcal{M}} is a localization of \mathcal{E}. We also deduce that \mathcal{E} \to \mathrm{mod}\overline{\mathcal{M}} admits a calculus of fractions up to homotopy. These two corollaries are analogues for exact categories of results of Buan and Marsh in \cite{BM2}, \cite{BM1} (see also \cite{Be}) that hold for triangulated categories.   If \mathcal{E} is a Frobenius exact category, we enhance its structure of prefibration category to the structure of a model category (see the article of Palu in \cite{Palu} for the case of triangulated categories). This last result applies in particular when \mathcal{E} is any of the Hom-finite Frobenius categories appearing in relation to cluster algebras.
