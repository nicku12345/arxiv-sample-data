We study the index of the APS boundary value problem for a strongly Callias-type operator D on a complete Riemannian manifold M. We show that this index is equal to an index on a simpler manifold whose boundary is a disjoint union of two complete manifolds N_0 and N_1. If the dimension of M is odd we show that the latter index depends only on the restrictions A_0 and A_1 of D to N_0 and N_1 and thus is an invariant of the boundary. We use this invariant to define the relative eta-invariant \eta(A_1,A_0). We show that even though in our situation the eta-invariants of A_1 and A_0 are not defined, the relative eta-invariant behaves as if it was the difference \eta(A_1)-\eta(A_0).
