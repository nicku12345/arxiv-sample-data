We provide a formula for the generating series of the zeta function Z(X,t) of symmetric powers Sym^n X of varieties over finite fields. This realizes Z(X,t) as an exponentiable motivic measure whose associated Kapranov motivic zeta function takes values in W(R) the big Witt ring of R=W(\mathbb{Z}). We apply our formula to compute Z(Sym^n X,t) in a number of explicit cases. Moreover, we show that all \lambda-ring motivic measures have zeta functions which are exponentiable. In this setting, the formula for Z(X,t) takes the form of a MacDonald formula for the zeta function.
