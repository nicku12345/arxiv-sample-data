In this paper we investigate the simplicial structure of a chain complex associated to the higher order Hochschild homology over the 3-sphere. We also introduce the tertiary Hochschild homology corresponding to a quintuple (A,B,C,\varepsilon,\theta), which becomes natural after we organize the elements in a convenient manner. We establish these results by way of a bar-like resolution in the context of simplicial modules. Finally, we generalize the higher order Hochschild homology over a trio of simplicial sets, which also grants natural geometric realizations.
