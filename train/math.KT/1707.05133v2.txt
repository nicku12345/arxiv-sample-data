We compute the equivariant K-homology of the classifying space for proper actions, for compact 3-dimensional hyperbolic reflection groups. This coincides with the topological K-theory of the reduced C^\ast-algebra associated to the group, via the Baum-Connes conjecture. We show that, for any such reflection group, the associated K-theory groups are torsion-free. As a result we can promote previous rational computations to integral compu- tations. Our proof relies on a new efficient algebraic criterion for checking torsion-freeness of K-theory groups, which could be applied to many other classes of groups.
