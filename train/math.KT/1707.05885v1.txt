We prove that for a Frobenius extension, if a module over the extension ring is Gorenstein projective, then its underlying module over the the base ring is Gorenstein projective; the converse holds if the Frobenius extension is either left-Gorenstein or separable (e.g. the integral group ring extension \mathbb{Z}\subset \mathbb{Z}G).   Moreover, for the Frobenius extension R\subset A=R[x]/(x^2), we show that: a graded A-module is Gorenstein projective in \mathrm{GrMod}(A), if and only if its ungraded A-module is Gorenstein projective, if and only if its underlying R-module is Gorenstein projective. It immediately follows that an R-complex is Gorenstein projective if and only if all its items are Gorenstein projective R-modules.
