Consider the wreath product \Gamma = F\wr \mathrm{F_n} = \bigoplus_{\mathrm{F_n}}F\rtimes\mathrm{F_n}, with F a finite group and \mathrm{F_n} the free group on n generators. We study the Baum-Connes conjecture for this group. Our aim is to explicitly describe the Baum-Connes assembly map for F\wr \mathrm{F_n}. To this end, we compute the topological and the analytical K-groups and exhibit their generators. Moreover, we present a concrete 2-dimensional model for \underline{E} \Gamma. As a result of our K-theoretic computations, we obtain that \mathrm K_0(\mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(\Gamma)) is the free abelian group of countable rank with a basis consisting of projections in \mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(\bigoplus_{\mathrm{F_n}}F) and \mathrm K_1(\mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(\Gamma)) is the free abelian group of rank n with a basis consisting of the unitaries coming from the free group.
