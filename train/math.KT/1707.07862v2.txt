The topological Hochschild homology THH(A) of an orthogonal ring spectrum A can be defined by evaluating the cyclic bar construction on A or by applying B\"okstedt's original definition of THH to A. In this paper, we construct a chain of stable equivalences of cyclotomic spectra comparing these two models for THH(A). This implies that the two versions of topological cyclic homology resulting from these variants of THH(A) are equivalent.
