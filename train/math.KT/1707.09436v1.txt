We construct the equivariant version of cd-structures, and we develop descent theory for topologies comes from equivariant cd-structures. In particular, we reprove several results of Cisinski-D\'eglies on the \'etale descent, qfh-descent, and h-descent. Since the \'etale topos, qfh-topos, and h-topos do not come from usual cd-structures, such results cannot be produced by usual cd-structures. We also apply equivariant cd-structures to study several topologies on the category of noetherian fs log schemes.
