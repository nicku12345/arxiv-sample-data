The congruence subgroup problem for a finitely generated group \Gamma and G\leq Aut(\Gamma) asks whether the map \hat{G}\to Aut(\hat{\Gamma}) is injective, or more generally, what is its kernel C\left(G,\Gamma\right)? Here \hat{X} denotes the profinite completion of X. In this paper we investigate C\left(IA(\Phi_{n}),\Phi_{n}\right), where \Phi_{n} is a free metabelian group on n\geq4 generators, and IA(\Phi_{n})=\ker(Aut(\Phi_{n})\to GL_{n}(\mathbb{Z})).   We show that in this case C(IA(\Phi_{n}),\Phi_{n}) is abelian, but not trivial, and not even finitely generated. This behavior is very different from what happens for free metabelian group on n=2,3 generators, or for finitely generated nilpotent groups.
