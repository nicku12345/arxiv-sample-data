The K_0-group of the C*-algebra of multipullback quantum complex projective plane is known to be \mathbb{Z}^3, with one generator given by the C*-algebra itself, one given by the section module of the noncommutative (dual) tautological line bundle, and one given by the Milnor module associated to a generator of the K_1-group of the C*-algebra of Calow-Matthes quantum 3-sphere. Herein we prove that these Milnor modules are isomorphic either to the section module of a noncommutative vector bundle associated to the SU_q(2)-prolongation of the Heegaard quantum 5-sphere S^5_H viewed as a U(1)-quantum principal bundle, or to a complement of this module in the rank-four free module. Finally, we demonstrate that one of the above Milnor modules always splits into the direct sum of the rank-one free module and a rank-one non-free projective module that is \emph{not} associated with S^5_H.
