In this note, we provide an axiomatic framework that characterizes the stable \infty-categories that are module categories over a motivic spectrum. This is done by invoking Lurie's \infty-categorical version of the Barr--Beck theorem. As an application, this gives an alternative approach to R\"ondigs and \O stv\ae r's theorem relating Voevodsky's motives with modules over motivic cohomology, and to Garkusha's extension of R\"ondigs and \O stv\ae r's result to general correspondence categories, including the category of Milnor-Witt correspondences in the sense of Calm\`es and Fasel. We also extend these comparison results to regular Noetherian schemes over a field (after inverting the residue characteristic), following the methods of Cisinski and D\'eglise.
