We build a ring spectrum representing Milnor-Witt motivic cohomology, as well as its \'etale local version and show how to deduce out of it three other theories: Borel-Moore homology, cohomology with compact support and homology. These theories, as well as the usual cohomology, are defined for singular schemes and satisfy the properties of their motivic analog (and more), up to considering more general twists. In fact, the whole formalism of these four theories can be functorially attached to any ring spectrum, giving finally maps between the Milnor-Witt motivic ones to the classical motivic ones.
