Let \mathbf{k} be the field \mathbb{F}_p or the ring \mathbb{Z}. We study combinatorial and topological properties of the universal simplicial complexes X(\mathbf{k}^n) and K(\mathbf{k}^n) whose simplices are certain unimodular subsets of \mathbf{k}^n. As a main result we show that X(\mathbf{k}^n), K(\mathbf{k}^n) and the links of their simplicies are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres specifying the exact number of spheres in the corresponding wedge decompositions. This is a generalisation of Davis and Januszkiewicz's result that K(\mathbb{Z}^n) and K(\mathbb{F}_2^n) are (n-2)-connected simplicial complexes.   We discuss applications of these universal simplicial complexes to toric topology and number theory.
