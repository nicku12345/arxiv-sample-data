Let A be an associative non-positive differential graded ring. In this paper we make a detailed study of a category \operatorname{\mathsf{Inj}}(A) of left DG-modules over A which generalizes the category of injective modules over a ring. We give many characterizations of this category, generalizing the theory of injective modules, and prove a derived version of the Bass-Papp theorem: the category \operatorname{\mathsf{Inj}}(A) is closed in the derived category \operatorname{\mathsf{D}}(A) under arbitrary direct sums if and only if the ring \mathrm{H}^0(A) is left noetherian and for every i<0 the left \mathrm{H}^0(A)-module \mathrm{H}^i(A) is finitely generated. Specializing further to the case of commutative noetherian DG-rings, we generalize the Matlis structure theory of injectives to this context. As an application, we obtain a concrete version of Grothendieck's local duality theorem over commutative noetherian local DG-rings.
