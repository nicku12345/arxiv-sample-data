The category of effective Grothendieck-Witt-motives \mathbf{DM}^{GW}_{\mathrm{eff},-}(k) (and Witt-motives \mathbf{DM}^W_{\mathrm{eff},-}(k)) by Voevodsky-Suslin method starting with some category of GW-correspondences (and Witt-correspondences) over a perfect field k, char\,k\neq 2, is defined. The functor M^{GW}_{eff}\colon Sm_k\to \mathbf{DM}^{GW}_{\mathrm{eff},-}(k) of Grothendieck-Witt-motives of smooth varieties is computed and it is proved that for any smooth scheme X and homotopy invariant sheave with GW-transfers F  Hom_{\mathbf{DM}^{GW}_{\mathrm{eff},-}(k)}(M^{GW}_{eff}(X), F[i]) \simeq H^i_{nis}(X, F)  naturally in X and F.
