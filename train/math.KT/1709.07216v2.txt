Let \Gamma be a discrete group. Assuming rational injectivity of the Baum-Connes assembly map, we provide new lower bounds on the rank of the positive scalar curvature bordism group and the relative group in Stolz' positive scalar curvature sequence for \mathrm{B} \Gamma. The lower bounds are formulated in terms of the part of degree up to 2 in the group homology of \Gamma with coefficients in the \mathbb{C}\Gamma-module generated by finite order elements. Our results use and extend work of Botvinnik and Gilkey which treated the case of finite groups. Further crucial ingredients are a real counterpart to the delocalized equivariant Chern character and Matthey's work on explicitly inverting this Chern character in low homological degrees.
