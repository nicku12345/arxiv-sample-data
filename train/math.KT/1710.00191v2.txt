We classify torsion actions of free wreath products of arbitrary compact quantum groups and use this to prove that if \mathbb{G} is a torsion-free compact quantum group satisfying the strong Baum-Connes property, then \mathbb{G}\wr_{\ast}S_{N}^{+} also satisfies the strong Baum-Connes property. We then compute the K-theory of free wreath products of classical and quantum free groups by SO_{q}(3).
