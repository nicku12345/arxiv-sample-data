Let k be an infinite perfect field. We provide a general criterion for a spectrum in the stable homotopy category over k to be effective, i.e. to be in the localizing subcategory generated by the suspension spectra of smooth schemes. As a consequence, we show that two recent versions of generalized motivic cohomology theories coincide.
