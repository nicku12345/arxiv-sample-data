For a Lie group G and a vector bundle E we study those actions of the Lie group TG on E for which the action map TG\times E \to E is a morphism of vector bundles, and call those \emph{affine actions}. We prove that the category \mathrm{Vect}_{TG}^{\mathrm{aff}}\left(X\right) of such actions over a fixed G-manifold X is equivalent to a certain slice category \mathfrak g_X \backslash \mathrm{Vect}_G\left(X\right). We show that there is a monadic adjunction relating \mathrm{Vect}_{TG}^{\mathrm{aff}}\left(X\right) to \mathrm{Vect}_G\left(X\right), and the right adjoint of this adjunction induces an isomorphism of Grothendieck groups K_{TG}^{\mathrm{aff}}\left(X\right) \cong KO_G\left(X\right). Complexification produces analogous results involving T_\mathbb C G and K_G\left(X\right).
