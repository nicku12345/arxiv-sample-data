We construct a relative version of topological K-theory of dg categories over an arbitrary quasi-compact, quasi-separated \mathbb{C}-scheme X. This has as input a \text{Perf}(X)-linear stable \infty-category and output a sheaf of spectra on X(\mathbb{C}), the space of complex points of X. We then characterize the values of this functor on inputs of the form Mod_{A}^{\omega}, for A a derived Azumaya algebra over X. In such cases we show that this coincides with the \alpha-twisted topological K-theory of X(\mathbb{C}) for some appropriately defined twist of K-theory. We use this to provide a topological analogue of a classical result of Quillen's on the algebraic K-theory of Severi-Brauer varieties.
