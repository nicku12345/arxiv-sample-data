We prove a Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg decomposition theorem for smooth proper schemes X in characteristic p when \dim X\leq p. The best known previous result of this kind, due to Yekutieli, required \dim X<p. Yekutieli's result follows from the observation that the denominators appearing in the classical proof of HKR do not divide p when \dim X<p. Our extension to \dim X=p requires a homological fact: the Hochschild homology of a smooth proper scheme is self-dual.
