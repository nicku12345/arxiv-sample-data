Shelstad's character identity is an equality between sums of characters of tempered representations in corresponding L-packets of two real, semisimple, linear, algebraic groups that are inner forms to each other. We reconstruct this character identity in the case of the discrete series, using index theory of elliptic operators in the framework of K-theory. Our geometric proof of the character identity is evidence that index theory can play a role in the classification of group representations via the Langlands program.
