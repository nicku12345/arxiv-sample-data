If f:S' \to S is a finite locally free morphism of schemes, we construct a symmetric monoidal "norm" functor f_\otimes: \mathcal H_*(S') \to\mathcal H_*(S), where \mathcal H_*(S) is the pointed unstable motivic homotopy category over S. If f is finite \'etale, we show that it stabilizes to a functor f_\otimes: \mathcal{SH}(S') \to \mathcal{SH}(S), where \mathcal{SH}(S) is the \mathbb P^1-stable motivic homotopy category over S. Using these norm functors, we define the notion of a normed motivic spectrum, which is an enhancement of a motivic E_\infty-ring spectrum. The main content of this text is a detailed study of the norm functors and of normed motivic spectra, and the construction of examples. In particular: we investigate the interaction of norms with Grothendieck's Galois theory, with Betti realization, and with Voevodsky's slice filtration; we prove that the norm functors categorify Rost's multiplicative transfers on Grothendieck-Witt rings; and we construct normed spectrum structures on the motivic cohomology spectrum H\mathbb Z, the homotopy K-theory spectrum KGL, and the algebraic cobordism spectrum MGL. The normed spectrum structure on H\mathbb Z is a common refinement of Fulton and MacPherson's mutliplicative transfers on Chow groups and of Voevodsky's power operations in motivic cohomology.
