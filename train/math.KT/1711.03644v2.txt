We study graded connected algebras over a field of characteristic zero and give an explicit formula for the cyclic homology of a tensor algebra. By means of a slightly new definition of David Anick's notion "strongly free" we are able to prove that cyclic homology of an algebra of global dimension two is zero in homological degree greater than one and is zero also in homological degree equal to one in case the relations are monomials. We give also explicit formulas for the cyclic homology of a tensor algebra modulo one symmetric quadratic form.
