We prove a recognition principle for motivic infinite P1-loop spaces over a perfect field. This is achieved by developing a theory of framed motivic spaces, which is a motivic analogue of the theory of E-infinity-spaces. A framed motivic space is a motivic space equipped with transfers along finite syntomic morphisms with trivialized cotangent complex in K-theory. Our main result is that grouplike framed motivic spaces are equivalent to the full subcategory of motivic spectra generated under colimits by suspension spectra. As a consequence, we deduce some representability results for suspension spectra of smooth varieties, and in particular for the motivic sphere spectrum, in terms of Hilbert schemes of points in affine spaces.
