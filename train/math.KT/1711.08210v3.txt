Let R be a commutative ring. For any projective R-module P_0 of constant rank 2 with a trivialization of its determinant, we define a generalized Vaserstein symbol on the orbit space of the set of epimorphisms P_0 \oplus R \rightarrow R under the action of the group of elementary automorphisms of P_0 \oplus R, which maps into the elementary symplectic Witt group. We give criteria for the surjectivity and injectivity of the generalized Vaserstein symbol and deduce that it is an isomorphism if R is a regular Noetherian ring of dimension 2 or a regular affine algebra of dimension 3 over a perfect field k with c.d.(k) \leq 1 and 6 \in k^{\times}.
