In this paper certain Chow weight structures on the "big" triangulated motivic categories DM_R^{eff}\subset DM_R are defined in terms of motives of all smooth varieties over the base field. This definition allows studying basic properties of these weight structures without applying resolution of singularities; thus we don't have to assume that the coefficient ring R contains 1/p in the case where the characteristic p of the base field is positive. Moreover, in the case where R satisfies the latter assumption our weight structures are "compatible" with Chow weight structures defined in previous papers (in terms of Chow motives). The results of this article yield certain Chow-weight filtration (also) on p-adic cohomology of motives and smooth varieties.
