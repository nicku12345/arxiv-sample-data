We propose the notion of a coarse cohomology theory and study the examples of coarse ordinary cohomology, coarse stable cohomotopy and coarse cohomology theories obtained by dualizing coarse homology theories. Our investigations of coarse stable cohomotopy lead to a solution of J. R. Klein's conjecture that the dualizing spectrum of a group is a coarse invariant. We further investigate coarse cohomological K-theory functors and explain why (an adaption of) the functor of Emerson--Meyer does not seem to fit into our setting.
