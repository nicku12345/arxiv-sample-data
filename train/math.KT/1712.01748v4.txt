We classify all invariants of the functor I^n (powers of the fundamental ideal of the Witt ring) with values in A, that it to say functions I^n(K)\rightarrow A(K) compatible with field extensions, in the cases where A(K)=W(K) is the Witt ring and A(K)=H^*(K,\mu_2) is mod 2 Galois cohomology. This is done in terms of some invariants f_n^d that behave like divided powers with respect to sums of Pfister forms, and we show that any invariant of I^n can be written uniquely as a (possibly infinite) combination of those f_n^d. This in particular allows to lift operations defined on mod 2 Milnor K-theory (or equivalently mod 2 Galois cohomology) to the level of I^n. We also study various properties of these invariants, including behaviour under products, similitudes, residues for discrete valuations, and restriction from I^n to I^{n+1}. The goal is to use this to study invariants of algebras with involutions in future articles.
