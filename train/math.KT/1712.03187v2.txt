Hesselholt defined a spectrum \operatorname{TP}(X), the periodic topological cyclic homology of a scheme X, using topological Hochschild homology and the Tate construction, which is a topological analogue of Connes-Tsygan periodic cyclic homology \operatorname{HP} defined by Hochschild homology and the Tate construction. Goodwillie proved that for R an algebra over a field of characteristic 0 and I a nilpotent ideal of R, the quotient map R\to R/I induces an isomorphism on \operatorname{HP}. In this paper, we show that the analogous result for \operatorname{TP} does not hold, that is to say, there is an algebra of positive characteristic and a nilpotent ideal such that the quotient map does not induce an isomorphism on \operatorname{TP}, even rationally.
