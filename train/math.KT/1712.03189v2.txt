Let p be a prime number, and let A be a ring in which p is nilpotent. In this paper, we consider the maps K_{q+1}(A[x]/(x^m), (x))\to K_{q+1}(A[x]/(x^{mn}), (x)),induced by the ring homomorphism A[x]/(x^{m})\to A[x]/(x^{mn}), x\mapsto x^n. We evaluate these maps, up to extension, for general A in terms of topological Hochschild homology, and for regular \mathbb{F}_p-algebras A, in terms of groups of de Rham-Witt forms. After the evaluation, we give a calculation of the relative K-group of \mathcal{O}_{K}/p\mathcal{O}_{K} for certain perfectoid fields K.
