Let M be a closed spin manifold which supports a positive scalar curvature metric. The set of concordance classes of positive scalar curvature metrics on M forms an abelian group P(M) after fixing a positive scalar curvature metric. The group P(M) measures the size of the space of positive scalar curvature metrics on M. Weinberger and Yu gave a lower bound of the rank of P(M) in terms of the number of torsion elements of \pi_1(M). In this paper, we give a sharper lower bound of the rank of P(M) by studying the image of the relative higher index map from P(M) to the real K-theory of the group \mathrm{C}^\ast-algebra \mathrm{C}^\ast_{\mathrm{r}}(\pi_1(M)). We show that it rationally contains the image of the Baum-Connes assembly map up to a certain homological degree depending on the dimension of M. At the same time we obtain lower bounds for the positive scalar curvature bordism group by applying the higher rho-invariant.
