In this paper we investigate the structure of algebraic cobordism of Levine-Morel as a module over the Lazard ring with the action of Landweber-Novikov and symmetric operations on it. We show that the associated graded groups of algebraic cobordism with respect to the topological filtration \Omega^*_{(r)}(X) are unions of finitely presented \mathbb{L}-modules of very specific structure. Namely, these submodules possess a filtration such that the corresponding factors are either free or isomorphic to cyclic modules \mathbb{L}/I(p,n)x where \mathrm{deg\ } x\ge \frac{p^n-1}{p-1}. As a corollary we prove the Syzygies Conjecture of Vishik on the existence of certain free \mathbb{L}-resolutions of \Omega^*(X), and show that algebraic cobordism of a smooth surface can be described in terms of K_0 together with a topological filtration.
