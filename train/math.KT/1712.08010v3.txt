We prove that the graph C*-algebra C^*(E) of a trimmable graph E is U(1)-equivariantly isomorphic to a pullback C*-algebra of a subgraph C*-algebra C^*(E'') and the C*-algebra of functions on a circle tensored with another subgraph C*-algebra C^*(E'). This allows us to unravel the structure and K-theory of the fixed-point subalgebra C^*(E)^{U(1)} through the (typically simpler) C*-algebras C^*(E'), C^*(E'') and C^*(E'')^{U(1)}. As examples of trimmable graphs, we consider one-loop extensions of the standard graphs encoding respectively the Cuntz algebra \mathcal{O}_2 and the Toeplitz algebra \mathcal{T}. Then we analyze equivariant pullback structures of trimmable graphs yielding the C*-algebras of the Vaksman-Soibelman quantum sphere S^{2n+1}_q and the quantum lens space L_q^3(l; 1,l), respectively.
