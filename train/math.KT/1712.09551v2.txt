Under suitable conditions, a substitution tiling gives rise to a Smale space, from which three equivalence relations can be constructed, namely the stable, unstable, and asymptotic equivalence relations. We denote with S, U, and A their corresponding C^*-algebras in the sense of Renault. In this article we show that the K-theories of S and U can be computed from the cohomology and homology of a single cochain complex with connecting maps for tilings of the line and of the plane. Moreover, we provide formulas to compute the K-theory for these three C^*-algebras. Furthermore, we show that the K-theory groups for tilings of dimension 1 are always torsion free. For tilings of dimension 2, only K_0(U) and K_1(S) can contain torsion.
