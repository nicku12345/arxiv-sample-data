We construct, study, and apply a characteristic map from the relative periodic cyclic homology of the quotient map for a group action to the periodic Hopf-cyclic homology with coefficients associated with inertia of the action. This result admits, and in fact, comes from, its noncommutative-geometric, or quantized, counterpart. The crucial ingredient is the construction of the appropriate quantization of the cyclic nerve of the action groupoid, the cyclic object related to inertia, as the Connes-cyclic dual of a Hopf-cyclic object with coefficients in some stable anti-Yetter--Drinfeld module quantizing the Brylinski space. For the Hopf-Galois quantization of the case of trivial inertia, we find a non-trivial identification of our characteristic map with a well-known isomorphism of Jara--\c{S}tefan. In presence of nontrivial inertia, for an analytic ramified Galois double cover, we show that the cokernel of our characteristic map, which can be interpreted as an invariant of inertia modulo topology of the maximal free action, is supported on the branch locus of the quotient map. Finally, we use our inertial Hopf-cyclic object to construct a new invariant of finite-dimensional algebras.
