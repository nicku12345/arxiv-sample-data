In a recent paper, the author proved that if n\geq 3 is a natural number, R a commutative ring and \sigma\in GL_n(R), then t_{kl}(\sigma_{ij}) where i\neq j and k\neq l can be expressed as a product of 8 matrices of the form ^{\epsilon}\sigma^{\pm 1} where \epsilon\in E_n(R). In this article we prove similar results for the odd-dimensional orthogonal groups O_{2n+1}(R) and the odd-dimensional unitary groups U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta) under the assumption that R is commutative and n\geq 3. This yields new, short proofs of the Sandwich Classification Theorems for the groups O_{2n+1}(R) and U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta).
