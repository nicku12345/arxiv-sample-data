For a unitary representation \phi of the fundamental group of a compact smooth manifold, Atiyah, Patodi, Singer defined the so called \alpha-invariant of \phi using the Chern-Simons invariants. In this article using traces on C^*-algebras, we give an intrinsically(i.e without using Chern character) define an element in KK with real coefficients theory whose pullback by the representation \phi is the \alpha-invariant.
