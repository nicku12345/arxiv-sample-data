We extend results of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Raskind on the \mathcal{K}_2-cohomology of smooth projective varieties over a separably closed field k to the \'etale motivic cohomology of smooth, not necessarily projective, varieties over k. Some consequences are drawn, such as the degeneration of the Bloch-Lichtenbaum spectral sequence for any field containing k.
