In this paper, we describe the structure of the direct product of partial Burnside rings of relative to the collection of a finite group. In particular, we show that the unit group of the partial Burnside ring relative to the set of all parabolic subgroups of a reducible finite Coxeter group is isomorphic to the direct product of unit groups of the partial Burnside ring of irreducible Coxeter group.
