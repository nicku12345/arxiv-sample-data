In mixed characteristic and in equal characteristic p we define a filtration on topological Hochschild homology and its variants. This filtration is an analogue of the filtration of algebraic K-theory by motivic cohomology. Its graded pieces are related in mixed characteristic to the complex A\Omega constructed in our previous work, and in equal characteristic p to crystalline cohomology. Our construction of the filtration on \mathrm{THH} is via flat descent to semiperfectoid rings.   As one application, we refine the construction of the A\Omega-complex by giving a cohomological construction of Breuil--Kisin modules for proper smooth formal schemes over \mathcal O_K, where K is a discretely valued extension of \mathbb Q_p with perfect residue field. As another application, we define syntomic sheaves \mathbb Z_p(n) for all n\geq 0 on a large class of \mathbb Z_p-algebras, and identify them in terms of p-adic nearby cycles in mixed characteristic, and in terms of logarithmic de~Rham-Witt sheaves in equal characteristic p.
