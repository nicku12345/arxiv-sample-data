We give a new characterization of pre-Calabi-Yau structures in the sense of [KV13] and establish some relations with other concepts. We start by developing some noncommutative calculus for DG categories. In particular we give a new construction of periodic and negative cyclic homology, and we construct a natural extension of the necklace Lie algebra [BL02]. This latter extension still has the structure of a DG Lie algebra, which allows one to define a pre-Calabi-Yau structure as a Maurer-Cartan element on a certain filtration piece in its completion. This is equivalent and in a sense Koszul dual to the original definition of [KV13], which we also show to be derived Morita invariant. We show that a double Poisson structure [VdB08a] is equivalent to a pre-Calabi-Yau structure concentrated in certain components. We also adapt the arguments in [Pri17] to show that a (left) n-Calabi-Yau structure [Gin,KV13,BD] is equivalent to a non-degenerate n-pre-Calabi-Yau structure. Finally, using the Van den Bergh functor [VdB08b], we give a constructive proof which shows that for homotopically finitely presented DG categories concentrated in non-negative (homological) degrees, any (left) n-Calabi-Yau structure induces a (2-n)-shifted symplectic structure [PTVV13] on its derived moduli stack of representations; while any n-pre-Calabi-Yau structure induces a (2-n)-shifted Poisson structure [CPTVV17,Pri17] on this derived moduli stack.
