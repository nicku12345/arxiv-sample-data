We generalize the K\"unneth formula for Chow groups to an arbitrary OBM-homology theory satisfying descent (e.g. algebraic cobordism) when taking a product with a toric variety. As a corollary we obtain a universal coefficient theorem for the operational cohomology rings. We also give a description for the homology groups of smooth toric varieties, that allows the calculation of algebraic cobordism groups of singular toric varieties. Some computations are carried out.
