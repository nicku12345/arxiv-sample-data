We define two model structures on the category of bicomplexes concentrated in the right half plane. The first model structure has weak equivalences detected by the totalisation functor. The second model structure's weak equivalences are detected by the E^2-term of the spectral sequence associated to the filtration of the total complex by the horizontal degree. We then extend this result to twisted complexes.
