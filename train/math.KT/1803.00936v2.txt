In this paper we study universal central extensions and non-abelian tensor product of hom-Lie-Rinehart algebras. We discuss about universal \alpha- central extensions, and, lifting of automorphisms and \alpha-derivations to central extensions for hom-Lie-Rinehart algebras. This is in turn provide such lifting of automorphisms and \alpha^k-derivations to the central extensions for hom-Lie algebras.
