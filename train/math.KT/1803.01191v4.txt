Given two small dg categories C,D, defined over a field, we introduce their (non-symmetric) twisted tensor product C\overset{\sim}{\otimes} D. We show that -\overset{\sim}{\otimes} D is left adjoint to the functor Coh(D,-), where Coh(D,E) is the dg category of dg functors D\to E and their coherent natural transformations. This adjunction holds in the category of small dg categories (not in the homotopy category of dg categories \mathrm{Hot}). We show that for C,D cofibrant, the adjunction descends to the corresponding adjunction in the homotopy category. Then comparison with a result of To\"{e}n shows that, for C,D cofibtant, C\overset{\sim}{\otimes} D is isomorphic to C\otimes D, as an object of the homotopy category \mathrm{Hot}.
