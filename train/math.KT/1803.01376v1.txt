We study extensively the homotopy theory of cogebras. By cogebras, we mean the full theory of cogebras: with counits and not necessarily locally conilpotent. For example \mathcal E_\infty-cogebras, \mathcal A_\infty-cogebras, \mathcal L_\infty-cogebras etc. To do so, we define the category of complete curved algebras --- where the notion of quasi-isomorphims does not make sense --- and endow it with a model category structure, equivalent to that of the category of cogebras.
