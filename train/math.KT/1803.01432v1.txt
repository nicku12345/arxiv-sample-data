For any cohomology theory H that can be factorized through (the Morel-Voevodsky's triangulated motivic homotopy category) SH^{S^1}(k) we establish the SH^{S^1}(k)-functoriality of coniveau spectral sequences for H. We also prove: for any affine essentially smooth semi-local S the Cousin complex for H^*(S) splits; if H also factorizes through SH^+(k) or DM(k), then this is also true for any primitive S. Moreover, the cohomology of such an S is a direct summand of the cohomology of any its open dense subscheme. This is a vast generalization of the results of a previous paper.   In order to prove these results we consider certain triangulated categories of motivic pro-spectra, and introduce Gersten weight structures for them. We study in detail the notions of cohomological dimensions of scheme associated to various categories of motivic pro-spectra; they are defined in terms of the corresponding weight structures and count the number of non-zero Nisnevich cohomology for sheaves in the hearts of orthogonal "homotopy" t-structures.
