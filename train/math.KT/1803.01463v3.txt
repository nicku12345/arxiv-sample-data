We introduce a new algebraic-cycle model for the motivic cohomology theory of truncated polynomials k[t]/(t^m) in one variable. This approach uses ideas from the deformation theory and non-archimedean analysis, and is distinct from the approaches via cycles with modulus. We compute the groups in the Milnor range when the base field is of characteristic 0, and prove that they give the Milnor K-groups of k[t]/(t^m), whose relative part is the sum of the absolute K\"ahler differential forms.
