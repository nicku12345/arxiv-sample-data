In this paper we relate triangulated category structures to the cohomology of small categories and define initial obstructions to the existence of an algebraic or topological enhancement. We show that these obstructions do not vanish in an example of triangulated category without models. We also obtain cohomological characterizations of pre-triangulated DG, A-infinity, and spectral categories.
