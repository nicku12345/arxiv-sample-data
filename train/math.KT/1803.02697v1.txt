We define and study, under suitable assumptions, the fundamental class, the index class and the rho class of a spin Dirac operator on the regular part of a spin stratified pseudomanifold. More singular structures, such as singular foliations, are also treated. We employ groupoid techniques in a crucial way; however, an effort has been made in order to make this article accessible to readers with only a minimal knowledge of groupoids. Finally, whenever appropriate, a comparison between classical microlocal methods and groupoids methods has been provided.
