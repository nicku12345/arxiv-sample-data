We present a method for computing \mathbb{A}^1-homotopy invariants of singularity categories of rings admitting suitable gradings. Using this we describe any such invariant, e.g. homotopy K-theory, for the stable categories of self-injective algebras admitting a connected grading. A remark is also made concerning the vanishing of all such invariants for cluster categories of type A_{2n} quivers.
