Let G be a semisimple Lie group with discrete series. We use maps K_0(C^*_rG)\to \mathbb{C} defined by orbital integrals to recover group theoretic information about G, including information contained in K-theory classes not associated to the discrete series. An important tool is a fixed point formula for equivariant indices obtained by the authors in an earlier paper. Applications include a tool to distinguish classes in K_0(C^*_rG), the (known) injectivity of Dirac induction, versions of Selberg's principle in K-theory and for matrix coefficients of the discrete series, a Tannaka-type duality, and a way to extract characters of representations from K-theory. Finally, we obtain a continuity property near the identity element of G of families of maps K_0(C^*_rG)\to \mathbb{C}, parametrised by semisimple elements of G, defined by stable orbital integrals. This implies a continuity property for L-packets of discrete series characters, which in turn can be used to deduce a (well-known) expression for formal degrees of discrete series representations from Harish-Chandra's character formula.
