Let \ell be a commutative ring with unit. To every pair of \ell-algebras A and B one can associate a simplicial set \hom(A,B^\Delta) so that \pi_0\hom(A,B^\Delta) equals the set of polynomial homotopy classes of morphisms from A to B. We prove that \pi_n\hom(A,B^\Delta) is the set of homotopy classes of morphisms from A to B^{S_n}, where B^{S_n} is the ind-algebra of polynomials on the n-dimensional cube with coefficients in B vanishing at the boundary of the cube. This is a generalization to arbitrary dimensions of a theorem of Corti\~nas-Thom, which addresses the cases n\leq 1. As an application we give a simplified proof of a theorem of Garkusha that computes the homotopy groups of his matrix-unstable algebraic KK-theory space in terms of polynomial homotopy classes of morphisms.
