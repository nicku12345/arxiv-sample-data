Wieler has shown that every irreducible Smale space with totally disconnected stable sets is a solenoid (i.e., obtained via a stationary inverse limit construction). Using her construction, we show that the associated stable C*-algebra is the stationary inductive limit of a C*-stable Fell algebra that has compact spectrum and trivial Dixmier-Douady invariant. This result applies in particular to Williams solenoids along with other examples. Beyond the structural implications of this inductive limit, one can use this result to in principle compute the K-theory of the stable C*-algebra. A specific one-dimensional Smale space (the aab/ab-solenoid) is considered as an illustrative running example throughout.
