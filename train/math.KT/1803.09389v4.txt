We introduce graded \mathbb{E}_{\infty}-rings and graded modules over them, and study their properties. We construct projective schemes associated to connective \mathbb{N}-graded \mathbb{E}_{\infty}-rings in spectral algebraic geometry. Under some finiteness conditions, we show that the \infty-category of almost perfect quasi-coherent sheaves over a spectral projective scheme \mathrm{Proj}\,(A) associated to a connective \mathbb{N}-graded \mathbb{E}_{\infty}-ring A can be described in terms of \mathbb{Z}-graded A-modules.
