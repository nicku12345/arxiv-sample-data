An arrow matrix is a matrix with zeroes outside the main diagonal, first row, and first column. We consider the space M_{St_n,\lambda} of Hermitian arrow (n+1)\times (n+1)-matrices with fixed simple spectrum \lambda. We prove that this space is a smooth 2n-manifold, and its smooth structure is independent on the spectrum. Next, this manifold carries the locally standard torus action: we describe the topology and combinatorics of its orbit space. If n\geqslant 3, the orbit space M_{St_n,\lambda}/T^n is not a polytope, hence this manifold is not quasitoric. However, there is a natural permutation action on M_{St_n,\lambda} which induces the combined action of a semidirect product T^n\rtimes\Sigma_n. The orbit space of this large action is a simple polytope. The structure of this polytope is described in the paper.   In case n=3, the space M_{St_3,\lambda}/T^3 is a solid torus with boundary subdivided into hexagons in a regular way. This description allows to compute the cohomology ring and equivariant cohomology ring of the 6-dimensional manifold M_{St_3,\lambda} using the general theory developed by the first author. This theory is also applied to a certain 6-dimensional manifold called the twin of M_{St_3,\lambda}. The twin carries a half-dimensional torus action and has nontrivial tangent and normal bundles.
