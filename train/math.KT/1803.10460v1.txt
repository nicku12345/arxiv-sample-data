Let R be a commutative ring and I\subset R be a nilpotent ideal such that the quotient R/I splits out of R as a ring. Let N be a natural number such that {I^N=0}. We establish a canonical isomorphism between the relative Milnor K-group K^{M}_{n+1}(R,I) and the quotient of the relative module of differential forms \Omega^n_{R,I}/d\,\Omega^{n-1}_{R,I} assuming that N! is invertible in R and that the ring R is weakly 5-fold stable. The latter means that any 4-tuple of elements in R can be shifted by an invertible element to become a 4-tuple of invertible elements.
