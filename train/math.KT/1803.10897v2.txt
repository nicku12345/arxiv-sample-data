Given a henselian pair (R, I) of commutative rings, we show that the relative K-theory and relative topological cyclic homology with finite coefficients are identified via the cyclotomic trace K \to \mathrm{TC}. This yields a generalization of the classical Gabber-Gillet-Thomason-Suslin rigidity theorem (for mod n coefficients, with n invertible in R) and McCarthy's theorem on relative K-theory (when I is nilpotent).   We deduce that the cyclotomic trace is an equivalence in large degrees between p-adic K-theory and topological cyclic homology for a large class of p-adic rings. In addition, we show that K-theory with finite coefficients satisfies continuity for complete noetherian rings which are F-finite modulo p. Our main new ingredient is a basic finiteness property of \mathrm{TC} with finite coefficients.
