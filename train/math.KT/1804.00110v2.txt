We prove a Fredholm property for spin-c Dirac operators \mathsf{D} on non-compact manifolds satisfying a certain condition with respect to the action of a semi-direct product group K\ltimes \Gamma, with K compact and \Gamma discrete. We apply this result to an example coming from the theory of Hamiltonian loop group spaces. In this context we prove that a certain index pairing [\mathcal{X}] \cap [\mathsf{D}] yields an element of the formal completion R^{-\infty}(T) of the representation ring of a maximal torus T \subset G; the resulting element has an additional antisymmetry property under the action of the affine Weyl group, indicating [\mathcal{X}] \cap [\mathsf{D}] corresponds to an element of the ring of projective positive energy representations of the loop group.
