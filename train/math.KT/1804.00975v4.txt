Invoking the density argument of Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy, we extend the Fundamental Theorem of K-theory from the category of simplicial rings to the category of \mathbb{S}-algebras. As an intermediate step, we prove the Fundamental Theorem for simplicial rings appealing to recent results from the first author's thesis. This recovers as a special case the Fundamental Theorem for the K-theory of spaces appearing in H\"uttemann-Klein-Vogell-Waldhausen-Williams.
