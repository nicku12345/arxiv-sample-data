Given a locally compact group G, we study the smallest exact crossed-product functor (A,G,\alpha)\mapsto A\rtimes_{\mathcal E} G on the category of G-C^*-dynamical systems. As an outcome, we show that the smallest exact crossed-product functor is automatically Morita compatible, and hence coincides with the functor \rtimes_{\mathcal{E}} as introduced by Baum, Guentner, and Willett in their reformulation of the Baum-Connes conjecture (see [2]). We show that the corresponding group algebra C_{\mathcal{E}}^*(G) always coincides with the reduced group algebra, thus showing that the new formulation of the Baum-Connes conjecture coincides with the classical one in the case of trivial coefficients.   Erratum: After publication of this manuscript, some gaps have unfortunately been found affecting some parts of the paper. We therefore included an appendix with an erratum at the end of this paper explaining the mistakes and keeping the original published version unchanged.
