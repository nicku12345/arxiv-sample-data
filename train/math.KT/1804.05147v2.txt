Let X be a torus manifold with locally standard action of a compact torus T of half the dimension and orbit space a homology polytope. Smooth complete complex toric varieties and quasi-toric manifolds are examples of torus manifolds. Consider a principal bundle with total space E and base B with fibre and structure group T. Let E(X) denote the total space of the associated torus manifold bundle. We give a presentation of the singular cohomology ring of E(X) as an algebra over the singular cohomology ring of B and a presentation of the topological K-ring of E(X) as an algebra over the topological K-ring of B. These are relative versions of the results of M. Masuda and T. Panov [13] on the cohomology ring of a torus manifold and P. Sankaran [14] on the topological K-ring of a torus manifold. Further, they extend the results due to P. Sankaran and V. Uma [15] on the cohomology ring and topological K-ring of toric bundles with fibre a smooth projective toric variety, to a toric bundle with fibre any smooth complete toric variety.
