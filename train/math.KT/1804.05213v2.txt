We describe a map from the equivariant twisted K-homology of a compact, connected, simply connected Lie group G to the Verlinde ring. Our map is described at the level of `D-cycles' for the geometric twisted K-homology of G, and is inverse to the Freed-Hopkins-Teleman isomorphism. As an application, we show that two possible definitions of the `quantization' of a Hamiltonian loop group space are compatible with each other.
