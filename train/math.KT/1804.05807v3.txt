In this paper we show that each polynomial exponential functor on complex finite-dimensional inner product spaces is defined up to equivalence of monoidal functors by an involutive solution to the Yang-Baxter equation (an involutive R-matrix), which determines an extremal character on S_{\infty}. These characters are classified by Thoma parameters, and Thoma parameters resulting from polynomial exponential functors are of a special kind. Moreover, we show that each R-matrix with Thoma parameters of this kind yield a corresponding polynomial exponential functor.   In the second part of the paper we use these functors to construct a higher twist over SU(n) for a localisation of K-theory that generalises the one given by the basic gerbe. We compute the indecomposable part of the rational characteristic classes of these twists in terms of the Thoma parameters of their R-matrices.
