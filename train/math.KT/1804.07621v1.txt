Using the theory of framed correspondences developed by Voevodsky [24] and the machinery of framed motives introduced and developed in [6], various explicit fibrant resolutions for a motivic Thom spectrum E are constructed in this paper. It is shown that the bispectrum   M_E^{\mathbb G}(X)=(M_{E}(X),M_{E}(X)(1),M_{E}(X)(2),\ldots), each term of which is a twisted E-framed motive of X, introduced in the paper, represents X_+\wedge E in the category of bispectra. As a topological application, it is proved that the E-framed motive with finite coefficients M_E(pt)(pt)/N, N>0, of the point pt=Spec (k) evaluated at pt is a quasi-fibrant model of the topological S^2-spectrum Re^\epsilon(E)/N whenever the base field k is algebraically closed of characteristic zero with an embedding \epsilon:k\hookrightarrow\mathbb C. Furthermore, the algebraic cobordism spectrum MGL is computed in terms of \Omega-correspondences in the sense of [15]. It is also proved that MGL is represented by a bispectrum each term of which is a sequential colimit of simplicial smooth quasi-projective varieties.
