Toric orbifolds are topological generalization of projrctive toric varieties associated to simplicial fans. We introduce some sufficient conditions on the combinatorial data associated to a toric orbifold to ensure an invariant CW-structure on it. In this paper we study equivariant K-theory, cobordism and cohomology theories of divisive toric orbifolds. These extend the similar results on divisive weighted projective spaces.
