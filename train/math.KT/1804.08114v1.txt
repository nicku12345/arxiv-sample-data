We present a new approach to Poincare duality for Cuntz-Pimsner algebras. We provide sufficient conditions under which Poincare self-duality for the coefficient algebra of a Hilbert bimodule lifts to Poincare self-duality for the associated Cuntz-Pimsner algebra.   With these conditions in hand, we can constructively produce fundamental classes in K-theory for a wide range of examples. We can also produce K-homology fundamental classes for the important examples of Cuntz-Krieger algebras (following Kaminker-Putnam) and crossed products of manifolds by isometries, and their non-commutative analogues.
