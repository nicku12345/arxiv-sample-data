We define and study an analogue of the Baum-Connes assembly map for complex semisimple quantum groups, that is, Drinfeld doubles of  q -deformations of compact semisimple Lie groups.   Our starting point is the deformation picture of the Baum-Connes assembly map for a complex semisimple Lie group  G , which allows one to express the  K -theory of the reduced group  C^* -algebra of  G  in terms of the  K -theory of its associated Cartan motion group. The latter can be identified with the semidirect product of the maximal compact subgroup  K  acting on  \mathfrak{k}^*  via the coadjoint action.   In the quantum case the role of the Cartan motion group is played by the Drinfeld double of the classical group  K , whose associated group  C^* -algebra is the crossed product of  C(K)  with respect to the adjoint action of  K . Our quantum assembly map is obtained by varying the deformation parameter in the Drinfeld double construction applied to the standard deformation  K_q  of  K . We prove that the quantum assembly map is an isomorphism, thus providing a description of the  K -theory of complex quantum groups in terms of classical topology.   Moreover, we show that there is a continuous field of  C^* -algebras which encodes both the quantum and classical assembly maps as well as a natural deformation between them. It follows in particular that the quantum assembly map contains the classical Baum-Connes assembly map as a direct summand.
