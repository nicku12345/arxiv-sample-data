We compute the equivariant K-theory ring of a cohomogeneity-one action of a compact Lie group. The general expressions extend to a range of other multiplicative cohomology theories including Bredon cohomology. Much more explicit expressions are given if when the space is a smooth manifold and the fundamental group of the principal isotropy is free abelian. Determining the multiplication in this ring involves a natural structure, which seems to be at best folklore, on the Mayer--Vietoris sequence in any multiplicative equivariant cohomology theory. A similarly general lemma is proven regarding the cohomology of a finite covering whose order is invertible in the coefficient system. Once this is set up, most of the proof is an analysis of maps of representation rings.
