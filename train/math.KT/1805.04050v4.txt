We show that in a smooth family of complete varieties, the existence of full exceptional collection on a fiber preserves for the fibers in a neighborhood. Then we show that the noncommutative deformations of a strong exceptional collection of vector bundles induce the same map on the second Hochschild cohomology as the canonical isomorphism induced by the derived equivalence to the corresponding endomorphism algebra.
