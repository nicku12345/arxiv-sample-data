Generalizing the definition of Cartier, we introduce p^n-typical formal group laws over \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}-algebras. An oriented cohomology theory in the sense of Levin-Morel is called p^n-typical if its corresponding formal group law is p^n-typical. The main result of the paper is the construction of 'Chern classes' from the algebraic n-th Morava K-theory to every p^n-typical oriented cohomology theory.   If the coefficient ring of a p^n-typical theory is a free \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}-module we also prove that these Chern classes freely generate all operations to it. Examples of such theories are algebraic mn-th Morava K-theories K(nm)^* for all m\in\mathbb{N} and \mathrm{CH}^*\otimes\mathbb{Z}_{(p)} (operations to Chow groups were studied in a previous paper). The universal p^n-typical oriented theory is BP\{n\}^*=BP^*/(v_j,j\nmid n) which coefficient ring is also a free \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}-module.   Chern classes from the n-th algebraic Morava K-theory K(n)^* to itself allow us to introduce the gamma filtration on K(n)^*. This is the best approximation to the topological filtration obtained by values of operations and it satisfies properties similar to that of the classical gamma filtration on K_0. The major difference from the classical case is that Chern classes from the graded factors gr^i_\gamma K(n)^* to \mathrm{CH}^i\otimes\mathbb{Z}_{(p)} are surjective for i\le p^n. For some projective homogeneous varieties this allows to estimate p-torsion in Chow groups of codimension up to p^n.
