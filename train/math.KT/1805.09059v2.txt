In the present article we discuss an approach to cohomological invariants of algebraic groups over fields of characteristic zero based on the Morava K-theories, which are generalized oriented cohomology theories in the sense of Levine--Morel.   We show that the second Morava K-theory detects the triviality of the Rost invariant and, more generally, relate the triviality of cohomological invariants and the splitting of Morava motives.   We describe the Morava K-theory of generalized Rost motives, compute the Morava K-theory of some affine varieties, and characterize the powers of the fundamental ideal of the Witt ring with the help of the Morava K-theory. Besides, we obtain new estimates on torsion in Chow groups of codimensions up to 2^n of quadrics from the (n+2)-nd power of the fundamental ideal of the Witt ring. We compute torsion in Chow groups of K(n)-split varieties with respect to a prime p in all codimensions up to \frac{p^n-1}{p-1} and provide a combinatorial tool to estimate torsion up to codimension p^n. An important role in the proof is played by the gamma filtration on Morava K-theories, which gives a conceptual explanation of the nature of the torsion.   Furthermore, we show that under some conditions the K(n)-motive of a smooth projective variety splits if and only if its K(m)-motive splits for all m\le n.
