We disprove two (unpublished) conjectures of Kontsevich which state generalized versions of categorical Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration for smooth and for proper DG categories (but not smooth and proper, in which case degeneration is proved by Kaledin \cite{Ka}). In particular, we show that there exists a minimal 10-dimensional A_{\infty}-algebra over a field of characteristic zero, for which the supertrace of \mu_3 on the second argument is non-zero.   As a byproduct, we obtain an example of a homotopically finitely presented DG category (over a field of characteristic zero) that does not have a smooth categorical compactification, giving a negative answer to a question of To\"en. This can be interpreted as a lack of resolution of singularities in the noncommutative setup.   We also obtain an example of a proper DG category which does not admit a categorical resolution of singularities in the terminology of Kuznetsov and Lunts \cite{KL} (that is, it cannot be embedded into a smooth and proper DG category).
