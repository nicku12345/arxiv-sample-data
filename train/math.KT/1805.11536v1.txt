For a model category, we prove that taking the category of coalgebras over a comonad commutes with left Bousfield localization in a suitable sense. Then we prove a general existence result for left-induced model structure on the category of coalgebras over a comonad in a left Bousfield localization. Next we provide several equivalent characterizations of when a left Bousfield localization preserves coalgebras over a comonad. These results are illustrated with many applications in chain complexes, (localized) spectra, and the stable module category.
