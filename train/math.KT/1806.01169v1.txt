In this paper we define a new cohomology for multiplicative Hom-associative algebras, which generalize Hochschild cohomology and fits with deformations of Hom-associative algebras including the structure map \alpha. It is a generalization of the known Hochschild-type cohomology for Hom-associative algebras defined by Amar, Ejbehi and Makhlouf. Moreover, we provide various observations and similarly a new cohomology of Hom-bialgebras extending the Gerstenhaber-Schack cohomology for Hom-bialgebras given by Dekkar and Makhlouf.
