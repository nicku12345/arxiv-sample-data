We generalize Roe's index theorem for graded generalized Dirac operators on amenable manifolds to multigraded elliptic uniform pseudodifferential operators. The generalization will follow from a local index theorem that is valid on any manifold of bounded geometry. This local formula incorporates the uniform estimates present in the definition of uniform pseudodifferential operators.
