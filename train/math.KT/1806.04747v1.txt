A ring R is said to be of stable range 1.5 if for each a, b from R and nonzero c from R satisfying aR + bR + cR = R there exists r from R such that (a + br)R + cR = R. Let R be a commutative domain in which all finitely generated ideals are principal, and let R be of stable range 1.5. Then each matrix A over R is reduced to Smith's canonical form by transformations PAQ in which P and Q are invertible and at least one of them can be chosen to be a product of elementary matrices. We generalize Helmer's theorem about the greatest common divisor of entries of A over R.
