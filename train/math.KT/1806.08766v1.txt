Let F be a local field with residue field k. The classifying space of GL_n(F) comes canonically equipped with a map to the delooping of the K-theory space of k. Passing to loop spaces, such a map abstractly encodes a homotopy coherently associative map of A-infinity-spaces GL_n(F)\to K_k. Using a generalized Waldhausen construction, we construct an explicit model built for the A_\infty-structure of this map, built from nested systems of lattices in F^n. More generally, we construct this model in the framework of Tate objects in exact categories, with finite dimensional vector spaces over local fields as a motivating example.
