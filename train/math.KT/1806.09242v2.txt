In this paper we address the classification problem for purely infinite simple Leavitt path algebras of finite graphs over a field \ell. Each graph E has associated a Leavitt path \ell-algebra L(E). There is an open question which asks whether the pair (K_0(L(E)), [1_{L(E)}]), consisting of the Grothendieck group together with the class [1_{L(E)}] of the identity, is a complete invariant for the classification, up to algebra isomorphism, of those Leavitt path algebras of finite graphs which are purely infinite simple. We show that (K_0(L(E)), [1_{L(E)}]) is a complete invariant for the classification of such algebras up to polynomial homotopy equivalence. To prove this we develop the bivariant algebraic K-theory of Leavitt path algebras and obtain several results of independent interest.
