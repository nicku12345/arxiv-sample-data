This paper examines a number of related questions about Euler characteristics and characteristic classes with values in Witt cohomology. We establish a motivic version of the Becker-Gottllieb transfer, generalizing a construction of Hoyois.   Ananyevskiy's splitting principle reduces questions about characteristic classes of vector bundles in \text{SL}-oriented, \eta-invertible theories to the case of rank two bundles. We refine the torus-normalizer splitting principle for \text{SL}_2 to help compute the characteristic classes in Witt cohomology of symmetric powers of a rank two bundle, and then generalize this to develop a general calculus of characteristic classes with values in Witt cohomology.
