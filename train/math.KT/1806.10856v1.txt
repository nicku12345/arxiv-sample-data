We consider the Burns-Flach formulation of the equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture (ETNC). In their setup, a Tamagawa number is an element of a relative K-group. We show that this relative group agrees with an ordinary K-group, namely of the category of locally compact topological modules over the order. Its virtual objects are an equivariant Haar measure in a precise sense. We expect that all relative K-groups in the ETNC will have analoguous interpretations. At present, we need to restrict to regular orders, e.g. hereditary.
