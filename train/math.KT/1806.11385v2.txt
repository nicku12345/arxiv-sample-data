We introduce the notion of crystallographic T-duality, inspired by the appearance of K-theory with graded equivariant twists in the study of topological crystalline materials. Besides giving a range of new topological T-dualities, it also unifies many previously known dualities, motivates generalisations of the Baum-Connes conjecture to graded groups, provides a powerful tool for computing topological phase classification groups, and facilitates the understanding of crystallographic bulk-boundary correspondences in physics.
