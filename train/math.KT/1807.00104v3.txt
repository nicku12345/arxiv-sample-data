Let K be a complete discrete valuation field with finite residue field of characteristic p, and let D be a central division algebra over K of finite index d. Thirty years ago, Suslin and Yufryakov showed that for all prime numbers \ell different from p and integers j \geq 1 , there exists a "reduced norm" isomorphism of \ell-adic K-groups \operatorname{Nrd}_{D/K} \colon K_j(D,\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}) \to K_j(K,\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}) such that d \cdot \operatorname{Nrd}_{D/K} is equal to the norm homomorphism N_{D/K}. The purpose of this paper is to prove the analogous result for the p-adic K-groups.   To do so, we employ the cyclotomic trace map to topological cyclic homology and show that there exists a "reduced trace" equivalence \operatorname{Trd}_{A/S} \colon \operatorname{THH}(A\,|\,D,\mathbb{Z}_p) \to \operatorname{THH}(S\,|\,K,\mathbb{Z}_p) between two p-complete cyclotomic spectra associated with D and K, respectively. Interestingly, we show that if p divides d, then it is not possible to choose said equivalence such that, as maps of cyclotomic spectra, d \cdot \operatorname{Trd}_{A/S} agrees with the trace \operatorname{Tr}_{A/S}, although this is possible as maps of spectra with \mathbb{T}-action.
