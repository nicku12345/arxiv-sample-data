We give a general construction of realization functors for t-structures on the base of a strong stable derivator. In particular, given such a derivator \mathbb D, a t-structure \mathbf t=(\mathcal D^{\leq0},\mathcal D^{\geq0}) on the triangulated category \mathbb D(\mathbb 1), and letting \mathcal A=\mathcal D^{\leq0}\cap \mathcal D^{\geq0} be its heart, we construct, under mild assumptions, a morphism of prederivators \[ \mathrm{real}_{\mathbf t}\colon \mathbf{D}_{\mathcal A}\to \mathbb D \] where \mathbf{D}_{\mathcal A} is the natural prederivator enhancing the derived category of \mathcal A. Furthermore, we give criteria for this morphism to be fully faithful and essentially surjective. If the t-structure \mathbf t is induced by a suitably "bounded" co/tilting object, \mathrm{real}_{\mathbf t} is an equivalence. Our construction unifies and extends most of the derived co/tilting equivalences appeared in the literature in the last years.
