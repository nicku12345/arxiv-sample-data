We prove that the ideal used in recent works to categorify the cyclotomic integers is generated by a cyclotomic polynomial. Moreover, we publish a proof by T. Ekedahl that the q-binomial relations used in the tensor product of N-complexes makes it necessary for the category to be enriched over the cyclotomic integers.
