We give a streamlined proof of {\mathbb A}^1-representability for G-torsors under "isotropic" reductive groups, extending previous results in this sequence of papers to finite fields. We then analyze a collection of group homomorphisms that yield fiber sequences in {\mathbb A}^1-homotopy theory, and identify the final examples of motivic spheres that arise as homogeneous spaces for reductive groups.
