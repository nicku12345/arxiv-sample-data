We study a Grothendieck topology on schemes which we call the \mathrm{arc}-topology. This topology is a refinement of the v-topology (the pro-version of Voevodsky's h-topology) where covers are tested via rank \leq 1 valuation rings. Functors which are \mathrm{arc}-sheaves are forced to satisfy a variety of glueing conditions such as excision in the sense of algebraic K-theory.   We show that \'etale cohomology is an \mathrm{arc}-sheaf and deduce various pullback squares in \'etale cohomology. Using \mathrm{arc}-descent, we reprove the Gabber-Huber affine analog of proper base change (in a large class of examples), as well as the Fujiwara-Gabber base change theorem on the \'etale cohomology of the complement of a henselian pair. As a final application we prove a rigid analytic version of the Artin-Grothendieck vanishing theorem from SGA4, extending results of Hansen.
