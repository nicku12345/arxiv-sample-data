We construct a Baum--Connes assembly map localised at the unit element of a discrete group \Gamma. This morphism, called \mu_\tau, is defined in KK-theory with coefficients in \mathbb{R} by means of the action of the projection [\tau]\in KK_{\mathbb{R}}^\Gamma(\mathbb{C},\mathbb{C}) canonically associated to the group trace of \Gamma. We show that the corresponding \tau-Baum--Connes conjecture is weaker then the classical one but still implies the strong Novikov conjecture. The right hand side of \mu_\tau is functorial with respect to the group \Gamma.
