Let X be a topological space. We consider certain generalized configuration spaces of points on X, obtained from the cartesian product X^n by removing some intersections of diagonals. We give a systematic framework for studying the cohomology of such spaces using what we call "tcdga models" for the cochains on X. We prove the following theorem: suppose that X is a "nice" topological space, R is any commutative ring, H^\bullet_c(X,R)\to H^\bullet(X,R) is the zero map, and that H^\bullet_c(X,R) is a projective R-module. Then the compact support cohomology of any generalized configuration space of points on X depends only on the graded R-module H^\bullet_c(X,R). This generalizes a theorem of Arabia.
