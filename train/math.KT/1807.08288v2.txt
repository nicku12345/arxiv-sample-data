We study C*-algebras generated by left regular representations of right LCM one-relator monoids and Artin-Tits monoids of finite type. We obtain structural results concerning nuclearity, ideal structure and pure infiniteness. Moreover, we compute K-theory. Based on our K-theory results, we develop a new way of computing K-theory for certain group C*-algebras and crossed products.
