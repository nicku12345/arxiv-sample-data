We improve our previous results on indefinite Kasparov modules, which provide a generalisation of unbounded Kasparov modules modelling non-symmetric and non-elliptic (e.g. hyperbolic) operators. In particular, we can weaken the assumptions that are imposed on indefinite Kasparov modules. Using a new theorem by Lesch and Mesland on the self-adjointness and regularity of the sum of two weakly anticommuting operators, we show that we still have an equivalence between indefinite Kasparov modules and pairs of Kasparov modules. Importantly, the weakened version of indefinite Kasparov modules now includes the main motivating example of the Dirac operator on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. The appendix contains a construction of an approximate identity for weakly commuting operators, which is due to Lesch and Mesland.
