In this paper, we obtain a localization formula in differential K-theory for S^1-action. Then by combining an extension of Goette's result on the comparison of two types of equivariant \eta-invariants, we establish a version of localization formula for equivariant \eta-invariants. An important step of our approach is to construct a pre-\lambda-ring structure in differential K-theory which is interesting in its own right.
