We study collections of additive categories \mathcal{M}(G), indexed by finite groups G and related by induction and restriction in a way that categorifies usual Mackey functors. We call them `Mackey 2-functors'. We provide a large collection of examples in particular thanks to additive derivators. We prove the first properties of Mackey 2-functors, including separable monadicity of restriction to subgroups. We then isolate the initial such structure, leading to what we call `Mackey 2-motives'. We also exhibit a convenient calculus of morphisms in Mackey 2-motives, by means of string diagrams. Finally, we show that the 2-endomorphism ring of the identity of G in this 2-category of Mackey 2-motives is isomorphic to the so-called crossed Burnside ring of G.
