The aim of this paper is to give the geometric realization of regular path complexes via (co)homology groups with coefficients in a ring R. Concretely, for each regular path complex P, we associate it with a singular \Delta-complex S(P) and show that the (co)homology groups of P are isomorphic to those of S(P) with coefficients in R. As a direct result we recognize path (co)homology as Hochschild (co)homology in case that R is commutative and P regular finite. Analogues of the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem and K\"{u}nneth formula are also showed for the Cartesian product and the join of two regular path complexes. In fact, we meanwhile improve some previous results which are covered by these conclusions in this paper.
