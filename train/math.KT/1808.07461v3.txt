In a known papers, A. Ivashchenko shows the family of contractible graphs, constructed from K(1) by contractible transformations, and he proves that such transformations do not change the homology groups of graphs. In this paper, we show that a (strong) contractible graph is actually a collapsible graph (in the simplicial sense), from which the invariance of the homology follows. In addition, we extend a result of A. Ivashchenko about graph homology, to a filtration of graphs, and we prove that the persistent homology is preserved with respect to contractible transformations. We apply this property as an algorithm to preprocess a data cloud and reduce the computation of the persistent homology for the filtered Vietoris-Rips complex.
