In this paper, we first study the Gorenstein projective/flat dimension of complexes of modules. The relation between the Gorenstein projective/flat dimension for complexes and that for modules are investigated. Then we study Tate, stable and unbounded homology for complexes of modules. In the case of module arguments, we get some results that improve the known results.
