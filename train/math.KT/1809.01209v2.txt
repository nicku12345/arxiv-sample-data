Let G be a group, let H be a subgroup of G and let \Or(G) be the orbit category. In this paper we extend the definition of the relative group (co)homology theories of the pair (G,H) defined by Adamson and Takasu to have coefficients in an \Or(G)-module. There is a canonical comparison homomorphism defined by Cisneros-Molina and Arciniega-Nev\'arez from Takasu's theory to Adamson's one. We give a necessary and sufficient condition on the subgroup H for which the comparison homomorphism is an isomorphism for all coefficients. We also use the L\"uck-Wiermann construction to introduce a long exact sequence for Adamson (co)homology. Finally, we provide some examples of explicit computations for the comparison homomorphism.
