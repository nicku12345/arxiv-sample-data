We construct and study a t-structure on p-typical cyclotomic spectra and explain how to recover crystalline cohomology of smooth schemes over perfect fields using this t-structure. Our main tool is a new approach to p-typical cyclotomic spectra via objects we call p-typical topological Cartier modules. Using these, we prove that the heart of the cyclotomic t-structure is the full subcategory of derived V-complete objects in the abelian category of p-typical Cartier modules.
