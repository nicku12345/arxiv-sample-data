In this paper, we consider the Hermitian K-theory of schemes with involution, for which we construct a transfer morphism and prove a version of the d\'{e}vissage theorem. This theorem is then used to compute the Hermitian K-theory of \mathbb{P}^1 with involution given by [X:Y] \mapsto [Y:X]. We also prove the C_2-equivariant \A^1-invariance of Hermitian K-theory, which confirms the representability of Hermitian K-theory in the C_2-equivariant motivic homotopy category of Heller, Krishna and \{O}stv\ae r \cite{HKO14}.
