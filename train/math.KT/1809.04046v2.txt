This paper describes constructions in homological algebra that are part of a strategy whose goal is to understand and classify symplectic mapping tori. More precisely, given a dg category and an auto-equivalence, satisfying certain assumptions, we introduce a category M_\phi-called the mapping torus category that describes the wrapped Fukaya category of an open symplectic mapping torus. Then we define a family of bimodules on a natural deformation of M_\phi, uniquely characterize it and using this, we distinguish M_\phi from the mapping torus category of the identity. The proof of the equivalence of M_\phi with wrapped Fukaya category is proven in a different paper (arXiv:1907.01156).
