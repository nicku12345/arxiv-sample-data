The concepts of a dihedral and a reflexive module with \infty-simplicial faces are introduced. For each involutive A_\infty-algebra, the dihedral and the reflexive tensor modules with \infty-simplicial faces are constructed. On the basis of dihedral and reflexive modules with \infty-simplicial faces that defined by an involutive A_\infty-algebra the constructions of the dihedral and the reflexive homology of involutive A_\infty-algebras over any unital commutative rings are given. The conception of an involutive homotopy unital A_\infty-algebra is introduced. A long exact sequence that connecting the dihedral and the reflexive homology of involutive homotopically unital A_\infty-algebras over any unital commutative rings is constructed.
