An alternative approach to the classical Morel-Voevodsky stable motivic homotopy theory SH(k) is suggested. The triangulated category of framed bispectra SH_{nis}^{fr}(k) and effective framed bispectra SH_{nis}^{fr,eff}(k) are introduced in the paper. Both triangulated categories only use Nisnevich local equivalences and have nothing to do with any kind of motivic equivalences. It is shown that SH_{nis}^{fr}(k) and SH_{nis}^{fr,eff}(k) recover the classical Morel-Voevodsky triangulated categories of bispectra SH(k) and effective bispectra SH^{eff}(k) respectively.   We also recover SH(k) and SH^{eff}(k) as the triangulated category of framed motivic spectral functors SH_{S^1}^{fr}[\mathcal Fr_0(k)] and the triangulated category of framed motives \mathcal {SH}^{fr}(k) respectively constructed in the paper.
