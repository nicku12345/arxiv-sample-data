We develop a new spectral sequence in order to calculate Hochschild homology of smash biproducts (also called twisted tensor products) of unital associative algebras A\# B provided one of A or B has Hochschild dimension less than 2. We use this spectral sequence to calculate Hochschild homology of quantum tori, multiparametric quantum affine spaces, quantum complete intersections, quantum Weyl algebras, deformed completed Weyl algebras, and finally the algebra M_q(2) of quantum 2\times 2-matrices.
