In this paper we study Schlichting's K-theory groups of the Buchweitz-Orlov singularity category \mathcal{D}^{sg}(X) of a quasi-projective algebraic scheme X/k with applications to Algebraic K-theory. We prove that for isolated quotient singularities \mathrm{K}_0(\mathcal{D}^{sg}(X)) is finite torsion, and that \mathrm{K}_1(\mathcal{D}^{sg}(X)) = 0. One of the main applications is that algebraic varieties with isolated quotient singularities satisfy rational Poincare duality on the level of the Grothendieck group; this allows computing the Grothendieck group of such varieties in terms of their resolution of singularities. Other applications concern the Grothendieck group of perfect complexes supported at a singular point and topological filtration on the Grothendieck groups.
