Let k be an algebraically closed field, l\neq\operatorname{char} k a prime number, and X a quasi-projective scheme over k. We show that the \'etale homotopy type of the dth symmetric power of X is \mathbb Z/l-homologically equivalent to the dth strict symmetric power of the \'etale homotopy type of X. We deduce that the \mathbb Z/l-local \'etale homotopy type of a motivic Eilenberg-Mac Lane space is an ordinary Eilenberg-Mac Lane space.
