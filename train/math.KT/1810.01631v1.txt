This article is a survey on the cohomology of a reductive algebraic group with coefficients in twisted representations. A large part of the paper is devoted to the advances obtained by the theory of strict polynomial functors initiated by Friedlander and Suslin in the late nineties. The last section explains that the existence of certain `universal classes' used to prove cohomological finite generation is equivalent to some recent `untwisting theorems' in the theory of strict polynomial functors. We actually provide thereby a new proof of these theorems.
