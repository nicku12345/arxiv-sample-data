A paper of U. First & Z. Reichstein proves that if R is a commutative ring of dimension d, then any Azumaya algebra A over R can be generated as an algebra by d+2 elements, by constructing such a generating set, but they do not prove that this number of generators is required, or even that for an arbitrarily large r that there exists an Azumaya algebra requiring r generators. In this paper, for any given fixed n\ge 2, we produce examples of a base ring R of dimension d and an Azumaya algebra of degree n over R that requires r(d,n) = \lfloor \frac{d}{2n-2} \rfloor + 2 generators. While r(d,n) < d+2 in general, we at least show that there is no uniform upper bound on the number of generators required for Azumaya algebras. The method of proof is to consider certain varieties B^r_n that are universal varieties for degree-n Azumaya algebras equipped with a set of r generators, and specifically we show that a natural map on Chow group CH^{(r-1)(n-1)}_{PGL_n} \to CH^{(r-1)(n-1)}(B^r_n) fails to be injective, which is to say that the map fails to be injective in the first dimension in which it possibly could fail. This implies that for a sufficiently generic rank-n Azumaya algebra, there is a characteristic class obstruction to generation by r elements.
