We formulate the (co)bar construction theory of dg K-(co)rings and the calculus theory of the Hochschild homology and cohomology of dg K-rings. As applications, we compare the Hochschild (co)homologies of a complete typical dg K-ring and its Koszul dual. Moreover, we show that the Koszul dual of a finite dimensional complete typical d-symmetric dg K-ring is a d-Calabi-Yau dg algebra whose Hochschild cohomology is a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra. Furthermore, we prove that the Hochschild cohomologies of a finite dimensional complete typical d-symmetric dg K-ring and its Koszul dual are isomorphic as Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras. In conclusion, we found a connection between the Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structures on the Hochschild cohomologies of d-Calabi-Yau dg algebras and d-symmetric dg K-rings.
