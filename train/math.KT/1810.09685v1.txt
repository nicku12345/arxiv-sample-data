We compute the equivariant K-theory with integer coefficients of an equivariantly formal isotropy action, subject to natural hypotheses which cover the three major classes of known examples. The proof proceeds by constructing a map of spectral sequences from Hodgkin's K\"unneth spectral sequence in equivariant K-theory to that in Borel cohomology. A new characterization of equivariant formality appears as a consequence of this construction, and we are now able to show that weak equivariant formality in the sense of Harada--Landweber is equivalent with integer coefficients to surjectivity of the forgetful map under a standard hypothesis.   The main structure theorem is formally similar to that for Borel equivariant cohomology, which appears in the author's dissertation/dormant book project and whose proof is finally made accessible in an appendix. The most generally applicable corollary of the main theorem for rational coefficients depends on a strengthening of the characterization of equivariant formality due to Shiga and Takahashi, which appears as a second appendix.
