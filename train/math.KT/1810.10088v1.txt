The Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjecture (LQC) relates special values of zeta functions to algebraic K-theory groups. The Ausoni-Rognes red-shift conjectures generalize the LQC to higher chromatic heights in a precise sense. In this paper, we propose an alternate generalization of the LQC to higher chromatic heights and prove a highly nontrivial case this conjecture. In particular, if the n-th Greek letter family is detected by a commutative ring spectrum R, then we conjecture that the n+1-st Greek letter family will be detected by the algebraic K-theory of R. We prove this in the case n=1 for R=K(\mathbb{F}_q)_p where p\ge 5 and q is prime power generator of the units in \mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}. In particular, we prove that the commutative ring spectrum K(K(\mathbb{F}_q)_p) detects the \beta-family. The method of proof also implies that the \beta-family is detected in iterated algebraic K-theory of the integers. Consequently, one may relate iterated algebraic K-theory groups of the integers to modular forms satisfying certain congruences.
