By a diagonal embedding of U(1) in SU_q(m), we prolongate the diagonal circle action on the Vaksman-Soibelman quantum sphere S^{2n+1}_q to the SU_q(m)-action on the prolongated bundle. Then we prove that the noncommutative vector bundles associated via the fundamental representation of SU_q(m), for m\in\{2,\ldots,n\}, yield generators of the even K-theory group of the C*-algebra of the Vaksman-Soibelman quantum complex projective space \mathbb{C}{\rm P}^n_q.
