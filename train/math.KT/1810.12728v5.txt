It is known that for a prime p\ne 2 there is the following natural description of the homology algebra of an abelian group H_*(A,\mathbb F_p)\cong \Lambda(A/p)\otimes \Gamma({}_pA) and for finitely generated abelian groups there is the following description of the cohomology algebra of H^*(A,\mathbb F_p)\cong \Lambda((A/p)^\vee)\otimes {\sf Sym}(({}_pA)^\vee). We prove that there are no such descriptions for p=2 that `depend' only on A/2 and {}_2A but we provide natural descriptions of H_*(A,\mathbb F_2) and H^*(A,\mathbb F_2) that `depend' on A/2, {}_2A and a linear map \tilde \beta:{}_2A\to A/2. Moreover, we prove that there is a filtration by subfunctors on H_n(A,\mathbb F_2) whose quotients are \Lambda^{n-2i}(A/2)\otimes \Gamma^i({}_2A) and that for finitely generated abelian groups there is a natural filtration on H^n(A,\mathbb F_2) whose quotients are  \Lambda^{n-2i}((A/2)^\vee)\otimes {\sf Sym}^i(({}_2A)^\vee).
