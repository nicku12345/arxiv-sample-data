We construct a semi-orthogonal decomposition on the category of perfect complexes on the blow-up of a derived Artin stack in a quasi-smooth centre. This gives a generalization of Thomason's blow-up formula in algebraic K-theory to derived stacks. We also provide a new criterion for descent in Voevodsky's cdh topology, which we use to give a direct proof of Cisinski's theorem that Weibel's homotopy invariant K-theory satisfies cdh descent.
