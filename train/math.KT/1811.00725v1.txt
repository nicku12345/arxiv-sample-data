In this paper we deduce a graded version of Quillen--Suslin's Local-Global Principle for the traditional classical groups, viz. general linear, symplectic and orthogonal groups and establish its equivalence of the normality property of the respective elementary subgroups. This generalizes previous result of Basu--Rao--Khanna. Then, as an application, we establish an analogue Local-Global Principle for the commutator subgroups of the special linear and symplectic groups. Finally, by using Swan-Weibel's homotopy trick, we establish graded analogue of the Local-Global Principle for the transvection subgroups of the full automorphism groups of the linear, symplectic and orthogonal modules. This generalizes the previous result of Bak--Basu--Rao.
