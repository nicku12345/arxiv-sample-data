We study the interplay of the homotopy coniveau tower, the Rost-Schmid complex of a strictly homotopy invariant sheaf, and homotopy modules. For a strictly homotopy invariant sheaf M, smooth k-scheme X and q \geqslant 0 we construct a novel cycle complex C^*(X, M, q) and we prove that in favorable cases, C^*(X, M, q) is equivalent to the homotopy coniveau tower M^{(q)}(X). To do so we establish moving lemmas for the Rost-Schmid complex. As an application we deduce a cycle complex model for Milnor-Witt motivic cohomology. Furthermore we prove that if M is a strictly homotopy invariant sheaf, then M_{-2} is a homotopy module. Finally we conjecture that for q>0, \underline{\pi}_0(M^{(q)}) is a homotopy module, explain the significance of this conjecture for studying conservativity properties of the \mathbb{G}_m-stabilization functor \mathcal{SH}^{S^1}\!(k) \to \mathcal{SH}(k), and provide some evidence for the conjecture.
