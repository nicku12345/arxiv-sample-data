In a previous paper we showed, under some assumptions, that the relative K-group in the Burns-Flach formulation of the equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture (ETNC) is canonically isomorphic to a K-group of locally compact equivariant modules. This viewpoint, as well as the usual one, come with generator-relator presentations (due to Bass-Swan and Nenashev) and in this paper we provide an explicit map.
