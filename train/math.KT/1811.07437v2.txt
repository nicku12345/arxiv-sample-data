Baez asks whether the Euler characteristic (defined for spaces with finite homology) can be reconciled with the homotopy cardinality (defined for spaces with finite homotopy). We consider the smallest infinity category \text{Top}^\text{rx} containing both these classes of spaces and closed under homotopy pushout squares. In our main result, we compute the K-theory K_0(\text{Top}^\text{rx}), which is freely generated by equivalence classes of connected p-finite spaces, as p ranges over all primes. This provides a negative answer to Baez's question globally, but a positive answer when we restrict attention to a prime.
