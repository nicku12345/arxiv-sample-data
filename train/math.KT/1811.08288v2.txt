Let G be a compact Lie group and T its maximal torus. In this paper, we try to compute gr_{\gamma}^*(G/T) the graded ring associated with the gamma filtration of the complex K-theory K^0(G/T) for G=Spin(n). In particular, we give a counterexample for a conjecture by Karpenko when G=Spin(17). The arguments for E_7 in \S 11 of the old version were not correct, and they are deleted in this version.
