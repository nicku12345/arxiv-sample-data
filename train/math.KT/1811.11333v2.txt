In this paper we construct a symmetric monoidal closed model category of coherently commutative monoidal categories. The main aim of this paper is to establish a Quillen equivalence between a model category of coherently commutative monoidal categories and a natural model category of Permutative (or strict symmetric monoidal) categories, \mathbf{Perm}, which is not a symmetric monoidal closed model category. The right adjoint of this Quillen equivalence is the classical Segal's Nerve functor.
