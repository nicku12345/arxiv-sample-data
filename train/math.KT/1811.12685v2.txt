We compute the Chow-Witt rings of split quadrics over a field of characteristic not two. We even determine the full bigraded I-cohomology and Milnor-Witt cohomology rings, including twists by line bundles. The results on I-cohomology corroborate the general philosophy that I-cohomology is an algebro-geometric version of singular cohomology of real varieties: our explicit calculations confirm that the I-cohomology ring of a split quadric over the reals is isomorphic to the singular cohomology ring of the space of its real points.
