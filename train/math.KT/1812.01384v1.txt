By a theorem of Mandell-May-Schwede-Shipley the stable homotopy theory of classical S^1-spectra is recovered from orthogonal spectra. In this paper general linear, special linear, symplectic, orthogonal and special orthogonal motivic spectra are introduced and studied. It is shown that the stable homotopy theory of motivic spectra is recovered from one of these types of spectra. An application is given for the localization functor C_*\mathcal Fr:SH_{nis}(k)\to SH_{nis}(k) in the sense of [12] that converts the Morel-Voevodsky stable motivic homotopy theory SH(k) into the equivalent local theory of framed bispectra [12].
