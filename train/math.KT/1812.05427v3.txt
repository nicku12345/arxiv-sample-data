We consider bisingular pseudodifferential operators which are pseudodifferential operators of tensor product type. These operators are defined on the product manifold M_1 \times M_2 for closed manifolds M_1 and M_2. We obtain results on the Fredholm index of elliptic bisingular operators. To this end we construct a suitable double deformation groupoid and prove that the index can be reduced to a topological formula subject to an obstruction in relative K-theory.
