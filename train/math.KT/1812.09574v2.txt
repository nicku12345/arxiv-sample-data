In this work, we build a spectral sequence in motivic homotopy that is analogous to both the Serre spectral sequence in algebraic topology and the Leray spectral sequence in algebraic geometry. Here, we focus on laying the foundations necessary to build the spectral sequence and give a convenient description of its E_2-page. Our description of the E_2-page is in terms of homology of the local system of fibers, which is given using a theory similar to Rost's cycle modules. We close by providing some sample applications of the spectral sequence and some hints at future work.
