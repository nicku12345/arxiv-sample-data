We develop Tannaka duality theory for dg categories. To any dg functor from a dg category \mathcal{A} to finite-dimensional complexes, we associate a dg coalgebra C via a Hochschild homology construction. When the dg functor is faithful, this gives a quasi-equivalence between the derived dg categories of \mathcal{A}-modules and of C-comodules. When \mathcal{A} is Morita fibrant (i.e. an idempotent-complete pre-triangulated category), it is thus quasi-equivalent to the derived dg category of compact C-comodules. We give several applications for motivic Galois groups.
