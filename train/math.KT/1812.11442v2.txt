Let A be a C*-algebra that is the norm closure A = \overline{\sum_{\beta \in \alpha} I_\beta} of an arbitrary sum of C*-ideals I_\beta \subseteq A. We construct a homological spectral sequence that takes as input the K-theory of \bigcap_{j \in J} I_j for all finite nonempty index sets J \subseteq \alpha and converges strongly to the K-theory of A.   For a coarse space X, the Roe algebra \mathfrak C^* X encodes large-scale properties. Given a coarsely excisive cover \{X_\beta\}_{\beta \in \alpha} of X, we reshape \mathfrak C^* X_\beta as input for the spectral sequence. From the K-theory of \mathfrak C^*X \big( \bigcap_{j \in J} X_j \big) for finite nonempty index sets J \subseteq \alpha, we compute the K-theory of \mathfrak C^* X if \alpha is finite, or of a direct limit C*-ideal of \mathfrak C^* X if \alpha is infinite.   Analogous spectral sequences exist for the algebra \mathfrak D^* X of pseudocompact finite-propagation operators that contains the Roe algebra as a C*-ideal, and for \mathfrak Q^* X = \mathfrak D^* X / \mathfrak C^* X.
