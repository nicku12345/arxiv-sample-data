This paper is dedicated to the study of weight complexes (defined on triangulated categories endowed with weight structures) and their applications. We introduce pure (co)homological functors that "ignore all non-zero weights"; these have a nice description in terms of weight complexes. For the weight structure w^G generated by the orbit category in the G-equivariant stable homotopy category SH(G) the corresponding pure cohomological functors into abelian groups are the Bredon cohomology associated to Mackey functors ones; pure functors related to motivic weight structures are also quite useful.   Our results also give some (more) new weight structures. Moreover, we prove that certain exact functors are conservative and "detect weights".
