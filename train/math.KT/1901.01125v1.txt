Let H_n be the n-th group homology functor (with integer coeffcients) and let \{G_i\} _ {i \in \mathbb{N}} be any tower of groups such that all maps G_{i+1} \to G_i are surjective. In this work we study kernel and cokernel of the following natural map: H_n(\varprojlim G_i) \to \varprojlim H_n(G_i) For n=1 Barnea and Shelah [BS] proved that this map is surjective and its kernel is a cotorsion group for any such tower \{G_i\} _ {i \in \mathbb{N}}. We show that for n=2 the kernel can be non-cotorsion group even in the case when all G_i are abelian and after it we study these kernels and cokernels for towers of abelian groups in more detail.
