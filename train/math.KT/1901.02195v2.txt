We show that various flavors of Witt vectors are functorial with respect to multiplicative polynomial laws of finite degree. We then deduce that the p-typical Witt vectors are functorial in multiplicative polynomial maps of degree at most p-1. This extra functoriality allows us to extend the p-typical Witt vectors functor from commutative rings to \mathbb{Z}/2-Tambara functors, for odd primes p. We use these Witt vectors for Tambara functors to describe the components of the dihedral fixed-points of the real topological Hochschild homology spectrum at odd primes.
