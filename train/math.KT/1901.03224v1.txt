We determine the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Tate-Hochschild cohomology of the group algebra kG of a finite group G in terms of the additive decomposition. In particular, we show that the Tate cohomology of G is a Batalin-Vilkovisky subalgebra of the Tate-Hochschild cohomology of the group algebra kG, and that the Tate cochain complex of G is a cyclic A_{\infty}-subalgebra of the Tate-Hochschild cochain complex of kG.
