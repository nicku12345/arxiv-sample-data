We give a proof of the Bott periodicity theorem for topological K-theory of C*-algebras based on Loring's treatment of Voiculescu's almost commuting matrices and Atiyah's rotation trick. We also explain how this relates to the Dirac operator on the circle; this uses Yu's localization algebra and an associated explicit formula for the pairing between the first K-homology and first K-theory groups of a (separable) C*-algebra.
