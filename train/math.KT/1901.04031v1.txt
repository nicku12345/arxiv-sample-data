We compute the motivic homotopy groups of algebraic cobordism over number fields, the motivic homotopy groups of 2-complete algebraic cobordism over the real numbers and rings of 2-integers and the motivic homotopy groups of mod 2 motivic Morava K-theory over fields with low virtual cohomological dimension. As an application we relate the order of the algebraic cobordism groups of rings of 2-integers to special values of Dedekind \zeta-functions of totally real abelian number fields.
