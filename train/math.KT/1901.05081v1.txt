Let \widetilde{X} be a smooth Riemannian manifold equipped with a proper, free, isometric and cocompact action of a discrete group \Gamma. In this paper we prove that the analytic surgery exact sequence of Higson-Roe for \widetilde{X} is isomorphic to the exact sequence associated to the adiabatic deformation of the Lie groupoid \widetilde{X}\times_\Gamma\widetilde{X}. We then generalize this result to the context of smoothly stratified manifolds. Finally, we show, by means of the aforementioned isomorphism, that the \varrho-classes associated to a metric with positive scalar curvature defined by Piazza and Schick corresponds to the \varrho-classes defined by the author of this paper.
