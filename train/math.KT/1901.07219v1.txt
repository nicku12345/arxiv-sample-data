Let L/F be a finite Galois extension of number fields with an arbitrary Galois group G. We give an explicit description of the kernel of the natural map on motivic tame kernels H^2_{\mathcal{M}}(o_L, {\bf Z}(i))_{G} {\rightarrow} H^2_{\mathcal{M}}(o_F, {\bf Z}(i)). Using the link between motivic cohomology and K-theory, we deduce genus formulae for all even K-groups K_{2i-2}(o_F) of the ring of integers. As a by-product, we also obtain lower bounds for the order of the kernel and cokernel of the functorial map H^2_{\mathcal{M}}(F, {\bf Z}(i)) \rightarrow H^2_{\mathcal{M}}( L, {\bf Z}(i) )^{G}.
