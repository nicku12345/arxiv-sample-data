Let X be a smooth, geometrically connected curve over a perfect field k. Given a connected, reductive group G, we prove that central extensions of G by the sheaf \mathbf K_2 on the big Zariski site of X, studied by J.-L. Brylinski and P. Deligne, are equivalent to factorization line bundles on the Beilinson-Drinfeld affine Grassmannian \operatorname{Gr}_G. Our result affirms a conjecture of D. Gaitsgory and S. Lysenko and classifies factorization line bundles on \operatorname{Gr}_G.
