We prove the Baum--Connes conjecture with arbitrary coefficients for some classes of groups:   (1) Linear algebraic groups over a non-archimedean local field.   (2) Linear algebraic groups over the adeles of a global field k, provided that at every archimedean place of k the associated Lie group is amenable.   (3) All closed subgroups of the above groups. This includes linear algebraic groups over global fields - with the same condition as in (2).   Update: proof of main results incomplete, maybe not repairable.
