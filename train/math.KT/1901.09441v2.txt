This paper investigates the \mathrm{K}-theory of twisted groupoid \mathrm{C}^*-algebras. It is shown that a homotopy of twists on an ample groupoid satisfying the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients gives rise to an isomorphism between the \mathrm{K}-theory groups of the respective twisted groupoid \mathrm{C}^*-algebras. The results are also interpreted in an inverse semigroup setting and applied to generalized Renault-Deaconu groupoids and P-graph algebras.
