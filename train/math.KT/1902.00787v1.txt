In this article we prove that there exists an explicit bijection between nice d-pre-Calabi-Yau algebras and d-double Poisson differential graded algebras, where d \in \mathbb{Z}, extending a result proved by N. Iyudu and M. Kontsevich. We also show that this correspondence is functorial in a quite satisfactory way, giving rise to a (partial) functor from the category of d-double Poisson dg algebras to the partial category of d-pre-Calabi-Yau algebras. Finally, we further generalize it to include double P_{\infty}-algebras, as introduced by T. Schedler.
