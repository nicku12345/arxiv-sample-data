This paper links the third symmetric cohomology (introduced by Staic and Zarelua ) to crossed modules with certain properties. The equivalent result in the language of 2-groups states that an extension of 2-groups corresponds to an element of HS^3 iff it possesses a section which preserves inverses in the 2-categorical sense. This ties in with Staic's (and Zarelua's) result regarding HS^2 and abelian extensions of groups.
