Gillespie's Theorem gives a systematic way to construct model category structures on \mathscr{C}( \mathscr{M} ), the category of chain complexes over an abelian category \mathscr{M}.   We can view \mathscr{C}( \mathscr{M} ) as the category of representations of the quiver \cdots \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow -1 \rightarrow -2 \rightarrow \cdots with the relations that two consecutive arrows compose to 0. This is a self-injective quiver with relations, and we generalise Gillespie's Theorem to other such quivers with relations. There is a large family of these, and following Iyama and Minamoto, their representations can be viewed as generalised chain complexes.   Our result gives a systematic way to construct model category structures on many categories. This includes the category of N-periodic chain complexes, the category of N-complexes where \partial^N = 0, and the category of representations of the repetitive quiver \mathbb{Z} A_n with mesh relations.
