In this paper, we investigate topological aspects of indices of twisted geometric operators on manifolds equipped with fibered boundaries. We define K-groups relative to the pushforward for boundary fibration, and show that indices of twisted geometric operators, defined by complete \Phi or edge metrics, can be regarded as the index pairing over these K-groups. We also prove various properties of these indices using groupoid deformation techniques. Using these properties, we give an application to the localization problem of signature operators for singular fiber bundles.
