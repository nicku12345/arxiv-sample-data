For an integer n>2 we define a polylogarithm, which is a holomorphic function on the universal abelian cover of C-{0,1} defined modulo (2 pi i)^n/(n-1)!. We use the formal properties of its functional relations to define groups lifting Goncharov's Bloch groups of a field F, and show that they fit into a complex lifting Goncharov's Bloch complex. When F=C we show that the imaginary part (when n is even) or real part (when n is odd) of the holomorphic polylogarithm agrees with Goncharov's real valued polylogarithm on the first cohomology group of the lifted Bloch complex. When n=2, this group is Neumann's extended Bloch group. Goncharov's complex conjecturally computes the rational motivic cohomology of F, and one may speculate whether the lifted complex computes the integral motivic cohomology. Finally, we construct a lift of Goncharov's regulator on the 5th homology of SL(3,C) to a complex regulator. This use polylogarithm relations arising from the cluster ensemble structure on the Grassmannians Gr(3,6) and Gr(3,7).
