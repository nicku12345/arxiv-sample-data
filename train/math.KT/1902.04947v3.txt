We introduce the notion of a Bredon-style equivariant coarse homology theory. We show that such a Bredon-style equivariant coarse homology theory satisfies localization theorems and that a general equivariant coarse homology theory can be approximated by a Bredon-style version. We discuss the special case of algebraic and topological equivariant coarse K-homology and obtain the coarse analog of Segal's localization theorem.
