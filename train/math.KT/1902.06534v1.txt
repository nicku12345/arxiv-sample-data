Let F be a complete discrete valuation field whose residue field k is a global field of positive characteristic p. Let D be a central division F-algebra of p-power degree. We prove that the subgroup of F^* consisting of reduced norms of D is exactly the kernel of the cup product map \lambda\in F^*\mapsto (D)\cup(\lambda)\in H^3(F,\,\mathbb{Q}_{p}/\Z_{p}(2)), if either D is tamely ramified or of period p. This gives a p-torsion counterpart of a recent theorem of Parimala, Preeti and Surech, where the same result is proved for division algebras of prime-to-p degree.
