We use sheaves of spectra to quantize a Hamiltonian \coprod\limits_n BO(n)-action on \varinjlim\limits_{N}T^*\mathbf{R}^N that naturally arises from Bott periodicity. We employ the category of correspondences developed in [GaRo] to give an enrichment of stratified Morse theory by the J-homomorphism. This provides a key step in the following work [Jin] on the proof of a claim in [JiTr]: the classifying map of the local system of brane structures on an (immersed) exact Lagrangian submanifold L\subset T^*\mathbf{R}^N is given by the composition of the stable Gauss map L\rightarrow U/O and the delooping of the J-homomorphism U/O\rightarrow B\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbf{S}).   We put special emphasis on the functoriality and (symmetric) monoidal structures of the categories involved, and as a byproduct, we produce several concrete constructions of (commutative) algebra/module objects and (right-lax) morphisms between them in the (symmetric) monoidal (\infty, 2)-category of correspondences, generalizing the construction out of Segal objects in [GaRo], which might be of interest by its own.
