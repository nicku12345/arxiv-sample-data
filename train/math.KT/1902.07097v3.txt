Let G be a finite group, X be a compact G-space. In this note we study the (\mathbb{Z}_ + \times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})-graded algebra \mathcal{F}^q_G(X) = \bigoplus_{n\geq0} q^n \cdot K_{G\wr\mathfrak{S}_n}(X^n)\otimes\mathbb{C}, defined in terms of equivariant K-theory with respect to wreath products as a symmetric algebra. More specifically, let H be another finite group and Y be a compact H-space, we give a decomposition of \mathcal{F}^q_{G\times H}(X\times Y) in terms of \mathcal{F}^q_G(X) and \mathcal{F}^q_H(Y). For this, we need to study the representation theory of pullbacks of groups. We discuss also some applications of the above result to equivariant connective K-homology.
