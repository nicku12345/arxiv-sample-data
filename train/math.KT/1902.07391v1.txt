The equivariant coarse index is well-understood and widely used for actions by discrete groups. We extend the definition of this index to general locally compact groups. We use a suitable notion of admissible modules over C^*-algebras of continuous functions to obtain a meaningful index. Inspired by work by Roe, we then develop a localised variant, with values in the K-theory of a group C^*-algebra. This generalises the Baum-Connes assembly map to non-cocompact actions. We show that an equivariant index for Callias-type operators is a special case of this localised index, obtain results on existence and non-existence of Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature invariant under proper group actions, and show that a localised version of the Baum-Connes conjecture is weaker than the original conjecture, while still giving a conceptual description of the K-theory of a group C^*-algebra.
