The original de Rham cohomology due to Souriau and the singular cohomology in diffeology are not isomorphic to each other in general. This manuscript introduces a singular de Rham complex endowed with an integration map into the singular cochain complex which gives the de Rham theorem for every diffeological space. It is also proved that a morphism called the factor map from the original de Rham complex to the new one is a quasi-isomorphism for a manifold and, more general, a space with singularities. Moreover, Chen's iterated integrals are considered in a diffeological framework. As a consequence, we deduce that the bar complex of the original de Rham complex of a simply-connected diffeological space is quasi-isomorphic to the singular de Rham complex of the diffeological free loop space provided the factor map for the underlying diffeological space is a quasi-isomorphism. The process for proving the assertion yields the Leray--Serre spectral sequence and the Eilenberg--Moore spectral sequence in diffeology.
