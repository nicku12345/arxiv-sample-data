The tensor functor from the category of A_\infty-algebras into the category of differential modules with \infty-simplicial faces is constructed. Further, it is showed that this functor sends homotopy equivalent A_\infty-algebras into homotopy equivalent differential modules with \infty-simplicial faces.
