Using the categorical approach to Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt type theorems from our previous work with Tamaroff, we prove three such theorems: for universal enveloping Rota-Baxter algebras of tridendriform algebras, for universal enveloping Rota--Baxter Lie algebras of post-Lie algebras, and for universal enveloping tridendriform algebras of post-Lie algebras. Similar results, though without functoriality of the PBW isomorphisms, were recently obtained by Gubarev. Our methods are completely different and mainly rely on methods of rewriting theory for shuffle operads.
