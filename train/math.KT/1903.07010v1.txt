We give examples of derived schemes X and a line bundle \Ls on the truncation tX so that \Ls does not extend to the original derived scheme X. In other words the pullback map \Pic(X) \to \Pic(tX) is not surjective. Our examples have the further property that, while their truncations are projective hypersurfaces, they fail to have any nontrivial line bundles, and hence they are not quasi-projective.
