A dendriform algebra is an associative algebra whose product splits into two binary operations and the associativity splits into three new identities. These algebras arise naturally from some combinatorial objects and through Rota-Baxter operators. In this paper, we start by defining cohomology of dendriform algebras with coefficient in a representation. The deformation of a dendriform algebra A is governed by the cohomology of A with coefficient in itself. Next we study \mathrm{Dend}_\infty-algebras (dendriform algebras up to homotopy) in which the dendriform identities hold up to certain homotopy. They are certain splitting of A_\infty-algebras. We define Rota-Baxter operator on A_\infty-algebras which naturally gives rise to \mathrm{Dend}_\infty-algebras. Finally, we classify skeletal and strict \mathrm{Dend}_\infty-algebras.
