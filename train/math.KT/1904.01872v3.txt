Using the framework for multiplicative parametrized homotopy theory introduced in joint work with C. Schlichtkrull, we produce a multiplicative comparison between the homotopical and operator algebraic constructions of twisted K-theory, both in the real and complex case. We also improve several comparison results about twisted K-theory of C*-algebras to include multiplicative structures. Our results can also be interpreted in the infinity-categorical setup for parametrized spectra.
