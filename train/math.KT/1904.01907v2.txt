Extending [13], we obtain a complete description of the motivic cohomology with \mathbb{Z}/2-coefficients of the Nisnevich classifying space of the spin group Spin_n associated to the standard split quadratic form. This provides us with very simple relations among subtle Stiefel-Whitney classes in the motivic cohomology of \v{C}ech simplicial schemes associated to Spin_n-torsors over the point, which are in one-to-one correspondence with quadratic forms from I^3, coming from the action of the motivic Steenrod algebra on the second subtle Stiefel-Whitney class. Moreover, exploiting the relation between Spin_7 and G_2, we describe completely the motivic cohomology ring of the Nisnevich classifying space of G_2.
