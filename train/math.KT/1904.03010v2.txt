Let E/K be a finite Galois extension of totally real number fields with Galois group G. Let p be an odd prime and let r>1 be an odd integer. The p-adic Beilinson conjecture relates the values at s=r of p-adic Artin L-functions attached to the irreducible characters of G to those of corresponding complex Artin L-functions. We show that this conjecture, the equivariant Iwasawa main conjecture and a conjecture of Schneider imply the `p-part' of the equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture for the pair (h^0(\mathrm{Spec}(E))(r), \mathbb Z[G]). If r>1 is even we obtain a similar result for Galois CM-extensions after restriction to `minus parts'. Crucially, our approach does not depend on the vanishing of any \mu-invariant.
