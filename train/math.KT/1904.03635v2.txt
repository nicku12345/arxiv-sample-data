Let F be a field, \ell a prime and D a central division F-algebra of \ell-power degree. By the Rost kernel of D we mean the subgroup of F^* consisting of elements \lambda such that the cohomology class (D)\cup (\lambda)\in H^3(F,\,\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}/\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}(2)) vanishes. In 1985, Suslin conjectured that the Rost kernel is generated by i-th powers of reduced norms from D^{\otimes i},\,\forall i\ge 1. Despite of known counterexamples, we prove some new cases of Suslin's conjecture. We assume F is a henselian discrete valuation field with residue field k of characteristic different from \ell. When D has period \ell, we show that Suslin's conjecture holds if either k is a 2-local field or the cohomological \ell-dimension \mathrm{cd}_{\ell}(k) of k is \le 2. When the period is arbitrary, we prove the same result when k itself is a henselian discrete valuation field with \mathrm{cd}_{\ell}(k)\le 2. In the case \ell=\text{char}(k) an analog is obtained for tamely ramified algebras. We conjecture that Suslin's conjecture holds for all fields of cohomological dimension 3.
