The theory of Topological Modular Forms suggests the existence of deformation invariants for two-dimensional supersymmetric field theories that are more refined than the standard elliptic genus. In this note we give a physical definition of some of these invariants. The theory of mock modular forms makes a surprise appearance, shedding light on the integrality properties of some well-known examples.
