We prove that the tangent complex of K-theory, in terms of (abelian) deformation problems over a characteristic 0 field k, is cyclic homology (over k). This equivalence is compatible with the \lambda-operations. In particular, the relative algebraic K-theory functor fully determines the absolute cyclic homology over any field k of characteristic 0.   We also show that the Loday-Quillen-Tsygan generalized trace comes as the tangent morphism of the canonical map BGL_\infty \to K.   The proof builds on results of Goodwillie, using Wodzicki's excision for cyclic homology and formal deformation theory \`a la Lurie-Pridham.
