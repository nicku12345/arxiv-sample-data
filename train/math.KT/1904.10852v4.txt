Based on recent advances on the relation between geometry and representation theory, we propose a new approach to elliptic Schubert calculus. We study the equivariant elliptic characteristic classes of Schubert varieties of the generalized full flag variety G/B. For this first we need to twist the notion of elliptic characteristic class of Borisov-Libgober by a line bundle, and thus allow the elliptic classes to depend on extra variables. Using the Bott-Samelson resolution of Schubert varieties we prove a BGG-type recursion for the elliptic classes, and study the Hecke algebra of our elliptic BGG operators. For G=GL_n(C) we find representatives of the elliptic classes of Schubert varieties in natural presentations of the K theory ring of G/B, and identify them with the Tarasov-Varchenko weight function. As a byproduct we find another recursion, different from the known R-matrix recursion for the fixed point restrictions of weight functions. On the other hand the R-matrix recursion generalizes for arbitrary reductive group G.
