Consider a proper, isometric action by a unimodular locally compact group G on a Riemannian manifold M with boundary, such that M/G is compact. For an equivariant, elliptic operator D on M, and an element g \in G, we define a numerical index \operatorname{index}_g(D), in terms of a parametrix for D and a trace associated to g. We prove an equivariant Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem for this index. We first state general analytic conditions under which this theorem holds, and then show that these conditions are satisfied if g=e is the identity element; if G is a finitely generated, discrete group, and the conjugacy class of g has polynomial growth; and if G is a connected, linear, real semisimple Lie group, and g is a semisimple element. In the classical case, where M is compact and G is trivial, our arguments reduce to a relatively short and simple proof of the original Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem. In part II of this series, we prove that, under certain conditions, \operatorname{index}_g(D) can be recovered from a K-theoretic index of D via a trace defined by the orbital integral over the conjugacy class of g.
