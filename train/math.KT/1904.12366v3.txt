We study formal deformations of multiplication in an operad. This closely resembles Gerstenhaber's deformation theory for associative algebras. However, this applies to various algebras of Loday-type and their twisted analogs. We explicitly describe the cohomology of these algebras with coefficients in a representation. Finally, deformation of morphisms between algebras of the same Loday-type is also considered.
