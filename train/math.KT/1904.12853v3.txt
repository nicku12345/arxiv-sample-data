We study "canonical weight decompositions" slightly generalizing that defined by J. Wildeshaus. For an triangulated category C, any integer n, and a weight structure w on C a triangle LM\to M\to RM\to LM[1], where LM is of weights at most m-1 and RM is of weights at least n+1 for some m\le n, is determined by M if exists. This happens if and only if the weight complex t(M)\in Obj K(Hw) (Hw is the heart of w) is homotopy equivalent to a complex with zero terms in degrees -n,\dots, -m; hence this condition can be "detected" via pure functors. One can also take m=-\infty or n=+\infty to obtain that the weight complex functor is "conservative and detects weights up to objects of infinitely small and infinitely large weights"; this is a significant improvement over previously known bounded conservativity results. Applying this statement we "calculate intersections of purely generated subcategories" and prove that certain weight-exact functors are conservative up to weight-degenerate objects. The main tool is the new interesting notion of morphisms killing weights m,\dots, n that we study in detail as well.   We apply general results to equivariant stable homotopy categories and spherical weight structures for them (as introduced in the previous paper) and obtain a certain converse to the (equivariant) stable Hurewicz theorem. In particular, the singular homology of a spectrum E vanishes in negative degrees if and only if E is an extension of a connective spectrum by an acyclic one.
