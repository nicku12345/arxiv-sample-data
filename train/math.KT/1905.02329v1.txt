Firstly, we compare the bounded derived categories with respect to the pure-exact and the usual exact structures, and describe bounded derived category by pure-projective modules, under a fairly strong assumption on the ring. Then, we study Verdier quotient of bounded pure derived category modulo the bounded homotopy category of pure-projective modules, which is called a pure singularity category since we show that it reflects the finiteness of pure-global dimension of rings. Moreover, invariance of pure singularity in a recollement of bounded pure derived categories is studied.
