This note consists of three unrelated remarks. First, we demonstrate how roughly speaking *-homomorphisms between matrix stable C^*-algebras are exactly the uniformly continuous *-preserving group homomorphisms between their genral linear groups. Second, using the Cuntz picture in KK-theory we bring morphisms in KK-theory represented by generators and relations to a particular simple form. Third, we show that for an inverse semigroup its associated groupoid is Hausdorff if and only if the inverse semigroup is E-continuous.
