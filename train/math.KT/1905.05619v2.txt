We study the question for which commutative ring spectra A the tensor of a simplicial set X with A, X \otimes A, is a stable invariant in the sense that it depends only on the homotopy type of \Sigma X. We prove several structural properties about different notions of stability, corresponding to different levels of invariance required of X\otimes A, and establish stability in important cases, such as complex and real periodic topological K-theory, KU and KO.
