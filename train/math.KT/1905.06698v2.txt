We specify exterior generators for \pi_* THH(MU) = \pi_*(MU) \otimes E(\lambda'_n \mid n\ge1) and \pi_* THH(BP) = \pi_*(BP) \otimes E(\lambda_n \mid n\ge1), and calculate the action of the \sigma-operator on these graded rings. In particular, \sigma(\lambda'_n) = 0 and \sigma(\lambda_n) = 0, while the actions on \pi_*(MU) and \pi_*(BP) are expressed in terms of the right units \eta_R in the Hopf algebroids (\pi_*(MU), \pi_*(MU \wedge MU)) and (\pi_*(BP), \pi_*(BP \wedge BP)), respectively.
