In this paper we study algebraic and combinatorial properties of Grothendieck polynomials and their dual polynomials by means of the Boson-Fermion correspondence. We show that these symmetric functions can be expressed as a vacuum expectation value of some operator that is written in terms of free-fermions. By using the free-fermionic expressions, we obtain alternative proofs of determinantal formulas and Pieri type formulas.
