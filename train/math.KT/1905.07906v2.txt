We show that the Koszul calculus of a preprojective algebra, whose graph is distinct from A\_1 and A\_2, vanishes in any (co)homological degree p>2. Moreover, its (higher) cohomological calculus is isomorphic as a bimodule to its (higher) homological calculus, by exchanging degrees p and 2-p, and we prove a generalised version of the 2-Calabi-Yau property. For the ADE Dynkin graphs, the preprojective algebras are not Koszul and they are not Calabi-Yau in the sense of Ginzburg's definition, but they satisfy our generalised Calabi-Yau property and we say that they are Koszul complex Calabi-Yau (Kc-Calabi-Yau) of dimension 2. For Kc-Calabi-Yau (quadratic) algebras of any dimension, defined in terms of derived categories, we prove a Poincar\'e Van den Bergh duality theorem. We compute explicitly the Koszul calculus of preprojective algebras for the ADE Dynkin graphs.
