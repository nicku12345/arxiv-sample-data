Let M be a closed connected spin manifold such that its spinor Dirac operator has non-vanishing (Rosenberg) index. We prove that for any Riemannian metric on V = M \times [-1,1] with scalar curvature bounded below by \sigma > 0, the distance between the boundary components of V is at most C_n/\sqrt{\sigma}, where C_n = \sqrt{(n-1)/{n}} \cdot C with C < 8(1+\sqrt{2}) being a universal constant. This verifies a conjecture of Gromov for such manifolds. In particular, our result applies to all high-dimensional closed simply connected manifolds M which do not admit a metric of positive scalar curvature. We also establish a quadratic decay estimate for the scalar curvature of complete metrics on manifolds, such as M \times \mathbb{R}^2, which contain M as a codimension two submanifold in a suitable way. Furthermore, we introduce the "\mathcal{KO}-width" of a closed manifold and deduce that infinite \mathcal{KO}-width is an obstruction to positive scalar curvature.
