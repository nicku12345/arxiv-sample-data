The K-theoretic Farrell-Jones isomorphism conjecture for a group ring R[G] has been proved for several groups. The toolbox for proving the Farrell-Jones conjecture for a given group depends on some geometric properties of the group as it is the case of hyperbolic groups. The technique used to prove it for hyperbolic groups G relies in the concept of an N-transfer space endowed with a G action. In this work, we give an explicit construction of a 1-transfer space.
