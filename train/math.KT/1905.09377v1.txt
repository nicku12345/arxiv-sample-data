It has been asked whether there is a version of the tensor product property for support varieties over finite dimensional algebras defined in terms of Hochschild cohomology. We show that in general no such version can exist. In particular, we show that for certain quantum complete intersections, there are modules and bimodules for which the variety of the tensor product is not even contained in the variety of the one-sided module.
