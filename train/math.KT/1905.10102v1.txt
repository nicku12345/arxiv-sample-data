In this paper we establish Koszul duality type results in the setting of chain complexes in exact categories. In particular we prove generalisations of Vallette's cooperadic Koszul duality theorem, and operadic Koszul duality along the lines of Lurie. We also prove a connective version. We conclude with some applications, including our main example, the category of complete bornological spaces over a Banach field.
