In the present paper the cyclic homology functor from the category of A_\infty-algebras over any commutative unital ring K to the category of graded K-modules is constructed. Further, it is showed that this functor sends homotopy equivalences of A_\infty-algebras into isomorphisms of graded modules. As a corollary, it is obtained that the cyclic homology of an A_\infty-algebra over any field is isomorphic to the cyclic homology of the A_\infty-algebra of homologies for the source A_\infty-algebra.
