In this paper, we introduce a class of locally \Phi-Beilinson-Green algebras which is a way of obtaining algebras from C-constructions, where \Phi is an infinite admissible set of the integral numbers, and show that symmetric approximation sequences in weakly n-angulated categories give rise to derived equivalences between quotient algebras of locally \Phi-Beilinson-Green algebras in the sequences modulo some ghost and coghost ideas by the locally finite tilting sets of complexes. Then we get a class of derived equivalent algebras. Finally, we get derived equivalences between locally \Phi-Beilinson-Green algebras from a given derived equivalence.
