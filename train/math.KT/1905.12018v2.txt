If G has 4-periodic cohomology, then D2 complexes over G are determined up to polarised homotopy by their Euler characteristic if and only if G has at most two one-dimensional quaternionic representations. We use this to solve Wall's D2 problem for several infinite families of non-abelian groups and, in these cases, also show that any finite Poincar\'{e} 3-complex X with \pi_1(X)=G admits a cell structure with a single 3-cell. The proof involves cancellation theorems for \mathbb{Z} G modules where G has periodic cohomology.
