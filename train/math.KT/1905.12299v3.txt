We show that if a countable discrete group acts properly and isometrically on a spin manifold of bounded Riemannian geometry and uniformly positive scalar curvature, then, under a suitable condition on the group action, the maximal higher index of the Dirac operator vanishes in K-theory of the maximal equivariant Roe algebra. The group action is not assumed to be cocompact. A key step in the proof is to establish a functional calculus for the Dirac operator in the maximal equivariant uniform Roe algebra. This allows us to prove vanishing of the index of the Dirac operator in K-theory of this algebra, which in turn yields the result for the maximal higher index.
