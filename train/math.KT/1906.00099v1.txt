The dominant energy condition imposes a restriction on initial value pairs found on a spacelike hypersurface of a Lorentzian manifold. In this article, we study the space of initial values that satisfy this condition strictly. To this aim, we introduce a Lorentzian {\alpha}-invariant for initial value pairs and compare it to its classical counterpart. Recent non-triviality results for the latter will then imply that this space has non-trivial homotopy groups.
