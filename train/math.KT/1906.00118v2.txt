In this work we study the failure of the HKR theorem over rings of positive and mixed characteristic. For this we construct a \emph{filtered circle} interpolating between the usual topological circle and a formal version of it. By mapping to schemes we produce this way a natural interpolation, realized in practice by the existence of a natural filtration, from Hochschild and (a filtered version of) cyclic homology to derived de Rham cohomology. The construction our filtered circle is based upon the theory of affine stacks and affinization introduced by the third author, together with some facts about schemes of Witt vectors.
