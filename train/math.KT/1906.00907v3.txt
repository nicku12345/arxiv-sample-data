The complex orthogonal and symplectic groups both act on the complete flag variety with finitely many orbits. We study two families of polynomials introduced by Wyser and Yong representing the K-theory classes of the closures of these orbits. Our polynomials are analogous to the Grothendieck polynomials representing K-classes of Schubert varieties, and we show that like Grothendieck polynomials, they are uniquely characterized among all polynomials representing the relevant classes by a certain stability property. We show that the same polynomials represent the equivariant K-classes of symmetric and skew-symmetric analogues of Knutson and Miller's matrix Schubert varieties. We derive explicit expressions for these polynomials in special cases, including a Pfaffian formula relying on a more general degeneracy locus formula of Anderson. Finally, we show that taking an appropriate limit of our representatives recovers the K-theoretic Schur Q-functions of Ikeda and Naruse.
