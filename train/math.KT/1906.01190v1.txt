Let N \subset M be a submanifold embedding of spin manifolds of some codimension k \geq 1. A classical result of Gromov and Lawson, refined by Hanke, Pape and Schick, states that M does not admit a metric of positive scalar curvature if k = 2 and the Dirac operator of N has non-trivial index, provided that suitable conditions are satisfied. In the cases k=1 and k=2, Zeidler and Kubota, respectively, established more systematic results: There exists a transfer \mathrm{KO}_\ast(\mathrm{C}^{\ast} \pi_1 M)\to \mathrm{KO}_{\ast - k}(\mathrm{C}^\ast \pi_1 N) which maps the index class of M to the index class of N. The main goal of this article is to construct analogous transfer maps E_\ast(\mathrm{B}\pi_1M) \to E_{\ast-k}(\mathrm{B}\pi_1N) for different generalized homology theories E and suitable submanifold embeddings. The design criterion is that it is compatible with the transfer E_\ast(M) \to E_{\ast-k}(N) induced by the inclusion N \subset M for a chosen orientation on the normal bundle. Under varying restrictions on homotopy groups and the normal bundle, we construct transfers in the following cases in particular: In ordinary homology, it works for all codimensions. This slightly generalizes a result of Engel and simplifies his proof. In complex K-homology, we achieve it for k \leq 3. For k \leq 2, we have a transfer on the equivariant KO-homology of the classifying space for proper actions.
