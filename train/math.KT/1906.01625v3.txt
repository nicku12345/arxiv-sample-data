Quantum toroidal algebras are obtained from quantum affine algebras by a further affinization, and, like the latter, can be used to construct integrable systems. These algebras also describe the symmetries of instanton partition functions for 5D \mathcal{N}=1 supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. We consider here the gauge theories defined on an orbifold S^1\times\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_p where the action of \mathbb{Z}_p is determined by two integer parameters (\nu_1,\nu_2). The corresponding quantum toroidal algebra is introduced as a deformation of the quantum toroidal algebra of \mathfrak{gl}(p). We show that it has the structure of a Hopf algebra, and present two representations, called vertical and horizontal, obtained by deforming respectively the Fock representation and Saito's vertex representations of the quantum toroidal algebra of \mathfrak{gl}(p). We construct the vertex operator intertwining between these two types of representations. This object is identified with a (\nu_1,\nu_2)-deformation of the refined topological vertex, allowing us to reconstruct the Nekrasov partition function and the qq-characters of the quiver gauge theories.
