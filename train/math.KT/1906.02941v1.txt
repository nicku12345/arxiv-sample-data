We analyze the spectrum of the tensor-triangulated category of Artin-Tate motives over the base field R of real numbers, with integral coefficients. Away from 2, we obtain the same spectrum as for complex Tate motives, previously studied by the second-named author. So the novelty is concentrated at the prime 2, where modular representation theory enters the picture via work of Positselski, based on Voevodsky's resolution of the Milnor Conjecture. With coefficients in k=Z/2, our spectrum becomes homeomorphic to the spectrum of the derived category of filtered kC_2-modules with a peculiar exact structure, for the cyclic group C_2=Gal(C/R). This spectrum consists of six points organized in an interesting way. As an application, we find exactly fourteen classes of mod-2 real Artin-Tate motives, up to the tensor-triangular structure. Among those, three special motives stand out, from which we can construct all others. We also discuss the spectrum of Artin motives and of Tate motives.
