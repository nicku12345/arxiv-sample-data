We prove that each exponential functor on the category of finite-dimensional complex inner product spaces and isomorphisms gives rise to an equivariant higher (ie. non-classical) twist of K-theory over G=SU(n). This twist is represented by a Fell bundle \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{G}, which reduces to the basic gerbe for the top exterior power functor. The groupoid \mathcal{G} comes equipped with a G-action and an augmentation map \mathcal{G} \to G, that is an equivariant equivalence. The C^*-algebra C^*(\mathcal{E}) associated to \mathcal{E} is stably isomorphic to the section algebra of a locally trivial bundle with stabilised strongly self-absorbing fibres. Using a version of the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence we compute the equivariant higher twisted K-groups K^G_*(C^*(\mathcal{E})) for arbitrary exponential functor twists over SU(2), and also over SU(3) after rationalisation.
