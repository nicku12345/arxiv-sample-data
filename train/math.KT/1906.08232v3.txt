In this note we are going to prove that if we have a fibration of smooth projective varieties X\to S over a surface S such that X is of dimension four and that the geometric generic fiber has finite dimensional motive and the first \'etale cohomology of the geometric generic fiber with respect to \mathbb {Q}_l coefficients is zero and the second \'etale cohomology is spanned by divisors, then A^3(X) (codimension three algebraically trivial cycles modulo rational equivalence) is dominated by finitely many copies of A_0(S). Meaning that there exists finitely many correspondences \Gamma_i on S\times X, such that \sum_i \Gamma_i is surjective from \oplus A^2(S) to A^3(X).
