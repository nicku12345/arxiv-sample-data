We calculate the third homology of \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Q}) with half-integral coefficients. Corresponding to each prime p there is an operator on this group with square the identity. The kernel of the (split surjective) homomorphism to the indecomposable K_3 of \mathbb{Q} is a the direct sum over all primes of the (-1)-eigenspaces of these operators. The (-1)-eigenspace of the operator corresponding to the prime p is cyclic of order the odd part of p+1.
