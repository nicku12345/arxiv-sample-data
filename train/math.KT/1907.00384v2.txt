We construct a map from the prestack of Tate objects over a commutative ring k to the stack of \mathbb{G}_{\rm m}-gerbes. The result is obtained by combining the determinant map from the stack of perfect complexes as proposed by Sch\"urg-To\"en-Vezzosi with a relative S_{\bullet}-construction for Tate objects as studied by Braunling-Groechenig-Wolfson. Along the way we prove a result about the K-theory of vector bundles over a connective \mathbb{E}_{\infty}-ring spectrum which is possibly of independent interest.
