We combine several mini miracles to achieve an elementary understanding of infinite loop spaces and very effective spectra in the algebro-geometric setting of motivic homotopy theory. Our approach combines \Gamma-spaces and framed correspondences into the concept of framed motivic \Gamma-spaces; these are continuous or enriched functors of two variables that take values in motivic spaces and are equipped with a framing. We craft proofs of our main results by imposing further axioms on framed motivic \Gamma-spaces such as a Segal condition for simplicial Nisnevich sheaves, cancellation, {\mathbb A}^{1}- and \sigma-invariance, Nisnevich excision, Suslin contractibility, and grouplikeness. This adds to the discussion in the literature on coexisting points of view on the {\mathbb A}^{1}-homotopy theory of algebraic varieties.
