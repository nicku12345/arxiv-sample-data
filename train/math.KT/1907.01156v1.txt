In this paper, we present partial results towards a classification of symplectic mapping tori using dynamical properties of wrapped Fukaya categories. More precisely, we construct a symplectic manifold T_\phi associated to a Weinstein domain M, and an exact, compactly supported symplectomorphism \phi. T_\phi is another Weinstein domain and its contact boundary is independent of \phi. In this paper, we distinguish T_\phi from T_{1_M}, under certain assumptions (Theorem 1.1). As an application, we obtain pairs of diffeomorphic Weinstein domains with the same contact boundary and symplectic cohomology, but that are different as Liouville domains.   Previously, we have suggested a categorical model M_\phi for the wrapped Fukaya category \mathcal{W}(T_\phi), and we have distinguished M_\phi from the mapping torus category of the identity. In this paper, we prove \mathcal{W}(T_\phi) and M_\phi are derived equivalent (Theorem 1.9); hence, deducing the promised Theorem 1.1. Theorem 1.9 is of independent interest as it preludes an algebraic description of wrapped Fukaya categories of locally trivial symplectic fibrations as twisted tensor products.
