We define Hochschild and cyclic homologies for bornological coarse spaces: for a fixed field k and group G, these are lax symmetric monoidal functors \mathcal{X}HH_{k}^G and \mathcal{X}HC_{k}^G from the category of equivariant bornological coarse spaces G\mathbf{BornCoarse} to the cocomplete stable \infty-category of chain complexes \mathbf{Ch}_\infty. We relate these equivariant coarse homology theories to coarse algebraic K-theory \mathcal{X} K^G_{k} and to coarse ordinary homology \mathcal{X} H^G by constructing a trace-like natural transformation \mathcal{X} K_{k}^G\to \mathcal{X} H^G that factors through coarse Hochschild (or cyclic) homology. We further compare the forget-control map for coarse Hochschild homology with the associated generalized assembly map.
