We propose a new notion of unbounded K\!K-cycle, mildly generalising unbounded Kasparov modules, for which the direct sum is well-defined. To a pair (A,B) of \sigma-unital C^{*}-algebras, we can then associate a semigroup \overline{U\!K\!K}(A,B) of homotopy equivalence classes of unbounded cycles, and we prove that this semigroup is in fact an abelian group. In case A is separable, our group \overline{U\!K\!K}(A,B) is isomorphic to Kasparov's K\!K-theory group K\!K(A,B) via the bounded transform. We also discuss various notions of degenerate cycles, and we prove that the homotopy relation on unbounded cycles coincides with the relation generated by operator-homotopies and addition of degenerate cycles.
