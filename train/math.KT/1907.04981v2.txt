In this article we give a comprehensive treatment of a `Clifford module flow' along paths in the skew-adjoint Fredholm operators on a real Hilbert space that takes values in KO{}_{*}(\mathbb{R}) via the Clifford index of Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro. We develop its properties for both bounded and unbounded skew-adjoint operators including an axiomatic characterization. Our constructions and approach are motivated by the principle that \[   \text{spectral flow} = \text{Fredholm index}. \] That is, we show how the KO--valued spectral flow relates to a KO-valued index by proving a Robbin-Salamon type result. The Kasparov product is also used to establish a spectral flow = Fredholm index result at the level of bivariant K-theory. We explain how our results incorporate previous applications of \mathbb{Z}/ 2\mathbb{Z}-valued spectral flow in the study of topological phases of matter.
