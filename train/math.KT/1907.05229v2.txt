We obtain a mixed complex simpler than the canonical one the computes the type cyclic homologies of a crossed product with invertible cocycle A\times_{\rho}^f H, of a weak module algebra A by a weak Hopf algebra H. This complex is provided with a filtration. The spectral sequence of this filtration generalizes the spectral sequence obtained in \cite{CGG}. When f takes its values in a separable subalgebra of A that satisfies suitable conditions, the above mentioned mixed complex is provided with another filtration, whose spectral sequence generalize the Feigin-Tsygan spectral sequence.
