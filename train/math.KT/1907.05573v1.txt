The operads of Poisson and Gerstenhaber algebras are generated by a single binary element if we consider them as Hopf operads (i.e. as operads in the category of cocommutative coalgebras). In this note we discuss in details the Hopf operads generated by a single element of arbitrary arity. We explain why the dual space to the space of n-ary operations in this operads are quadratic and Koszul algebras. We give the detailed description of generators, relations and a certain monomial basis in these algebras.
