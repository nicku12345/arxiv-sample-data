Consider a monoidal category which is at the same time abelian with enough projectives and such that projectives are flat on the right. We show that there is a B_{\infty}-algebra which is A_{\infty}-quasi-isomorphic to the derived endomorphism algebra of the tensor unit. This B_{\infty}-algebra is obtained as the co-Hochschild complex of a projective resolution of the tensor unit, endowed with a lifted A_{\infty}-coalgebra structure. We show that in the classical situation of the category of bimodules over an algebra, this newly defined B_{\infty}-algebra is isomorphic to the Hochschild complex of the algebra in the homotopy category of B_{\infty}-algebras.
