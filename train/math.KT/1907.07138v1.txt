We give some formulas for the ZZ pairing in KO theory using a long exact sequence for bivariant K theory which links real and complex theories. This is discussed under the framework of real structures given by antilinear operators verifying some symmetries. Topological phases protected by time reversal symmetry from condensed matter physics will be discussed.
