Let K be the K3 manifold. In this note, we discuss two methods to prove that certain generalized Miller--Morita--Mumford classes for smooth bundles with fiber K are non-zero. As a consequence, we fill a gap in a paper of the first author, and prove that the homomorphism Diff(K)\to \pi_0 Diff(K) does not split. One of the two methods of proof uses a result of Franke on the stable cohomology of arithmetic groups that strengthens work of Borel, and may be of independent interest.
