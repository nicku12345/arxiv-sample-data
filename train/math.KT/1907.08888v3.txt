We show how to compute the Tamarkin-Tsygan calculus of an associative algebra by providing, for a given cofibrant replacement of it, a `small' \mathsf{Calc}_\infty-model of its calculus, which we make somewhat explicit at the level of \mathsf{Calc}-algebras. To do this, we prove that the operad \mathsf{Calc} is inhomogeneous Koszul; to our best knowledge, this result is new. We illustrate our technique by carrying out some computations for two monomial associative algebra using the cofibrant replacement obtained by the author in 1804.01435.
