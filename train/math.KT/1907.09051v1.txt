Using a smooth version of the Connes--Thom isomorphism in Grensing's bivariant K-theory for locally convex algebras, we prove an equivariant version of the Connes--Thom isomorphism in periodic cyclic homology. As an application, we prove that periodic cyclic homology is invariant with respect to equivariant strict deformation quantization.
