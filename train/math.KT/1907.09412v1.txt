We prove that certain triangulated categories are (weakly) approximable in the sense of A. Neeman. We prove that a triangulated C that is compactly generated by a single object G is weakly approximable if C(G,G[i])=0 for i>1 (we say that G is weakly negative if this assumption is fulfilled; the case where the equality C(G,G[1])=0 is fulfilled as well was mentioned by Neeman himself). Moreover, if G\cong \bigoplus_{0\le i\le n}G_i and C(G_i,G_j[1])=0 whenever i\le j then C is also approximable.   The latter result can be useful since (under a few more additional assumptions) it allows to characterize a certain explicit subcategory of C as the category of finite cohomological functors from the subcategory C^c of compact objects of C into R-modules (for a noetherian commutative ring R such that C is R-linear). One may apply this statement to the construction of certain adjoint functors and t-structures.   Our proof of (weak) approximability of C under the aforementioned assumptions is closely related to (weight decompositions for) certain (weak) weight structures, and we discuss this relationship in detail.
