We introduce an enriched analogue of Lam and Pylyavskyy's theory of set-valued P-partitions. An an application, we construct a K-theoretic version of Stembridge's Hopf algebra of peak quasisymmetric functions. We show that the symmetric part of this algebra is generated by Ikeda and Naruse's shifted stable Grothendieck polynomials. We give the first proof that the natural skew analogues of these power series are also symmetric. A central tool in our constructions is a "K-theoretic" Hopf algebra of labeled posets, which may be of independent interest. Our results also lead to some new explicit formulas for the involution \omega on the ring of symmetric functions.
