In 1985 Bayer and Billera defined a flag vector f(X) for every convex polytope X, and proved some fundamental properties. The flag vectors f(X) span a graded ring \mathcal{R}=\bigoplus_{d\geq0}\mathcal{R}_d. Here \mathcal{R}_d is the span of the f(X) with \dim X=d. It has dimension the Fibonacci number F_{d+1}.   This paper introduces and explores the conjecture, that \mathcal{R} has a counting basis \{e_i\}. If true then the equation f(X) = \sum g_i(X)e_i conjecturally provides a formula for the Betti numbers g_i(X) of a new homology theory. As the g_i(X) are linear functions of f(X), we call the new theory linear homology.   Further, assuming the conjecture each g_i will have a rank r\geq0. The rank zero part of linear homology will be (middle perversity) intersection homology. The higher rank g_i measure successively more complicated singularities. In dimension d we will have \dim\mathcal{R}_d linearly independent Betti numbers.   This paper produces a basis \{e_i\} for \mathcal{R}, that is conjecturally a counting basis.
