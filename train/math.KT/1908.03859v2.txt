In joint work with Elmanto, Hoyois, Khan and Sosnilo, we computed infinite \mathbb{P}^1-loop spaces of motivic Thom spectra, using the technique of framed correspondences. This result allows us to express non-negative \mathbb{G}_m-homotopy groups of motivic Thom spectra in terms of geometric generators and relations. Using this explicit description, we show that the unit map of the algebraic special linear cobordism spectrum induces an isomorphism on \mathbb{G}_m-homotopy sheaves.
