Let M_\Sigma be an n-dimensional Thom-Mather stratified space of depth 1. We denote by \beta M the singular locus and by L the associated link. In this paper we study the problem of when such a space can be endowed with a wedge metric of positive scalar curvature. We relate this problem to recent work on index theory on stratified spaces, giving first an obstruction to the existence of such a metric in terms of a wedge \alpha-class \alpha_w (M_\Sigma)\in KO_n. In order to establish a sufficient condition we need to assume additional structure: we assume that the link of M_\Sigma is a homogeneous space of positive scalar curvature, L=G/K, where the semisimple compact Lie group G acts transitively on L by isometries. Examples of such manifolds include compact semisimple Lie groups and Riemannian symmetric spaces of compact type. Under these assumptions, when M_\Sigma and \beta M are spin, we reinterpret our obstruction in terms of two \alpha-classes associated to the resolution of M_\Sigma, M, and to the singular locus \beta M. Finally, when M_\Sigma, \beta M, L, and G are simply connected and \dim M is big enough, and when some other conditions on L (satisfied in a large number of cases) hold, we establish the main result of this article, showing that the vanishing of these two \alpha-classes is also sufficient for the existence of a well-adapted wedge metric of positive scalar curvature.
