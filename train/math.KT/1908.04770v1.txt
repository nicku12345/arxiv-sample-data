We derive new functional equations for Nielsen polylogarithms. We show that, when viewed modulo \mathrm{Li}_5 and products of lower weight functions, the weight 5 Nielsen polylogarithm S_{3,2} satisfies the dilogarithm five-term relation. We also give some functional equations and evaluations for Nielsen polylogarithms in weights up to 8, and general families of identities in higher weight.
