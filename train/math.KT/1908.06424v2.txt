Let X be the two-fold self product of a CM elliptic curve having discriminant N and having multiplication by the ring of integers of a number field K. Let \mathscr {X} denote a smooth spread of X over \mathscr{O}_K[1/6N]. Let A^2 stands for the group of algebraically trivial cycles on schemes modulo rational equivalence. Let j^*: A^2(\mathscr {X})\to A^2(X) denote the flat pull-back corresponding to the embedding j:X\hookrightarrow \mathscr {X}. We prove that im(j^*)[n](K)/A^2(\mathscr {X})[n](K) is a pro-finite group. Here A[n]  denote the group of n-torsion of an abelian group A and im(j^*)(K), A^2(\mathscr {X})(K) stand for the cycles fixed under the action of the Galois group.
