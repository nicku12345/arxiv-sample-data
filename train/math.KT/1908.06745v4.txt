Sets with a self-distributive operation (in the sense of (a \triangleleft b) \triangleleft c = (a \triangleleft c) \triangleleft (b \triangleleft c)), in particular quandles, appear in knot and braid theories, Hopf algebra classification, the study of the Yang-Baxter equation, and other areas. An important invariant of quandles is their structure group. The structure group of a finite quandle is known to be either "boring" (free abelian), or "interesting" (non-abelian with torsion). In this paper we explicitly describe all finite quandles with abelian structure group. To achieve this, we show that such quandles are abelian (i.e., satisfy (a \triangleleft b) \triangleleft c = (a \triangleleft c) \triangleleft b); present the structure group of any abelian quandle as a central extension of a free abelian group by an explicit finite abelian group; and determine when the latter is trivial. In the second part of the paper, we relate the structure group of any quandle to its 2nd homology group H_2. We use this to prove that the H_2 of a finite quandle with abelian structure group is torsion-free, but general abelian quandles may exhibit torsion. Torsion in H_2 is important for constructing knot invariants and pointed Hopf algebras.
