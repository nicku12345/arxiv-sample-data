We apply the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and tensor products of elliptic complexes to the cohomology of transitive Lie algebroids. We prove that the Euler characteristic of a representation of a transitive Lie algebroid A over a compact manifold M vanishes unless A=TM, and prove a general K\"{u}nneth formula. As applications we give a short proof of a vanishing result for the Euler characteristic of a principal bundle calculated using invariant differential forms, and show that the cohomology of certain Lie algebroids are exterior algebras. The latter result can be seen as a generalization of Hopf's theorem regarding the cohomology of compact Lie groups.
