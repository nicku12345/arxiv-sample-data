We consider the global aspects of the 6-dimensional \mathcal{N}=(1, 0) theory arising from the coupling of the vector multiplet to the tensor multiplet. We show that the Yang-Mills field and its dual, when both are abelianized, combine to define a class in twisted cohomology with the twist arising from the class of the B-field, in a duality-symmetric manner. We then show that this lifts naturally to a class in twisted (differential) K-theory. Alternatively, viewing the B-field in both \mathcal{N}=(1,0) and \mathcal{N}=(2,0) theories, not as a twist but as an invertible element, leads to a description within untwisted chromatic level two generalized cohomology theories, including forms of elliptic cohomology and Morava K-theory.
