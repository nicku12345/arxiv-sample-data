We prove that the essential dimension of central simple algebras of degree p^{\ell m} and exponent p^m over fields F containing a base-field k of characteristic p is at least \ell+1 when k is perfect. We do this by observing that the p-rank of F bounds the symbol length in \operatorname{Br}_{p^m}(F) and that there exist indecomposable p-algebras of degree p^{\ell m} and exponent p^m. We also prove that the symbol length of the Milne-Kato cohomology group \operatorname H^{n+1}_{p^m}(F) is bounded from above by \binom rn where r is the p-rank of the field, and provide upper and lower bounds for the essential dimension of Brauer classes of a given symbol length.
