The family of Thom spectra y(n) interpolate between the sphere spectrum and the mod two Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum. Computations of Mahowald, Ravenel, and Shick and the authors show that the E_1 ring spectrum y(n) has chromatic complexity n. We show that topological periodic cyclic homology of y(n) has chromatic complexity n+1. This gives evidence that topological periodic cyclic homology shifts chromatic height at all chromatic heights, supporting a variant of the Ausoni--Rognes red-shift conjecture. We also show that relative algebraic K-theory, topological cyclic homology, and topological negative cyclic homology of y(n) at least preserve chromatic complexity.
