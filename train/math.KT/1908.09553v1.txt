We construct a Spanier-Whitehead type duality functor relating finite \mathcal{C}-spectra to finite \mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{op}}-spectra and prove that every \mathcal{C}-homology theory is given by taking the homotopy groups of a balanced smash product with a fixed \mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{op}}-spectrum. We use this to construct Chern characters for certain rational \mathcal{C}-homology theories.
