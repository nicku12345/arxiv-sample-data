We prove that Chern insulators have topologically protected edge states which not only propagate unidirectionally along a straight line boundary, but also swerve around arbitrary-angled corners and geometric imperfections of the material boundary. This is a physical manifestation of the index theory of certain semigroup operator algebras.
