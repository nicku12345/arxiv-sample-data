We give a new proof of the Baum--Connes conjecture with coefficients for any second countable, locally compact topological group that acts properly and cocompactly on a finite-dimensional CAT(0)-cubical space with bounded geometry. The proof uses the Julg-Valette complex of a CAT(0)-cubical space introduced by the first three authors, and the direct splitting method in Kasparov theory developed by the last author.
