This is the second part of a series of papers which bridges the Chang--Weinberger--Yu relative higher index and geometry of almost flat hermitian vector bundles on manifolds with boundary. In this paper we apply the description of the relative higher index given in Part I to provide the relative version of the Hanke--Schick theorem, which relates the relative higher index with index pairing of a K-homology cycle with almost flat relative vector bundles. We also deal with the quantitative version and the dual problem of this theorem.
