Let V be an algebraic variety defined over \mathbb R, and V_{top} the space of its complex points. We compare the algebraic Witt group W(V) of symmetric bilinear forms on vector bundles over V, with the topological Witt group WR(V_{top}) of symmetric forms on Real vector bundles over V_{top} in the sense of Atiyah, especially when V is 2-dimensional. To do so, we develop topological tools to calculate WR(V_{top}), and to measure the difference between W(V) and WR(V_{top}).
