We introduce the Hochschild extensions of dg algebras, which are A_\infty-algebras. We show that all exact Hochschild extensions are symmetric Hochschild extensions, more precisely, every exact Hochschild extension of a finite dimensional complete typical dg algebra is a symmetric A_\infty-algebra. Moreover, we prove that the Koszul dual of trivial extension is Calabi-Yau completion and the Koszul dual of exact Hochschild extension is deformed Calabi-Yau completion, more precisely, the Koszul dual of the trivial extension of a finite dimensional complete dg algebra is the Calabi-Yau completion of its Koszul dual, and the Koszul dual of an exact Hochschild extension of a finite dimensional complete typical dg algebra is the deformed Calabi-Yau completion of its Koszul dual.
