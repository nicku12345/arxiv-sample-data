In 1918, Noether published a paper where she studied such a problem, now called Noether's problem on rationality: Let L=K\left( t_{1},t_{2},\cdots ,t_{n}\right)  be a purely transcendental extension over a field K and G a finite subgroup acting transitively on t_{1},t_{2},\cdots ,t_{n} in an evident manner. Is it true that the invariant subfield L^{G} of L under % G is still purely transcendental over K? The problem has been open in general except for minor particular cases. In this paper we will attempt to understand a general theory for Noether's problem on rationality by transcendental Galois theory. Then new particular cases will be obtained. We will also give a generalization for the remarkable counter-example given by Swan in 1969.
