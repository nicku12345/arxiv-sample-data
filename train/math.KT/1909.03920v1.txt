We give a new formula for p-typical real topological cyclic homology that refines the fiber sequence formula discovered by Nikolaus and Scholze for p-typical topological cyclic homology to one involving genuine C_2-spectra. To accomplish this, we give a new definition of the \infty-category of real p-cyclotomic spectra that replaces the usage of genuinely equivariant dihedral spectra with the parametrized Tate construction (-)^{t_{C_2} \mu_p} associated to the dihedral group D_{2p} = \mu_p \rtimes C_2. We then define a p-typical and \infty-categorical version of H{\o}genhaven's O(2)-orthogonal cyclotomic spectra, construct a forgetful functor relating the two theories, and show that this functor restricts to an equivalence between full subcategories of appropriately bounded below objects.
