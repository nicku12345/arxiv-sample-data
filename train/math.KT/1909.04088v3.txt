We prove a conjecture of Shklyarov concerning the relationship between K. Saito's higher residue pairing and a certain pairing on the periodic cyclic homology of matrix factorization categories. Along the way, we give new proofs of a result of Shklyarov and Polishchuk-Vaintrob's Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for matrix factorizations.
