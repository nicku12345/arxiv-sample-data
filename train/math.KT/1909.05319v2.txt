We study categorical primitive forms for Calabi--Yau A_\infty categories with semi-simple Hochschild cohomology. We classify these primitive forms in terms of certain grading operators on the Hochschild homology. We use this result to prove that, if the Fukaya category {{\sf Fuk}}(M) of a symplectic manifold M has semi-simple Hochschild cohomology, then its genus zero Gromov--Witten invariants may be recovered from the A_\infty-category {{\sf Fuk}}(M) together with the closed-open map. An immediate corollary of this is that in the semi-simple case, homological mirror symmetry implies enumerative mirror symmetry.
