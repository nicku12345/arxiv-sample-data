We introduce the notion of proper Kasparov cycles for Kasparov's G-equivariant KK-theory for a general locally compact, second countable topological group G. We show that for any proper Kasparov cycle, its induced map on K-theory factors through the left-hand side of the Baum-Connes conjecture. This allows us to upgrade the direct splitting method, a recent new approach to the Baum-Connes conjecture which, in contrast to the standard gamma element method (the Dirac dual-Dirac method), avoids the need of constructing proper algebras and the Dirac and the dual-Dirac elements. We introduce the notion of Kasparov cycles with Property (gamma) removing the G-compact assumption on the universal space EG in the previous paper "Direct Splitting Method for the Baum-Connes Conjecture". We show that the existence of a cycle with Property (gamma) implies the split-injectivity of the Baum-Connes assembly map for all coefficients. We also obtain results concerning the surjectivity of the assembly map.
