We construct an \emph{ungraded version} of Beilinson--Ginzburg--Soergel's Koszul duality, inspired by Beilinson's construction of rational motivic cohomology in terms of K-theory. For this, we introduce and study the category DK(X) of constructible K-motives on varieties X with an affine stratification. There is a natural and geometric functor from the category of mixed sheaves D_{mix}(X) to DK(X). We show that when X is the flag variety, this functor is Koszul dual to the realisation functor from D_{mix}(X^\vee) to D(X^\vee), the constructible derived category.
