Consider a proper, isometric action by a unimodular, locally compact group G on a complete Riemannian manifold M. For equivariant elliptic operators that are invertible outside a cocompact subset of M, we show that a localised index in the K-theory of the maximal group C^*-algebra of G is well-defined. The approach is based on the use of maximal versions of equivariant localised Roe algebras, and many of the technical arguments in this paper are used to handle the ways in which they differ from their reduced versions.   By using the maximal group C^*-algebra instead of its reduced counterpart, we can apply the trace given by integration over G to recover an index defined earlier by the last two authors, and developed further by Braverman, in terms of sections invariant under the group action. As a very special case, this allows one to refine numerical obstructions to positive scalar curvature on a noncompact \operatorname{Spin} manifold X defined via Callias index theory, to obstructions in the K-theory of the maximal C^*-algebra of the fundamental group \pi_1(X).   As a motivating application in another direction, we prove a version of Guillemin and Sternberg's quantisation commutes with reduction principle for equivariant indices of \operatorname{Spin}^c Callias-type operators.
