B. Kim and the first author proved a result comparing the virtual fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of stable quasimaps and stable LG-quasimaps by studying localized Chern characters for 2-periodic complexes. In this paper, we study a K-theoretic analogue of the localized Chern character map and show that for a Koszul 2-periodic complex it coincides with the cosection localized Gysin map by Y.-H. Kiem and J. Li. As an application we compare the virtual structure sheaves of the moduli space of stable quasimaps and stable LG-quasimaps.
