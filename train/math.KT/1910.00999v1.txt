We give a fully faithful integral model for spaces in terms of \mathbb{E}_{\infty}-ring spectra and the Nikolaus-Scholze Frobenius. The key technical input is the development of a homotopy coherent Frobenius action on a certain subcategory of p-complete \mathbb{E}_{\infty}-rings for each prime p. Using this, we show that the data of a space X is the data of its Spanier-Whitehead dual as an \mathbb{E}_{\infty}-ring together with a trivialization of the Frobenius action after completion at each prime.   In producing the above Frobenius action, we explore two ideas which may be of independent interest. The first is a more general action of Frobenius in equivariant homotopy theory; we show that a version of Quillen's Q-construction acts on the \infty-category of \mathbb{E}_{\infty}-rings with "genuine equivariant multiplication," which we call global algebras. The second is a "pre-group-completed" variant of algebraic K-theory which we call partial K-theory. We develop the notion of partial K-theory and give a computation of the partial K-theory of \mathbb{F}_p up to p-completion.
