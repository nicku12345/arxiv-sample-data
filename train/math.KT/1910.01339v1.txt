In this paper, we continue the program initiated by Kahn-Saito-Yamazaki by constructing and studying an unstable motivic homotopy category with modulus, extending the Morel-Voevodsky construction from smooth schemes over a field k to certain diagrams of schemes. We present this category as a candidate environment for studying representability problems for non \mathbb{A}^1-invariant generalized cohomology theories.
