Given an Azumaya algebra with involution (A,\sigma) over a commutative ring R and some auxiliary data, we construct an 8-periodic chain complex involving the Witt groups of (A,\sigma) and other algebras with involution, and prove it is exact when R is semilocal. When R is a field, this recovers an 8-periodic exact sequence of Witt groups of Grenier-Boley and Mahmoudi, which in turn generalizes exact sequences of Parimala--Sridharan--Suresh and Lewis. We use this result to establish the Grothendieck--Serre conjecture on principal homogeneous bundles and the local purity conjecture for certain outer forms of \mathbf{GL}_n and \mathbf{Sp}_{2n}, provided some assumptions on R. We also apply it to characterize the kernel of the restriction map W(R)\to W(S) when R is a (non-semilocal) 2-dimensional regular domain and S is a quadratic \'etale R-algebra, generalizing a theorem of Pfister. The preliminary sections of this paper include many fundamental results concerning Azumaya algebras with involution and hermitian forms over them.
