In this note, we interpret Leibniz algebras as differential graded Lie algebras. Namely, we consider two functors from the category of Leibniz algebras to that of differential graded Lie algebras and show that they naturally give rise to the Leibniz cohomology and the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology. As an application, we prove a conjecture stated by Pirashvili in arXiv:1904.00121 [math.KT].
