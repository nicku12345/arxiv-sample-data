For every \infty-category \mathscr{C}, there is a homotopy n-category \mathrm{h}_n \mathscr{C} and a canonical functor \gamma_n \colon \mathscr{C} \to \mathrm{h}_n \mathscr{C}. We study these higher homotopy categories, especially in connection with the existence and preservation of (co)limits, by introducing a higher categorical notion of weak colimit. Based on the idea of the homotopy n-category, we introduce the notion of an n-derivator and study the main examples arising from \infty-categories. Following the work of Maltsiniotis and Garkusha, we define K-theory for \infty-derivators and prove that the canonical comparison map from the Waldhausen K-theory of \mathscr{C} to the K-theory of the associated n-derivator \mathbb{D}_{\mathscr{C}}^{(n)} is (n+1)-connected. We also prove that this comparison map identifies derivator K-theory of \infty-derivators in terms of a universal property. Moreover, using the canonical structure of higher weak pushouts in the homotopy n-category, we define also a K-theory space K(\mathrm{h}_n \mathscr{C}, \mathrm{can}) associated to \mathrm{h}_n \mathscr{C}. We prove that the canonical comparison map from the Waldhausen K-theory of \mathscr{C} to K(\mathrm{h}_n \mathscr{C}, \mathrm{can}) is n-connected.
