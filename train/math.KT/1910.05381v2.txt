Let 1 \to N \to G \to G/N \to 1 be a short exact sequence of countable discrete groups and let B be any G-C^*-algebra. In this paper, we show that the strong Novikov conjecture with coefficients in B holds for such a group G when the normal subgroup N and the quotient group G/N are coarsely embeddable into Hilbert spaces. As a result, the group G satisfies the Novikov conjecture under the same hypothesis on N and G/N.
