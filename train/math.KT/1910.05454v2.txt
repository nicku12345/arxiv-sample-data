Let us consider a p-adic Lie extension of a number field K which fits into the setting of non-commutative Iwasawa theory formulated by Coates-Fukaya-Kato-Sujatha-Venjakob. For the first main result, we will prove the control theorem of Selmer group associated to a motive, which generalizes previous results by the second author and Greenberg. For the second main result, we prove the functional equation of the dual Selmer groups, which generalizes previous results by Greenberg, Perrin-Riou and Zabradi. Note that our proof of the functional equation is different from the proof of Zabradi even in the case where the Selmer group is associated to an elliptic curve. We also discuss the functional equation for the analytic p-adic L-functions and check the compatibility with the functional equation of the dual Selmer groups.
