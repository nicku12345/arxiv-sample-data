Let X be a variety defined over a local field K of mixed characteristic (0,p) with a totally degenerate reduction in the sense of Raskind and Xarles. Generalizing earlier work of Raskind and Xarles and relying on some conjectures we define a map, which we call the toric regulator, from the various motivic cohomology groups of X to certain p-adically uniformized tori over K. This construction captures the part of the \'etale regulators on X that land in the Galois cohomology of the submodules of cohomology which are extensions of \mathbb{Z}_l by \mathbb{Z}_l(1), simultaneously for all l. We also discuss the relation with the log-syntomic regulator and study a number of examples. In particular, for K_2 of a Mumford curve we find a relation with the rigid analytic regulator of \'Pal and for K_1 of the product of Mumford curves we conjecture a formula for the toric regulator.
