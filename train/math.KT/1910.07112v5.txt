In this paper we reduce the generalized Hilbert's third problem about Dehn invariants and scissors congruence classes to the injectivity of certain Chern--Simons invariants. We also establish a version of a conjecture of Goncharov relating scissors congruence groups of polytopes and the algebraic K-theory of \mathbf{C}.
