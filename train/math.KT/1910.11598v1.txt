We enumerate the low dimensional cells in the Voronoi cell complexes attached to the modular groups SL_N(Z) and GL_N(Z) for N=8,9,10,11, using quotient sublattices techniques for N=8,9 and linear programming methods for higher dimensions. These enumerations allow us to compute some cohomology of these groups and prove that K_8(Z) = 0. We deduce from it new knowledge on the Kummer-Vandiver conjecture.
