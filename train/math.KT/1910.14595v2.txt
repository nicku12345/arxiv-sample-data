We study relationships between the Nisnevich topology on smooth schemes and certain Grothendieck topologies on proper and not necessarily proper modulus pairs which were introduced respectively in [9] and [3]. Our results play an important role in the theory of sheaves with transfers on proper modulus pairs. This is a revised version of arXiv:1809.05851 [math.AG].
