We show that a complete hereditary cotorsion pair (\C,\C^\bot) in an exact category \E, together with a subcategory \Z\subseteq\E containing \C^\bot, determines a Waldhausen category structure on the exact category \C, in which \Z is the class of acyclic objects.   This allows us to prove a new version of Quillen's Localization Theorem, relating the K-theory of exact categories \A\subseteq\B to that of a cofiber. The novel idea in our approach is that, instead of looking for an exact quotient category that serves as the cofiber, we produce a Waldhausen category, constructed through a cotorsion pair. Notably, we do not require \A to be a Serre subcategory, which produces new examples.   Due to the algebraic nature of our Waldhausen categories, we are able to recover a version of Quillen's Resolution Theorem, now in a more homotopical setting that allows for weak equivalences.
