In this article, we establish a motivic analog of an enumeration result of James-Thomas on non-stable vector bundles in topological setting. Using this, we obtain results on enumeration of projective modules of rank d over a smooth affine k-algebra A of dimension d, recovering in particular results of Suslin and Bhatwadekar on cancellation of such vector bundles. Admitting a conjecture of Asok and Fasel, we prove cancellation of such vector bundles of rank d-1 if the base field k is algebraically closed. We also explore the cancellation properties of symplectic vector bundles.
