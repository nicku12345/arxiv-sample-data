We associate to every G-bornological coarse space X and every left-exact \infty-category with G-action a left-exact infinity-category of equivariant X-controlled objects. Postcomposing with algebraic K-theory leads to {new} equivariant coarse homology theories. This allows us to apply the injectivity results for assembly maps by Bunke, Engel, Kasprowski and Winges to the algebraic K-theory of left-exact \infty-categories.
