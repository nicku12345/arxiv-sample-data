We introduce a functor \mathfrak{M}:\mathbf{Alg}\times\mathbf{Alg}^\mathrm{op}\rightarrow\mathrm{pro}\text{-}\mathbf{Alg} constructed from representations of \mathrm{Hom}_\mathbf{Alg}(A,B\otimes ?). As applications, the following items are introduced and studied: (i) Analogue of the functor \pi_0 for algebras and affine schemes. (ii) Cotype of Weibel's concept of strict homotopization. (iii) A homotopy invariant intrinsic singular cohomology theory for affine schemes with cup product. (iv) Some extensions of \mathbf{Alg} that are enriched over idempotent semigroups. (v) Classifying homotopy pro-algebras for Corti\~{n}as-Thom's KK-groups and Weibel's homotopy K-groups.
