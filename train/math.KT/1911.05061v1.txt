Let F and k be perfect fields. The main goal of this paper is to investigate algebraic models for the Morel-Voevodsky unstable motivic homotopy category \mathrm{Ho}(F) after \mathbf{H}^{\mathbb{A}^1}k localization. More specifically, we extend results of Goerss to the \mathbb{A}^1-algebraic topology setting: we study the homotopy theory of the category s\mathrm{coCAlg}_k(Sm_F) of presheaves of simplicial coalgebras over a field k and their \tau and \mathbb{A}^1-localizations. For k algebraically closed, we show that the unit of the adjunction k^{\delta}[-]\dashv(-)^{gp} determines the \mathbf{H}^{\mathbb{A}^1}k homotopy type, where k^{\delta}[-] is the canonical coalgebra functor induced by the diagonal map \Delta:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X}. We extend this result for the category of presheaves of coalgebras over a non-algebraically closed field k and the category of discrete G-motivic spaces, for G=Gal(\bar{k}/k).   On the other hand, we show that the category of coalgebra objects in \mathrm{PST}(Sm_F,k) is locally presentable, where \mathrm{PST}(Sm_F,k) is the category of presheaves with Voevodsky transfers and the monoidal structure is given by a Day convolution product.
