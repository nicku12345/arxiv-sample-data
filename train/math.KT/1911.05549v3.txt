A conjecture of Morel asserts that the sheaf of \mathbb A^1-connected components of a space is \mathbb A^1-invariant. Using purely algebro-geometric methods, we determine the sheaf of \mathbb A^1-connected components of a smooth projective surface, which is birationally ruled over a curve of genus >0. As a consequence, we show that Morel's conjecture holds for all smooth projective surfaces over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.
