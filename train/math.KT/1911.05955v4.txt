We extend results of Kass--Wickelgren to define an Euler class for a non-orientable (or non-relatively orientable) vector bundle on a smooth scheme, valued in the Grothendieck--Witt group of the ground field. We use a root stack construction to produce this Euler class and discuss its relation to other versions of an Euler class in \mathbb{A}^{1}-homotopy theory. This allows one to apply Kass--Wickelgren's technique for arithmetic enrichments of enumerative geometry to a larger class of problems; as an example, we use our construction to give an arithmetic count of the number of lines meeting 6 planes in \mathbb{P}^4.
