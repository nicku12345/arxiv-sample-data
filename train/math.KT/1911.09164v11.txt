As a branch of algebraic and differential topology of manifolds, the theory of Morse functions and their higher dimensional versions or fold maps and its application to algebraic and differential topology of manifolds is fundamental, important and interesting. This paper is on explicit construction of fold maps and homology groups and cohomology rings of their Reeb spaces: they are defined as the spaces of all connected components of preimages of the maps, and in suitable situations inherit some topological information such as homology groups and cohomology rings of the manifolds. Explicit construction of the maps is a fundamental and difficult task even on manifolds which are not so complicated. The author has constructed explicit fold maps systematically and performed several calculations of homology groups and cohomology rings of the Reeb spaces. This paper concerns new observations on this task.
