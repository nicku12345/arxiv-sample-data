We give a new proof of the universal property of KK^G-theory with respect to stability, homotopy invariance and split-exactness for G a locally compact group, or a locally compact (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid, or a countable inverse semigroup which is relatively short and conceptual. Morphisms in the generators and relations picture of KK^G-theory are brought to a particular simple form.
