We investigate certain categorical aspects of Voevodsky's triangulated categories of motives. For this, various recollements for Grothendieck categories of enriched functors and their derived categories are established. In order to extend these recollements further with respect to Serre's localization, the concept of the (strict) Voevodsky property for Serre localizing subcategories is introduced. This concept is inspired by the celebrated Voevodsky theorem on homotopy invariant presheaves with transfers. As an application, it is shown that Voevodsky's triangulated categories of motives fit into recollements of derived categories of associated Grothendieck categories of Nisnevich sheaves with specific transfers.
