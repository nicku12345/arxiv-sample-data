We provide two simple proofs of the fact that even Artin groups of FC-type are poly-free which was recently established by R. Blasco-Garcia, C. Mart\'inez-P\'erez and L. Paris. More generally, let \Gamma be a finite simplicial graph with all edges labelled by positive even integers and A_\Gamma be its associated Artin group, our new proof implies that if A_T is poly-free (resp. normally poly-free) for every clique T in \Gamma, then A_\Gamma is poly-free (resp. normally poly-free). We prove similar results regarding the Farrell--Jones Conjecture for even Artin groups. In particular, we show that if A_\Gamma is an even Artin group such that each clique in \Gamma either has at most 3 vertices, has all of its labels at least 6, or is the join of these two types of cliques (the edges connecting the cliques are all labelled by 2), then A_\Gamma satisfies the Farrell--Jones Conjecture. In addition,our method enable us to obtain results for general Artin groups.
