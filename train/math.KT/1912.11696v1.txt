Let a compact torus T=T^{n-1} act on a smooth compact manifold X=X^{2n} effectively, with nonempty finite set of fixed points, and suppose that stabilizers of all points are connected. If H^{odd}(X)=0 and the weights of tangent representation at each fixed point are in general position, we prove that the orbit space Q=X/T is a homology (n+1)-sphere. If, in addition, \pi_1(X)=0, then Q is homeomorphic to S^{n+1}. We introduce the notion of j-generality of tangent weights of torus action. For any action of T^k on X^{2n} with isolated fixed points and H^{odd}(X)=0, we prove that j-generality of weights implies (j+1)-acyclicity of the orbit space Q. This statement generalizes several known results for actions of complexity zero and one. In complexity one, we give a criterion of equivariant formality in terms of the orbit space. In this case, we give a formula expressing Betti numbers of a manifold in terms of certain combinatorial structure that sits in the orbit space.
