Recent work of Jonathan Campbell and Inna Zakharevich has focused on building machinery for studying scissors congruence problems via algebraic K-theory, and applying these tools to studying the Grothendieck ring of varieties. In this paper we give a new application of their framework: we construct a spectrum that recovers the classical \mathrm{SK} ("schneiden und kleben," German for "cut and paste") groups for manifolds on \pi_0, and we construct a derived version of the Euler characteristic.
