Let A and B be C*-algebras and \varphi\colon A\to B be a *-homomorphism. We discuss the properties of the kernel and (co-)image of the induced map \mathrm{K}_{0}(\varphi)\colon \mathrm{K}_{0}(A) \to \mathrm{K}_{0}(B) on the level of K-theory. In particular, we are interested in the case that the co-image is torsion free, and show that it holds when A and  B  are commutative and unital, B has real rank zero, and \varphi is unital and injective. We also show that  A is embeddable in B if  \mathrm{K}_{0}(\varphi) is injective and A has stable rank one and real rank zero.
