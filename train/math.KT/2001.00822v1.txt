We study problems relating to the D(2)-Problem for metacyclic groups of type G(p,p-1) where p is an odd prime. Specifically we build on Nadim's thesis \cite{Jamil}, which showed that the \mathbb{Z}[G(5,4)]-module \mathbb{Z} admits a diagonal resolution and a minimal representative for the third syzygy \Omega_3(\mathbb{Z}) is R(2)\oplus[y-1). Motivated by this result, we show that the \mathbb{Z}[G(p,p-1)]-module R(2)\oplus[y-1) is both full and straight for any odd prime p. Given Johnson's work on the D(2)-Problem \cite{D2}, this leads to the conclusion that G(5,4) satisfies the D(2)-property, as well as providing a sufficient condition for the D(2)-property to hold for G(p,p-1), namely the condition that R(2)\oplus[y-1) is a minimal representative for \Omega_3(\mathbb{Z}) over \mathbb{Z}[G(p,p-1)], which we refer to as the condition M(p). Following this result, we prove a theorem which simplifies the calculations required to show that the condition M(p) holds. Finally, we carry out these calculations in the case where p=7 and prove that the condition M(7) holds, which is sufficient to show that G(7,6) satisfies the D(2)-property.
