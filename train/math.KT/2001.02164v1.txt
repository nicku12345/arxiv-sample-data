For G a finite group, a normalized 2-cocycle \alpha\in Z^{2}(G,\mathbb{S}^{1}) and X a G-space on which a normal subgroup A acts trivially, we show that the \alpha-twisted G-equivariant K-theory of X decomposes as a direct sum of twisted equivariant K-theories of X parametrized by the orbits of an action of G on the set of irreducible \alpha-projective representations of A. This generalizes the decomposition obtained by G\'omez and Uribe for equivariant K-theory. We also explore some examples of this decomposition for the particular case of the dihedral groups D_{2n} with n\ge 1 an even integer.
