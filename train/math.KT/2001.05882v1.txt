We investigate the relations between the Grothendieck group of coherent modules of an algebraic variety and its Chow group of algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence. Those are in essence torsion phenomena, which we attempt to control by considering the action of the Adams operations on the Brown-Gersten-Quillen spectral sequence and related objects, such as connective K_0-theory. We provide elementary arguments whenever possible. As applications, we compute the connective K_0-theory of the following objects: (1) the variety of reduced norm one elements in a central division algebra of prime degree; (2) the classifying space of the split special orthogonal group of odd degree.
