Twisted topological Hochschild homology of C_n-equivariant spectra was introduced by Angeltveit, Blumberg, Gerhardt, Hill, Lawson, and Mandell, building on the work of Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel on norms in equivariant homotopy theory. In this paper we introduce tools for computing twisted THH, which we apply to computations for Thom spectra, Eilenberg-MacLane spectra, and the real bordism spectrum MU_{\mathbb{R}}. In particular, we construct an equivariant version of the B\"okstedt spectral sequence, the formulation of which requires further development of the Hochschild homology of Green functors, first introduced by Blumberg, Gerhardt, Hill, and Lawson.
