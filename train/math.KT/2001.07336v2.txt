For a proper action by a locally compact group G on a manifold M with a G-equivariant Spin-structure, we obtain obstructions to the existence of complete G-invariant Riemannian metrics with uniformly positive scalar curvature. We focus on the case where M/G is noncompact. The obstructions follow from a Callias-type index theorem, and relate to positive scalar curvature near hypersurfaces in M. We also deduce some other applications of this index theorem. If G is a connected Lie group, then the obstructions to positive scalar curvature vanish under a mild assumption on the action. In that case, we generalise a construction by Lawson and Yau to obtain complete G-invariant Riemannian metrics with uniformly positive scalar curvature, under an equivariant bounded geometry assumption.
