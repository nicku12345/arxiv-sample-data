Vandiver's conjecture states that any prime p does not divide the class number h(R) of the maximal real subfield R of the p-th cyclotomic field. The aim of this paper is to prove Vandiver's conjecture, which has several consequences including the first case of Fermat's Great Theorem. The main idea lies in using relations of the algebraic K-theory and the Iwasawa theory, discovered by M.Kervaire and M.P.Murthy in 1977.
