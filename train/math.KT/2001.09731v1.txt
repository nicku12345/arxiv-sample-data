We establish two versions of a central theorem, the Family Colimit Theorem, for the coarse coherence property of metric spaces. This is a coarse geometric property and so is well-defined for finitely generated groups with word metrics. It is known that coarse coherence of the fundamental group has important implications for classification of high-dimensional manifolds. The Family Colimit Theorem is one of the permanence theorems that give structure to the class of coarsely coherent groups. In fact, all known permanence theorems follow from the Family Colimit Theorem. We also use this theorem to construct new groups from this class.
