We prove a purity property in telescopically localized algebraic K-theory of ring spectra: For n\geq 1, the T(n)-localization of K(R) only depends on the T(0)\oplus \dots \oplus T(n)-localization of R. This complements a classical result of Waldhausen in rational K-theory. Combining our result with work of Clausen--Mathew--Naumann--Noel, one finds that L_{T(n)}K(R) in fact only depends on the T(n-1)\oplus T(n)-localization of R, again for n \geq 1. As consequences, we deduce several vanishing results for telescopically localized K-theory, as well as an equivalence between K(R) and \mathrm{TC}(\tau_{\geq 0} R) after T(n)-localization for n\geq 2.
