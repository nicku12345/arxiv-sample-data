We investigate the integral Tate conjecture for 1-cycles on the product of a curve and a surface over a finite field, under the assumption that the surface is geometrically CH_0-trivial. By this we mean that over any algebraically closed field extension, the degree map on the zero-dimensional Chow group of the surface is an isomorphism. This applies to Enriques surfaces. When the N\'eron-Severi group has no torsion, we recover earlier results of A. Pirutka. The results rely on a detailed study of the third unramified cohomology group of specific products of varieties.
