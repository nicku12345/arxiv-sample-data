We prove two basic structural properties of the algebraic K-theory of rings after K(1)-localization at an implicit prime p. Our first result (also recently obtained by Land--Meier--Tamme by different methods) states that L_{K(1)} K(R) is insensitive to inverting p on R; we deduce this from recent advances in prismatic cohomology and \mathrm{TC}. Our second result yields a K\"unneth formula in K(1)-local K-theory for adding p-power roots of unity to R.
