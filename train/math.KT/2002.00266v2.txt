We prove Weibel's conjecture for twisted K-theory when twisting by a smooth proper connective dg-algebra. Our main contribution is showing we can kill a negative twisted K-theory class using a projective birational morphism (in the same twisted setting). We extend the vanishing result to relative twisted K-theory of a smooth affine morphism and describe counter examples to some similar extensions.
