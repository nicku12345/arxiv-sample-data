Our aim in this paper is to determine the tautological algebra generated by the cohomology classes of the Brill Noether loci in the rational cohomology of the moduli space \mathcal{M}_C(2,d) of semistable bundles of rank 2 and degree d. When C is a general smooth projective curve of genus g\geq 2, d=2g-2, the tautological algebra of  \mathcal{M}_C(2,2g-2) (resp. \mathcal{SU}_C(2,L), deg(L)=2g-2)) is generated by the divisor classes (resp. the Theta divisor \Theta).
