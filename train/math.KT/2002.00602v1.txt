Let C be a smooth and projective curve over the truncated polynomial ring k_m:=k[t]/(t^m),  where k is a field of characteristic 0. Using a candidate for the motivic cohomology group {\rm H}^{3}_{\pazocal{M}}(C,\mathbb{Q}(3)) based on the Bloch complex of weight 3, we construct regulators to k for every m<r<2m. Specializing this construction, we obtain an invariant \rho_{m,r}(f \wedge g \wedge h) of rational functions f, g and h on C. The current work is a twofold generalization of our work on the infinitesimal Chow dilogarithm: we sheafify the previous construction and therefore do not restrict ourselves to triples of rational functions and we construct the regulator for any m<r<2m, rather than only for m=2. We also define regulators of cycles, which we expect to give a complete set of invariants for the infinitesimal part of {\rm CH}^{2}(k_{m},3).  This generalizes Park's work, where the additive Chow cycles, namely the case of cycles close to 0, is handled for r=m+1. In this paper, we generalize the reciprocity theorem to pairs of cycles which are the same modulo (t^m) and for any m<r<2m. We expect the theory of the paper to give regulators on categories of motives over rings with nilpotents.
