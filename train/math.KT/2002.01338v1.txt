We define asymptotic transfers in bounded K-theory together with a context where this can be done in great generality. Controlled algebra plays a central role in many advances in geometric topology, including recent work on Novikov, Borel, and Farrell-Jones conjectures. One of the features that appears in various manifestations throughout the subject, starting with the original work of Farrell and Jones, is an asymptotic transfer whose meaning and construction depend on the geometric circumstances. We first develop a general framework that allows us to construct a version of asymptotic transfer maps for any finite aspherical complex. This framework is the equivariant parametrized K-theory with fibred control. We also include several fibrewise excision theorems for its computation and a discussion of where the standard tools break down and which tools replace them.
