We extend the notion of regular coherence from rings to additive categories and show that well-known consequences of regular coherence for rings also apply to additive categories. For instance the negative K-groups and all twisted Nil-groups vanish for an additive category if it is regular coherent. This will be applied to nested sequences of additive categories, motivated by our ongoing project to determine the algebraic K-theory of the Hecke algebra of a reductive p-adic group.
