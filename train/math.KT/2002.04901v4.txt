This paper has two parts. In the first part we recall the important role that weak proregularity of an ideal in a commutative ring has in derived completion and in adic flatness. We also introduce the new concepts of idealistic and sequential derived completion, and prove a few results about them, including the fact that these two concepts agree iff the ideal is weakly proregular.   In the second part we study the local nature of weak proregularity, and its behavior w.r.t. ring quotients. These results allow us to prove that weak proregularity occurs in the context of bounded prisms, in the sense of Bhatt and Scholze. We anticipate that the concept of weak proregularity will help simplify and improve some of the more technical aspects of the groundbreaking theory of perfectoid rings and prisms (that has transformed arithmetic geometry in recent years).
