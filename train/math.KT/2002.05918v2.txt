Let k be a field admitting a resolution of singularities. In this paper, we prove that the functor of zeroth \mathbb{A}^1-homology \mathbf{H}^{\mathbb{A}^1}_0 is universal as a functorial birational invariant of smooth proper k-varieties taking values in a category enriched by abelian groups. For a smooth proper k-variety X, we also prove that the dimension of \mathbf{H}^{\mathbb{A}^1}_0(X;\mathbb{Q})(\mathrm{Spec} k) coincides with the number of R-equivalence classes of X(k). We deduce these results as consequences of the structure theorem that for a smooth proper k-variety X, the sheaf \mathbf{H}^{\mathbb{A}^1}_0(X) is the free abelian presheaf generated by the birational \mathbb{A}^1-connected components \pi_0^{b\mathbb{A}^1}(X) of Asok-Morel.
