There are two de Rham complexes in diffeology. The original one is due to Souriau and another one is the singular de Rham complex defined by a simplicial differential graded algebra. We compare the first de Rham cohomology groups of the two complexes within the \v{C}ech-de Rham spectral sequence by making use of the factor map which connects the two de Rham complexes. As a consequence, it follows that the singular de Rham cohomology algebra of the irrational torus T_\theta is isomorphic to the tensor product of the original de Rham cohomology and the exterior algebra generated by a non-trivial flow bundle over T_\theta.
