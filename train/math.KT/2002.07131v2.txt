We develop index theory on compact Riemannian spin manifolds with boundary in the case when the topological information is encoded by bundles which are supported away from the boundary. As a first application, we establish a "long neck principle" for a compact Riemannian spin n-manifold with boundary X, stating that if \textrm{scal}(X)\geq n(n-1) and there is a nonzero degree map into the sphere f\colon X\to S^n which is strictly area decreasing, then the distance between the support of \textrm{d} f and the boundary of X is at most \pi/n. This answers, in the spin setting and for strictly area decreasing maps, a question recently asked by Gromov. As a second application, we consider a Riemannian manifold X obtained by removing k pairwise disjoint embedded n-balls from a closed spin n-manifold Y. We show that if \textrm{scal}(X)>\sigma>0 and Y satisfies a certain condition expressed in terms of higher index theory, then the radius of a geodesic collar neighborhood of \partial X is at most \pi \sqrt{(n-1)/(n\sigma)}. Finally, we consider the case of a Riemannian n-manifold V diffeomorphic to N\times [-1,1], with N a closed spin manifold with nonvanishing Rosenberg index. In this case, we show that if \textrm{scal}(V)\geq\sigma>0, then the distance between the boundary components of V is at most 2\pi \sqrt{(n-1)/(n\sigma)}. This last constant is sharp by an argument due to Gromov.
