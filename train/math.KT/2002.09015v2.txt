We construct distinguished free generators of the K_0-group of the C*-algebra C(\mathbb{CP}^n_\mathcal{T}) of the multipullback quantum complex projective space. To this end, first we prove a quantum-tubular-neighborhood lemma to overcome the difficulty of the lack of an embedding of \mathbb{CP}^{n-1}_\mathcal{T} in \mathbb{CP}^n_\mathcal{T}. This allows us to compute K_0(C(\mathbb{CP}^n_\mathcal{T} )) using the Mayer-Vietoris six-term exact sequence in K-theory. The same lemma also helps us to prove a comparison theorem identifying the K_0-group of the C*-algebra C(\mathbb{CP}^n_q) of the Vaksman-Soibelman quantum complex projective space with K_0(C(\mathbb{CP}^n_\mathcal{T})). Since this identification is induced by the restriction-corestriction of a U(1)-equivariant \mbox{*-homomorphism} from the C*-algebra C(S^{2n+1}_q) of the (2n\!+\!1)-dimensional Vaksman-Soibelman quantum sphere to the C*-algebra C(S^{2n+1}_H) of the (2n\!+\!1)-dimensional Heegaard quantum sphere, we conclude that there is a basis of K_0(C(\mathbb{CP}^n_\mathcal{T})) given by associated noncommutative vector bundles coming from the same representations that yield an associated-noncommutative-vector-bundle basis of the K_0(C(\mathbb{CP}^n_q)). Finally, using identities in K-theory afforded by Toeplitz projections in C(\mathbb{CP}^n_\mathcal{T}), we prove noncommutative Atiyah-Todd identities.
