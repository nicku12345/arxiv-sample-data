We study the Hilbert scheme \mathrm{Hilb}_d(\mathbb{A}^\infty) from an \mathbb{A}^1-homotopical viewpoint and obtain applications to algebraic K-theory. We show that the Hilbert scheme \mathrm{Hilb}_d(\mathbb{A}^\infty) is \mathbb{A}^1-equivalent to the Grassmannian of (d-1)-planes in \mathbb{A}^\infty. We then describe the \mathbb{A}^1-homotopy type of \mathrm{Hilb}_d(\mathbb{A}^n) in a range, for n large compared to d. For example, we compute the integral cohomology of \mathrm{Hilb}_d(\mathbb{A}^n)(\mathbb{C}) in a range. We also deduce that the forgetful map \mathrm{FFlat}\to\mathrm{Vect} from the moduli stack of finite locally free schemes to that of finite locally free sheaves is an \mathbb{A}^1-equivalence after group completion. This implies that the moduli stack \mathrm{FFlat}, viewed as a presheaf with framed transfers, is a model for the effective motivic spectrum \mathrm{kgl} representing algebraic K-theory. Combining our techniques with the recent work of Bachmann, we obtain Hilbert scheme models for the \mathrm{kgl}-homology of smooth proper schemes over a perfect field.
