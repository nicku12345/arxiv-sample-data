Using the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients, we develop a K-theory formula for reduced C*-algebras of strongly 0-E-unitary inverse semigroups, or equivalently, for certain reduced partial crossed products. In the case of semigroup C*-algebras, we obtain a generalization of previous K-theory results of Cuntz, Echterhoff and the author without having to assume the Toeplitz condition. As applications, we discuss semigroup C*-algebras of Artin monoids, Baumslag-Solitar monoids, one-relator monoids, C*-algebras generated by right regular representations of semigroups from number theory, and C*-algebras of inverse semigroups arising in the context of tilings.
