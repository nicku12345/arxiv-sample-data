Fix an odd prime p. The results in this paper are modeled after work of Hesselholt and Hesselholt-Madsen on the p-typical absolute de Rham-Witt complex in mixed characteristic. We have two primary results. The first is an exact sequence which describes the kernel of the restriction map on the de Rham-Witt complex over A, where A is the ring of integers in an algebraic extension of \mathbb{Q}_p, or where A is a p-torsion-free perfectoid ring. The second result is a description of the p-power torsion (and related objects) in the de Rham-Witt complex over A, where A is a p-torsion-free perfectoid ring containing a compatible system of p-power roots of unity. Both of these results are analogous to results of Hesselholt and Madsen. Our main contribution is the extension of their results to certain perfectoid rings. We also provide algebraic proofs of these results, whereas the proofs of Hesselholt and Madsen used techniques from topology.
