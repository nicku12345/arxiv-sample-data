In this paper we prove a Thomason-style descent theorem for the \rho-complete sphere spectrum. In particular, we deduce a very general \'etale descent result for torsion, \rho-complete motivic spectra. To this end, we prove a new convergence result for slice spectral sequence in the \rho-complete motivic category, following Levine's work. This generalizes and extends previous \'etale descent results for motivic cohomology theories which, combined with \'etale rigidity results, gives a complete, structural description of the \'etale motivic stable category.
