Constructing Morse functions and their higher dimensional versions or fold maps is fundamental, important and challenging in investigating the topologies and the differentiable structures of differentiable manifolds via Morse functions, fold maps and more general generic maps. It is one of important and interesting branches of the singularity theory of differentiable maps and applications to geometry of manifolds. In this paper we present fold maps with information of cohomology rings of their Reeb spaces. Reeb spaces are defined as the spaces of all connected components of all preimages, and in suitable situations inherit topological information such as homology groups and cohomology rings of the manifolds. Previously, the author demonstrated construction of fold maps in various cases : key methods are surgery operations to manifolds and maps and in this paper, we present more useful surgery operations and by them we construct new fold maps. More precisely, fold maps with singular value sets with crossings: the singular value set of a smooth map is the image of the set of all singular points and note that for fold maps, the set of all singular points are closed submanifolds without boundaries and the restrictions to them are immersions of codimension 1.
