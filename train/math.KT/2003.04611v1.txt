The cohomology H^*(\Gamma, E)  of a torsion-free arithmetic subgroup \Gamma of the special linear \mathbb{Q}-group \mathsf{G} = SL_n may be interpreted in terms of the automorphic spectrum of \Gamma. Within this framework, there is a decomposition of the cohomology into the cuspidal cohomology and the Eisenstein cohomology. The latter space is decomposed according to the classes \{\mathsf{P}\} of associate proper parabolic \mathbb{Q}-subgroups of \mathsf{G}. Each summand H^*_{\mathrm{\{P\}}}(\Gamma, E) is built up by Eisenstein series (or residues of such) attached to cuspidal automorphic forms on the Levi components of elements in \{\mathsf{P}\}. The cohomology H^*(\Gamma, E)  vanishes above the degree given by the cohomological dimension \mathrm{cd}(\Gamma) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}. We are concerned with the internal structure of the cohomology in this top degree. On the one hand, we explicitly describe the associate classes \{\mathsf{P}\} for which the corresponding summand H^{\mathrm{cd}(\Gamma)}_{\mathrm{\{\mathsf{P}\}}}(\Gamma, E) vanishes. On the other hand, in the remaining cases of associate classes we construct various families of non-vanishing Eisenstein cohomology classes which span H^{\mathrm{cd}(\Gamma)}_{\mathrm{\{\mathsf{Q}\}}}(\Gamma, \mathbb{C}). Finally, in the case of a principal congruence subgroup \Gamma(q), q = p^{\nu} > 5, p\geq 3 a prime, we give lower bounds for the size of these spaces if not even a precise formula for its dimension for certain associate classes \{\mathsf{Q}\}.
