Let R be an Artin algebra and e an idempotent of R. Assume that {\rm Tor}_i^{eRe}(Re,G)=0 for any G\in{\rm GProj} eRe and i sufficiently large. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the Schur functor S_e to induce a triangle-equivalence \mathbb{D}_{def}(R)\simeq\mathbb{D}_{def}(eRe). Combine this with a result of Psaroudakis-Skartsaterhagen-Solberg [29], we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the singular equivalence \mathbb{D}_{sg}(R)\simeq\mathbb{D}_{sg}(eRe) to restrict to a triangle-equivalence \underline{{\rm GProj} R}\simeq\underline{{\rm GProj} eRe}. Applying these to the triangular matrix algebra T=\left(   \begin{array}{cc}   A & M \quad   0 & B   \end{array}   \right), corresponding results between candidate categories of T and A (resp. B) are obtained. As a consequence, we infer Gorensteinness and CM-freeness of T from those of A (resp. B). Some concrete examples are given to indicate one can realise the Gorenstein defect category of a triangular matrix algebra as the singularity category of one of its corner algabras.
