We determine the mod p cohomological invariants for several affine group schemes G in chararacteristic p. These are invariants of G-torsors with values in etale motivic cohomology, or equivalently in Kato's version of Galois cohomology based on differential forms.   In particular, we find the mod 2 cohomological invariants for the symmetric groups and the orthogonal groups in characteristic 2, which Serre computed in characteristic not 2. We also determine all operations on the mod p etale motivic cohomology of fields, extending Vial's computations of the operations on the mod p Milnor K-theory of fields.
