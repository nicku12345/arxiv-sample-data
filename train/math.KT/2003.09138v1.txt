A generalisation of the equivariant Dixmier-Douady invariant is constructed as a second-degree cohomology class within a new semi-equivariant \v{C}ech cohomology theory. This invariant obstructs liftings of semi-equivariant principal bundles that are associated to central exact sequences of structure groups in which each structure group is acted on by the equivariance group. The results and methods described can be applied to the study of complex vector bundles equipped with linear/anti-linear actions, such as Atiyah's Real vector bundles.
