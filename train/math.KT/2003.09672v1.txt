This paper is part of a sequence interpreting quantities of conformal field theories K-theoretically. Here we give geometric constructions of the associated module categories (modular invariants, nimreps, etc). In particular, we give a KK-theory interpretation of all modular invariants for the loop groups of tori, as well as most known modular invariants of loop groups. In addition, we find unexpectedly that the Tambara-Yamagami fusion category has an elegant description as bundles over a groupoid, and use that to interpret its module categories as KK-elements. We establish reconstruction for the doubles of all Tambara-Yamagami categories, generalizing work of Bischoff to even-order groups. We conclude by relating the modular group representations coming from finite groups and loop groups to the Chern character and to the Fourier-Mukai transform
