We study Grothedieck groups of triangulated categories using weight structures, weight complexes, and the corresponding pure (co)homological functors. We prove some general statements on K_0 of weighted categories and apply it to Voevodsky motives endowed with so-called Chow weight structures. We obtain certain "motivic substitutes" for smooth compactifications of smooth varieties over arbitrary perfect fields; this enables us to make certain unramified cohomology and Euler characteristic calculations that are closely related to results of T. Ekedahl and B. Kahn.
