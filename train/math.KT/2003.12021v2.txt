We establish a kind of "degree zero Freudenthal Gm-suspension theorem" in motivic homotopy theory. From this we deduce results about the conservativity of the P^1-stabilization functor.   In order to establish these results, we show how to compute certain pullbacks in the cohomology of a strictly homotopy invariant sheaf in terms of the Rost--Schmid complex. This establishes the main conjecture of [BY18], which easily implies the aforementioned results.
