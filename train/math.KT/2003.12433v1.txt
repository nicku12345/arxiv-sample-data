In a previous work, we proved an index theorem for families of asymptotically hyperbolic discrete dynamical systems and obtained applications to bifurcation theory. A weaker and far more common assumption than asymptotic hyperbolicity is the existence of an exponential dichotomy. In this paper we generalize all our previous results to the latter setting, which requires substantial modifications of our arguments. In addition, we generalize previous results on continuity and differentiability of Nemitski operators for discrete dynamical systems to obtain even better bifurcation results.
