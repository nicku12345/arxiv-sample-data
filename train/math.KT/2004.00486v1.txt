In this paper, we introduce several new secondary invariants for Dirac operators on a complete Riemannian manifold with a uniform positive scalar curvature metric outside a compact set and use these secondary invariants to establish a higher index theorem for the Dirac operators. We apply our theory to study the secondary invariants for a manifold with corner with positive scalar curvature metric on each boundary face.
