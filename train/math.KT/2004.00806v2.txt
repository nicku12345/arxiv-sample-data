We construct a C_2-equivariant spectral sequence for RO(C_2)-graded homotopy groups. The construction is by using the motivic effective slice filtration and the C_2-equivariant Betti realization. We apply the spectral sequence to compute the RO(C_2)-graded homotopy groups of the completed C_2-equivariant connective real K-theory spectrum. The computation reproves the C_2-equivariant Adams spectral sequence results by Guillou, Hill, Isaksen and Ravenel.
