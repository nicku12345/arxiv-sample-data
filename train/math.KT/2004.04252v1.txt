If G has periodic cohomology then, for appropriate n, the tree of algebraic n-complexes is isomorphic as a graded tree to the stable class [P] of a projective module representing the Swan finiteness obstruction. We use this to show that the tree of homotopy types of (G,n)-complexes can be recovered by quotienting by a certain action of \text{Aut}(G) on [P] which we describe explicitly.
