The present paper is an attempt to give a geometric description of "higher" twistings of topological K-theory that have finite order. For this purpose we introduce some bundle-like objects over a base X that locally over open U\subset X are equivalent to a matrix algebra bundle A_k\stackrel{M_k(\mathbb{C})}{\longrightarrow}U in some category-theoretic sense. Such objects not necessarily come from some locally trivial matrix algebra bundle, and we show how this gives the required description.   v.2: major changes, especially in the second half of the paper
