We show that the cohomology ring of a finite-dimensional complex pointed Hopf algebra with an abelian group of group-like elements is finitely generated. Our strategy has three major steps. We first reduce the problem to the finite generation of cohomology of finite dimensional Nichols algebras of diagonal type. For the Nichols algebras we do a detailed analysis of cohomology via the Anick resolution reducing the problem further to specific combinatorial properties. Finally, to check these properties we turn to the classification of Nichols algebras of diagonal type due to Heckenberger. In this paper we complete the verification of these combinatorial properties for major parametric families, including Nichols algebras of Cartan and super types and develop all the theoretical foundations necessary for the case-by-case analysis. The remaining discrete families are addressed in a separate publication. As an application of the main theorem we deduce finite generation of cohomology for other classes of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, including basic Hopf algebras with abelian groups of characters and finite quotients of quantum groups at roots of one.
