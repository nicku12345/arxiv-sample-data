Grothendieck-Witt spectra represent higher Grothendieck-Witt groups and higher Hermitian K-theory in particular. A description of the Grothendieck-Witt spectrum of a finite dimensional projective bundle \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}) over a base scheme X is given in terms of the Grothendieck-Witt spectra of the base, using the dg category of strictly perfect complexes, provided that X is a scheme over \text{Spec }\mathbb{Z}[1/2] and satisfies the resolution property, e.g. if X has an ample family of line bundles.
