We compute the equivariant KO-homology of the classifying space for proper actions of \textrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z}) and \textrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{Z}). We also compute the Bredon homology and equivariant K-homology of the classifying spaces for proper actions of \textrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{p}]) and \textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{p}]) for each prime p. Finally, we prove the Unstable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg Conjecture for a large class of groups whose maximal finite subgroups are odd order and have periodic cohomology.
