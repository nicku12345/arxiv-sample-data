We prove that \mathrm{St}(n, A) is a crossed module over \mathrm{GL}(n, A) under a local stable rank condition on an algebra A over a commutative ring. Our proof uses only elementary localization techniques in terms of pro-groups and stability results for \mathrm K_1 and \mathrm K_2. We also prove similar result for the Steinberg group associated with any sufficiently isotropic general linear group constructed by a quasi-finite algebra.
