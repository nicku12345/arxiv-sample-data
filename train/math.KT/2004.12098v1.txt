We prove that the \infty-category of motivic spectra satisfies Milnor excision: if A\to B is a morphism of commutative rings sending an ideal I\subset A isomorphically onto an ideal of B, then a motivic spectrum over A is equivalent to a pair of motivic spectra over B and A/I that are identified over B/IB. Consequently, any cohomology theory represented by a motivic spectrum satisfies Milnor excision. We also prove Milnor excision for Ayoub's \'etale motives over schemes of finite virtual cohomological dimension.
