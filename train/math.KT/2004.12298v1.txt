In this work we develop a theory of motives for logarithmic schemes over fields in the sense of Fontaine, Illusie, and Kato. Our construction is based on the notion of finite log correspondences, the dividing Nisnevich topology on log schemes, and the idea of parameterizing homotopies by \overline{\square}, i.e. the projective line with respect to its compactifying logarithmic structure at infinity. Hodge cohomology of log schemes is an example of an \overline{\square}-invariant theory that is representable in the category of logarithmic motives. This bears a resemblance to Voevodsky's category of motives and \mathbb{A}^{1}-invariant theories. Assuming resolution of singularities, we identify the latter with the full subcategory comprised of \mathbb{A}^{1}-local objects in the category of logarithmic motives. Palpable properties such as \overline{\square}-homotopy invariance, Mayer-Vietoris for coverings, and a symmetric monoidal structure witness the robustness of the setup. Moreover, we show that logarithmic motives satisfy fundamental properties such as a projective bundle theorem, a blow-up distinguished triangle, and a Gysin distinguished triangle.
