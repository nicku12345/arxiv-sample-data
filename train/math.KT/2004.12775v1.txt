In [1] we introduced the concept of structured space, which is a topological space that locally resembles some algebraic structures. In [2] we proceeded the study of these spaces, developing two cohomology theories. The aim of this paper is to define categories of structured spaces, (pre)sheaves with values in such categories, and generalised notions of vector bundles, ringed spaces and schemes. Then, we will construct (using some techniques and also the general method in Section 2 of [2]) various cohomology theories for these objects.
