Let X be a smooth manifold and \mathbf{k} be a commutative (or at least \mathbb{E}_2) ring spectrum. Given a smooth exact Lagrangian L\hookrightarrow T^*X, the microlocal sheaf theory (following Kashiwara--Schapira) naturally assigns a locally constant sheaf of categories on L with fiber equivalent to the category of \mathbf{k}-spectra \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbf{k}). We show that the classifying map for the local system of categories factors through the stable Gauss map L\rightarrow U/O and the delooping of the J-homomorphism U/O\rightarrow B\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbf{S}). As an application, combining with previous results of Guillermou [Gui], we recover a result of Abouzaid--Kragh [AbKr] on the triviality of the composition L\rightarrow U/O\rightarrow B\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbf{S}), when L is in addition compact.
