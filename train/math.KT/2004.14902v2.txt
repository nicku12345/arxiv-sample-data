The homotopy category of the bordism category hBord_d has as objects closed oriented (d-1)-manifolds and as morphisms diffeomorphism classes of d-dimensional bordisms. Using a new fiber sequence for bordism categories, we compute the classifying space of hBord_d for d = 1, exhibiting it as a circle bundle over \mathbb{CP}^\infty_{-1}.   As part of our proof we construct a quotient Bord_1^{red} of the cobordism category where circles are deleted. We show that this category has classifying space \Omega^{\infty-2}\mathbb{CP}^\infty_{-1} and moreover that, if one equips these bordisms with a map to a simply connected space X, the resulting Bord_1^{red}(X) can be thought of as a cobordism model for the topological cyclic homology TC(\mathbb{S}[\Omega X]).   In the second part of the paper we construct an infinite loop space map B(hBord_1^{red}) \to Q(\Sigma^2 \mathbb{CP}^\infty_+) in this model and use it to derive combinatorial formulas for rational cocycles on Bord_1^{red} representing the Miller-Morita-Mumford classes \kappa_i \in H^{2i+2}((B(hBord_1); \mathbb{Q}).
