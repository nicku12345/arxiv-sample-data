In previous work, we related homotopy types of (G,n)-complexes when G has periodic cohomology to projective \mathbb{Z} G modules representing the Swan finiteness obstruction. We use this to determine when X \vee S^n \simeq Y \vee S^n implies X \simeq Y for (G,n)-complexes X and Y, and give lower bounds for the number of minimal homotopy types of (G,n)-complexes when this fails. The proof involves constructing projective \mathbb{Z} G modules as lifts of locally free modules over orders in products of quaternion algebras, whose existence follows from the Eichler mass formula. In the case n=2, difficulties arise which lead to a new approach to finding a counterexample to Wall's D2 problem.
