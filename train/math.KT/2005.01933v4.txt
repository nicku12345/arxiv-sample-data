Let N be a closed spin manifold with positive scalar curvature and D_N the Dirac operator on N. Let M_1 and M_2 be two Galois covers of N such that M_2 is a quotient of M_1. Then the quotient map from M_1 to M_2 naturally induces maps between the geometric C^*-algebras associated to the two manifolds. We prove, by a finite-propagation argument, that the \emph{maximal} higher rho invariants of the lifts of D_N to M_1 and M_2 behave functorially with respect to the above quotient map. This can be applied to the computation of higher rho invariants, along with other related invariants.
