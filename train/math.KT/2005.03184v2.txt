In recent years, a large class of nuclear C^\ast-algebras have been classified, modulo an assumption on the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT). We think this assumption is redundant and propose a strategy for proving it. Indeed, following the original proof of the classification theorem, we propose bridging the gap between reduction theorems and examples. While many such bridges are possible, various approximate ideal structures appear quite promising.
