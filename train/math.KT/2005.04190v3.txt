Let p be a prime, n \geq 1, K(n) the nth Morava K-theory spectrum, \mathbb{G}_n the extended Morava stabilizer group, and K(A) the algebraic K-theory spectrum of a commutative S-algebra A. For a type n+1 complex V_n, Ausoni and Rognes conjectured that (a) the unit map i_n: L_{K(n)}(S^0) \to E_n from the K(n)-local sphere to the Lubin-Tate spectrum induces a map \[K(L_{K(n)}(S^0)) \wedge v_{n+1}^{-1}V_n \to (K(E_n))^{h\mathbb{G}_n} \wedge v_{n+1}^{-1}V_n\] that is a weak equivalence, where (b) since \mathbb{G}_n is profinite, (K(E_n))^{h\mathbb{G}_n} denotes a continuous homotopy fixed point spectrum, and (c) \pi_\ast(-) of the target of the above map is the abutment of a homotopy fixed point spectral sequence. For n = 1, p \geq 5, and V_1 = V(1), we give a way to realize the above map and (c), by proving that i_1 induces a map \[K(L_{K(1)}(S^0)) \wedge v_{2}^{-1}V_1 \to (K(E_1) \wedge v_{2}^{-1}V_1)^{h\mathbb{G}_1},\] where the target of this map is a continuous homotopy fixed point spectrum, with an associated homotopy fixed point spectral sequence. Also, we prove that there is an equivalence \[(K(E_1) \wedge v_{2}^{-1}V_1)^{h\mathbb{G}_1} \simeq (K(E_1))^{\widetilde{h}\mathbb{G}_1} \wedge v_2^{-1}V_1,\] where (K(E_1))^{\widetilde{h}\mathbb{G}_1} is the homotopy fixed points with \mathbb{G}_1 regarded as a discrete group.
