Over any field of characteristic not 2, we establish a 2-term resolution of the \eta-periodic, 2-local motivic sphere spectrum by shifts of the connective 2-local Witt K-theory spectrum. This is curiously similar to the resolution of the K(1)-local sphere in classical stable homotopy theory. As applications we determine the \eta-periodized motivic stable stems and the \eta-periodized algebraic symplectic and SL-cobordism groups. Along the way we construct Adams operations on the motivic spectrum representing Hermitian K-theory and establish new completeness results for certain motivic spectra over fields of finite virtual 2-cohomological dimension. In an appendix, we supply a new proof of the homotopy fixed point theorem for the Hermitian K-theory of fields.
