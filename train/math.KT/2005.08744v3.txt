We discuss some general properties of \mathrm{TR} and its K(1)-localization. We prove that after K(1)-localization, \mathrm{TR} of H\mathbb{Z}-algebras is a truncating invariant in the sense of Land--Tamme, and deduce h-descent results. We show that for regular rings in mixed characteristic, \mathrm{TR} is asymptotically K(1)-local, extending results of Hesselholt--Madsen. As an application of these methods and recent advances in the theory of cyclotomic spectra, we construct an analog of Thomason's spectral sequence relating K(1)-local K-theory and \'etale cohomology for K(1)-local \mathrm{TR}.
