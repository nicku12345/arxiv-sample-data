We characterize A_\infty-structures that are transfers over a chain homotopy equivalence or a quasi-isomorphism, answering a question posed by D. Sullivan. Along the way, we present an obstruction theory for weak A_\infty-morphisms over an arbitrary commutative ring. We then generalize our results to {\mathcal P}_\infty-structures over a field of characteristic zero, for any quadratic Koszul operad {\mathcal P}.
