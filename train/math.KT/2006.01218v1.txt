Let (S,L) be a Lie-Rinehart algebra such that L is S-projective and let U be its universal enveloping algebra. In this paper we present a spectral sequence which converges to the Hochschild cohomology of U with values on a U-bimodule M and whose second page involves the Lie-Rinehart cohomology of the algebra and the Hochschild cohomology of S with values on M. After giving a convenient description of the involved algebraic structures we use the spectral sequence to compute explicitly the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra of differential operators tangent to a central arrangement of three lines.
