We construct well-behaved extensions of the motivic spectra representing generalized motivic cohomology and connective Balmer--Witt K-theory (among others) to mixed characteristic Dedekind schemes on which 2 is invertible. As a consequence we lift the fundamental fiber sequence of \eta-periodic motivic stable homotopy theory established in [arxiv:2005.06778] from fields to arbitrary base schemes, and use this to determine (among other things) the \eta-periodized algebraic symplectic and SL-cobordism groups of mixed characteristic Dedekind schemes containing 1/2.
