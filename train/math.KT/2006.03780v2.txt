In this paper, which is based on the author's MSc thesis, we study in detail the cohomology theory for twisted coalgebras introduced in "Monoidal Functors, Species and Hopf Algebras" by M. Aguiar and S. Mahajan. We compute it completely in various examples, including those proposed by Aguiar and Mahajan, and obtain structural results: in particular, we study its multiplicative structure, provide a K\"unneth formula, and succeed in giving an alternative description of this cohomology theory which, in particular, allows for its effective computation.   At the very end of the paper, we briefly outline how all the computations done in this paper can be swiftly explained and extended to an arbitrary Koszul twisted coalgebra through their corresponding Koszul duality theory. While doing so, we work out the example of the species of linear orders: we show it is twisted Koszul, compute its dual and the (doubly) graded dimensions of its components, which turn out to be the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind.
