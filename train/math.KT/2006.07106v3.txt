We propose two definitions of configuration Lie groupoids of a Lie groupoid. In both the cases we prove a Fadell-Neuwirth type fibration theorem for a certain class of Lie groupoids and give infinitely many examples of Lie groupoids where it fails. The second main purpose of this article is to study the fundamental groups (called {\it pure orbifold braid groups}) of the configuration Lie groupoids of a family of Lie groupoids, including the above examples. This is achieved by producing a short exact sequence, although the fibration theorem fails in these cases. Among several consequences, first we see that the pure orbifold braid groups have poly-virtually free structure, which generalizes the classical braid group case. We also provide an explicit set of generators of the pure orbifold braid groups. Secondly, we prove that a class of affine and finite complex Artin groups are virtually poly-free, which partially answers the question if all Artin groups are virtually poly-free ([[3], Question 2]). Finally, combining this poly-virtually free structure and a recent result ([4]), we deduce the Farrell-Jones isomorphism conjecture for the above class of orbifold braid groups. This also implies the conjecture for the case of the Artin group of type \tilde D_n, which was left open in [24].
