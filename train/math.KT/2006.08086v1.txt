Consider a proper, isometric action by a unimodular locally compact group G on a Riemannian manifold M with boundary, such that M/G is compact. Then an equivariant Dirac-type operator D on M under a suitable boundary condition has an equivariant index \operatorname{index}_G(D) in the K-theory of the reduced group C^*-algebra C^*_rG of G. This is a common generalisation of the Baum-Connes analytic assembly map and the (equivariant) Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index. In part I of this series, a numerical index \operatorname{index}_g(D) was defined for an element g \in G, in terms of a parametrix of D and a trace associated to g. An Atiyah-Patodi-Singer type index formula was obtained for this index. In this paper, we show that, under certain conditions, \tau_g(\operatorname{index}_G(D)) = \operatorname{index}_g(D), for a trace \tau_g defined by the orbital integral over the conjugacy class of g. This implies that the index theorem from part I yields information about the K-theoretic index \operatorname{index}_G(D). It also shows that \operatorname{index}_g(D) is a homotopy-invariant quantity.
