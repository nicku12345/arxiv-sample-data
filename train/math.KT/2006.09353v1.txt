We study in detail the so-called Chow-weight homology of Voevodsky motivic complexes and relate it to motivic homology. We generalize earlier results and prove that the vanishing of higher motivic homology groups of a motif M implies similar vanishing for its Chow-weight homology along with effectivity properties of the higher terms of its weight complex t(M) and of higher Deligne weight quotients of its cohomology. Applying this statement to motives with compact support we obtain a similar relation between the vanishing of Chow groups and the cohomology with compact support of varieties. Moreover, we prove that if higher motivic homology groups of a geometric motif or a variety over a universal domain are torsion (in a certain "range") then the exponents of these groups are uniformly bounded.   To prove our main results we study Voevodsky slices of motives. Since the slice functors do not respect the compactness of motives, the results of the previous Chow-weight homology paper are not sufficient for our purposes; this is our main reason to extend them to (w_{Chow}-bounded below) motivic complexes.
