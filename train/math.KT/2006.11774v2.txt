We present a version of projective bundle theorem in MW-motives (resp. Chow-Witt rings), which says that \widetilde{CH}^*(\mathbb{P}(E)) is determined by \widetilde{CH}^*(X), CH^*(X) and Sq^2 for smooth quasi-projective schemes X and vector bundles E over X with odd rank, provided that _2CH^*(X)=0. If the rank of E is even and 2 is invertible, the theorem is still true under a new kind of orientability, called by projective orientability.   As an application, we compute the MW-motives of blow-ups with smooth centers. Moreover, we discuss the invariance of Chow-Witt cycles of projective bundles under automorphisms of vector bundles.
