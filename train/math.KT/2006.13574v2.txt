We show that the Steinberg group \text{St}(C_2,{\mathbb Z}) associated with the Lie type C_2 and with integer coefficients can be realized as a quotient of the braid group B_6 by one relation. As an application we give a new braid-like presentation of the symplectic modular group \text{Sp}_4({\mathbb Z}).
