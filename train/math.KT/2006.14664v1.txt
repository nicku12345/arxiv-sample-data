We construct a functor, from the category of schemes to the category of graded rings, that is an initial object for having a theory of Chern classes with an additive first Chern class. For any scheme X, the graded ring that our functor associates to X is related to the associated graded ring of the \gamma-filtration on the Grothendieck ring of finite rank locally free sheaves on X via a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch type theorem.
