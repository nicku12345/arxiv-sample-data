This paper contributes to the classification of positive scalar curvature metrics up to bordism and up to concordance. Let M be a closed spin manifold of dimension \ge 5 which admits a metric with positive scalar curvature. We give lower bounds on the rank of the group of psc metrics over M up to bordism in terms of the corank of the canonical map KO_*(M)\to KO_*(B\pi_1(M)), provided the rational analytic Novikov conjecture is true for \pi_1(M).
