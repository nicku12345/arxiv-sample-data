In this paper, we use trace methods to study the algebraic K-theory of rings of the form R[x_1,\ldots, x_d]/(x_1,\ldots, x_d)^2. We compute the relative p-adic K groups for R a perfectoid ring. In particular, we get the integral K groups when R is a finite field, and the integral relative K groups K_*(R[x_1,\ldots, x_d]/(x_1,\ldots, x_d)^2, (x_1,\ldots, x_d)) when R is a perfect \mathbb{F}_p-algebra. We conclude the paper with some other notable computations, including some rings which are not quite of the above form.
