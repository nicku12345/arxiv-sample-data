According to a statement by Pavel Etingof, in the special case of an affine variety X with a faithful action by a finite group G, the sheaf of (twisted) Cherednik algebras \mathcal{H}_{1, c, \psi, X, G} with formal parameters c, \psi is a universal formal deformation of \mathcal{D}_X\rtimes G where \mathcal{D}_X is the sheaf of differential operators on X. In the current note, we generalize Etingof's result to the non-affine case. We prove that for a generic smooth analytic or algebraic variety X, the sheaf \mathcal{H}_{1, c, \psi, X, G} with formal c and \psi is a universal filtered formal deformation of \mathcal{D}_X\rtimes G. To that aim, we first construct quasi-isomorphisms between the Hochschild (co)chain complex of \mathcal{D}_X\rtimes G and the G-invariant part of the direct sum over all elements g in G of sheaves of holomorphic differential forms on the cotangent bundles of the g-fixed point submanifolds in X. Finally, we combine these quasi-isomorphisms with results from the theory of algebraic extensions for sheaves of filtered associative algebras to establish a bijective correspondence between the space of isomorphism classes of filtered infinitesimal deformations of \mathcal{D}_X\rtimes G and the parameter space of \mathcal{H}_{1, c, \psi, X, G}.
