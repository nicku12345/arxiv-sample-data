Let \mathcal{O}_K be the ring of integers in an algebraic number field K and let S:=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_K). Let T_0,\ldots,T_n be regular schemes of finite type over S and let X be a scheme of finite type over T_n with a stratification of closed subschemes (a generalized cellular decomposition) \[ \emptyset=X_{-1} \subseteq X_0 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_{n-1} \subseteq X_n:=X \] with X_i-X_{i-1}=E_i where E_i is a vector bundle of rank d_i on T_i. We prove that if the Beilinson-Soule vanishing conjecture and Soule conjecture holds for T_i it follows the same conjectures hold for X. We develop a criteria for the conjectures to hold in terms of an open cover and use this criteria to prove the Beilinson-Soule vanishing conjecture and Soule conjecture for the partial flag bundle \mathbb{F}(d,E) of any coherent \mathcal{O}_S-module E on S. Hence we get non-trivial examples where the conjectures hold in arbitrary dimension. As a special case we prove the conjectures for any affine or projective fibration of finite type over S. We moreover reduce the study of the Beilinson-Soule vanishing conjecture and the Soule conjecture on L-functions to the study of affine regular schemes of finite type over \mathbb{Z}. We also discuss the Beilinson conjecture on special values for partial flag bundles. We reduce the study of the Bloch-Kato conjecture on special values for flag bundles to the case of Dedekind domains.
