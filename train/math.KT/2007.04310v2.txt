We prove the existence of several different families of solvable lattice models whose partition functions give the double \beta-Grothendieck polynomials and the dual double \beta-Grothendieck polynomials for arbitrary permutations. Moreover, we introduce a new family of double "biaxial" \beta-Grothendieck polynomials depending on a pair of permutations which simultaneously generalize both the double and dual double polynomials. We then use these models and their Yang-Baxter equations to reprove Fomin-Kirillov's Cauchy identity for \beta-Grothendieck polynomials, generalize it to a new Cauchy identity for biaxial \beta-Grothendieck polynomials, and prove a new branching rule for double \beta-Grothendieck polynomials.
