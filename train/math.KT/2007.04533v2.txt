We construct an integrable colored six-vertex model whose partition function is a double Grothendieck polynomial. This gives an integrable systems interpretation of bumpless pipe dreams and recent results of Weigandt [arXiv:2003.07342] relating double Grothendieck polynomias with bumpless pipe dreams. For vexillary permutations, we then construct a new model that we call the semidual version model. We use our semidual model and the five-vertex model of Motegi and Sakai to given a new proof that double Grothendieck polynomials for vexillary permutations are equal to flagged factorial Grothendieck polynomials. Taking the stable limit of double Grothendieck polynomials, we obtain a new proof that the stable limit is a factorial Grothendieck polynomial as defined by McNamara. The states of our semidual model naturally correspond to families of nonintersecting lattice paths, where we can then use the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot lemma to give a determinant formula for double Schubert polynomials corresponding to vexillary permutations.
