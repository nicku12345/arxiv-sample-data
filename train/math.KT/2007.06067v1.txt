Let r \geq 2, d be two integers which are coprime to each other. Let C be a smooth projective curve of genus g \geq 2 and M(r,L) be the moduli space of rank r stable vector bundles on C whose determinants are isomorphic to a fixed line bundle L of degree d on C. In this paper, we study motivic decomposition of M(r,L) for r=2, 3 cases. We give a new proof of a version of the main result of arXiv:1806.11101. We also found a new motivic decomposition of M(3,L).
