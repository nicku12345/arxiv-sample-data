For a finite quiver without sinks, we establish an isomorphism in the homotopy category \mathrm {Ho}(B_\infty) of B_{\infty}-algebras between the Hochschild cochain complex of the Leavitt path algebra L and the singular Hochschild cochain complex of the corresponding radical square zero algebra \Lambda. Combining this isomorphism with a description of the dg singularity category of \Lambda in terms of the dg perfect derived category of L, we verify Keller's conjecture for the singular Hochschild cohomology of \Lambda. More precisely, we prove that there is an isomorphism in \mathrm{Ho}(B_\infty) between the singular Hochschild cochain complex of \Lambda and the Hochschild cochain complex of the dg singularity category of \Lambda. One ingredient of the proof is the following duality theorem on B_\infty-algebras: for any B_\infty-algebra, there is a natural B_\infty-isomorphism between its opposite B_\infty-algebra and its transpose B_\infty-algebra.   We prove that Keller's conjecture is invariant under one-point (co)extensions and singular equivalences with levels. Consequently, Keller's conjecture holds for those algebras obtained inductively from \Lambda by one-point (co)extensions and singular equivalences with levels. These algebras include all finite dimensional gentle algebras.
