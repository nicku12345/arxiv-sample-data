We discuss a homological method for transferring algebra structures on complexes along suitably nice homotopy equivalences, including those obtained after an application of the Perturbation Lemma. We study the implications for the Homotopy Transfer Theorems under such homotopy equivalences.   As an application, we discuss how to use the homotopy on a Koszul complex given by a scaled de Rham map to find a new method for building a dg algebra structure on a well-known resolution, obtaining one that is both concrete and permutation invariant.
