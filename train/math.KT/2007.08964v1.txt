Higher twisted K-theory is an extension of twisted K-theory introduced by Ulrich Pennig which captures all of the homotopy-theoretic twists of topological K-theory in a geometric way. We give an overview of his formulation and key results, and reformulate the definition from a topological perspective. We then investigate ways of producing explicit geometric representatives of the higher twists of K-theory viewed as cohomology classes in special cases using the clutching construction and when the class is decomposable. Atiyah-Hirzebruch and Serre spectral sequences are developed and information on their differentials is obtained, and these along with a Mayer-Vietoris sequence in higher twisted K-theory are applied in order to perform computations for a variety of spaces.
