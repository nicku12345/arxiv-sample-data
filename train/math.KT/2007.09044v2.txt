In this paper, semilocal Milnor K-theory of fields is introduced and studied. A strongly convergent spectral sequence relating semilocal Milnor K-theory to semilocal motivic cohomology is constructed. In weight 2, the motivic cohomology groups H^p_{Zar}(k,\mathbb Z(2)), p\leq 1, are computed as semilocal Milnor K-theory groups \widehat{K}^M_{2,3-p}(k). The following applications are given: (i) several criteria for the Beilinson-Soul\'e Vanishing Conjecture; (ii) computation of K_4 of a field; (iii) the Beilinson conjecture for rational K-theory of fields of prime characteristic is shown to be equivalent to vanishing of rational semilocal Milnor K-theory.
