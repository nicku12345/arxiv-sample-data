We compute the \mathbb{A}^1-localization of several invariants of schemes namely, topological Hochschild homology (\mathrm{THH}), topological cyclic homology (\mathrm{TC}) and topological periodic cyclic homology (\mathrm{TP}). This procedure is quite brutal and kills the completed versions of most of these invariants. The main ingredient for the vanishing statements is the vanishing of \mathbb{A}^1-localization of de Rham cohomology (and, eventually, crystalline cohomology) in positive characteristics.
