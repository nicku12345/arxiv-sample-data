Let A be a discrete valuation ring with field of fractions F and (sufficiently large) residue field k. We prove that there is a natural exact sequence H_3(\mathrm{SL}_2(A),\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]) \to H_3(\mathrm{SL}_2(F),\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}])\to \mathcal{RP}_1(k)[\frac{1}{2}]\to 0, where \mathcal{RP}_1(k) is the refined scissors congruence group of k. Let \Gamma_0(\mathfrak{m}_A) denote the congruence subgroup consisting of matrices in \mathrm{SL}_2(A) whose lower off-diagonal entry lies in the maximal ideal \mathfrak{m}_A. We also prove that there is an exact sequence 0\to \overline{\mathcal{P}}(k)[\frac{1}{2}]\to H_2(\Gamma_0(\mathfrak{m}_A),\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}])\to H_2(\mathrm{SL}_2(A),\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}])\to I^2(k)[\frac{1}{2}]\to 0, where I^2(k) is the second power of the fundamental ideal of the Grothendieck-Witt ring \mathrm{GW}(k) and \overline{\mathcal{P}}(k) is a certain quotient of the scissors congruence group (in the sense of Dupont-Sah) \mathcal{P}(k) of k.
