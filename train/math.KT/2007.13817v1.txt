Let R be a perfectoid ring. Hesselholt and Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze have identified the Postnikov filtration on \mathrm{THH}(R;\mathbb Z_p): it is concentrated in even degrees, generated by powers of the B\"okstedt generator \sigma, generalizing classical B\"okstedt periodicity for R=\mathbb F_p. We study an equivariant generalization of the Postnikov filtration, the *regular slice filtration*, on \mathrm{THH}(R;\mathbb Z_p). The slice filtration is again concentrated in even degrees, generated by RO(\mathbb T)-graded classes which can loosely be thought of as the *norms* of \sigma. The slices are expressible as RO(\mathbb T)-graded suspensions of Mackey functors obtained from the Witt Mackey functor. We obtain a sort of filtration by q-factorials. A key ingredient, which may be of independent interest, is a close connection between the Hill-Yarnall characterization of the slice filtration and Ansch\"utz-le Bras' q-deformation of Legendre's formula.
