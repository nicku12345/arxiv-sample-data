The purpose of this paper is to show the relationship in all dimensions between the structural (diffraction pattern) aspect of tilings (described by \v{C}ech cohomology of the tiling space) and the spectral properties (of Hamiltonians defined on such tilings) defined by K-theory, and to show their equivalence in dimensions \leq 3. A theorem makes precise the conditions for this relationship to hold. It can be viewed as an extension of the "Bloch Theorem" to a large class of aperiodic tilings. The idea underlying this result is based on the relationship between cohomology and K-theory traces and their equivalence in low dimensions.
