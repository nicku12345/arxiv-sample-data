We define a representation of the unitary group U(n) by metaplectic operators acting on L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) and consider the operator algebra generated by the operators of the representation and pseudodifferential operators of Shubin class. Under suitable conditions, we prove the Fredholm property for elements in this algebra and obtain an index formula.
