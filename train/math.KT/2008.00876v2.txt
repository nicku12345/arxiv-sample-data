Operadic tangent cohomology generalizes the existing theories of Harrison cohomology, Chevalley--Eilenberg cohomology and Hochschild cohomology. These are usually non-trivial to compute. We complement the existing computational techniques by producing a spectral sequence that converges to the operadic tangent cohomology of a fixed algebra. Our main technical tool is that of filtrations arising from towers of cofibrations of algebras, which play the same role cell attaching maps and skeletal filtrations do for topological spaces.   As an application, we consider the rational Adams--Hilton construction on topological spaces, where our spectral sequence gives rise to a seemingly new and completely algebraic description of the Serre spectral sequence, which we also show is multiplicative and converges to the Chas--Sullivan loop product. Finally, we consider relative Sullivan--de Rham models of a fibration p, where our spectral sequence converges to the rational homotopy groups of the identity component of the space of self-fiber homotopy equivalences of p.
