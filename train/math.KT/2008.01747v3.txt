In this paper we prove an inverse function theorem in derived differential geometry. More concretely, we show that a morphism of curved L_\infty spaces which is a quasi-isomorphism at a point has a local homotopy inverse. This theorem simultaneously generalizes the inverse function theorem for smooth manifolds and the Whitehead theorem for L_\infty algebras. The main ingredients are the obstruction theory for L_\infty homomorphisms (in the curved setting) and the homotopy transfer theorem for curved L_\infty algebras. Both techniques work in the A_\infty case as well.
