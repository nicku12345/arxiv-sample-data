We provide a reference for basic categorial properties of the categories of (possibly non-unital) \mathbb{C}-linear *-categories or C^{*}-categories, and (not necessarily unit-preserving) functors. Generalizing the classical case of algebras with G-action, we extend the construction of crossed products to categories with G-action. We will show that the crossed product functor preserves exact sequences and excisive squares and sends weak equivalences to equivalences.
