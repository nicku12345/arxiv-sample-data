Consider a pair of symplectic varieties dual with respect to 3D-mirror symmetry. The K-theoretic limit of the elliptic duality interface is an equivariant K-theory class of the product. We show that this class provides correspondences in the product mapping the K-theoretic stable envelopes to the K-theoretic stable envelopes. This construction allows us to extend the action of various representation theoretic objects on K(X), such as action of quantum groups, quantum Weyl groups, R-matrices etc., to their action on the K-theory of the variety dual to X. In particular, we relate the wall R-matrices to the R-matrices of the dual variety.   As an example, we apply our results to the Hilbert scheme of n points in the complex plane. In this case we arrive at the conjectures of E.Gorsky and A.Negut.
