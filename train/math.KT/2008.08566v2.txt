Inspired by the work of Bell on dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture, and by the family Floer homology, we construct p-adic analytic families of bimodules on the Fukaya category of a monotone or negatively monotone symplectic manifold, interpolating the bimodules corresponding to iterates of a symplectomorphism \phi isotopic to identity. We consider this family as a p-adic analytic action on the Fukaya category. Using this, we deduce that the ranks of Floer homology groups HF(\phi^k(L),L';\Lambda) are constant in k\in\mathbb{Z}, with finitely many possible exceptions. We also prove an analogous result without the monotonicity assumption for generic \phi isotopic to identity by showing how to construct a p-adic analytic action in this case.
