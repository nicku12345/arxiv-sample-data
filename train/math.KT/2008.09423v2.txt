Schur's Theorem and its generalisation, Baer's Theorem, are distinguished results in group theory, connecting the upper central quotients with the lower central series. The aim of this paper is to generalise these results in two different directions, using novel methods related with the non-abelian tensor product. In particular, we prove a version of Schur-Baer Theorem for finitely generated groups. Then, we apply these newly obtained results to describe the k-nilpotent multiplier, for k\geq 2, and other invariants of groups.
