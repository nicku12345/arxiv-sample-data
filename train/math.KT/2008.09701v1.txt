Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators on the real line coupled with a natural family of representations of the irrational rotation algebra are used to build a family of 2-dimensional spectral triples over the Schwartz algebra of the irrational torus. These spectral cycles (`Heisenberg cycles') fit easily into Connes' framework of Noncommutative Geometry: they are regular and give rise to meromorphic zeta functions, which we compute geometrically via Mehler's formula for the harmonic oscillator. We compute the Connes'-Moscovici Index formula for the Heisenberg cycles and determine their Chern characters, which are mixed-degree co-cochains with the standard trace in degree zero and Connes' curvature cocycle times the rotation parameter, in degree 2. We apply the resulting index computations to prove a result about the b-twist renormalization morphisms arising in a previous paper of the first author and A. Duwenig.
