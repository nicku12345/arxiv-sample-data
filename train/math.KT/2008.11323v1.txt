This is the first of a series of papers on enriched infinity categories, seeking to reduce enriched higher category theory to the higher algebra of presentable infinity categories, which is better understood and can be approached via universal properties.   In this paper, we introduce enriched presheaves on an enriched infinity category. We prove analogues of most familiar properties of presheaves. For example, we compute limits and colimits of presheaves, prove that all presheaves are colimits of representable presheaves, and prove a version of the Yoneda lemma.
