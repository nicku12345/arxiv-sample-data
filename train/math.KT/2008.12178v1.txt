Let T=(A,M,0,B) be a triangular matrix algebra with its corner algebras A and B Artinian and _AM_B an A-B-bimodule. The 2-recollement structures for singularity categories and Gorenstein defect categories over T are studied. Under mild assumptions, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existences of 2-recollements of singularity categories and Gorenstein defect categories over T relative to those of A and B. Parts of our results strengthen and unify the corresponding work in [27,28,34].
