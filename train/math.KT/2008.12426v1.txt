E-theory was originally defined concretely by Connes and Higson and further work followed this construction. We generalise the definition to C^\ast-categories. C^\ast-categories were formulated to give a theory of operator algebras in a categorical picture and play important role in the study of mathematical physics. In this context, they are analogous to C^\ast-algebras and so have invariants defined coming from C^\ast-algebra theory but they do not yet have a definition of E-theory. Here we define E-theory for both complex and real graded C^\ast-categories and prove it has similar properties to E-theory for C^\ast-algebras.
