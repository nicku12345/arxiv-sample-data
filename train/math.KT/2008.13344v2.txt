In this paper we show that the \mathrm{K}-homology groups of a separable C*-algebra can be enriched with additional descriptive set-theoretic information, and regarded as definable groups. Using a definable version of the Universal Coefficient Theorem, we prove that the corresponding definable \mathrm{K}-homology is a finer invariant than the purely algebraic one, even when restricted to the class of UHF C*-algebras, or to the class of unital commutative C*-algebras whose spectrum is a 1-dimensional connected subspace of \mathbb{R}^{3}.
