In this note, we review some recent developments related to metric aspects of scalar curvature from the point of view of index theory for Dirac operators. In particular, we revisit index-theoretic approaches to a conjecture of Gromov on the width of Riemannian bands M \times [-1,1], and on a conjecture of Rosenberg and Stolz on the non-existence of complete positive scalar curvature metrics on M \times {\mathbb R}. We show that there is a more general geometric statement underlying both of them implying a quantitative negative upper bound on the infimum of the scalar curvature of a complete metric on M \times {\mathbb R} if the scalar curvature is positive in some neighborhood. We study (\hat{A}-)iso-enlargeable spin manifolds and related notions of width for Riemannian manifolds from an index-theoretic point of view. Finally, we list some open problems arising in the interplay between index theory, largeness properties and width.
