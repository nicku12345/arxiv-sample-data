Let n be an integer greater than or equal to 3 and (R,\Delta) a Hermitian form ring where R is commutative. We prove that if H is a subgroup of the odd-dimensional unitary group U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta) normalised by a relative elementary subgroup EU_{2n+1}((R,\Delta),(I,\Omega)), then there is an odd form ideal (J,\Sigma) such that EU_{2n+1}((R,\Delta),(JI^{k},\Omega_{\min}^{JI^k}\overset{\cdot}{+}\Sigma\circ I^{k}))\leq H \leq CU_{2n+1}((R,\Delta),(J,\Sigma)) where k=12 if n=3 respectively k=10 if n\geq 4. As a conseqence of this result we obtain a sandwich theorem for subnormal subgroups of odd-dimensional unitary groups.
