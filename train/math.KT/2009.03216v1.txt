We study the Hochschild homology of the convolution algebra of a proper Lie groupoid by introducing a convolution sheaf over the space of orbits. We develop a localization result for the associated Hochschild homology sheaf, and prove that the Hochschild homology sheaf at each stalk is quasi-isomorphic to the stalk at the origin of the Hochschild homology of the convolution algebra of its linearization, which is the transformation groupoid of a linear action of a compact isotropy group on a vector space. We then explain Brylinski's ansatz to compute the Hochschild homology of the transformation groupoid of a compact group action on a manifold. We verify Brylinski's conjecture for the case of smooth circle actions that the Hochschild homology is given by basic relative forms on the associated inertia space.
