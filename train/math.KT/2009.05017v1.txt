For an extension of associative algebras B\subset A over a field and an A-bimodule X, we obtain a Jacobi-Zariski long nearly exact sequence relating the Hochschild homologies of A and B, and the relative Hochschild homology, all of them with coefficients in X. This long sequence is exact twice in three. There is a spectral sequence which converges to the gap of exactness, which terms at page 1 are \Tor_{B^e}^{p+q}(X, (A/B)^{\otimes_B^p}) for p,q>0.
