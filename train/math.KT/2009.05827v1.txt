In this work we study the E_{\infty}-ring \text{THH}(\mathbb{F}_p) from various perspectives. Following an identification at the level of E_2-algebras of \text{THH}(\mathbb{F}_p) with \mathbb{F}_p[\Omega S^3], the group ring of the E_1-group \Omega S^3 over \mathbb{F}_p, we use trace methods to compute its algebraic K-theory. We also show that as an E_2 H\mathbb{F}_p-ring, \text{THH}(\mathbb{F}_p) is uniquely determined by its homotopy groups. These results hold in fact for \text{THH}(k), where k is any perfect field of characteristic p. Along the way we expand on some of the methods used by Hesselholt-Madsen and later by Speirs to develop certain tools to study the THH of graded ring spectra and the algebraic K-theory of formal DGAs.
