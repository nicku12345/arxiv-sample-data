We establish a fibre sequence relating the classical Grothendieck-Witt theory of a ring R to the homotopy \mathrm{C}_2-orbits of its K-theory and Ranicki's original (non-periodic) symmetric L-theory. We use this fibre sequence to remove the assumption that 2 is a unit in R from various results about Grothendieck-Witt groups. For instance, we solve the homotopy limit problem for Dedekind rings whose fraction field is a number field, calculate the various flavours of Grothendieck-Witt groups of \mathbb{Z}, show that the Grothendieck-Witt groups of rings of integers in number fields are finitely generated, and that the comparison map from quadratic to symmetric Grothendieck-Witt theory of Noetherian rings of global dimension d is an equivalence in degrees \geq d+3. As an important tool, we establish the hermitian analogue of Quillen's localisation-d\'evissage sequence for Dedekind rings and use it to solve a conjecture of Berrick-Karoubi.
