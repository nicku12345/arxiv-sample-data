We construct elements in K_4 of modular curves using the Goncharov polylogarithmic complex of weight 3, together with results of de Jeu. The construction is uniform in the level and makes use of new modular units obtained as cross-ratios of division values of the Weierstrass \wp function. These units provide explicit triangulations of the Manin 3-term relations in K_2 of modular curves, which in turn give rise to elements in K_4. Based on numerical computation and on recent results of Weijia Wang, we conjecture that these elements are proportional to the Beilinson elements defined using the Eisenstein symbol.
