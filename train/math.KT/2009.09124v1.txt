We provide a geometric model for the classifying space of automorphism groups of Hermitian vector bundles over a ring with involution R such that \frac{1}{2} \in R; this generalizes a result of Schlichting-Tripathi \cite{SchTri}. We then prove a periodicity theorem for Hermitian K-theory and use it to construct an E_\infty motivic ring spectrum \mathbf{KR}^{\mathrm{alg}} representing homotopy Hermitian K-theory. From these results, we show that \mathbf{KR}^{\mathrm{alg}} is stable under base change, and cdh descent for homotopy Hermitian K-theory of rings with involution is a formal consequence.
