Let G be a group acting on a small category \mathcal C over a field k, that is \mathcal C is a G-k-category. We first obtain that \mathcal C is resolvable by a category which is G-k-equivalent to it, on which G acts freely on objects.   This resolvent category enables to show that if the coinvariants and the invariants functors are exact, then the coinvariants and invariants of the Hochschild-Mitchell (co)homology of \mathcal C are isomorphic to the trivial component of the Hochschild-Mitchell (co)ho\-mo\-logy of the skew category \mathcal C[G]. Otherwise the corresponding spectral sequence can be settled.   If the action of G is free on objects, there is a canonical decomposition of the Hochschild-Mitchell (co)homology of the quotient category \mathcal C/G along the conjugacy classes of G. This way we provide a general frame for monomorphisms which have been described previously in low degrees.
