Over a perfect field, we determine the sheaf of \mathbb{A}^1-connected components of a class of threefolds given by the Blow-up of a variety admitting a \mathbb{P}^1-fibration over either an \mathbb{A}^1-rigid or a non-uniruled surface, along a smooth curve. As a consequence, we verify that the sheaf of \mathbb{A}^1-connected components for such varieties is \mathbb{A}^1-invariant.
