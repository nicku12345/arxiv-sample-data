In this note we present a complete computation of the topological K-theory of the reduced C*-algebra of a semidirect product of the form \Gamma=\mathbb{Z}^n\rtimes_\rho\mathbb{Z}/2 with no further assumptions about of the conjugacy action \rho. For this, we use some results for \mathbb{Z}/2-equivariant K-theory proved by Rosenberg and previous results of Davis and Luck when the conjugacy action \rho is free outside the origin.
