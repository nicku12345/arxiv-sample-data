We generalize to higher algebraic K-theory an identity (originally due to Milnor) that relates the Reidemeister torsion of an infinite cyclic cover to its Lefschetz zeta function. Our identity involves a higher torsion invariant, the endomorphism torsion, of a parametrized family of endomorphisms as well as a higher zeta function of such a family. We also exhibit several examples of families of endomorphisms having non-trivial endomorphism torsion.
