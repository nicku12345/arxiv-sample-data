This paper studies averaging algebras, say, associative algebras endowed with averaging operators. We develop a cohomology theory for averaging algebras and justify it by interpreting lower degree cohomology groups as formal deformations and abelian extensions of averaging algebras. We make explicit the L_\infty-algebra structure over the cochain complex defining cohomology groups and introduce the notion of homotopy averaging algebras as Maurer-Cartan elements of this L_\infty-algebra.
