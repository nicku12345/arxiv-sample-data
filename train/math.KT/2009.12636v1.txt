We study the algebraic K-theory and Grothendieck-Witt theory of proto-exact categories of vector bundles over monoid schemes. Our main results are the complete description of the algebraic K-theory space of an integral monoid scheme X in terms of its Picard group \operatorname{Pic}(X) and pointed monoid of regular functions \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) and a description of the Grothendieck-Witt space of X in terms of an additional involution on \operatorname{Pic}(X). We also prove space-level projective bundle formulae in both settings.
