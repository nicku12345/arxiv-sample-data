We introduce the concept of 3-Lie-Rinehart superalgebra and systematically describe a cohomology complex by considering coefficient modules. Furthermore, we study the relationships between a Lie-Rinehart superalgebra and its induced 3-Lie-Rinehart superalgebra. The deformations of 3-Lie-Rinehart superalgebra are considered via the cohomology theory.
