We examine the cyclic homology of the monoidal category of modules over a finite dimensional Hopf algebra, motivated by the need to demonstrate that there is a difference between the recently introduced mixed anti-Yetter-Drinfeld contramodules and the usual stable anti-Yetter-Drinfeld contramodules. Namely, we show that the Sweedler's Hopf algebra provides an example where mixed complexes in the category of stable anti-Yetter-Drinfeld contramodules (classical) are not DG-equivalent to the category of mixed anti-Yetter-Drinfeld contramodules (new).
