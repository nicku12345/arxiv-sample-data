The purpose of this short paper is to investigate relations between various real K-theories. In particular, we show how a real projective bundle theorem implies an unexpected relation between Atiyah's KR-theory and the usual equivariant K-theory of real vector bundles. This relation has been used recently in a new computation of the Witt group of real curves by Schlichting, Weibel and the author. We also interpret Atiyah's theory as a special case of twisted K-theory.
