For a smooth affine algebra R of dimension d \geq 3 over a field k and an invertible alternating matrix \chi of rank 2n, the group Sp(\chi) of invertible matrices of rank 2n over R which are symplectic with respect to \chi acts on the right on the set Um_{2n}(R) of unimodular rows of length 2n over R. In this paper, we prove that Sp(\chi) acts transitively on Um_{2n}(R) if k is algebraically closed, d! \in k^{\times} and 2n \geq d.
