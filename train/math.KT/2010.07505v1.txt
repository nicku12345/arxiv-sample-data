We calculate the Gerstenhaber bracket on Hopf algebra and Hochschild cohomologies of the Taft algebra T_p for any integer p>2 which is a nonquasi-triangular Hopf algebra. We show that the bracket is indeed zero on Hopf algebra cohomology of T_p, as in all known quasi-triangular Hopf algebras. This example is the first known bracket computation for a nonquasi-triangular algebra. Also, we find a general formula for the bracket on Hopf algebra cohomology of any Hopf algebra with bijective antipode on the bar resolution that is reminiscent of Gerstenhaber's original formula for Hochschild cohomology.
