Let K be a mixed characteristic local field whose residue field has cardinality q, and let n be an integer dividing q-1. In the first part of this document we construct a K-theoretic enhancement of the n-th power residue symbol K^\times \times K^\times \rightarrow \mu_n. In the second part we construct central extensions of GL_m(K) by \mu_n and we express the n-th power residue symbol in terms of a symbol defined using the extension obtained for m=1. Our constructions both rely on the study of finite free pointed \mu_n-sets.
