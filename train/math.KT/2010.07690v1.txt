If n \equiv 0,1~mod~4, we prove a sum formula V_{\theta_{0}} (a_{0},a_{R}^{n}) = n \cdot V_{\theta_{0}} (a_{0},a_{R}) for the generalized Vaserstein symbol whenever R is a smooth affine algebra over a perfect field k with char(k) \neq 2 such that -1 \in {k^{\times}}^{2}. This enables us to generalize a result of Fasel-Rao-Swan on transformations of unimodular rows via elementary matrices over normal affine algebras of dimension d \geq 4 over algebraically closed fields of characteristic \neq 2. As a consequence, we prove that any projective module of rank 3 with trivial Chern classes over a smooth affine algebra of dimension 4 over an algebraically closed field k with char(k) \neq 2,3 is cancellative.
