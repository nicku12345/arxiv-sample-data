We do three things in the paper: (1) study the analog of localization sequences (in the sense of algebraic K-theory of stable \infty-categories) for additive \infty-categories, (2) define the notion of square zero extensions for suitable \infty-categories, and (3) use (1) and (2) to extend the Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy theorem for stable \infty-categories which are not monogenically generated (such as the stable \infty-category of Voevodsky's motives or the stable \infty-category of perfect complexes on some algebraic stacks). The key input in our paper is Bondarko's notion of weight structures which provides a "ring-with-many-objects" analog of a connnective \mathbb{E}_1-ring spectrum.
