We prove an analogue of a theorem of Varshavsky in the motivic stable homotopy category, which states that for a contracting correspondence, the local terms of the Verdier pairing agree with the naive local terms. We also show that some \mathbb{A}^1-enumerative invariants, such as the local \mathbb{A}^1-Brouwer degree and the Euler class with support, can be interpreted as local terms.
