We explain how to reconstruct the category of Artin-Tate \mathbb{R}-motivic spectra as a deformation of the purely topological C_2-equivariant stable category. The special fiber of this deformation is algebraic, and equivalent to an appropriate category of C_2-equivariant sheaves on the moduli stack of formal groups. As such, our results directly generalize the cofiber of \tau philosophy that has revolutionized classical stable homotopy theory.   A key observation is that the Artin-Tate subcategory of \mathbb{R}-motivic spectra is easier to understand than the previously studied cellular subcategory. In particular, the Artin-Tate category contains a variant of the \tau map, which is a feature conspicuously absent from the cellular category.
