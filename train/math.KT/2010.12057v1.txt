We review the theory of derivators from the ground up, defining new classes of derivators which were originally motivated by derivator K-theory. We prove that many old arguments that relied on homotopical bicompleteness hold also for one-sided half derivators on arbitrary diagram categories. We end by defining the maximal domain for a K-theory of derivators generalising Waldhausen K-theory.
