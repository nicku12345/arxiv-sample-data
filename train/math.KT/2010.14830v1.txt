We introduce and study the notion of an orthogonal sum of a (possibly infinite) family of objects in a C^{*}-category. Furthermore, we construct reduced crossed products of C^{*}-categories with groups. We axiomatize the basic properties of the K-theory for C^{*}-categories in the notion of a homological functor. We then study various rigidity properties of homological functors in general, and special additional features of the K-theory of C^{*}-categories. As an application we construct and study interesting functors on the orbit category of a group from C^{*}-categorical data.
