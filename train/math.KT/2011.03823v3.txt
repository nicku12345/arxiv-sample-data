In this work, we introduce {\em topological representations of a quiver} as a system consisting of topological spaces and its relationships determined by the quiver. Such a setting gives a natural connection between topological representations of a quiver and diagrams of topological spaces.   First, we investigate the relation between the category of topological representations and that of linear representations of a quiver via P(\Gamma)-\mathcal{TOP}^o and k\Gamma-Mod, concerning (positively) graded or vertex (positively) graded modules. Second, we discuss the homological theory of topological representations of quivers via \Gamma-limit Lim^{\Gamma} and using it, define the homology groups of topological representations of quivers via H_n. It is found that some properties of a quiver can be read from homology groups. Third, we investigate the homotopy theory of topological representations of quivers. We define the homotopy equivalence between two morphisms in \textbf{Top}\mathrm{-}\textbf{Rep}\Gamma and show that the parallel Homotopy Axiom also holds for top-representations based on the homotopy equivalence.   Last, we mainly obtain the functor At^{\Gamma} from \textbf{Top}\mathrm{-}\textbf{Rep}\Gamma to \textbf{Top} and show that At^{\Gamma} preserves homotopy equivalence between morphisms. The relationship is established between the homotopy groups of a top-representation (T,f) and the homotopy groups of At^{\Gamma}(T,f).
