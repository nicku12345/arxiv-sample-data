We prove the Parshin's conjecture on the rational triviality of the higher algebraic K-theory of smooth projective varieties over finite fields. This is known to imply the Beilinson-Soul\'e conjecture for the fields of positive characteristic. Especially it implies that for a field F of char p and n>0, the only rationally non-trivial weight appearing in K_n(F)\otimes \mathbb{Q} can be n, thus K_n(F)\otimes \mathbb{Q}=K_n^M(F)\otimes \mathbb{Q} where K_n^M(F) is the Milnor K-theory.
