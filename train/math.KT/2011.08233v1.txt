We prove some K-theoretic descent results for finite group actions on stable \infty-categories, including the p-group case of the Galois descent conjecture of Ausoni-Rognes. We also prove vanishing results in accordance with Ausoni-Rognes's redshift philosophy: in particular, we show that if R is an \mathbb{E}_\infty-ring spectrum with L_{T(n)}R=0, then L_{T(n+1)}K(R)=0. Our key observation is that descent and vanishing are logically interrelated, permitting to establish them simultaneously by induction on the height.
