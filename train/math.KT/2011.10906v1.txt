We introduce controlled KK-theory groups associated to a pair of C^*-algebras. Our main results show that these groups are related to classical KK-theory by a Milnor exact sequence, in such a way that R{\o}rdam's KL-group is identified with an inverse limit of our controlled KK-groups.   In the case that the C^*-algebras involved satisfy the UCT, our Milnor exact sequence identifies with the Milnor sequence associated to a KK-filtration in the sense of Schochet, although our results are independent of the UCT. Applications to the UCT will be pursued in subsequent work.
