We provide descriptions of the Whitehead groups, and the algebraic K-theory groups, of the fundamental group of a connected, oriented, closed 3-manifold in terms of Whitehead groups of their finite subgroups and certain Nil-groups. The main tools we use are: the K-theoretic Farrell-Jones isomorphism conjecture, the construction of models for the universal space for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups in 3-manifold groups, and both the prime and JSJ-decompositions together with the well-known geometrization theorem.
