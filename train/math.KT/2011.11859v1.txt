We construct and study a triangulated category of motives with modulus \mathbf{MDM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}} over a field k that extends Voevodsky's category \mathbf{DM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}} in such a way as to encompass non-homotopy invariant phenomena. In a similar way as \mathbf{DM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}} is constructed out of smooth k-varieties, \mathbf{MDM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}} is constructed out of proper modulus pairs, introduced in Part I of this work. To such a modulus pair we associate its motive in \mathbf{MDM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}}. In some cases the \mathrm{Hom} group in \mathbf{MDM}_{\mathrm{gm}}^{\mathrm{eff}} between the motives of two modulus pairs can be described in terms of Bloch's higher Chow groups.
