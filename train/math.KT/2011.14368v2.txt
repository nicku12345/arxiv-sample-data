Based on Morse theory for the energy functional on path spaces we develop a deformation theory for mapping spaces of spheres into orthogonal groups. This is used to show that these mapping spaces are weakly homotopy equivalent, in a stable range, to mapping spaces associated to orthogonal Clifford representations. Given an oriented Euclidean bundle V \to X of rank divisible by four over a finite complex X we derive a stable decomposition result for vector bundles over the sphere bundle \mathord{\mathbb S}( \mathbb{R} \oplus V) in terms of vector bundles and Clifford module bundles over X. After passing to topological K-theory these results imply classical Bott-Thom isomorphism theorems.
