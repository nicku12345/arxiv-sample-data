We consider tilings of the plane with 12-fold symmetry obtained by the cut and projection method. We compute their cohomology groups using the techniques introduced by the second author, Hunton and Kellendonk. To do this we completely describe the window, the orbits of lines under the group action and the orbits of 0-singularities. The complete family of generalized 12-fold tilings can be described using 2-parameters and it presents a surprisingly rich cohomological structure. To put this finding into perspective, one should compare our results with the cohomology of the generalized 5-fold tilings (more commonly known as generalized Penrose tilings). In this case the tilings form a 1-parameter family, which fits in simply one of two types of cohomology.
