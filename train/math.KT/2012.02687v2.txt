We define the Chow t-structure on the \infty-category of motivic spectra SH(k) over an arbitrary base field k. We identify the heart of this t-structure SH(k)^{c\heartsuit} when the exponential characteristic of k is inverted. Restricting to the cellular subcategory, we identify the Chow heart SH(k)^{cell, c\heartsuit} as the category of even graded MU_{2*}MU-comodules. Furthermore, we show that the \infty-category of modules over the Chow truncated sphere spectrum is algebraic.   Our results generalize the ones in Gheorghe--Wang--Xu in three aspects: To integral results; To all base fields other than just C; To the entire \infty-category of motivic spectra SH(k), rather than a subcategory containing only certain cellular objects.   We also discuss a strategy for computing motivic stable homotopy groups of (p-completed) spheres over an arbitrary base field k using the Postnikov tower associated to the Chow t-structure and the motivic Adams spectral sequences over k.
