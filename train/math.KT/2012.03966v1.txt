Following the Nikolaus-Scholze approach to THH, we extend the definition of topological coHochschild homology (coTHH) of Hess-Shipley to \infty-categories. After this, we prove that coTHH of what we call quasi-proper coalgebras can be obtained from THH via Spanier-Whitehead dual. Using our duality results, we construct new examples of coalgebras and do various coTHH computations. Our main computational result is the coHochschild homology of the Steenrod algebra spectrum.
