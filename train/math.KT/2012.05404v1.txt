In a paper in 1962, Golod proved that the Betti sequence of the residue field of a local ring attains an upper bound given by Serre if and only if the homology algebra of the Koszul complex of the ring has trivial multiplications and trivial Massey operations. This is the origin of the notion of Golod ring. Using the Koszul complex components he also constructed a minimal free resolution of the residue field. In this article, we extend this construction up to degree five for any local ring. We describe how the multiplicative structure and the triple Massey products of the homology of the Koszul algebra are involved in this construction. As a consequence, we provide explicit formulas for the first six terms of a sequence that measures how far the ring is from being Golod.
