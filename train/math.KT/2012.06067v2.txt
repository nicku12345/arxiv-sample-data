In this paper, we first provide an explicit procedure to glue complete hereditary cotorsion pairs along the recollement (\mathcal{A},\mathcal{C},\mathcal{B}) of abelian categories with enough projective and injective objects. As a consequence, we investigate how to establish recollements of triangulated categories from recollements of abelian categories by using the theory of exact model structures. Finally, we give applications to contraderived categories, projective stable derived categories and stable categories of Gorenstein injective modules over an upper triangular matrix ring.
