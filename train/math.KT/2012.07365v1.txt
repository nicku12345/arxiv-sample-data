We extend the Garkusha-Panin and Voevodsky strict \mathbb{A}^{1}-invariance theorems in motivic homotopy theory to one-dimensional base schemes with perfect residue fields. In the proof, we utilize the trivial fiber topology and localization for motivic homotopy categories relative to closed immersions. This approach allows us to reduce strict \mathbb{A}^{1}-invariance to the case of fields. Furthermore, we compare motivic and Nisnevich local fibrant replacement functors and study \mathbb{G}_{m}-loops.
