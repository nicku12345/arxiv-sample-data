Let p\in \mathbb Z be an odd prime. We show that the fiber sequence for the cyclotomic trace of the sphere spectrum \mathbb S admits an "eigensplitting" that generalizes known splittings on K-theory and TC. We identify the summands in the fiber as the covers of \mathbb Z^{\wedge}_{p}-Anderson duals of summands in the K(1)-localized algebraic K-theory of \mathbb Z. Analogous results hold for the ring \mathbb Z where we prove that the K(1)-localized fiber sequence is self-dual for \mathbb Z^{\wedge}_{p}-Anderson duality, with the duality permuting the summands by i\mapsto 1-i (indexed mod p-1). We explain an intrinsic characterization of the summand we call Z in the splitting TC(\mathbb Z)^{\wedge}_{p}\simeq j \vee \Sigma j'\vee Z in terms of units in the p-cyclotomic tower of \mathbb Q^{\wedge}_{p}.
