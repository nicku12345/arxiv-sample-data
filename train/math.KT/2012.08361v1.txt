The goal of this paper is to extend the work of Voevodsky and Morel on the homotopy t-structure on the category of motivic complexes to the context of motives for logarithmic schemes. To do so, we prove an analogue of Morel's connectivity theorem and show a purity statement for (\mathbf{P}^1, \infty)-local complexes of sheaves with log transfers.   The homotopy t-structure on \mathbf{logDM}^{\textrm{eff}}(k) is proved to be compatible with Voevodsky's t-structure i.e. we show that the comparison functor R^{\overline{\square}}\omega^*\colon \mathbf{DM}^{\textrm{eff}}(k)\to \mathbf{logDM}^{\textrm{eff}}(k) is t-exact.   The heart of the homotopy t-structure on \mathbf{logDM}^{\textrm{eff}}(k) is the Grothendieck abelian category of strictly cube-invariant sheaves with log transfers: we use it to build a new version of the category of reciprocity sheaves in the style of Kahn--Saito--Yamazaki and R\"ulling.
