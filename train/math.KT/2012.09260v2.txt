Let \ell be a commutative ring with involution * containing an element \lambda such that \lambda+\lambda^*=1 and let \operatorname{Alg}^*_\ell be the category of \ell-algebras equipped with a semilinear involution and involution preserving homomorphisms. We construct a triangulated category kk^h and a functor j^h:\operatorname{Alg}^*_\ell\to kk^h that is homotopy invariant, matricially and hermitian stable and excisive and is universal initial with these properties. We prove that a version of Karoubi's fundamental theorem holds in kk^h. By the universal property of the latter, this implies that any functor H:\operatorname{Alg}^*_\ell\to\mathfrak{T} with values in a triangulated category which is homotopy invariant, matricially and hermitian stable and excisive satisfies the fundamental theorem. We also prove a bivariant version of Karoubi's 12-term exact sequence.
