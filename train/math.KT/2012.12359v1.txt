For any countable discrete group \Gamma (without any further assumptions on it) we construct an explicit morphism from the topological model of the Left-Hand side of the Baum-Connes assembly map, K^*_{top}(\Gamma), to the cyclic periodic homology of the group algebra, HP_*(\mathbb{C}\Gamma). This morphism, called the Chern assembly map, allows in particular to give a proper and explicit formulation for a Chern-Connes pairing \begin{equation}\nonumber K^*_{top}(\Gamma)\times HP^*(\mathbb{C}\Gamma)\longrightarrow \mathbb{C}, \end{equation} for any countable discrete group \Gamma. Several theorems are needed to get to the above mentioned Chern assemby map. In particular we establish a delocalised Riemann-Roch theorem, the wrong way functoriality for periodic delocalised cohomology for \Gamma-proper actions, the construction of a Chern morphism between the Left-Hand side of Baum-Connes and a delocalised cohomology group associated to \Gamma which is an isomorphism once tensoring with \mathbb{C}, and the construction of an explicit cohomological assembly map between the delocalised cohomology group associated to \Gamma and the cyclic periodic homology of the group algebra.
