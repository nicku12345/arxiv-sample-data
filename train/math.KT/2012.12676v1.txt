We develop the foundations of G-global homotopy theory as a synthesis of classical equivariant homotopy theory on the one hand and global homotopy theory in the sense of Schwede on the other hand. Using this framework, we are able to construct the G-global algebraic K-theory of symmetric monoidal categories with G-action, unifying equivariant algebraic K-theory, as originally introduced by Shimakawa, and Schwede's global algebraic K-theory.   As an application of the theory, we prove that the G-global algebraic K-theory functor exhibits the symmetric monoidal categories with G-action as a model of connective G-global stable homotopy theory, generalizing and strengthening a classical theorem of Thomason. This in particular allows us to deduce the corresponding statements for global and equivariant algebraic K-theory.
