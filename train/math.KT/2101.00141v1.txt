In the present paper we continue our investigation of hypersurface support for integrable Hopf algebras. We use hypersurface support to classify thick (two-sided) ideals in the stable categories of representations for bosonized quantum complete intersections, quantum Borels in type A, Drinfeld doubles of height 1 Borels in finite characteristic, and rings of functions on finite group schemes over a perfect field. We then identify the prime ideal spectra for these stable categories. In the curious case of functions on a finite group scheme G, the spectrum of the category is identified not with the spectrum of cohomology, but with the quotient of the spectrum of cohomology by the adjoint action of the subgroup of connected components \pi_0(G) in G.
