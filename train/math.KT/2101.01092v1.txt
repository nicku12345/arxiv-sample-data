We study the mod p^r Milnor K-groups of p-adically complete and p-henselian rings, establishing in particular a Nesterenko-Suslin style description in terms of the Milnor range of syntomic cohomology. In the case of smooth schemes over complete discrete valuation rings we prove the mod p^r Gersten conjecture for Milnor K-theory locally in the Nisnevich topology. In characteristic p we show that the Bloch-Kato-Gabber theorem remains true for valuation rings, and for regular formal schemes in a pro sense.
