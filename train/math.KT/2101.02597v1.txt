Let B\subset A be a bounded extension of finite dimensional algebras. We use the Jacobi-Zariski long nearly exact sequence to show that B satisfies Han's conjecture if and only if A does, regardless if the extension splits or not. We provide conditions ensuring that an extension by arrows and relations is bounded. Examples of non split bounded extensions are given and we obtain a structure result for the extensions of an algebra given by a quiver and admissible relations.
