We apply the coverings in the motivic Milnor fibre construction of Denef and Loeser to compute the motivic Euler characteristic of Ayoub's nearby cycles, for a scheme over a discrete valuation ring of characteristic zero whose special fibre has isolated quasi-homogeneous singularities resolved by a blow-up. This allows to compare the local picture at the singularities with the global conductor formula for hypersurfaces developed by Levine, Pepin Lehalleur and Srinivas, revealing that the formula is local in nature, thus extending it to the more general setting considered in this paper.
