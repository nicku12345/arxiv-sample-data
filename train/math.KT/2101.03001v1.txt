Let X be a smooth projective quadric defined over a field of characteristic 2. We prove that in the Chow group of codimension 2 or 3 of X the torsion subgroup has at most two elements. In codimension 2, we determine precisely when this torsion subgroup is nontrivial. In codimension 3, we show that there is no torsion if {\dim X\ge 11.} This extends the analogous results in characteristic different from 2, obtained by Karpenko in the nineteen-nineties.
