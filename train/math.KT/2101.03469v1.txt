How does one measure the failure of Hochschild homology to commute with colimits?   Here I relate this question to a major open problem about dynamics in contact manifolds -- the assertion that Reeb orbits exist and are detected by symplectic homology. More precisely, I show that for polarizably Weinstein fillable contact manifolds, said property is equivalent to the failure of Hochschild homology to commute with certain colimits of representation categories of tree quivers.   So as to be intelligible to algebraists, I try to include or black-box as much of the geometric background as possible.
