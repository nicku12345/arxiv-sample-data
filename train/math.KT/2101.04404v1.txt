We prove that the derived categories of abelian categories have unique enhancements -- all of them, the unbounded, bounded, bounded above and bounded below derived categories. The unseparated and left completed derived categories of a Grothendieck abelian category are also shown to have unique enhancements. Finally we show that the derived category of complexes with quasi-coherent cohomology and the category of perfect complexes have unique enhancements for quasi-compact and quasi-separated schemes.
