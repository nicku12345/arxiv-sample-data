In this article we provide a framework for the study of Hecke operators acting on the Bredon (co)homology of an arithmetic discrete group. Our main interest lies in the study of Hecke operators for Bianchi groups. Using the Baum-Connes conjecture, we can transfer computations in Bredon homology to obtain a Hecke action on the K-theory of the reduced C^{*}-algebra of the group. We show the power of this method giving explicit computations for the group SL_2(\mathbb{Z}[i]). In order to carry out these computations we use an Atiyah-Segal type spectral sequence together with the Bredon homology of the classifying space for proper actions.
