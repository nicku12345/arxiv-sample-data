In a companion paper [ABS1] we introduced the stable \infty-category of noncommutative CW-spectra, which we denoted \mathtt{NSp}. Let \mathcal{M} denote the full spectrally enriched subcategory of \mathtt{NSp} whose objects are the non-commutative suspension spectra of matrix algebras. In [ABS1] we proved that \mathtt{NSp} is equivalent to the \infty-category of spectral presheaves on \mathcal{M}. In this paper we investigate the structure of \mathcal{M}, and derive some consequences regarding the structure of \mathtt{NSp}.   To begin with, we introduce a rank filtration of \mathcal{M}. We show that the mapping spectra of \mathcal{M} map naturally to the connective K-theory spectrum ku, and that the rank filtration of \mathcal{M} is a lift of the classical rank filtration of ku. We describe the subquotients of the rank filtration in terms of complexes of direct-sum decompositions which also arose in the study of K-theory and of Weiss's orthogonal calculus. We prove that the rank filtration stabilizes rationally after the first stage. Using this we give an explicit model of the rationalization of \mathtt{NSp} as presheaves of rational spectra on the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and unitary transformations up to scaling. Our results also have consequences for the p-localization and the chromatic localization of \mathcal{M}.
