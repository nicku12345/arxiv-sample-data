We develop a notion of formal groups in the filtered setting and describe a duality relating these to a specified class of filtered Hopf algebras. We then study a deformation to the normal cone construction in the setting of derived algebraic geometry. Applied to the unit section of a formal group \widehat{\mathbb{G}}, this provides a \mathbb{G}_m-equivariant degeneration of \widehat{\mathbb{G}} to its tangent Lie algebra. We prove a unicity result on complete filtrations, which, in particular, identifies the resulting filtration on the coordinate algebra of this deformation with the adic filtration on the coordinate algebra of \widehat{\mathbb{G}}. We use this in a special case, together with the aforementioned notion of Cartier duality, to recover the filtration on the filtered circle of [MRT19]. Finally, we investigate some properties of \widehat{\mathbb{G}}-Hochschild homology set out in loc. cit., and describe "lifts" of these invariants to the setting of spectral algebraic geometry.
