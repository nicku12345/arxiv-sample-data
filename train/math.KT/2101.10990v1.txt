Enumerative geometry studies the intersection theory of virtual fundamental classes in the homology of moduli spaces. These usually depend on auxiliary parameters and are then related by wall-crossing formulas.   We construct a homological graded Lie bracket on the homology of moduli spaces which can be used to express universal wall-crossing formulas. For this we develop a new topological theory of pushforward operations for principal bundles with orientations in twisted K-theory. We prove that all rational pushforward operations are obtained from a single new projective Euler operation, which also has applications to Chern classes in twisted K-theory.
