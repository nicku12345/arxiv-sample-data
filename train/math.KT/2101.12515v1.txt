We present a definition of twisted motivic Chern classes for singulars pairs (X,\Delta) consisting of a singular space X and a \mathbb Q-Cartier divisor containing the singularities of X. The definition is a mixture of the construction of motivic Chern classes previously defined by Brasselet-Schurmann-Yokura with the construction of multiplier ideals. The twisted motivic Chern classes are the limits of the the elliptic classes defined by Borisov-Libgober. We show that with a suitable choice of the divisor \Delta the twisted motivic Chern classes satisfy the axioms of the stable envelopes in K-theory. Our construction is an extension of the results proven by the first author for the fundamental slope.
