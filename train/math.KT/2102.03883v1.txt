In an unpublished work of Fasel-Rao-Swan the notion of the relative Witt group W_E(R,I) is defined. In this article we will give the details of this construction. Then we studied the injectivity of the relative Vaserstein symbol V_{R,I}: Um_3(R,I)/E_3(R,I)\rightarrow W_E(R,I). We established injectivity of this symbol if R is an affine non-singular algebra of dimension 3 over a perfect C_1-field and I is a local complete intersection ideal of R. It is believed that for a 3-dimensional affine algebra non-singularity is not necessary for establishing injectivity of the Vaserstein symbol . At the end of the article we will give an example of a singular 3-dimensional algebra over a perfect C_1-field for which the Vaserstein symbol is injective.
