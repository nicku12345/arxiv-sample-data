We show that \mathbb A^1-connectedness of a large class of varieties over a field k can be characterized as the condition that their generic point can be connected to a k-rational point using (not necessarily naive) \mathbb A^1-homotopies. We also show that symmetric powers of \mathbb A^1-connected varieties (over an arbitrary field), as well as smooth proper models of them (over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0), are \mathbb A^1-connected. As an application of these results, we show that norm varieties constructed by Rost over a field k of characteristic 0 are \mathbb A^1-connected, after passing to the algebraic closure of k.
