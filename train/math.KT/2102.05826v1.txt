This paper focuses on a question raised by Holm and J{\o}rgensen, who asked if the induced cotorsion pairs (\Phi({\sf X}),\Phi({\sf X})^{\perp}) and (^{\perp}\Psi({\sf Y}),\Psi({\sf Y})) in \mathrm{Rep}{Q}{\sf{A}}--the category of all \sf{A}-valued representations of a quiver Q--are complete whenever (\sf X,\sf Y) is a complete cotorsion pair in an abelian category \sf{A} satisfying some mild conditions. Recently, Odaba\c{s}{\i} gave an affirmative answer if the quiver Q is rooted and the cotorsion pair (\sf X,\sf Y) is further hereditary. In this paper, we significantly improve Odaba\c{s}{\i}'s work by establishing the same result in the much more general framework of functor categories, and at the same time removing the hereditary assumption on the cotorsion pair.
