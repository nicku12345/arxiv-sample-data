Let (A,\sigma) be an Azumaya algebra with involution over a regular ring R. We prove that the Gersten-Witt complex of (A,\sigma) defined by Gille is isomorphic to the Gersten-Witt complex of (A,\sigma) defined by Bayer-Fluckiger, Parimala and the author. Advantages of both constructions are used to show that the Gersten-Witt complex is exact when \dim R\leq 3, \mathrm{ind}\, A\leq 2 and \sigma is orthogonal or symplectic. This means that the Grothendieck-Serre conjecture holds for the group R-scheme of \sigma-unitary elements in A under the same hypotheses; R is not required to contain a field.
