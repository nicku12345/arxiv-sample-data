Let B be a commutative algebra and A be a B-algebra (determined by an algebra homomorphism \varepsilon:B\rightarrow A). M. D. Staic introduced a Hochschild like cohomology H^{\bullet}((A,B,\varepsilon);A) called secondary Hochschild cohomology, to describe the non-trivial B-algebra deformations of A. J. Laubacher et al later obtained a natural construction of a new chain (and cochain) complex \overline{C}_{\bullet}(A,B,\varepsilon) (resp. \overline{C}^{\bullet}(A,B,\varepsilon)) in the process of introducing the secondary cyclic (co)homology. It turns out that unlike the classical case of associative algebras (over a field), there exist different (co)chain complexes for the B-algebra A. In this paper, we establish a connection between the two (co)homology theories for B-algebra A. We show that the pair \big(H^{\bullet}((A,B,\varepsilon);A),HH_{\bullet}(A,B,\varepsilon)\big) forms a non-commutative differential calculus, where HH_{\bullet}(A,B,\varepsilon) denotes the homology of the complex \overline{C}_{\bullet}(A,B,\varepsilon).
