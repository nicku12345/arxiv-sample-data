For an action of a finite cyclic group F on an n-dimensional noncommutative torus A_\theta, we give sufficient conditions when the fundamental projective modules over A_\theta, which determine the range of the canonical trace on A_\theta, extend to projective modules over the crossed product C*-algebra A_\theta \rtimes F. Our results allow us to understand the range of the canonical trace on A_\theta \rtimes F, and determine it completely for several examples including the crossed products of 2-dimensional noncommutative tori with finite cyclic groups and the flip action of \mathbb{Z}_2 on any n-dimensional noncommutative torus. As an application, for the flip action of \mathbb{Z}_2 on a simple n-dimensional torus A_\theta, we determine the Morita equivalence class of A_\theta \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2, in terms of the Morita equivalence class of A_\theta.
