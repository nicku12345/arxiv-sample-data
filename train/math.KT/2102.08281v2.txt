We prove that TR is corepresentable by the reduced topological Hochschild homology of the flat affine line \mathbf{S}[t] as a functor defined on the \infty-category of cyclotomic spectra taking values in the \infty-category of cyclotomic spectra with Frobenius lifts, refining a result of Blumberg-Mandell. To that end, we define the notion of an integral topological Cartier module using Barwick's formalism of Mackey functors on orbital \infty-categories, extending the work of Antieau-Nikolaus in the p-typical case. As an application, we show that TR evaluated on a connective \mathbf{E}_1-ring admits a description in terms of the spectrum of curves on algebraic K-theory generalizing the work of Hesselholt and Betley-Schlichtkrull.
