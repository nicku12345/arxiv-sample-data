For a countable group G we construct a small, idempotent complete, symmetric monoidal, stable \infty-category \mathrm{KK}^{G}_{\mathrm{sep}} whose homotopy category recovers the triangulated equivariant Kasparov category of separable G-C^*-algebras, and exhibit its universal property. Likewise, we consider an associated presentably symmetric monoidal, stable \infty-category \mathrm{KK}^{G} which receives a symmetric monoidal functor \mathrm{kk}^{G} from possibly non-separable G-C^*-algebras and discuss its universal property. In addition to the symmetric monoidal structures, we construct various change-of-group functors relating these KK-categories for varying G. We use this to define and establish key properties of a (spectrum valued) equivariant, locally finite K-homology theory on proper and locally compact G-topological spaces, allowing for coefficients in arbitrary G-C^*-algebras. Finally, we extend the functor \mathrm{kk}^{G} from G-C^*-algebras to G-C^*-categories. These constructions are key in a companion paper about a form of equivariant Paschke duality and assembly maps.
