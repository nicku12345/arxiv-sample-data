It is well-known that spin structures and Dirac operators play a crucial role in the study of positive scalar curvature metrics (psc-metrics) on compact manifolds. Here we consider a class of non-spin manifolds with "almost spin" structure, namely those with spin^c or pin^\pm-structures. It turns out that in those cases (under natural assumptions on such a manifold M), the index of a relevant Dirac operator completely controls existence of a psc-metric which is S^1- or C_2-invariant near a "special submanifold" B of M. This submanifold B\subset M is dual to the complex (respectively, real) line bundle L which determines the spin^c or pin^\pm structure on M. We also show that these manifold pairs (M,B) can be interpreted as "manifolds with fibered singularities" equipped with "well-adapted psc-metrics". This survey is based on our recent work as well as on our joint work with Paolo Piazza.
