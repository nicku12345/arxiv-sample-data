For a proper map f:X\to S between varieties over \mathbb{C} with X smooth, we introduce increasing filtrations \textbf{P}^{\leq \cdot}_f\subset P^{\leq \cdot}_f on \text{gr}^\cdot K_\cdot(X), the associated graded on K-theory with respect to the codimension filtration, both sent by the cycle map to the perverse filtration on cohomology {}^pH^{\leq \cdot}_f(X). The filtrations P^{\leq \cdot}_f and \textbf{P}^{\leq \cdot}_f are functorial with respect to proper pushforward; P^{\leq \cdot}_f is functorial with respect to pullback.   We use the above filtrations to propose two definitions of (graded) intersection K-theory \text{gr}^\cdot IK_\cdot(S) and \text{gr}^\cdot \textbf{I}K_\cdot(S). Both have cycle maps to intersection cohomology IH^{\cdot}(S). We conjecture a version of the decomposition theorem for semismall surjective maps and prove it in some particular cases.
