Let \Gamma be a discrete group of finite virtual cohomological dimension with certain finiteness conditions of the type satisfied by arithmetic groups. We define a representation ring for \Gamma, determined on its elements of finite order, which is of finite type. Then we determine the contribution of this ring to the topological K-theory K^*(B\Gamma), obtaining an exact formula for the difference in terms of the cohomology of the centralizers of elements of finite order in \Gamma.
