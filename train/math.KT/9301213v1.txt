In this paper, we discuss the following conjecture raised by Baum-Douglas: For any first-order elliptic differential operator D on smooth manifold M with boundary \p M, D possesses an elliptic boundary condition if and only if \partial [D] = 0 in K_1(\partial M), where [D] is the relative K-cycle in K_0(M, \partial M) corresponding to D. We prove the ``if'' part of this conjecture for \dim(M) \not= 4, 5, 6, 7 and the ``only if'' part of the conjecture for arbitrary dimension.
