We define an unreduced version of the e-controlled lower K-theoretic groups of Ranicki and Yamasaki, and Quinn. We show that the reduced versions of our groups coincide (in the inverse limit and its first derived, \lim^1) with those of Ranicki and Yamasaki. We also relate the controlled groups to the continuously controlled groups of Anderson and Munkholm, and to the Quinn homology groups of Quinn.
