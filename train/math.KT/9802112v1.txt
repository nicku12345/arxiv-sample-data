For a projective morphism of an smooth algebraic surface X onto a smooth algebraic curve S, both given over a perfect field k, we construct the direct image morphism in two cases: from H^i(X,\Omega^2_X) to H^{i-1}(S,\Omega^1_S) and when char k =0 from H^i(X,K_2(X)) to H^{i-1}(S,K_1(S)). (If i=2, then the last map is the Gysin map from CH^2(X) to CH^1(S).)   To do this in the first case we use the known adelic resolution for sheafs \Omega^2_X and \Omega^1_S. In the second case we construct a K_2-adelic resolution of a sheaf K_2(X). And thus we reduce the direct image morphism to the construction of some residues and symbols from differentials and symbols of 2-dimensional local fields associated with pairs x \in C (x is a closed point on an irredicuble curve C \in X) to 1-dimensional local fields associated with closed points on the curve S.   We prove reciprocity laws for these maps.
