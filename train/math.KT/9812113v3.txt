REVISED VERSION: We have re-organized the paper, and included some new results. Most important, we prove that the (truncated) Weil complexes compute the cyclic cohomology of the Hopf algebra (see the new Theorem 7.3). We also include a short discussion on the uni-modulare case, and the computation for H= U_q(sl_2).   THE OLD ABSTRACT: We give a construction of Connes-Moscovici's cyclic cohomology for any Hopf algebra equipped with a twisted antipode. Furthermore, we introduce a non-commutative Weil complex, which connects the work of Gelfand and Smirnov with cyclic cohomology. We show how the Weil complex arises naturally when looking at Hopf algebra actions and invariant higher traces, to give a non-commutative version of the usual Chern-Weil theory.
