In the present paper we investigate the question about the injectivity of the map F(R) --> F(K) induced by the canonical inclusion of a local regular ring of geometric type R to its field of fractions K for a homotopy invariant functor F with transfers satisfying some additional properties. As an application we get the original proof of Special Unitary Case of Grothendieck's conjecture about principal homogeneous spaces and some other interesting examples.
