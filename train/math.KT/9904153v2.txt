The various descent and duality relations among BPS and non-BPS D-branes are classified using topological K-theory. It is shown how the descent procedures for producing type-II D-branes from brane-antibrane bound states by tachyon condensation and \klein projections arise as natural homomorphisms of K-groups generating the brane charges. The transformations are generalized to type-I theories and type-II orientifolds, from which the complete set of vacuum manifolds and field contents for tachyon condensation is deduced. A new set of internal descent relations is found which describes branes over orientifold planes as topological defects in the worldvolumes of brane-antibrane pairs on top of planes of higher dimension. The periodicity properties of these relations are shown to be a consequence of the fact that all fundamental bound state constructions and hence the complete spectrum of brane charges are associated with the topological solitons which classify the four Hopf fibrations.
