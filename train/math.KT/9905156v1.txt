Let \widetilde{JO}(X)=\widetilde{KO}(X)/TO(X) be the J-group of a connected finite CW complex X. We Obtain two computable formulas of TO(X)_{(p)}, the localization of TO(X) at a prime p. Then we show how to use these two formulas of TO(X)_{(p)} to find the J-orders of elements of \widetilde{KO}(CP^m), at least the 2 and 3 primary factors of the canonical generators of \widetilde{JO}(CP^m). Here CP^m is the complex projective space.
