Given a finite group G and a G-space X, we show that a direct sum F_G (X) = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0}K_{G_n} (X^n) \bigotimes \C admits a natural graded Hopf algebra and \lambda-ring structure, where G_n denotes the wreath product G \sim S_n. F_G (X) is shown to be isomorphic to a certain supersymmetric product in terms of K_G(X)\bigotimes \C as a graded algebra. We further prove that F_G (X) is isomorphic to the Fock space of an infinite dimensional Heisenberg (super)algebra. As one of several applications, we compute the orbifold Euler characteristic e(X^n, G_n).
