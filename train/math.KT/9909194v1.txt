In recent years, there has been considerable success in computing Ext-groups of modular representations associated to the general linear group by relating this problem to one of computing Ext-groups in functor categories. In this paper, we extend our ability to make such Ext-group calculations by establishing several fundamental results. Throughout this paper, we work over fields of positive characteristic p.
