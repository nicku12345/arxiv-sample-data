The authors establish a connection between the Quillen K-theory of certain local fields and the de Rham-Witt complex of their rings of integers with logarithmic poles at the maximal ideal. They consider fields K that are complete discrete valuation fields of characteristic zero with perfect residue fields k of characteristic p > 2. They evaluate the K-theory with Z/p^v-coefficients of K, and verify the Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjecture for K.
