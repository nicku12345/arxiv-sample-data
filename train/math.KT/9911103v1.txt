This paper is the continuation of Part I, expanding previous results of math.DG/9803051. This paper uses techniques in noncommutative geometry as developed by Alain Connes in order to study the twisted higher index theory of elliptic operators on orbifold covering spaces of compact good orbifolds, which are invariant under a projective action of the orbifold fundamental group. We also compute the range of the higher cyclic traces on K-theory for cocompact Fuchsian groups, which is then applied to determine the range of values of the Connes-Kubo Hall conductance in the discrete model of the quantum Hall effect on the hyperbolic plane. The new phenomenon that we observe in our case is that the Connes-Kubo Hall conductance has plateaux at integral multiples of a fractional valued topological invariant, namely the orbifold Euler characteristic. The set of possible fractions has been determined, and is compared with recently available experimental data.
