We define extender sequences, generelizing measure sequences from Radin Forcing. Using the extender sequences we combine Gitik-Magidor forcing for adding many Prikry sequences with Radin forcing. This forcing satisfies Prikry like condition, destroys no cardinals, and has a kind of properness. Depending on the large cardinal we start with, this forcing can blow the power of a cardinal together with changing its' cofinality to a prescribe value. If this prescribed value is the cardinal itself then it remains regular and even can remain measurable.
