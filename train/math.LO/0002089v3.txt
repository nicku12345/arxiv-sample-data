We introduce 0^h (0^handgrenade) as a sharp for an inner model with a proper class of strong cardinals. If 0^h does not exist then any normal iteration tree is "almost linear." We exploit this fact to prove the existence of the core model K in the theory "ZFC + 0^h does not exist." (As of today, non-0^h is thereby the weakest anti large cardinal assumption under which K can be shown to exist in ZFC. In this sense we improve earlier work of Dodd, Jensen, Mitchell, and - partially - Steel.) We indicate that our paper provides the last step for determining the exact consistency strength of a statement in the Delfino problem list.
