We present two ways in which the model L({\mathbb R}) is canonical assuming the existence of large cardinals. We show that the theory of this model, with {\em ordinal} parameters, cannot be changed by small forcing; we show further that a set of ordinals in V cannot be added to L({\mathbb R}) by small forcing. The large cardinal needed corresponds to the consistency strength of AD^{L({\mathbb R})}; roughly \omega Woodin cardinals.
