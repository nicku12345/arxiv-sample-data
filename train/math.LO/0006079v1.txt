We formulate the P<NP hypothesis in the case of the satisfiability problem as a \Pi ^0_2 sentence, out of which we can construct a partial recursive function f_{\neg A} so that f_{\neg A} is total if and only if P < NP. We then show that if f_{\neg A} is total, then it isn't {\cal T}--provably total (where {\cal T} is a fragment of ZFC that adequately extends PA and whose consistency is of ordinal order). Follows that the negation of P < NP, that is, P = NP, is consistent with those {\cal T}.
