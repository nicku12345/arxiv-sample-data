It is shown that G-up, the quantified propositional Goedel-Dummett logic based on the truth-values set V-up = {1 - 1/n : n >= 1} u {1}, is decidable. This result is obtained by reduction to Buechi's theory S1S. An alternative proof based on elimination of quantifiers is also given, which yields both an axiomatization and a characterization of G-up as the intersection of all finite-valued quantified propositional Goedel logics.
