Geometrical stability theory is a powerful set of model-theoretic tools that can lead to structural results on models of a simple first-order theory. Typical results offer a characterization of the groups definable in a model of the theory. The work is carried out in a universal domain of the theory (a saturated model) in which the Stone space topology on ultrafilters of definable relations is compact. Here we operate in the more general setting of homogeneous models, which typically have noncompact Stone topologies. In this paper strongly lambda-homogeneous models (M,R) in which the elements of R induce a symmetric and transitive notion of independence with bounded character are studied. This notion of independence, defined using a combinatorial condition called ``dividing'', agrees with forking independence when (M,R) is saturated. The concept central to the development of geometrical stability theory for saturated structures, namely the canonical base, is also shown to exist in this setting.
