The paper is concerned with the existence of a universal graph at the successor of a strong limit singular mu of cofinality aleph_0. Starting from the assumption of the existence of a supercompact cardinal, a model is built in which for some such mu there are mu^{++} graphs on mu^+ that taken jointly are universal for the graphs on mu^+, while 2^{mu^+}>> mu^{++} . The paper also addresses the general problem of obtaining a framework for consistency results at the successor of a singular strong limit starting from the assumption that a supercompact cardinal kappa exists. The result on the existence of universal graphs is obtained as a specific application of a more general method.
