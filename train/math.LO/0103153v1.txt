Say that a function pi:n^{<omega}-->n (henceforth called a predictor) k-constantly predicts a real x in n^omega if for almost all intervals I of length k, there is i in I such that x(i)=pi (x restriction i). We study the k-constant prediction number v_n^const(k), that is, the size of the least family of predictors needed to k --constantly predict all reals, for different values of n and k, and investigate their relationship.
