Extending a result of Foreman and Magidor we prove that in the core model for almost linear iterations the following holds. There is a sequence (S^n_\alpha : n<\omega,\alpha>0) such that each individual S^n_\alpha is a stationary subset of \aleph_{\alpha+1} consisting of points of cofinality \omega_1, and for all limits \lambda and for all f:\lambda -> \omega do we have that (S^{f(\alpha)}_\alpha : \alpha<\lambda) is mutually stationary if and only if the range of f is finite.
