Any model of ZFC + GCH has a generic extension (made with a poset of size aleph_2) in which the following hold:   MA + 2^{aleph_0}= aleph_2+ there exists a Delta^2_1-well ordering of the reals.   The proof consists in iterating posets designed to change at will the guessing properties of ladder systems on omega_1. Therefore, the study of such ladders is a main concern of this article.
