For an uncountable regular cardinal \kappa we let \nabla_\kappa(A) be the statement that A \subset \kappa and for all regular \theta > \kappa, the set of all X \in [\theta]^<\kappa such that X \cap \kappa \in \kappa and otp(X \cap OR) is a cardinal in L[A \cap X \cap \kappa] is stationary. We had shown earlier that \nabla_{\omega_1}(A) can hold in a generic extension of L. We now prove that \nabla_{\omega_2}(A) can hold in a semi-proper generic extension of L, whereas \nabla_{\omega_3}(0) is equivalent with the existence of 0^#.
