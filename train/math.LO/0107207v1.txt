Under some cardinal arithmetic assumptions, we prove that every stationary subset of lambda of a right cofinality has the weak diamond. This is a strong negation of uniformization. We then deal with a weaker version of the weak diamond- colouring restrictions. We then deal with semi- saturated (normal) filters.
