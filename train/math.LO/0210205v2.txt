We develop the theory of the forcing with trees and creatures for an inaccessible lambda continuing Ros{\l}anowski and Shelah math.LO/9807172, math.LO/9909115. To make a real use of these forcing notions (that is to iterate them without collapsing cardinals) we need suitable iteration theorems, and those are proved as well. (In this aspect we continue Ros{\l}anowski and Shelah math.LO/9906024.)
