Split preorders are preordering relations on a domain whose composition is defined in a particular way by splitting the domain into two disjoint subsets. These relations and the associated composition arise in categorial proof theory in connection with coherence theorems. Here split preorders are represented isomorphically in the category whose arrows are binary relations, where composition is defined in the usual way. This representation is related to a classical result of representation theory due to Richard Brauer.
