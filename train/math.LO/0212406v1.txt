There have been many generalizations of Shoenfield's Theorem on the absoluteness of \Sigma^1_2 sentences between uncountable transitive models of \mathrm{ZFC}. One of the strongest versions currently known deals with \Sigma^2_1 absoluteness conditioned on \mathrm{CH}. For a variety of reasons, from the study of inner models and from simply combinatorial set theory, the question of whether conditional \Sigma^2_2 absoluteness is possible at all, and if so, what large cardinal assumptions are involved and what sentence(s) might play the role of \mathrm{CH}, are fundamental questions. This article investigates the possiblities for \Sigma^2_2 absoluteness by extending the connections between determinacy hypotheses and absoluteness hypotheses.
