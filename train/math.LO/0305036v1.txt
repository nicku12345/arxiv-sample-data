Define z to be the smallest cardinality of a function f:X->Y with X and Y sets of reals such that there is no Borel function g extending f. In this paper we prove that it is relatively consistent with ZFC to have b<z where b is, as usual, smallest cardinality of an unbounded family in w^w. This answers a question raised by Zapletal. We also show that it is relatively consistent with ZFC that there exists a set of reals X such that the Borel order of X is bounded but there exists a relatively analytic subset of X which is not relatively coanalytic. This answers a question of Mauldin.
