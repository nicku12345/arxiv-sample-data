We present a modification to the Prikry on Extenders forcing notion allowing the blow up of the power set of a large cardinal, change its cofinality to omega without adding bounded subsets, working directly from arbitrary extender (e.g., n-huge extender). Using this forcing, starting from a superstrong cardinal, we construct a model in which the added Prikry sequences are a scale in the normal Prikry sequence.
