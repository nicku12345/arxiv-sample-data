In a previous paper we developed the notions of th-independence and \th-ranks which define a geometric independence relation in a class of theories which we called ``rosy''. We proved that rosy theories include simple and o-minimal theories and that for any theory for which the stable forking conjecture was true, \th-forking coincides with forking independence.   In this article, we continue to study properties of th-forking and find more examples of rosy theories. Among the new properties we prove in this paper are some alternative characterizations of rosy theories and some tools to prove and analyze rosiness in particular cases. Finally, we use this to find two examples of rosy non simple theories: pseudo real closed fields (PRC-fields) and the uniform companion of a large differential field defined by Marcus Tressl.
