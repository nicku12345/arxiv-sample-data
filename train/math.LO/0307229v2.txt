If an extension Vbar of V satisfies the delta approximation and cover properties for classes and V is a class in Vbar, then every suitably closed embedding j:Vbar to Nbar in Vbar with critical point above delta restricts to an embedding j|V:V to N amenable to the ground model V. In such extensions, therefore, there are no new large cardinals above delta. This result extends work in math.LO/9808011.
