We generalize the Hart-Shelah example \cite{HaSh:323} to higher infinitary logics. We build, for each natural number k\geq 2 and for each infinite cardinal \lambda, a sentence \psi_k^\lambda of the logic L_{(2^\lambda)^+,\omega} that (modulo mild set theoretical hypotheses around \lambda and assuming 2^\lambda < \lambda^{+m}) is categorical in \lambda^+,\dots,\lambda^{+k-1} but not in \beth_{k+1}(\lambda)^+ (or beyond); we study the dimensional encoding of combinatorics involved in the construction of this sentence and study various model-theoretic properties of the resulting abstract elementary class {\mathcal K}^*(\lambda,k)=(Mod(\psi_k^\lambda),\prec_{(2^\lambda)^+,\omega}) in the finite interval of cardinals \lambda,\lambda^+,\dots,\lambda^{+k}.
