The purpose is to formulate a Fourier transformation for the space of functionals, as an infinitesimal meaning. We extend {\bf R} to  ^{\star}(^{\ast}{\bf R}) under the base of nonstandard methods for the construction. The domain of a functional is the set of all internal functions from a  ^{\ast}-finite lattice to a  ^{\ast}-finite lattice with a double meaning. Considering a  ^{\ast}-finite lattice with a double meaning, we find how to treat the domain for a functional in our theory of Fourier transformation, and calculate two typical examples.
