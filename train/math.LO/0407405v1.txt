A classical theorem of Luzin is that the separation principle holds for the Pi^0_alpha sets but fails for the Sigma^0_alpha sets. We show that for every Sigma^0_alpha set A which is not Pi^0_alpha there exists a Sigma^0_alpha set B which is disjoint from A but cannot be separated from A by a Delta^0_alpha set C. Assuming Pi^1_1-determancy it follows from a theorem of Steel that a similar result holds for Pi^1_1 sets. On the other hand assuming V=L there is a proper Pi^1_1 set which is not half of a Borel inseparable pair. These results answer questions raised by F.Dashiell.
