Axiomatic approach has demonstrated its power in mathematics. The main goal of this preprint is to show that axiomatic methods are also very efficient for computer science. It is possible to apply these methods to many problems in computer science. Here the main modes of computer functioning and program execution are described, formalized, and studied in an axiomatic context. The emphasis is on three principal modes: computation, decision, and acceptation. Now the prevalent mode for computers is computation. Problems of artificial intelligence involve decision mode, while communication functions of computer demand accepting mode. The main goal of this preprint is to study properties of these modes and relations between them. These problems are closely related to such fundamental concepts of computer science and technology as computability, decidability, and acceptability. In other words, we are concerned with the question what computers and software systems can do working in this or that mode. Consequently, results of this preprint allow one to achieve higher understanding of computations and in such a way, to find some basic properties of computers and their applications. Classes of algorithms, which model different kinds of computers and software, are compared with respect to their computing, accepting or deciding power. Operations with algorithms and machines are introduced. Examples show how to apply axiomatic results to different classes of algorithms and machines in order to enhance their performance.
