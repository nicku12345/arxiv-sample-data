We consider, for infinite cardinals kappa and alpha <= kappa^+, the group Pi(kappa,< alpha) of sequences of integers, of length kappa, with non-zero entries in fewer than alpha positions. Our main result tells when Pi(kappa,< alpha) can be embedded in Pi(lambda,< beta). The proof involves some set-theoretic results, one about familes of finite sets and one about families of ultrafilters.
