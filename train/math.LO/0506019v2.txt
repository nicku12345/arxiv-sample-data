We explore the interaction between Lebesgue measure and dominating functions. We show, via both a priority construction and a forcing construction, that there is a function of incomplete degree that dominates almost all degrees. This answers a question of Dobrinen and Simpson, who showed that such functions are related to the proof-theoretic strength of the regularity of Lebesgue measure for G_\delta sets. Our constructions essentially settle the reverse mathematical classification of this principle.   Revised Nov 13, 2005. Minor corrections made.
