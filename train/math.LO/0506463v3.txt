Gentzen's classical sequent calculus LK has explicit structural rules for contraction and weakening. They can be absorbed (in a right-sided formulation) by replacing the axiom P,(not P) by Gamma,P,(not P) for any context Gamma, and replacing the original disjunction rule with Gamma,A,B implies Gamma,(A or B).   This paper presents a classical sequent calculus which is also free of contraction and weakening, but more symmetrically: both contraction and weakening are absorbed into conjunction, leaving the axiom rule intact. It uses a blended conjunction rule, combining the standard context-sharing and context-splitting rules: Gamma,Delta,A and Gamma,Sigma,B implies Gamma,Delta,Sigma,(A and B). We refer to this system M as minimal sequent calculus.   We prove a minimality theorem for the propositional fragment Mp: any propositional sequent calculus S (within a standard class of right-sided calculi) is complete if and only if S contains Mp (that is, each rule of Mp is derivable in S). Thus one can view M as a minimal complete core of Gentzen's LK.
