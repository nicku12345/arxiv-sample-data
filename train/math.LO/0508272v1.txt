We introduce more properties of forcing notions which imply that their lambda-support iterations are lambda-proper, where lambda is an inaccessible cardinal. This paper is a direct continuation of section A.2 of math.LO/0210205. As an application of our iteration result we show that it is consistent that dominating numbers associated with two normal filters on lambda are distinct.
