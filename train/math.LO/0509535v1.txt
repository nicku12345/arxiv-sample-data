We introduce tame abstract elementary classes as a generalization of all cases of abstract elementary classes that are known to permit development of stability-like theory. In this paper we explore stability results in this context. We assume that \K is a tame abstract elementary class satisfying the amalgamation property with no maximal model. The main results include:   (1) Galois-stability above the Hanf number implies that \kappa(K) is less than the Hanf number. Where \kappa(K) is the parallel of \kapppa(T) for f.o. T.   (2) We use (1) to construct Morley sequences (for non-splitting) improving previous results of Shelah (from Sh394) and Grossberg & Lessmann.   (3) We obtain a partial stability-spectrum theorem for classes categorical above the Hanf number.
