We define constructive truth for arithmetic and for intuitionistic analysis, and investigate its properties. We also prove that the set of constructively true (first order) arithmetical statements is Pi-1-2 and Sigma-1-2 hard, and we conjecture it to be complete for second order arithmetic. A statement is constructively true iff it is realized by a constructive function under continuous function realizability.
