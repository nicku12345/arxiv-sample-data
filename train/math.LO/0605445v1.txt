This article is Part I in a series of three papers devoted to determining the minimal complexity of scales in the inner model K(\mathbb{R}). Here, in Part I, we shall complete our development of a fine structure theory for K(\mathbb{R}) which is essential for our work in Parts II and III. In particular, we prove the following fundamental theorem which supports our analysis of scales in K(\mathbb{R}): If \mathcal{M} is an iterable real premouse, then \mathcal{M} is acceptable above the reals. This theorem will be used in Parts II and III to solve the problem of finding scales of minimal complexity in K(\mathbb{R}).
