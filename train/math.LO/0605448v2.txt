We define weak real mice \mathcal{M} and prove that the boldface pointclass \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_m(\mathcal{M}) has the scale property assuming only the determinacy of sets of reals in \mathcal{M} when m is the smallest integer m>0 such that \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_m(\mathcal{M}) contains a set of reals not in \mathcal{M}. We shall use this development in Part III to obtain scales of minimal complexity in K(\mathbb{R}).
