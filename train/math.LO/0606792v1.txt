It is known from Grzegorczyk's paper \cite{grze-1951} that the lattice of real semi-algebraic closed subsets of {\mathbb R}^n is undecidable for every integer n\geq 2. More generally, if X is any definable set over a real or algebraically closed field K, then the lattice L(X) of all definable subsets of X closed in X is undecidable whenever \dim X\geq 2. Nevertheless, we investigate in this paper the model theory of the class {\rm SC\_{def}}(K,d) of all such lattices L(X) with \dim X\leq d and K as above or a henselian valued field of characteristic zero. <p> We show that the universal theory of {\rm SC\_{def}}(K,d), in a natural expansion by definition of the lattice language, is the same for every such field K. We give a finite axiomatization of it and prove that it is locally finite and admits a model-completion, which turns to be decidable as well as all its completions. We expect L({\mathbb Q}\_p^d) to be a model of (a little variant of) this model-completion. This leads us to a new conjecture in p-adic semi-algebraic geometry which, combined with the results of this paper, would give decidability (via a natural recursive axiomatization) and elimination of quantifiers for the complete theory of L({\mathbb R}\_p^d), uniformly in p.
