We find the model completion of the theory modules over A, where A is a finitely generated commutative algebra over a field K. This is done in a context where the field K and the module are represented by sorts in the theory, so that constructible sets associated with a module can be interpreted in this language. The language is expanded by additional sorts for the Grassmanians of all powers of K^n, which are necessary to achieve quantifier elimination.   The result turns out to be that the model completion is the theory of a certain class of ``big'' injective modules. In particular, it is shown that the class of injective modules is itself elementary. We also obtain an explicit description of the types in this theory.
