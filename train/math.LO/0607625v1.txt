Dirichlet integrals and the associated Dirichlet statistical densities are widely used in various areas. Generalizations of Dirichlet integrals and Dirichlet models to matrix-variate cases, when the matrices are real symmetric positive definite or hermitian positive definite, are available \cite{4}. Real scalar variables case of the Dirichlet models are generalized in various directions. One such generalization of the type-2 or inverted Dirichlet is looked into in this article. Matrix-variate analogue, when the matrices are hermitian positive definite, are worked out along with some properties which are mathematically and statistically interesting.
