We prove several reflection theorems on D-spaces, which are Hausdorff topological spaces X in which for every open neighbourhood assignment U there is a closed discrete subspace D such that \[ \bigcup\{U(x): x\in D\}=X. \] The upwards reflection theorems are obtained in the presence of a forcing axiom, while most of the downwards reflection results use large cardinal assumptions.   The combinatorial content of arguments showing that a given space is a D-space, can be formulated using the concept of discrete families. We note the connection between non-reflection arguments involving discrete families and the well known question of the existence of families allowing partial transversals without having a transversal themselves, and use it to give non-trivial instances of the incompactness phenomenon in the context of discretisations.
