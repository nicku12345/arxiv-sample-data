We will present a collection of guessing principles which have a similar relationship to \diamond as cardinal invariants of the continuum have to \CH. The purpose is to provide a means for systematically analyzing \diamond and its consequences. It also provides for a unified approach for understanding the status of a number of consequences of \CH and \diamond in models such as those of Laver, Miller, and Sacks.
