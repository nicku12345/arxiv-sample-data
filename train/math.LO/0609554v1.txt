The undecidability of the additive theory of primes (with identity) as well as the theory Th(N,+, n -> p\_n), where p\_n denotes the (n+1)-th prime, are open questions. As a possible approach, we extend the latter theory by adding some extra function. In this direction we show the undecidability of the existential part of the theory Th(N, +, n -> p\_n, n -> r\_n), where r\_n is the remainder of p\_n divided by n in the euclidian division.
