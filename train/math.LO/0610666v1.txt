We consider the ordered field which is the completion of the Puiseux series field over \bR equipped with a ring of analytic functions on [-1,1]^n which contains the standard subanalytic functions as well as functions given by t-adically convergent power series, thus combining the analytic structures from [DD] and [LR3]. We prove quantifier elimination and o-minimality in the corresponding language. We extend these constructions and results to rank n ordered fields \bR_n (the maximal completions of iterated Puiseux series fields). We generalize the example of Hrushovski and Peterzil [HP] of a sentence which is not true in any o-minimal expansion of \bR (shown in [LR3] to be true in an o-minimal expansion of the Puiseux series field) to a tower of examples of sentences \sigma_n, true in \bR_n, but not true in any o-minimal expansion of any of the fields \bR,\bR_1,...,\bR_{n-1}.
