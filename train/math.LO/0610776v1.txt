We classify the computability-theoretic complexity of two index sets of classes of first-order theories: We show that the property of being an \aleph_0-categorical theory is \Pi^0_3-complete; and the property of being an Ehrenfeucht theory \Pi^1_1-complete. We also show that the property of having continuum many models is \Sigma^1_1-hard. Finally, as a corollary, we note that the properties of having only decidable models, and of having only computable models, are both \Pi^1_1-complete.
