We show that it is relatively consistent with ZF that the Borel hierarchy on the reals has length \omega_2. This implies that \omega_1 has countable cofinality, so the axiom of choice fails very badly in our model. A similar argument produces models of ZF in which the Borel hierarchy has length any given limit ordinal less than \omega_2, e.g., \omega or \omega_1+\omega_1.
