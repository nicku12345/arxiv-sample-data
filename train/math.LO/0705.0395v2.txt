We give some sufficient conditions under which any valued field that admits quantifier elimination in the Macintyre language is henselian. Then, without extra assumptions, we prove that if a valued field of characteristic (0,0) has a \Z-group as its value group and admits quantifier elimination in the main sort of the Denef-Pas style language \mathcal{L}_{RRP} then it is henselian. In fact the proof of this suggests that a quite large class of Denef-Pas style languages is natural with respect to henselianity.
