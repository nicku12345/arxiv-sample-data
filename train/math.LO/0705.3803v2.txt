A sectionally pseudocomplemented poset P is one which has the top element and in which every principal order filter is a pseudocomplemented poset. The sectional pseudocomplements give rise to an implication-like operation on P which coincides with the relative pseudocomplementation if P is relatively psudocomplemented. We characterise this operation and study some elementary properties of upper semilattices, lower semilattices and lattices equipped with this kind of implication. We deal also with a few weaker versions of implication. Sectionally pseudocomplemented lattices have already been studied in the literature.
