Our aim is to improve the negative results i.e. non-existence of limit models, and the failure of the generic pair property from math.LO/0609636 to inaccessible lambda as promised there. The motivation is that in [Sh:F756] the positive results are for lambda measurable hence inaccessible, whereas in math.LO/0609636 in the negative results obtained only on non-strong limit cardinals.
