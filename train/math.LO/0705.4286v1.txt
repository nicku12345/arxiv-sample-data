We characterise the Priestley spaces corresponding to affine complete bounded distributive lattices. Moreover we prove that the class of affine complete bounded distributive lattices is closed under products and free products. We show that every (not necessarily bounded) distributive lattice can be embedded in an affine complete one and that \mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1] is initial in the class of affine complete lattices.
