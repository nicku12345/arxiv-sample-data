We consider strong combinatorial principles for sigma-directed families of countable sets in the ordering by inclusion modulo finite, e.g. P-ideals of countable sets. We try for principles as strong as possible while remaining compatible with CH, and we also consider principles compatible with the existence of nonspecial Aronszajn trees. The main thrust is towards abstract principles with game theoretic formulations. Some of these principles are purely combinatorial, while the ultimate principles are primarily combinatorial but also have aspects of forcing axioms.
