Let H be a product of countably infinite number of copies of an uncountable Polish space X. Let \Sigma_\xi (\bar {\Sigma}_\xi) be the class of Borel sets of additive class \xi for the product of copies of the discrete topology on X (the Polish topology on X), and let {\cal B} = \cup_{\xi < \omega_1} \bar{\Sigma}_\xi. We prove in the L\'{e}vy--Solovay model that \bar{\Sigma}_\xi =\Sigma_{\xi}\cap {\cal B} for 1 \leq \xi < \omega_1.
