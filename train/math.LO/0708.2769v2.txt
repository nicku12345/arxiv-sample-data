For every natural number m, the existentially closed models of the theory of fields with m commuting derivations can be given a first-order geometric characterization in several ways. In particular, the theory of these differential fields has a model-companion. The axioms are that certain differential varieties determined by certain ordinary varieties are nonempty. There is no restriction on the characteristic of the underlying field.
