We show using a proof of the Global Square property in Core Models below a measurable of Mitchell order o(kappa)=kappa^++ (a result originally due to Jensen & Zeman) that Foreman and Magidor's Mutual Stationarity property MS(Aleph_n (1<n<omega), Cof(omega_1)) implies the existence of inner models with measurables of high Mitchell order. This MS property states that any sequence of independently chosen stationary subsets S_n of the Aleph_n (of fixed cofinality omega_1) is mutually stationary below aleph_omega.
