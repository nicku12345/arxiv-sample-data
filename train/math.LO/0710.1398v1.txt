A logical model of spatiotemporal structures is pictured as a succession of processes in time. One usual way to formalize time structure is to assume the global existence of time points and then collect some of them to form time intervals of processes. Under this set-theoretic approach, the logic that governs the processes acquires a Boolean structure. However, in a real distributed system or a relativistic universe where the message-passing time between different locations is not negligible, the logic has no choice but to accept time interval instead of time point as a primitive concept. From this modeling process of spatiotemporal structures, orthologic, the most simplified version of quantum logic, emerges naturally.
