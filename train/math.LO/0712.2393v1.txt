It is shown that the known notion of selective coideal can be extended to a family \mathcal{H} of subsets of \mathcal{R}, where (\mathcal{R},\leq,r) is a topological Ramsey space in the sense of Todorcevic (see \cite{todo}). Then it is proven that, if \mathcal{H} selective, the \mathcal{H}-Ramsey and \mathcal{H}-Baire subsets of \mathcal{R} are equivalent. This extends the results of Farah in \cite{farah} for semiselective coideals of \mathbb{N}. Also, it is proven that the family of {\cal H}--Ramsey subsets of {\cal R} is closed under the Souslin operation.
