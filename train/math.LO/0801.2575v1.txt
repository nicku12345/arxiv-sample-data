This paper reviews the fully complete hypergames model of system F, presented a decade ago in the author's thesis. Instantiating type variables is modelled by allowing ``games as moves''. The uniformity of a quantified type variable \forall X is modelled by copycat expansion: X represents an unknown game, a kind of black box, so all the player can do is copy moves between a positive occurrence and a negative occurrence of X.   This presentation is based on slides for a talk entitled ``Hypergame semantics: ten years later'' given at `Games for Logic and Programming Languages', Seattle, August 2006.
