We show that if T is a dependent theory then so is its Keisler randomisation T^R. In order to do this we generalise the notion of a Vapnik-Chervonenkis class to families of [0,1]-valued functions (a \emph{continuous} Vapnik-Chervonenkis class), and we characterise families of functions having this property via the growth rate of the mean width of an associated family of convex compacts.
