We compare three notions of effectiveness on uncountable structures. The first notion is that of a \real-computable structure, based on a model of computation proposed by Blum, Shub, and Smale, which uses full-precision real arithmetic. The second notion is that of an F-parameterizable structure, defined by Morozov and based on Mal'tsev's notion of a constructive structure. The third is \Sigma-definability over HF(\real), defined by Ershov as a generalization of the observation that the computably enumerable sets are exactly those \Sigma_1-definable in HF(\mathbb{N}).   We show that every \real-computable structure has an F-parameterization, but that the expansion of the real field by the exponential function is F-parameterizable but not \real-computable. We also show that the structures with \real-computable copies are exactly the structures with copies \Sigma-definable over HF(\real). One consequence of this equivalence is a method of approximating certain \real-computable structures by Turing computable structures.
