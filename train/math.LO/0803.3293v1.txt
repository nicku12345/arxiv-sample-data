Classification is an important goal in many branches of mathematics. The idea is to describe the members of some class of mathematical objects, up to isomorphism or other important equivalence in terms of relatively simple invariants. Where this is impossible, it is useful to have concrete results saying so. In model theory and descriptive set theory, there is a large body of work, showing that certain classes of mathematical structures admit classification, while others do not. In the present paper, we describe some recent work on classification in computable structure theory.
