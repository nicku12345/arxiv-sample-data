We consider definably complete and Baire expansions of ordered fields: every definable subset of the domain of the structure has a supremum and the domain can not be written as the union of a definable increasing family of nowhere dense sets. Every expansion of the real field is definably complete and Baire. So is every o-minimal expansion of a field. However, unlike the o-minimal case, the structures considered form an elementary class. In this context we prove a version of Kuratowski-Ulam's Theorem and some restricted version of Sard's Lemma. We use the above results to prove the following version of Wilkie's Theorem of the Complement: given a definably complete Baire expansion K of an ordered field with a family of smooth functions, if there are uniform bounds on the number of definably connected components of quantifier free definable sets, then K is o-minimal. We further generalize the above result, along the line of Speissegger's theorem, and prove the o-minimality of the relative Pfaffian closure of an o-minimal structure inside a definably complete Baire structure.
