We show that if a real x is strongly Hausdorff h-random, where h is a dimension function corresponding to a convex order, then it is also random for a continuous probability measure \mu such that the \mu-measure of the basic open cylinders shrinks according to h. The proof uses a new method to construct measures, based on effective (partial) continuous transformations and a basis theorem for \Pi^0_1-classes applied to closed sets of probability measures. We use the main result to give a new proof of Frostman's Lemma, to derive a collapse of randomness notions for Hausdorff measures, and to provide a characterization of effective Hausdorff dimension similar to Frostman's Theorem.
