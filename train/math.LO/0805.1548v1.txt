We extend to singular cardinals the model-theoretical relation \lambda \stackrel{\kappa}{\Rightarrow} \mu introduced in P. Lipparini, The compactness spectrum of abstract logics, large cardinals and combinatorial principles, Boll. Unione Matematica Italiana ser. VII, {\bf 4-B} 875--903 (1990). We extend some results obtained in Part II, finding equivalent conditions involving uniformity of ultrafilters and the existence of certain infinite matrices. Our present definition suggests a new compactness property for abstract logics.
