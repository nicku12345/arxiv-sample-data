An equivalence structure is a set with a single binary relation, satisfying sentences stating that the relation is an equivalence relation. A computable structure A is said to be \Delta^0_\alpha categorical if for any computable structure B isomorphic to A there is a \Delta^0_\alpha function witnessing that the two are isomorphic.   The present paper gives an exact characterization of \Delta^0_\alpha equivalence structures where \alpha = 1 or \alpha \geq 3. Extensive results for \alpha = 2 are also given, and open cases are exhaustively described.
