Since the axioms in (Consi-CoS) are not recursively enumerable, NACT* is no axiom system in the classical sense . Therefore we construct a series of partial systems which form a recursive axiom system too. Starting with the "dichotomic" systems NACT# and its variant NACT#4, we are going on to the "disjunctive" systems NACT+ and NACT+4, and eventually to NACT+Strat. After that we discuss the medium classes of these systems. Finally we present the inconsistent NSA-systems based on Not-SelfApplicability and explain their help for computational set theory.
