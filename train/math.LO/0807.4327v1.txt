The main goal of "Naive Axiomatic Mengenlehre" (NAM) is to find a more or less adequately explicit criterion that precisely formalizes the intuitive notion of a "normal set". NAM is mainly a construction procedure for building several formal systems NAMix, each of which can turn out to be an adequate codification of the contentual naive set theory. ("i" is a natural number which enumerates the used "normality" condition, and "x" is a letter which points to the variants of the used axioms.) Parallel to NAM, the Naive Axiomatic Class Theory NACT is constructed as a system of systems too.
