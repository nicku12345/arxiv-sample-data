We study direct product representations of algebras in varieties. We collect several conditions expressing that these representations are "definable" in a first-order-logic sense, among them the concept of Definable Factor Congruences (DFC). The main results are that DFC is a Mal'cev property and that it is equivalent to all other conditions formulated; in particular we prove that V has DFC if and only if V has 0&1 and Boolean Factor Congruences. We also obtain an explicit first order definition of the kernel of the canonical projections via the terms associated to the Mal'cev condition for DFC, in such a manner it is preserved by taking direct products and direct factors. The main tool is the use of "central elements," which are a generalization of both central idempotent elements in rings with identity and neutral complemented elements in a bounded lattice.
