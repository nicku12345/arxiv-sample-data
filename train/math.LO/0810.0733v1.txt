We characterize nonforking (Morley) sequences in dependent theories in terms of a generalization of Poizat's special sequences and show that average types of Morley sequences are stationary over their domains. We characterize generically stable types in terms of the structure of the "eventual" type. We then study basic properties of "strict Morley sequences", based on Shelah's notion of strict nonforking. In particular we prove "Kim's lemma" for such sequences, and a weak version of local character.
