We study varieties with a term-definable poset structure, "po-groupoids". It is known that connected posets have the "strict refinement property" (SRP). In [arXiv:0808.1860v1 [math.LO]] it is proved that semidegenerate varieties with the SRP have definable factor congruences and if the similarity type is finite, directly indecomposables are axiomatizable by a set of first-order sentences. We obtain such a set for semidegenerate varieties of connected po-groupoids and show its quantifier complexity is bounded in general.
