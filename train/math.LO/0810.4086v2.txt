We prove that IHS_A, the theory of infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces equipped with a generic automorphism, is \aleph_0-stable up to perturbation of the automorphism, and admits prime models up to perturbation over any set. Similarly, APr_A, the theory of atomless probability algebras equipped with a generic automorphism is \aleph_0-stable up to perturbation. However, not allowing perturbation it is not even superstable.
