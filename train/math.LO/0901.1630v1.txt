In this paper we study the dense elements and the radical of a residuated lattice, residuated lattices with lifting Boolean center, simple, local, semilocal and quasi-local residuated lattices. BL-algebras have lifting Boolean center; moreover, Glivenko residuated lattices which fulfill a certain equation (that is satisfied by BL-algebras) have lifting Boolean center.
