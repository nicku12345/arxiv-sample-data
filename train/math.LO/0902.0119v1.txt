We prove that for every simple theory T (or even simple thick compact abstract theory) there is a (unique) compact abstract theory T^\fP whose saturated models are the lovely pairs of T. Independence-theoretic results that were proved in \cite{ppv:pairs} when T^\fP is a first order theory are proved for the general case: in particular T^\fP is simple and we characterise independence.
