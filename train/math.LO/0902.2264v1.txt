In this article we prove a set of preservation properties of the reticulation functor for residuated lattices (for instance preservation of subalgebras, finite direct products, inductive limits, Boolean powers) and we transfer certain properties between bounded distributive lattices and residuated lattices through the reticulation, focusing on Stone, strongly Stone and m-Stone algebras.
