In this paper we consider an approach where both propositions and the accessibility relation are infinitely many-valued over G\"{o}del algebras. In particular, we consider separately the \Box -fragment and the \Diamond -fragment of our G\"{o}del modal logic and prove that both logics are complete with respect to the class of models with values in the linear Hetying algebra [0,1]. In addition, we show that the first fragment is uniquely determined by the class of models having crisp accessibility relation but it has not the finite model property. On the contrary, the second fragment is not characterized by crisp accessibility models alone but it has the finite model property. Finally, we show that the approach can be extended to include finitely many rational truth-values \`{a} la Pavelka.
