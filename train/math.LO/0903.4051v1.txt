The primary purpose of this article is to show that a certain natural set of axioms yields a completeness result for continuous first-order logic. In particular, we show that in continuous first-order logic a set of formulae is (completely) satisfiable if (and only if) it is consistent. From this result it follows that continuous first-order logic also satisfies an \emph{approximated} form of strong completeness, whereby \Sigma\vDash\varphi (if and) only if \Sigma\vdash\varphi\dotminus 2^{-n} for all n<\omega. This approximated form of strong completeness asserts that if \Sigma\vDash\varphi, then proofs from \Sigma, being finite, can provide arbitrary better approximations of the truth of \varphi.
