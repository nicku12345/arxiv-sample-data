We throw some light on the question: is there a MAD family (= a family of infinite subsets of N, the intersection of any two is finite) which is completely separable (i.e. any X subseteq N is included in a finite union of members of the family or include a member of the family). We prove that it is hard to prove the consistency of the negation:   (a) if 2^{aleph_0} < aleph_omega, then there is such a family   (b) if there is no such families then some situation related to pcf holds whose consistency is large.
