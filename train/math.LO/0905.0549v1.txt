In 1990, J.L. Krivine introduced the notion of storage operator to simulate, in \lambda-calculus, the "call by value" in a context of a "call by name". J.L. Krivine has shown that, using G\"odel translation from classical into intuitionistic logic, we can find a simple type for storage operators in AF2 type system. In this present paper, we give a general type for storage operators in a slight extension of AF2. We give at the end (without proof) a generalization of this result to other types.
