A numeral system is defined by three closed \lambda-terms : a normal \lambda-term d_0 for Zero, a \lambda-term S_d for Successor, and a \lambda-term for Zero Test, such that the \lambda-terms ({S_d}^{i} ~ d_0) are normalizable and have different normal forms. A numeral system is said adequate iff it has a closed \lambda-term for Predecessor. This Note gives a simple example of a non adequate numeral system.
