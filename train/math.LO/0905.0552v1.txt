In this paper, we present three methods to give the value of a classical integer in \lambda\mu-calculus. The first method is an external method and gives the value and the false part of a normal classical integer. The second method uses a new reduction rule and gives as result the corresponding Church integer. The third method is the M. Parigot's method which uses the J.L. Krivine's storage operators.
