We give in this paper a purely syntactical definition of input and output types of system F. We define the syntactical data types as input and output types. We show that any type with positive quantifiers is a syntactical data type and that an input type is an output type. We give some restrictions on the \forall-elimination rule in order to prove that an output type is an input type.
