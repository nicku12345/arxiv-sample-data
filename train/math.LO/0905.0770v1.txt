In 1990, J.L. Krivine introduced the notion of storage operator to simulate, for Church integers, the "call by value" in a context of a "call by name" strategy. In this present paper, we define, for every \lambda-term S which realizes the successor function on Church integers, the notion of S-storage operator. We prove that every storage operator is a S-storage operator. But the converse is not always true.
