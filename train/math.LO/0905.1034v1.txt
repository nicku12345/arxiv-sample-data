The symmetric \lambda \mu-calculus is the \lambda \mu-calculus introduced by Parigot in which the reduction rule \m', which is the symmetric of \mu, is added. We give arithmetical proofs of some strong normalization results for this calculus. We show (this is a new result) that the \mu\mu'-reduction is strongly normalizing for the un-typed calculus. We also show the strong normalization of the \beta\mu\mu'-reduction for the typed calculus: this was already known but the previous proofs use candidates of reducibility where the interpretation of a type was defined as the fix point of some increasing operator and thus, were highly non arithmetical.
