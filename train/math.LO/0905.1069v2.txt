Given a definably compact group G in a saturated o-minimal structure, there is a canonical homomorphism from G to a compact real Lie group F(G). We establish a similar result for the (o-mininimal) universal cover of a definably compact group. We also show that F(G) determines the definable homotopy type of G. A crucial step is to show that the fundamental group of an open subset of F(G) is isomorphic to the definable fundamental group of its preimage in G. Our results depend on the study of the o-minimal fundamental groupoid of G.
