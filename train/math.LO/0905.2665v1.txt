We employ the notions of `sequential function' and `interrogation' (dialogue) in order to define new partial combinatory algebra structures on sets of functions. These structures are analyzed using J. Longley's preorder-enriched category of partial combinatory algebras and decidable applicative structures.   We also investigate total combinatory algebras of partial functions. One of the results is, that every realizability topos is a quotient of a realizability topos on a total combinatory algebra.
