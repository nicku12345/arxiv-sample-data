In this short note we relate some known properties of propositional calculus to purely algebraic considerations of a Boolean algebra. Classes of formulas of propositional calculus are considered as elements of a Boolean algebra. As such they can be represented by uniquely defined elements of this algebra which we call "logical primes". The algebraic notations appear useful because they make it possible to derive well known properties of propositional calculus by simple calculations or to substitute lengthy logical considerations by schematic algebraic manipulations.
