In this paper we develop a theory called \sigma-Set Theory, in which we present an axiom system developed from the study of Set Theories of Zermelo-Fraenkel, Neumann-Bernays-Godel and Morse-Kelley. In \sigma-Set Theory, we present the proper existence of objects called \sigma-antielement, \sigma-antiset, natural numbers, antinatural numbers and generated \sigma-set by two \sigma-sets, from which we obtain, among other things, a commutative non-associative algebraic structure called Integer Space 3^{X}, which corresponds to the algebraic completion of 2^{X}.
