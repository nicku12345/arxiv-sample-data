We present a way of topologizing sets of Galois types over structures in abstract elementary classes with amalgamation. In the elementary case, the topologies thus produced refine the syntactic topologies familiar from first order logic. We exhibit a number of natural correspondences between the model-theoretic properties of classes and their constituent models and the topological properties of the associated spaces. Tameness of Galois types, in particular, emerges as a topological separation principle.
