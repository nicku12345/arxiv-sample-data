We extend the Ahlbrandt--Ziegler analysis of interpretability in aleph_0-categorical structures by showing that existential interpretation is controlled by the monoid of self--embeddings and positive existential interpretation of structures without constant endomorphisms is controlled by the monoid of endomorphisms in the same way as general interpretability is controlled by the automorphism group.
