We clarified the connection between measurements and partitions, and discussed the meaning of semiotics for measurements based on functions. The terms of property and relation quantity were defined by our understanding of partitions and functions. Farther more, we discussed correspondences established between two quantities, and the theorems of complete set based on it. Finally, we presented the structure which can afford the obligation of general system, and also the definitions of subsystem and isomorphism.
