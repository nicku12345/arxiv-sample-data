We propose a new, game-theoretic, approach to the idealized forcing, in terms of fusion games. This generalizes the classical approach to the Sacks and the Miller forcing. For definable (\mathbf{\Pi}^1_1 on \mathbf{\Sigma}^1_1) \sigma-ideals we show that if a \sigma-ideal is generated by closed sets, then it is generated by closed sets in all forcing extensions. We also prove an infinite-dimensional version of the Solecki dichotomy for analytic sets. Among examples, we investigate the \sigma-ideal \E generated by closed null sets and \sigma-ideals connected with not piecewise continuous functions.
