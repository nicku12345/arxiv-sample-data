We study the notions generic stability, regularity, homogeneous pregeometries, quasiminimality, and their mutual relations, in an arbitrary first order theory T. We prove that "infinite-dimensional homogeneous pregeometries" coincide with generically stable strongly regular types (p(x),x=x). We prove that quasiminimal structures of cardinality at least aleph-2 are homogeneous pregeometries, We prove that the generic type of an arbitrary quasiminimal structure is locally strongly regular. Some of the results depend on a general dichotomy for regular-like types: generic stability, or existence of a suitable definable partial ordering.
