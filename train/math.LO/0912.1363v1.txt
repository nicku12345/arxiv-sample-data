For a countable, weakly minimal theory, we show that the Schroeder-Bernstein property (any two elementarily bi-embeddable models are isomorphic) is equivalent to both a condition on orbits of rank 1 types and the property that the theory has no infinite collection of pairwise bi-embeddable, pairwise nonisomorphic models. We conclude that for countable weakly minimal theories, the Schroeder-Bernstein property is absolute between transitive models of ZFC.
