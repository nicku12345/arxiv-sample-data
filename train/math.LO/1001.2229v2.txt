An argument of A.Borel shows that every compact connected Lie group is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of its derived subgroup and a torus. We prove a parallel result for definably compact definably connected groups definable in an o-minimal expansion of a real closed field. As opposed to the Lie case, however, we provide an example showing that the derived subgroup may not have a definable semidirect complement.
