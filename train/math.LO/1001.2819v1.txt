With every \sigma-ideal I on a Polish space we associate the \sigma-ideal I^* generated by the closed sets in I. We study the forcing notions of Borel sets modulo the respective \sigma-ideals I and I^* and find connections between their forcing properties. To this end, we associate to a \sigma-ideal on a Polish space an ideal on a countable set and show how forcing properties of the forcing depend on combinatorial properties of the ideal. For \sigma-ideals generated by closed sets we also study the degrees of reals added in the forcing extensions. Among corollaries of our results, we get necessary and sufficient conditions for a \sigma-ideal I generated by closed sets, under which every Borel function can be restricted to an I-positive Borel set on which it is either 1-1 or constant.
