Weakly dicomplemented lattices are bounded lattices equipped with two unary operations to encode a negation on {\it concepts}. They have been introduced to capture the equational theory of concept algebras \cite{Wi00}. They generalize Boolean algebras. Concept algebras are concept lattices, thus complete lattices, with a weak negation and a weak opposition. A special case of the representation problem for weakly dicomplemented lattices, posed in \cite{Kw04}, is whether complete {\wdl}s are isomorphic to concept algebras. In this contribution we give a negative answer to this question (Theorem \ref{T:main}). We also provide a new proof of a well known result due to M.H. Stone \cite{St36}, saying that {\em each Boolean algebra is a field of sets} (Corollary \ref{C:Stone}). Before these, we prove that the boundedness condition on the initial definition of {\wdl}s (Definition \ref{D:wdl}) is superfluous (Theorem \ref{T:wcl}, see also \cite{Kw09}).
