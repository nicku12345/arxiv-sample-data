Assume that there is no quasi-measurable cardinal smaller than 2^\omega. (\kappa is quasi measurable if there exists \kappa -additive ideal \ci  of subsets of \kappa  such that the Boolean algebra P(\kappa)/\ci satisfies c.c.c.) We show that for a c.c.c. \sigma -ideal I with a Borel base of subsets of an uncountable Polish space, if \cal A is a point-finite family of subsets from I then there is an uncountable collection of pairwise disjoint subfamilies of \cal A whose union is completely nonmeasurable i.e. its intersection with every non-small Borel set does not belong to the \sigma -field generated by Borel sets and the ideal I. This result is a generalization of Four Poles Theorem.
