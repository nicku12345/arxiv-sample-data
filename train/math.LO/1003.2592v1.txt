Every permutation invariant Borel subset of the space of countable structures is definable in \La_{\omega_1\omega} by a theorem of Lopez-Escobar. We prove variants of this theorem relative to fixed relations and fixed non-permutation invariant quantifiers. Moreover we show that for every closed subgroup G of the symmetric group S_{\infty}, there is a closed binary quantifier Q such that the G-invariant subsets of the space of countable structures are exactly the \La_{\omega_1\omega}(Q)-definable sets.
