We define a nontrivial version of the square principle \Box_\omega, which we then show consistent by means of forcing with finite conditions.   This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to the fact that the presented \Box_\omega can be constructed in ZFC, as shown by Lajos Soukup and Philip Welch.   Note, that the forcing itself has not been found flawed.
