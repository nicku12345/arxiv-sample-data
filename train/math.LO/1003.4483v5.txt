This paper presents an account of the first-order logic of Principia Mathematica and preliminary evidence that the system is superior to currently accepted classical rivals. A widely accepted view that Whitehead and Russell's presentation of logic in Principia is essentially defective in departing from contemporary standards is considered. It is shown that the judgement is based on a number of arguments that do not withstand critical scrutiny. For example, the common presumption that the metatheory of contemporary first-order logic may be made precise in the expected way (using a first-order set theory equivalent to NBG) is shown to be false; on pain of contradiction, there cannot exist any such domain of interpretation of NBG. An alternative view of first-order logic, derived from Principia, is then presented. It is shown that Principia avoids the problem just discussed, as the first-order fragment may be made precise under an interpretation of the full system.
