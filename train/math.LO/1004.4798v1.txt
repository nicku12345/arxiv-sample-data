Using Koszmider's strongly unbounded functions, we show the following consistency result:   Suppose that \kappa,\lambda are infinite cardinals such that \kappa^{+++} \leq \lambda, \kappa^{<\kappa}=\kappa and 2^{\kappa}= \kappa^+, and \eta is an ordinal with \kappa^+\leq \eta <\kappa^{++} and cf(\eta) = \kappa^+.   Then, in some cardinal-preserving generic extension there is a superatomic Boolean algebra B such that - ht(B) = \eta + 1, - the cardinality of the \alphath level of B is \kappa for every \alpha <\eta, - and the cardinality of the \etath level of B is \lambda Especially, \<{\omega}\>_{{\omega}_1}\concatenation \<{\omega}_3\> and \<{\omega}_1\>_{{\omega}_2}\concatenation \<{\omega}_4\> can be cardinal sequences of superatomic Boolean algebras.
