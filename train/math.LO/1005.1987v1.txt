In this paper we address a problem: How far can we iterate lower recursively Mahlo operations in higher reflecting universes? Or formally: How much can lower recursively Mahlo operations be iterated in set theories for higher reflecting universes? It turns out that in \Pi_N-reflecting universes the lowest recursively Mahlo operation can be iterated along towers of \Sigma_1-exponential orderings of height N-3, and that all we can do is such iterations. Namely the set theory for \Pi_N-reflecting universes is proof-theoretically reducible to iterations of the operation along such a tower.
