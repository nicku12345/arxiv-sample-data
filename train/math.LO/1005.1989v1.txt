In this note we show that a set is provably \Delta^0_2 in the fragment I\Sigma_n of arithmetic iff it is I\Sigma_n-provably in the class D_\alpha of \alpha-r.e. sets in the Ershov hierarchy for an \alpha <_{\epsilon_0} \omega_{1+n}, where <_{\epsilon_0} denotes a standard \epsilon_0-ordering. In the Appendix it is shown that a limit existence rule (LimR) due to Beklemishev and Visser becomes stronger when the number of nested applications of the inference rule grows.
