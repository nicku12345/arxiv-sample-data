This is part I of a study on cardinals that are characterizable by Scott sentences. Building on [3], [6] and [1] we study which cardinals are characterizable by a Scott sentence \phi, in the sense that \phi characterizes \kappa, if \phi has a model of size \kappa, but no models of size \kappa^+. We show that the set of cardinals that are characterized by a Scott sentence is closed under successors, countable unions and countable products (cf. theorems 2.3, 3.4, and corollary 3.6). We also prove that if \aleph_\alpha is characterized by a Scott sentence, at least one of \aleph_alpha and \aleph_alpha^+ is homogeneously characterizable (cf. definition 1.3 and theorem 2.9). Based on Shelah's [8], we give counterexamples that characterizable cardinals are not closed under predecessors, or cofinalities.
