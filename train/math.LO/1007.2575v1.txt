Bosbach states represent a way of probabilisticly evaluating the formulas from various (commutative or non-commutative) many-valued logics. They are defined on the algebras corresponding to these logics with values in [0,1]. Starting from the observation that in the definition of Bosbach states there intervenes the standard MV-algebra structure of [0,1], in this paper we introduce Bosbach states defined on residuated lattices with values in residuated lattices. We are led to two types of generalized Bosbach states, with distinct behaviours. The properties of generalized Bosbach states, proven in the paper, may serve as an algebraic foundation for developping some probabilistic many-valued logics.   {\bf Keywords}: Bosbach states, residuated lattices, MV-algebras, s-Cauchy completion, metric completion.   {\bf MSC 2010}: Primary 06F35.
