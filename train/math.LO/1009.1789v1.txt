We provide a self-contained introduction to the classical theory of universal-homogeneous models (also known as generic structures, rich models, or Fra\"iss\'e limits). In the literature, most treatments restrict consideration to embeddings among finite structures. This is not suitable for some applications. We take the notion of morphisms as primitive and we allow structures to have arbitrary cardinality.
