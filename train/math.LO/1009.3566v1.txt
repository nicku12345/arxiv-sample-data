We discuss two constructions for obtaining generically stable Keisler measures in an NIP theory. First, we show how to symmetrize an arbitrary invariant measure to obtain a generically stable one from it. Next, we show that suitable sigma-additive probability measures give rise to generically stable measures. Also included is a proof that generically stable measures over o-minimal theories and the p-adics are smooth.
