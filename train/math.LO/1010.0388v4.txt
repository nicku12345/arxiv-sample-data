We give a full solution to the question of existence of indiscernibles in dependent theories by proving the following theorem: for every \theta there is a dependent theory T of size \theta such that for all \kappa and \delta, \kappa\to\left(\delta\right)_{T,1} iff \kappa\to\left(\delta\right)_{\theta}^{<\omega}. This means that unless there are good set theoretical reasons, there are large sets with no indiscernible sequences.
