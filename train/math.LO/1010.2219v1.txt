We generalize the notion of saturated order to infinite partial orders and give both a set-theoretic and an algebraic characterization of such orders. We then study the proof theoretic strength of the equivalence of these characterizations in the context of reverse mathematics, showing that depending on one's choice of definitions it is either provable in \mathsf{RCA}_0 or equivalent to \mathsf{ACA}_0.
