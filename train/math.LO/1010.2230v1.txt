The stable Ramsey's theorem for pairs has been the subject of numerous investigations in mathematical logic. We introduce a weaker form of it by restricting from the class of all stable colorings to subclasses of it that are non-null in a certain effective measure-theoretic sense. We show that the sets that can compute infinite homogeneous sets for non-null many computable stable colorings and the sets that can compute infinite homogeneous sets for all computable stable colorings agree below \emp' but not in general. We also answer the analogs of two well known questions about the stable Ramsey's theorem by showing that our weaker principle does not imply \mathsf{COH} or \mathsf{WKL}_0 in the context of reverse mathematics.
