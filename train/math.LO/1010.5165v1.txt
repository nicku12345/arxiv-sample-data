We show that when certain statements are provable in subsystems of constructive analysis using intuitionistic predicate calculus, related sequential statements are provable in weak classical subsystems. In particular, if a \Pi^1_2 sentence of a certain form is provable using E-HA{}^\omega along with the axiom of choice and an independence of premise principle, the sequential form of the statement is provable in the classical system RCA. We obtain this and similar results using applications of modified realizability and the \textit{Dialectica} interpretation. These results allow us to use techniques of classical reverse mathematics to demonstrate the unprovability of several mathematical principles in subsystems of constructive analysis.
