We compare two different notions of generic expansions of countable saturated structures. One kind of genericity is related to model-companions and to amalgamation constructions \'a la Hrushovski-Fra\"iss\'e. Another notion of generic expansion is defined via topological properties and Baire category theory. The second type of genericity was first formulated by Truss for automorphisms. We work with a later generalization, due to Ivanov, to finite tuples of predicates and functions.
