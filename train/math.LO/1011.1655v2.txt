The theory of valued difference fields (K, \sigma, v) depends on how the valuation v interacts with the automorphism \sigma. Two special cases have already been worked out - the isometric case, where v(\sigma(x)) = v(x) for all x\in K, has been worked out by Luc Belair, Angus Macintyre and Thomas Scanlon; and the contractive case, where v(\sigma(x)) > n\cdot v(x) for all n\in\mathbb{N} and x\in K^\times with v(x) > 0, has been worked out by Salih Azgin. In this paper we deal with a more general version, called the multiplicative case, where v(\sigma(x)) = \rho\cdot v(x), where \rho (> 0) is interpreted as an element of a real-closed field. We give an axiomatization and prove a relative quantifier elimination theorem for such a theory.
