We show that the first order structure whose underlying universe is \mathbb C and whose basic relations are all algebraic subset of \mathbb C^2 does not have quantifier elimination. Since an algebraic subset of \mathbb C ^2 needs either to be of dimension \leq 1 or to have a complement of dimension \leq 1, one can restate the former result as a failure of quantifier elimination for planar complex algebraic curves. We then prove that removing the planarity hypothesis suffices to recover quantifier elimination: the structure with the universe \mathbb C and a predicate for each algebraic subset of \mathbb C^n of dimension \leq 1 has quantifier elimination.
