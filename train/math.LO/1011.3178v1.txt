We answer a question raised by Pillay, that is whether the infinite weight of the generic type of the free group is witnessed in F_{\omega}. We also prove that the set of primitive elements in finite rank free groups is not uniformly definable. As a corollary, we observe that the generic type over the empty set is not isolated. Finally, we show that uncountable free groups are not \aleph_1-homogeneous.
