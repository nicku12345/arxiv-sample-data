We analyze the notion of guessing model, a way to assign combinatorial properties to arbitrary regular cardinals. Guessing models can be used, in combination with inaccessibility, to characterize various large cardinals axioms, ranging from supercompactness to rank-to-rank embeddings. The majority of these large cardinals properties can be defined in terms of suitable elementary embeddings j\colon V_\gamma \to V_\lambda. One key observation is that such embeddings are uniquely determined by the image structures j [ V_\gamma ]\prec V_\lambda. These structures will be the prototypes guessing models. We shall show, using guessing models M, how to prove for the ordinal \kappa_M=j_M (\crit(j_M)) (where \pi_M is the transitive collapse of M and j_M is its inverse) many of the combinatorial properties that we can prove for the cardinal j(\crit(j)) using the structure j[V_\gamma]\prec V_{j(\gamma)}. \kappa_M will always be a regular cardinal, but consistently can be a successor. Guessing models M with \kappa_M=\aleph_2 exist assuming the proper forcing axiom PFA. By means of these models we shall introduce a new structural property of models of PFA: the existence of a "Laver function" f : \aleph_2 \to H_{\aleph_2} sharing the same features of the usual Laver functions f :\kappa\to H_\kappa provided by a supercompact cardinal \kappa. Further applications of our analysis will be proofs of the singular cardinal hypothesis and of the failure of the square principle assuming the existence of guessing models. In particular the failure of square shows that the existence of guessing models is a very strong assumption in terms of large cardinal strength.
