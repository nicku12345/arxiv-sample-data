Let \Gamma be the random bipartite graph, a countable graph with two infinite sides, edges randomly distributed between the sides, but no edges within a side. In this paper, we investigate the reducts of \Gamma that preserve sides. We classify the closed permutation subgroups containing the group Aut(\Gamma)^*, where Aut(\Gamma)^* is the group of all isomorphisms and anti-isomorphisms of \Gamma preserving the two sides. Our results rely on a combinatorial theorem of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"{o}dl and a strong finite submodel property for \Gamma.
