In this paper we review some of the main achievements of the semiring-theoretic approach to MV-algebras initiated and pursued mainly by the present authors and their collaborators. The survey focuses mainly on the connections between MV-algebras and other theories that such a semiringbased approach enabled, and on an application of such a framework to Digital Image Processing. We also give some suggestions for further developments by stating several open problems and possible research lines.
