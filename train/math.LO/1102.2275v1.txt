We study the spectrum of forcing notions between the iterations of \sigma-closed followed by ccc forcings and the proper forcings. This includes the hierarchy of \alpha-proper forcings for indecomposable countable ordinals as well as the Axiom A forcings. We focus on the bounded forcing axioms for the hierarchy of \alpha-proper forcings and connect them to a hierarchy of weak club guessing principles. We show that they are, in a sense, dual to each other. In particular, these weak club guessing principles separate the bounded forcing axioms for distinct countable indecomposable ordinals. In the study of forcings completely embeddable into an iteration of \sigma-closed followed by ccc forcing, we present an equivalent characterization of this class in terms of Baumgartner's Axiom A. This resolves a well-known conjecture of Baumgartner from the 1980's.
