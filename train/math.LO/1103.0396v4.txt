We introduce generalized quantifiers, as defined in Tarskian semantics by Mostowski and Lindstr\"om, in logics whose semantics is based on teams instead of assignments, e.g., IF-logic and Dependence logic. Both the monotone and the non-monotone case is considered.   It is argued that to handle quantifier scope dependencies of generalized quantifiers in a satisfying way the dependence atom in Dependence logic is not well suited and that the multivalued dependence atom is a better choice. This atom is in fact definably equivalent to the \emph{independence atom} recently introduced by V\"a\"an\"anen and Gr\"adel.
