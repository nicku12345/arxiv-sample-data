Using the Gandy -- Harrington topology and other methods of effective descriptive set theory, we prove several theorems on compact and sigma-compact pointsets. In particular we show that any \Sigma^1_1 set A of the Baire space N^N either is covered by a countable union of compact \Delta^1_1 sets, or A contains a subset closed in N^N and homeomorphic to N^N (and then A is not covered by a sigma-compact set, of course).
