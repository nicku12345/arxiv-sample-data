We present a constructive proof of Brouwer's fixed point theorem for uniformly continuous and sequentially locally non-constant functions based on the existence of approximate fixed points. And we will show that Brouwer's fixed point theorem for uniformly continuous and sequentially locally non-constant functions implies Sperner's lemma for a simplex. Since the existence of approximate fixed points is derived from Sperner's lemma, our Brouwer's fixed point theorem is equivalent to Sperner's lemma.
