When R is a non-archimedean real closed field we say that a function f\in R(\bar{X}) is finitary at a point \bar{b}\in R^n if on some neighborhood of \bar{b} the defined values of f are in the finite part of R. In this note we give a characterization of rational functions which are finitary on a set defined by positivity and finiteness conditions. The main novel ingredient is a proof that OVF-integrality has a natural topological definition, which allows us to apply a known Ganzstellensatz for the relevant valuation. We also give some information about the Kochen geometry associated with OVF-integrality.
