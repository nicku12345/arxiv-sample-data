It is proved that every singular cardinal \lambda admits a function RTS:[\lambda^+]^2\rightarrow[\lambda^+]^2 that transforms rectangles into squares. Namely, for every cofinal subsets A,B of \lambda^+, there exists a cofinal subset C of lambda^+, such that RTS[AxB] covers CxC.   When combined with a recent result of Eisworth, this shows that Shelah's notion of strong coloring Pr_1(\lambda^+,\lambda^+,\lambda^+,\cf(\lambda)) coincides with the classical negative partition relation \lambda^+\not\rightarrow[\lambda^+]^2_{\lambda^+}.
