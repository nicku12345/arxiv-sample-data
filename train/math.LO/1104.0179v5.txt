Non-n-ampleness as defined by Pillay and Evans is preserved under analysability. Generalizing this to a more general notion of Sigma-ampleness, we obtain an immediate proof for all simple theories of CHatzidakis weak Canonical Base Property (CBP) for types of finite SU-rank. This is then applied to the special case of groups.
