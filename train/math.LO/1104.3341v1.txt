Given a finitely generated group \Gamma, we study the space {\rm Isom}(\Gamma,{\mathbb Q\mathbb U}) of all actions of \Gamma by isometries of the rational Urysohn metric space {\mathbb Q\mathbb U}, where {\rm Isom}(\Gamma,{\mathbb Q\mathbb U}) is equipped with the topology it inherits seen as a closed subset of {\rm Isom}({\mathbb Q\mathbb U})^\Gamma. When \Gamma is the free group \F_n on n generators this space is just {\rm Isom}({\mathbb Q\mathbb U})^n, but is in general significantly more complicated. We prove that when \Gamma is finitely generated Abelian there is a generic point in {\rm Isom}(\Gamma,{\mathbb Q\mathbb U}), i.e., there is a comeagre set of mutually conjugate isometric actions of \Gamma on {\mathbb Q\mathbb U}.
