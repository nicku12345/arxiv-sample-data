It is proved that any countable index, universally measurable subgroup of a Polish group is open. By consequence, any universally measurable homomorphism from a Polish group into the infinite symmetric group S_\infty is continuous. It is also shown that a universally measurable homomorphism from a Polish group into a second countable, locally compact group is necessarily continuous.
