In a game where both contestants have perfect information, there is a strict limit on how perfect that information can be. By contrast, when one player is deprived of all information, the limit on the other player's information disappears, admitting a hierarchy of levels of lopsided perfection of information. We turn toward the question of when the player with super-perfect information has a winning strategy, and we exactly answer this question for a specific family of lopsided-information games which we call guessing games.
