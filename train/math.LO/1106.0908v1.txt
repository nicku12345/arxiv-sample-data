Assuming that 0^# exists, we prove that there is a structure that can effectively interpret its own jump. In particular, we get a structure \mathcal A such that \[ Sp({\mathcal A}) = \{{\bf x}':{\bf x}\in Sp ({\mathcal A})\}, \] where Sp ({\mathcal A}) is the set of Turing degrees which compute a copy of \mathcal A.   It turns out that, more interesting than the result itself, is its unexpected complexity. We prove that higher-order arithmetic, which is the union of full nth-order arithmetic for all n, cannot prove the existence of such a structure.
