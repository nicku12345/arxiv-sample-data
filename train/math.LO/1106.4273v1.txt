We study maximal orthogonal families of Borel probability measures on 2^\omega (abbreviated m.o. families) and show that there are generic extensions of the constructible universe L in which each of the following holds:   (1) There is a \Delta^1_3-definable well order of the reals, there is a \Pi^1_2-definable m.o. family, there are no \mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2-definable m.o. families and \mathfrak{b}=\mathfrak{c}=\omega_3 (in fact any reasonable value of \mathfrak{c} will do).   (2) There is a \Delta^1_3-definable well order of the reals, there is a \Pi^1_2-definable m.o. family, there are no \mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2-definable m.o. families, \mathfrak{b}=\omega_1 and \mathfrak{c}=\omega_2.
