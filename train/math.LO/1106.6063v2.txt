In reverse mathematics, is is possible to have a curious situation where we know that an implication does not reverse, but appear to have no information on on how to weaken the assumption while preserving the conclusion. A main cause of this phenomenon is the proof of a \Pi^1_2 sentence from the theory {\Pioo}. Using methods based on the functional interpretation, we introduce a family of weakenings of {\Pioo} and use them to give new upper bounds for the Nash-Williams Theorem of wqo theory and Menger's Theorem for countable graphs.
