This paper will develop a single framework for unifying, simplifying and extending our prior results about axiom systems that retain a partial knowledge of their own consistency, via an axiomatic declaration of self-consistency. Its perhaps single most surprising new result will be its exploration of a viable alternative to conventional reflection principles.
