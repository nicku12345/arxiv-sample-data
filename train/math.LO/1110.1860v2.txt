We study generalizations of Demuth's Theorem, which states that the image of a Martin-L\"of random real under a tt-reduction is either computable or Turing equivalent to a Martin-L\"of random real. We show that Demuth's Theorem holds for Schnorr randomness and computable randomness (answering a question of Franklin), but that it cannot be strengthened by replacing the Turing equivalence in the statement of the theorem with wtt-equivalence. We also provide some additional results about the Turing and tt-degrees of reals that are random with respect to some computable measure.
