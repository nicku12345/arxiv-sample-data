This paper is the concise addition to the foregoing work "Inconsistency of Inaccessibility", containing the presentation of main theorem proof (in ZF) about inaccessible cardinals nonexistence. Here some refinement of this presentation is set forth. Much attention is devoted to the explicit and substantial development and cultivation of basic ideas, serving as grounds for all main constructions and reasonings.
