We determine the large cardinal consistency strength of the existence of a \lambda-supercompact cardinal \kappa such that GCH fails at \lambda. Indeed, we show that the existence of a \lambda-supercompact cardinal \kappa such that 2^\lambda \geq \theta is equiconsistent with the existence of a \lambda-supercompact cardinal that is also \theta-tall. We also prove some basic facts about the large cardinal notion of tallness with closure.
