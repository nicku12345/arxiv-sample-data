We answer a question of Moore by building a forcing extension satisfying measuring together with CH. The construction works over any model of ZFC and can be described as a forcing iteration with countable structures as side conditions and with symmetry constraints. Also, we show that a small variation of this construction produces a model of measuring together with the continuum being larger than the second uncountable cardinal.
