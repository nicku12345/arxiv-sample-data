Two uniqueness results on representations of sets constructible in a directed family of sets are given. In the unpackable case, swiss cheese decompositions are unique. In the packable case, they are not unique but admit a quasi-ordering under which the minimal decomposition is unique. Both cases lead to a one-dimensional elimination of imaginaries in VC-minimal and quasi-VC-minimal theories.
