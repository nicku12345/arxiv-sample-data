We use cell decomposition techniques to study additive reducts of p- adic fields. We consider a very general class of fields, including fields with infinite residue fields, which we study using a multi-sorted language. The results are used to obtain cell decomposition results for the case of finite residue fields. We do not require fields to be Henselian, and we allow them to be of any characteristic.
