We introduce a new semantical formalism for logics of imperfect information, based on Game Logic (and, in particular, on van Benthem, Ghosh and Lu's Concurrent Dynamic Game Logic). This new kind of semantics combines aspects from game theoretic semantics and from team semantics, and demonstrates how logics of imperfect information can be seen as languages for reasoning about games.   Finally we show that, for a very expressive fragment of our language, a simpler semantics is available.
