We introduce the notion of normal hyperimaginary and we develop its basic theory. We present a new proof of Lascar-Pillay's theorem on bounded hyperimaginaries based on properties of normal hyperimaginaries. However, the use of Peter-Weyl's theorem on the structure of compact Hausdorff groups is not completely eliminated from the proof. In the second part, we show that all closed sets in Kim-Pillay spaces are equivalent to hyperimaginaries and we use this to introduce an approximation of \varphi-types for bounded hyperimaginaries.
