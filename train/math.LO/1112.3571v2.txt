We prove that the statement `For all Borel ideals I and J on \omega, every isomorphism between Boolean algebras P(\omega)/I and P(\omega)/J has a continuous representation' is relatively consistent with ZFC. In this model every isomorphism between P(\omega)/I and any other quotient P(\omega)/J over a Borel ideal is trivial for a number of Borel ideals I on \omega.   We can also assure that the dominating number is equal to \aleph_1 and that 2^{\aleph_1}>2^{\aleph_0}. Therefore the Calkin algebra has outer automorphisms while all automorphisms of P(\omega)/Fin are trivial.   Proofs rely on delicate analysis of names for reals in a countable support iteration of suslin proper forcings.
