In an extended abstract Ressayre considered real closed exponential fields and integer parts that respect the exponential function. He outlined a proof that every real closed exponential field has an exponential integer part. In the present paper, we give a detailed account of Ressayre's construction, which becomes canonical once we fix the real closed exponential field, a residue field section, and a well ordering of the field. The procedure is constructible over these objects; each step looks effective, but may require many steps. We produce an example of an exponential field R with a residue field k and a well ordering < such that D^c(R) is low and k and < are \Delta^0_3, and Ressayre's construction cannot be completed in L_{\omega_1^{CK}}.
