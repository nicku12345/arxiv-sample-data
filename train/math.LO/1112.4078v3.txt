We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomially bounded o-minimal expansion of a real closed field (in a language of arbitrary cardinality) to be \aleph_{\alpha}-saturated. The conditions are in terms of the value group, residue field, and pseudo- Cauchy sequences of the natural valuation on the real closed field. This is achieved by an analysis of types, leading to the trichotomy. Our characterization provides a construction method for saturated models, using fields of generalized power series.
