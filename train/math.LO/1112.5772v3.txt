We prove that the strong polarized relation of \theta above \omega applied simultaneously for every cardinal in the interval [\aleph_1,\aleph] is consistent. We conclude that this positive relation is consistent for every cardinal invariant on the continuum. We show that similar results hold for a supercompact cardinal, and for a strong limit singular under some assumptions.
