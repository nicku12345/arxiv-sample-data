We consider natural \Sigma^1_2 definable analogues of many of the classical statements that have been shown to be equivalent to CH. It is shown that these \Sigma^1_2 analogues are equivalent to that all reals are constructible. We also prove two partition relations for \Sigma^1_2 colourings which hold precisely when there is a non-constructible real.
