We define a reasonably well-behaved class of ultraimaginaries, i.e.\ classes modulo invariant equivalence relations, called {\em tame}, and establish some basic simplicity-theoretic facts. We also show feeble elimination of supersimple ultraimaginaries: If e is an ultraimaginary definable over a tuple a with SU(a)<\omega^{\alpha+1}, then e is eliminable up to rank <\omega^\alpha. Finally, we prove some uniform versions of the weak canonical base property.
