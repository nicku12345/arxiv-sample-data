Under MA we prove that for the ideal \cal I of thin sets on \omega and for any ordinal \gamma \leq \omega_1 there is an {\cal I}-ultrafilter (in the sense of Baumgartner), which belongs to the class {\cal P}_{\gamma} of P-hierarchy of ultrafilters. Since the class of {\cal P}_2 ultrafilters coincides with a class of P-points, out result generalize theorem of Fla\v{s}kov\'a, which states that there are {\cal I}-ultrafilters which are not P-points. It is also related to theorem which states that under CH for any tall P-ideal \cal I on \omega there is an {\cal I}-ultrafilter, however the ideal of thin sets is not P-ideal.
