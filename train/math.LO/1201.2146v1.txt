We investigate mutual behavior of cascades, contours of which are contained in a fixed ultrafilter. Using that relation we prove (ZFC) that the class of strict J_{\omega^\omega}-ultrafilters, introduced by J. E. Baumgartner in \textit{Ultrafilters on \omega}, is empty. We translate the result to the language of <_\infty-sequences under an ultrafilter, investigated by C. Laflamme in \textit{A few special ordinal ultrafilters}, to show that if there is an arbitrary long finite <_\infty-sequence under u than u is at least strict J_{\omega^{\omega+1}}- ultrafilter.
