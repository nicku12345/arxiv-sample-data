Assume L(\mathbb{R},\mu) satisfies ZF+DC+\Theta>\omega_2 + \mu is a normal fine measure on \powerset_{\omega_1}(\mathbb{R}). The main result of this paper is the characterization theorem of L(\mathbb{R},\mu) which states that L(\mathbb{R},\mu) satisfies \Theta>\omega_2 if and only if L(\mathbb{R},\mu) satisfies AD^+. As a result, we obtain the equiconsistency between the two theories: "ZFC + there are \omega^2 Woodin cardinals" and "ZF+DC+\mu is a normal fine measure on \powerset_{\omega_1}(\mathbb{R}) + \Theta>\omega_2".
