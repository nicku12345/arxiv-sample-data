We present some results about generics for computable Mathias forcing. The n-generics and weak n-generics in this setting form a strict hierarchy as in the case of Cohen forcing. We analyze the complexity of the Mathias forcing relation, and show that if G is any n-generic with n \geq 3 then it satisfies the jump property G^{(n-1)} = G' \oplus \emptyset^{(n)}. We prove that every such G has generalized high degree, and so cannot have even Cohen 1-generic degree. On the other hand, we show that G, together with any bi-immune set A \leq_T \emptyset^{(n-1)}, computes a Cohen n-generic set.
