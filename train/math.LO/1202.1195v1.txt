Notions of asimulation and k-asimulation introduced in [Olkhovikov, 2011] are extended onto the level of predicate logic. We then prove that a first-order formula is equivalent to a standard translation of an intuitionistic predicate formula iff it is invariant with respect to k-asimulations for some k, and then that a first-order formula is equivalent to a standard translation of an intuitionistic predicate formula iff it is invariant with respect to asimulations. Finally, it is proved that a first-order formula is equivalent to a standard translation of an intuitionistic predicate formula over a class of intuitionistic models (intuitionistic models with constant domain) iff it is invariant with respect to asimulations between intuitionistic models (intuitionistic models with constant domain).
