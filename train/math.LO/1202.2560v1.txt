A generic computation of a subset A of the natural numbers consists of a a computation that correctly computes most of the bits of A, and which never incorrectly computes any bits of A, but which does not necessarily give an answer for every input. The motivation for this concept comes from group theory and complexity theory, but the purely recursion theoretic analysis proves to be interesting, and often counterintuitive. The primary result of this paper is that there are no minimal pairs for generic computability, answering a question of Jockusch and Schupp.
