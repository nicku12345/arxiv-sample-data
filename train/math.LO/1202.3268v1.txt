Thomason \cite{Thomason74} showed that a certain modal logic \mathbf{L}\subset \mathbf{S4} is incomplete with respect to Kripke semantics. Later Gerson \cite{Gerson75} showed that \mathbf{L} is also incomplete with respect to neighborhood semantics. In this paper we show that \mathbf{L} is in fact incomplete with respect to any class of complete Boolean algebras with operators, i.e. that it is completely incomplete.
