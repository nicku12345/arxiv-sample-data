Following Bezhanishvili & Vosmaer, we confirm a conjecture of Yde Venema by piecing together results from various authors. Specifically, we show that if \mathbb{A} is a residually finite, finitely generated modal algebra such that \operatorname{HSP}(\mathbb{A}) has equationally definable principal congruences, then the profinite completion of \mathbb{A} is isomorphic to its MacNeille completion, and \Diamond is smooth. Specific examples of such modal algebras are the free \mathbf{K4}-algebra and the free \mathbf{PDL}-algebra.
