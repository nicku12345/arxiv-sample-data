This article is based on the talk of the same name which I gave at the "Aspects of Descriptive Set Theory" RIMS Symposium in Kyoto in October 2011; it is essentially just a survey of my article "Indestructibility of Vopenka's Principle". In particular, I present (with a sketch of the proof) a forcing indestructibility theorem for the large cardinal axiom Vopenka's Principle. It is notable in that there is no preparatory forcing required to make the axiom indestructible, unlike other indestructibility results.
