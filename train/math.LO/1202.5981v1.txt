We study [0,1]-valued logics that are closed under the {\L}ukasiewicz-Pavelka connectives; our primary examples are the the continuous logic framework of Ben Yaacov and Usvyatsov \cite{Ben-Yaacov-Usvyatsov:2010} and the {\L}ukasziewicz-Pavelka logic itself. The main result of the paper is a characterization of these logics in terms of a model-theoretic property, namely, an extension of the omitting types theorem to uncountable languages.
