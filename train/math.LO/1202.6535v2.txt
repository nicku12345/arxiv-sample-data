A first-order theory T has the Schr\"oder-Bernstein (SB) property if any pair of elementarily bi-embeddable models are isomorphic. We prove that T has an expansion by constants that has the SB property if and only if T is superstable and non-multidimensional. We also prove that among superstable theories T, the class of a-saturated models of T has the SB property if and only if T has no nomadic types.
