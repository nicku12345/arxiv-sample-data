In this paper it is shown that the class \mathcal{PCSL}^{ec} of existentially closed pseudocomplemented semilattices is finitely axiomatizable by appropriately extending the finite axiomatization of the class \mathcal{\mathcal{PCSL}}^{ac} of algebraically closed pseudocomplemented semilattices presented in Rupp, Addler, and Schmid. Because \mathcal{PCSL}^{ec} coincides with the model companion of the class \mathcal{PCSL} of pseudocomplemented semilattices this addendum to Rupp, Addler, and Schmid solves the problem posed by Albert and Burris in the final paragraph of their paper: "Does the class of pseudocomplemented semilattices have a finitely axiomatizable model companion?"
