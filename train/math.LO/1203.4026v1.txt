The dream solution of the continuum hypothesis (CH) would be a solution by which we settle the continuum hypothesis on the basis of a newly discovered fundamental principle of set theory, a missing axiom, widely regarded as true. Such a dream solution would indeed be a solution, since we would all accept the new axiom along with its consequences. In this article, however, I argue that such a dream solution to CH is unattainable.   The article is adapted from and expands upon material in my article, "The set-theoretic multiverse", to appear in the Review of Symbolic Logic (see arXiv:1108.4223).
