Unlike Martin-L\"of randomness and Schnorr randomness, computable randomness has not been defined, except for a few ad hoc cases, outside of Cantor space. This paper offers such a definition (actually, several equivalent definitions), and further, provides a general method for abstracting "bit-wise" definitions of randomness from Cantor space to arbitrary computable probability spaces. This same method is also applied to give machine characterizations of computable and Schnorr randomness for computable probability spaces, extending the previously known results. The paper contains a new type of randomness---endomorphism randomness---which the author hopes will shed light on the open question of whether Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness is equivalent to Martin-L\"of randomness. The last section contains ideas for future research.
