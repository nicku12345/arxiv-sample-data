As the class of pseudocomplemented semilattices is a universal Horn class generated by a single finite structure it has a \aleph_0-categorical model companion. We will construct the countable existentially closed pseudocomplemented semilattice which is the uniquely determined model of cardinality \aleph_0 of the model companion as a direct limit of algebraically closed pseudocomplemented semilattices.
