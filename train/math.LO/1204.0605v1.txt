The aim of our paper is to prove the Triple Representation Theorem, which was established by Jen\v{c}a in the setting of complete lattice effect algebras, for a special class of homogeneous effect algebras, namely TRT-effect algebras. This class includes complete lattice effect algebras, sharply dominating Archimedean atomic lattice effect algebras and homogeneous orthocomplete effect algebras.
