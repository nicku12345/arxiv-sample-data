The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we thoroughly study the set of meager elements M(E), the set of sharp elements S(E) and the center C(E) in the setting of meager-orthocomplete homogeneous effect algebras E. Second, we prove the Triple Representation Theorem for sharply dominating meager-orthocomplete homogeneous effect algebras, in particular orthocomplete homogeneous effect algebras.
