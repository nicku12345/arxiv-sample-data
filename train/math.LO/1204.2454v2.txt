For integers l \geq 2, d \geq 1 we study (undirected) graphs with vertices 1, ..., n such that the vertices can be partitioned into l parts such that every vertex has at most d neighbours in its own part. The set of all such graphs is denoted \mbP_n(l,d). We prove a labelled first-order limit law, i.e., for every first-order sentence \varphi, the proportion of graphs in \mbP_n(l,d) that satisfy \varphi converges as n \to \infty. By combining this result with a result of Hundack, Pr\"omel and Steger \cite{HPS} we also prove that if 1 \leq s_1 \leq ... \leq s_l are integers, then \mb{Forb}(\mcK_{1, s_1, ..., s_l}) has a labelled first-order limit law, where \mb{Forb}(\mcK_{1, s_1, ..., s_l}) denotes the set of all graphs with vertices 1, ..., n, for some n, in which there is no subgraph isomorphic to the complete (l+1)-partite graph with parts of sizes 1, s_1, ..., s_l. In the course of doing this we also prove that there exists a first-order formula \xi (depending only on l and d) such that the proportion of \mcG \in \mbP_n(l,d) with the following property approaches 1 as n \to \infty: there is a unique partition of \{1, ..., n\} into l parts such that every vertex has at most d neighbours in its own part, and this partition, viewed as an equivalence relation, is defined by \xi.
