We consider a set \mbK = \bigcup_{n \in \mbbN}\mbK_n of {\em finite} structures such that all members of \mbK_n have the same universe, the cardinality of which approaches \infty as n\to\infty. Each structure in \mbK may have a nontrivial underlying pregeometry and on each \mbK_n we consider a probability measure, either the uniform measure, or what we call the {\em dimension conditional measure}. The main questions are: What conditions imply that for every extension axiom \varphi, compatible with the defining properties of \mbK, the probability that \varphi is true in a member of \mbK_n approaches 1 as n \to \infty? And what conditions imply that this is not the case, possibly in the strong sense that the mentioned probability approaches 0 for some \varphi?   If each \mbK_n is the set of structures with universe {1, ..., n}, in a fixed relational language, in which certain "forbidden" structures cannot be weakly embedded and \mbK has the disjoint amalgamation property, then there is a condition (concerning the set of forbidden structures) which, if we consider the uniform measure, gives a dichotomy; i.e. the condition holds if and only if the answer to the first question is `yes'. In general, we do not obtain a dichotomy, but we do obtain a condition guaranteeing that the answer is `yes' for the first question, as well as a condition guaranteeing that the answer is `no'; and we give examples showing that in the gap between these conditions the answer may be either `yes' or `no'. This analysis is made for both the uniform measure and for the dimension conditional measure. The later measure has closer relation to random generation of structures and is more "generous" with respect to satisfiability of extension axioms.
