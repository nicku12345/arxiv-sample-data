The space of Lascar strong types, on some sort and relative to a given first order theory T, is in general not a compact Hausdorff space. This paper has at least three aims. First to show that spaces of Lascar strong types and other related spaces such as the Lascar group, have well-defined Borel cardinalities. The second is to compute the Borel cardinalities of the known examples as well as some new examples. The third is to explore notions of definable map, embedding and isomorphism between these and related quotient objects. The motivation for writing this paper is the recent discovery, via definable groups, of new examples of non G-compact first order theories.
