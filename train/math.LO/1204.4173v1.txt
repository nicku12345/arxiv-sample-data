M. E. Rudin in "Partial orders on the types of \beta {N}", (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 155, 1971, 353-362) proved (under CH) that for each P-point u there is a P-point v such that v>_{RK}u. A. Blass in "Rudin - Kisler ordering on P-points" (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 179, 1973, 145-166) improved that theorem assuming MA in the place of CH, in that paper he also proved that under MA each RK-increasing sequence of P-points is upper bounded by a P-point. We improve Blass results simultaneously in 3 directions - we prove it for each class of index \geq 2 of P-hierarchy (P-points coincidence with a class P_2 of P-hierarchy), assuming \mathfrak{b}=\mathfrak{c} in the place of MA and we show that there are at least \mathfrak{b} many Rudin-Kisler incomparable such upper bounds.
