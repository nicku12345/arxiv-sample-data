We use ideas from topological dynamics (amenability), combinatorics (structural Ramsey theory) and model theory (Fra\" {i}ss\' e limits) to study closed amenable subgroups G of the symmetric group S_\infty of a countable set, where S_\infty has the topology of pointwise convergence. We construct G-invariant measures on the universal minimal flows associated with these groups G in, moreover, an algorithmic manner. This leads to an identification of the generic elements, in the sense of being Martin-L\" of random, of these flows with respect to the constructed invariant measures. Along these lines we study the random elements of S_\infty, which are permutations that transform recursively presented universal structures into such structures which are Martin-L\" of random.
