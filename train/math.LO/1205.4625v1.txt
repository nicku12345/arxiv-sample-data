In [Mon11] are studied, for the axiomatic extensions of the monoidal t-norm based logic ([EG01]), the properties of single chain completeness. On the other side, in [GJKO07, Chapter 5] are studied many logical and algebraic properties (like Halld\'en completeness, variable separation properties, amalgamation property etc.), in the context of substructural logics. The aim of this paper is twofold: first of all we will specialize the properties studied in [GJKO07, Chapter 5] from the case of substructural logics to the one of extensions of MTL, by obtaining some general characterization. Moreover we will show that some of these properties are indeed strictly connected to the topics developed in [Mon11]. This will help to have a better intuition concerning some open problems of [Mon11].
