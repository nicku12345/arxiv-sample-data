We present a system of axioms motivated by a topological intuition: The set of subsets of any set is a topology on that set. On the one hand, this system is a common weakening of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ZF, the positive set theory GPK and the theory of hyperuniverses. On the other hand, it retains most of the expressiveness of these theories and has the same consistency strength as ZF. We single out the additional axiom of the universal set as the one that increases the consistency strength to that of GPK and explore several other axioms and interrelations between those theories. Our results are independent of whether the empty class is a set and whether atoms exist.   This article is a revised version of the first part of the author's doctoral thesis.
