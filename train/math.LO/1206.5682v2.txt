We prove that, for every theory T which is given by an {\mathcal L}_{\omega_1,\omega} sentence, T has less than 2^{\aleph_0} many countable models if and only if we have that, for every X\in 2^\omega on a cone of Turing degrees, every X-hyperarithmetic model of T has an X-computable copy. We also find a concrete description, relative to some oracle, of the Turing-degree spectra of all the models of a counterexample to Vaught's conjecture.
