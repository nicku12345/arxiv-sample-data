Assume a complete superstable theory is superstable, and let P be a class of regular types, typically closed under automorphisms of the monster and non-orthogonality. We define the notion of P-NDOP and prove the existence of P-decompositions and derive an analog of Sh401 for superstable theories with P-NDOP. In this context, we also find a sufficient condition on P-decompositions that imply non-isomorphic models. For this, we investigate natural structures on the types in P\intersect S(M) modulo non-orthogonality.
