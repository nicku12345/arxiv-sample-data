Let A be an infinite set. Let \Omega(A) be the algebra over A where every constant is a fundamental constant and every finitary function is a fundamental operation. We shall give a method of representing any algebra \mathcal{L} in the variety generated by \Omega(A) as limit reduced powers and even direct limits of limit reduced powers of \mathcal{L}. If the algebra \mathcal{L} is elementarily equivalent to \Omega(A), then this construction represents \Omega(A) as a limit ultrapower and also as direct limits of limit ultrapowers of \Omega(A). This method therefore gives a method of representing Boolean ultrapowers and other generalizations of the ultrapower construction as limit ultrapowers and direct limits of limit ultrapowers.
