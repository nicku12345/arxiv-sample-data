The classical condition "\phi is a semantic consequence of \Theta" in infinite-valued propositional \L ukasiewicz logic \L_\infty is refined using enriched valuations that take into account the effect on \phi of the stability of the truth-value of all \theta\in \Theta under small perturbations (or, measurement errors) of the models of \Theta. The differential properties of the functions represented by \phi and by all \theta\in \Theta naturally lead to a new notion of semantic consequence \models_\partial that turns out to coincide with syntactic consequence \vdash.
