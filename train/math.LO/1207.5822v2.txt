Under the assumption that \delta is a Woodin cardinal and \GCH holds, I show that if F is any class function from the regular cardinals to the cardinals such that (1) \kappa<\cf(F(\kappa)), (2) \kappa<\lambda implies F(\kappa)\leq F(\lambda), and (3) \delta is closed under F, then there is a cofinality-preserving forcing extension in which 2^\gamma= F(\gamma) for each regular cardinal \gamma<\delta, and in which \delta remains Woodin. Unlike the analogous results for supercompact cardinals [Men76] and strong cardinals [FH08], there is no requirement that the function F be locally definable.
