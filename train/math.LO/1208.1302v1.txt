We investigate the behaviour of concepts from dependent theories when applied to real closed fields. Our main focus is on the concept of perpendicular indiscernible sequences, a concept first introduced in section 4 of math.LO/0009056 .   This is essentially the MSc. thesis of the first author written under he guidance of the second author.
