We show that the theory of the non-standard Frobenius automorphism, acting on an algebraically closed valued field of equal characteristic 0, is NTP2. More generally, in the contractive as well as in the isometric case, we prove that a sigma-henselian valued difference field of equicharacteristic 0 is NTP2, provided both the residue difference field and the value group (as an ordered difference group) are NTP2.
