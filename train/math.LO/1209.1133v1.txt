We show that, assuming GCH, if \kappa is a Ramsey or a strongly Ramsey cardinal and F is a class function on the regular cardinals having a closure point at \kappa and obeying the constraints of Easton's theorem, namely, F(\alpha)\leq F(\beta) for \alpha\leq\beta and \alpha<\cf(F(\alpha)), then there is a cofinality preserving forcing extension in which \kappa remains Ramsey or strongly Ramsey respectively and 2^\delta=F(\delta) for every regular cardinal \delta.
