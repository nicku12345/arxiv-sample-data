Given a Woodin cardinal \delta, I show that if F is any Easton function with F"\delta\subseteq\delta and \GCH holds, then there is a cofinality-preserving forcing extension in which 2^\gamma= F(\gamma) for each regular cardinal \gamma<\delta, and in which \delta remains Woodin.   I also present a new example in which forcing a certain behavior of the continuum function on the regular cardinals, while preserving a given large cardinal, requires large cardinal strength beyond that of the original large cardinal under consideration. Specifically, I prove that the existence of a \lambda-supercompact cardinal \kappa such that \GCH fails at \lambda is equiconsistent with the existence of a cardinal \kappa that is \lambda-supercompact and \lambda^{++}-tall.   I generalize a theorem on measurable cardinals due to Levinski, which says that given a measurable cardinal, there is a forcing extension preserving the measurability of \kappa in which \kappa is the least regular cardinal at which \GCH holds. Indeed, I show that Levinski's result can be extended to many other large cardinal contexts. This work paves the way for many additional results, analogous to the results stated above for Woodin cardinals and partially supercompact cardinals.
