Posner and Robinson (1981) proved that if S \subseteq \omega is non-computable, then there exists a G \subseteq \omega such that S \oplus G \geq_T G'. Shore and Slaman (1999) extended this result to all n \in \omega, by showing that if S \nleq_T \emptyset^{(n-1)} then there exists a G such that S \oplus G \geq_T G^{(n)}. Their argument employs Kumabe-Slaman forcing, and so the set they obtain, unlike that of the Posner-Robinson theorem, is not generic for Cohen forcing in any way. We answer the question of whether this is a necessary complication by showing that for all n \geq 1, the set G of the Shore-Slaman theorem cannot be chosen to be even weakly 2-generic. Our result applies to several other effective forcing notions commonly used in computability theory, and we also prove that the set G cannot be chosen to be 2-random.
