Working with uncountable structures of fixed cardinality, we investigate the complexity of certain equivalence relations and show that if V = L, then many of them are \Sigma^1_1-complete, in particular the isomorphism relation of dense linear orders.   Then we show that it is undecidable in ZFC whether or not the isomorphism relation of a certain well behaved theory (stable, NDOP, NOTOP) is \Sigma^1_1-complete (it is, if V = L, but can be forced not to be).
