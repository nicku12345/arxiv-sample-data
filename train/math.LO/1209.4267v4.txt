A. Miller proved the consistent existence of a coanalytic two-point set, Hamel basis and MAD family. In these cases the classical transfinite induction can be modified to produce a coanalytic set. We generalize his result formulating a condition which can be easily applied in such situations. We reprove the classical results and as a new application we show that in V=L there exists an uncountable coanalytic subset of the plane that intersects every C^1 curve in a countable set.
