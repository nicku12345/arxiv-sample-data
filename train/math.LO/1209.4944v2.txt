This paper analyzes theorems about algebraic field extensions using the techniques of reverse mathematics. In section 2, we show that \mathsf{WKL}_0 is equivalent to the ability to extend F-automorphisms of field extensions to automorphisms of \bar{F}, the algebraic closure of F. Section 3 explores finitary conditions for embeddability. Normal and Galois extensions are discussed in section 4, and the Galois correspondence theorems for infinite field extensions are treated in section 5.
