For half a century, authors have weakened the rule of necessitation in various more or less ad hoc ways in order to make inconsistent systems consistent. More recently, necessitation was weakened in a systematic way, not for the purpose of resolving paradoxes but rather to salvage the deduction theorem for modal logic. We show how this systematic weakening can be applied to the older problem of paradox resolution. Four examples are given: a predicate symbol S4 consistent with arithmetic; a resolution of the surprise examination paradox; a resolution of Fitch's paradox; and finally, the construction of a knowing machine which knows its own code. We discuss a technique for possibly finding answers to a question of P. \'Egr\'e and J. van Benthem.
