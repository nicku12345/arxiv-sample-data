The ample hierarchy of geometries of stables theories is strict. We generalise the construction of the free pseudospace to higher dimensions and show that the n-dimensional free pseudospace is \omega-stable n-ample yet not (n+1)-ample. In particular, the free pseudospace is not 3-ample. A thorough study of forking is conducted and an explicit description of canonical bases is exhibited.
