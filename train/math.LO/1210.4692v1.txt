Pseudorandmness plays an important role in number theory, complexity theory and cryptography. Our aim is to use models of arithmetic to explain pseudorandomness by randomness. To this end we construct a set of models \cal M, a common element \iota of these models and a probability distribution on \cal M, such that for every pseudorandom sequence s, the probability that s(\iota)=1 holds true in a random model from \cal M is equal to 1/2.
