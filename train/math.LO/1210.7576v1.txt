In this paper we consider two types of dimension that can be defined for products of one-dimensional topologically totally transcendental (t.t.t) structures. The first is topological and considers the interior of projections of the set onto lower dimensional products. The second one is based on algebraic dependence. We show that these definitions are equivalent for \omega -saturated one-dimensional t.t.t structures. We also prove that sets which are dense in products of these structures are comeager.
