We say that binary relation E on a space X is a clopen graph on X iff E is symmetric and irreflexive and clopen relative to X x X minus its diagonal. Equivalently for distinct x, y in X there are open sets U,V with (x,y) in U x V and either U x V a subset of E or U x V a subset of E complement.   For clopen graphs E_1 and E_2 on the Baire space (omega^omega) we say that E_1 continuously reduces to E_2 iff there is a continuous map f from the Baire space to itself such that for   [(x,y) in E_1 iff (f(x),f(y)) in E_2 ] for distinct x,y. Note that f need not be one-to-one but there should be no edges in the preimage of a point. If f is a homeomorphism to its image, then we say that E_1 continuously embeds into E_2.   Theorem. There does not exist countably many clopen graphs on the Baire space such that every clopen graph on the Baire space continuously reduces to one of them. However there does exists omega_1 clopen graphs on such that every clopen graph continuously embedds into one of them.   This answers a question of Stefan Geschke.
