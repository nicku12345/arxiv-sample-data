We study aleph_0-stable theories, and prove that if T either has eni-DOP or is eni-deep, then its class of countable models is Borel complete. We introduce the notion of lambda-Borel completeness and prove that such theories are lambda-Borel complete. Using this, we conclude that an aleph_0-stable theory has 2^lambda pairwise non-L(infinity,aleph_0) equivalent models of size lambda for all infinite cardinals lambda if and only if T either has eni-DOP or is eni-deep.
