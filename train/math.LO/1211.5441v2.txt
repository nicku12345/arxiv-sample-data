We indicate a way of distinguishing between structures, for which, two structures are said to be separable.Being separable implies being non-isomorphic. We show that for any first order theory T in a countable language, if it has an uncountable set of countable models that are pairwise separable, then actually it has such a set of size 2^{\aleph_0}. Our result follows trivially assuming the Continuum Hypothesis (CH). We work here in ZFC (only without CH).
