We let R be an o-minimal expansion of a field, V a convex subring, and (R_0, V_{0}) an elementary substructure of (R,V). We let L be the language consisting of a language for R, in which R has elimination of quantifiers, and a predicate for V, and we let L_{R_{0}} be the language L expanded by constants for all elements of R_0. Our main result is that (R,V) considered as an L_{R_{0}}-structure is model complete provided that k_R, the corresponding residue field with structure induced from R, is o-minimal. Along the way we show that o-minimality of k_R implies that the sets definable in k_R are the same as the sets definable in k with structure induced from (R,V). We also give a criterion for a superstructure of (R,V) being an elementary extension of (R,V).
