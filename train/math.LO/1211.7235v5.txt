We classify the groups definable in the coloured fields obtained by Hrushovski amalgamation. A group definable in the bad green field is isogenous to the quotient of a subgroup of an algebraic group by a Cartesian power of the group of green elements. A definable subgroup of an algebraic group in the green or red field is an extension of the coloured points of a multiplicative or additive algebraic group by an algebraic group. In particular, a simple group in a coloured field is algebraic.
