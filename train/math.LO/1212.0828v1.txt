An open question in reverse mathematics is whether the cohesive principle, \COH, is implied by the stable form of Ramsey's theorem for pairs, \SRT^2_2, in \omega-models of \RCA. One typical way of establishing this implication would be to show that for every sequence \vec{R} of subsets of \omega, there is a set A that is \Delta^0_2 in \vec{R} such that every infinite subset of A or \bar{A} computes an \vec{R}-cohesive set. In this article, this is shown to be false, even under far less stringent assumptions: for all natural numbers n \geq 2 and m < 2^n, there is a sequence \vec{R} = \sequence{R_0,...,R_{n-1}} of subsets of \omega such that for any partition A_0,...,A_{m-1} of \omega arithmetical in \vec{R}, there is an infinite subset of some A_j that computes no set cohesive for \vec{R}. This complements a number of previous results in computability theory on the computational feebleness of infinite sets of numbers with prescribed combinatorial properties. The proof is a forcing argument using an adaptation of the method of Seetapun showing that every finite coloring of pairs of integers has an infinite homogeneous set not computing a given non-computable set.
