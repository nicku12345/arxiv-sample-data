This paper studies the transfinite propositional provability logics \glp_\Lambda and their corresponding algebras. These logics have for each ordinal \xi< \Lambda a modality \la \alpha \ra. We will focus on the closed fragment of \glp_\Lambda (i.e., where no propositional variables occur) and \emph{worms} therein. Worms are iterated consistency expressions of the form \la \xi_n\ra \ldots \la \xi_1 \ra \top. Beklemishev has defined well-orderings <_\xi on worms whose modalities are all at least \xi and presented a calculus to compute the respective order-types.   In the current paper we present a generalization of the original <_\xi orderings and provide a calculus for the corresponding generalized order-types o_\xi. Our calculus is based on so-called {\em hyperations} which are transfinite iterations of normal functions.   Finally, we give two different characterizations of those sequences of ordinals which are of the form \la {\formerOmega}_\xi (A) \ra_{\xi \in \ord} for some worm A. One of these characterizations is in terms of a second kind of transfinite iteration called {\em cohyperation.}
