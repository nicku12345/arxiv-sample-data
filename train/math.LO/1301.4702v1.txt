This thesis analyses extenders in fine structural mice. Kunen showed that in the inner model for one measurable cardinal, there is a unique measure. This result is generalized, in various ways, to mice below a superstrong cardinal.   The analysis is then used to show that certain tame mice satisfy V=\mathsf{HOD}. In particular, the approach proides a new proof of this result for the inner model M_n for n Woodin cardinals. It is also shown that in M_n, all homogeneously Suslin sets of reals are \mathbf{\Delta}^1_{n+1}.
