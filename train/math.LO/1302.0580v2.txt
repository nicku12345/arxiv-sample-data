We study the relative complexity of equivalence relations and preorders from computability theory and complexity theory. Given binary relations R, S, a componentwise reducibility is defined by  R\le S \iff \ex f \, \forall x, y \, [xRy \lra f(x) Sf(y)].  Here f is taken from a suitable class of effective functions. For us the relations will be on natural numbers, and f must be computable. We show that there is a \Pi_1-complete equivalence relation, but no \Pi k-complete for k \ge 2.   We show that \Sigma k preorders arising naturally in the above-mentioned areas are \Sigma k-complete. This includes polynomial time m-reducibility on exponential time sets, which is \Sigma 2, almost inclusion on r.e.\ sets, which is \Sigma 3, and Turing reducibility on r.e.\ sets, which is \Sigma 4.
