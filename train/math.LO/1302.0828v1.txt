In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of work in reverse mathematics concerning natural mathematical principles that are provable from \RT, Ramsey's Theorem for Pairs. These principles tend to fall outside of the "big five" systems of reverse mathematics and a complicated picture of subsystems below \RT has emerged. In this paper, we answer two open questions concerning these subsystems, specifically that \ADS is not equivalent to \CAC and that \EM is not equivalent to \RT.
