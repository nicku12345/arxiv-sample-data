We prove completeness, interpolation, decidability and an omitting types theorem for certain multi dimensional modal logics where the states are not abstract entities but have an inner structure. The states will be sequences. Our approach is algebraic addressing (varieties generated by) complex algebras of Kripke semantics for such logic. Those algebras, whose elements are sets of states are common reducts of cylindric and polyadic algebras
