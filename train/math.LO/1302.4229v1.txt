The model-theoretic Grothendieck ring of a first order structure, as defined by Krajic\v{e}k and Scanlon, captures some combinatorial properties of the definable subsets of finite powers of the structure. In this paper we compute the Grothendieck ring, K_0(M_\mathcal R), of a right R-module M, where \mathcal R is any unital ring. As a corollary we prove a conjecture of Prest that K_0(M) is non-trivial, whenever M is non-zero. The main proof uses various techniques from the homology theory of simplicial complexes.
