We show that Shelah's Eventual Categoricity Conjecture follows from the existence of class many strongly compact cardinals. This is the first time the consistency of this conjecture has been proven. We do so by showing that every AEC with LS(K) below a strongly compact cardinal \kappa is < \kappa tame and applying the categoricity transfer of Grossberg and VanDieren. These techniques also apply to measurable and weakly compact cardinals and we prove similar tameness results under those hypotheses. We isolate a dual property to tameness, called \emph{type shortness}, and show that it follows similarly from large cardinals.
