We prove that \RCA + \RRT^3_2 \not\vdash \ACA where \RRT^3_2 is the Rainbow Ramsey Theorem for 2-bounded colorings of triples. This reverse mathematical result is based on a cone avoidance theorem, that every 2-bounded coloring of pairs admits a cone-avoiding infinite rainbow, regardless of the complexity of the given coloring. We also apply the proof of the cone avoidance theorem to the question whether \RCA + \RRT^4_2 \vdash \ACA and obtain some partial answer.
