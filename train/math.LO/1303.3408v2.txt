Constructive theories usually have interesting metamathematical properties where explicit witnesses can be extracted from proofs of existential sentences. For relational theories, probably the most natural of these is the existence property, EP, sometimes referred to as the set existence property. This states that whenever (\exists x)\phi(x) is provable, there is a formula \chi(x) such that (\exists ! x)\phi(x) \wedge \chi(x) is provable. It has been known since the 80's that EP holds for some intuitionistic set theories and yet fails for IZF. Despite this, it has remained open until now whether EP holds for the most well known constructive set theory, CZF. In this paper we show that EP fails for CZF.
