We show that an analogue of the Hilbert's Thirteenth Problem fails in the real subanalytic setting.Namely we prove that, for any integer n, the o-minimal structure generated by restricted analytic functions in n variables is strictly smaller than the structure of all global subanalytic sets, whereas these two structures define the same subsets in \mathbb R ^{n+1}.
