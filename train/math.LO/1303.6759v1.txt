The theory of fields that are equipped with a countably infinite family of commuting derivations is not companionable; but if the axiom is added whereby the characteristic of the fields is zero, then the resulting theory is companionable. Each of these two theories is the union of a chain of companionable theories. In the case of characteristic zero, the model-companions of the theories in the chain form another chain, whose union is therefore the model-companion of the union of the original chain. However, in a signature with predicates, in all finite numbers of arguments, for linear dependence of vectors, the two-sorted theory of vector-spaces with their scalar-fields is companionable, and it is the union of a chain of companionable theories, but the model-companions of the theories in the chain are mutually inconsistent. Finally, the union of a chain of non-companionable theories may be companionable.
