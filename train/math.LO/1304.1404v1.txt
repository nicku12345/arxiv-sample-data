We prove the celebrated representation theorem of Andreka-Resek-Thompson, together with its polyadic analogue by Ferenczi, using games as introduced in algebraic logic by Hirsch and Hodkinson. We also show that atomic algebras are completely representable and that all such varieties of relativized set algebras have the strong amalgmation property.
