Extending a deep result of Andreka and Nemeti, we show that unlike the dimension complemented case, there are weak set quasi-polyadic simple algebras of dimension >1, that are finitely genertaed with more than one element, but cannot be generated with a single element. We give a contrasting result for polyadic agebras of infinite dimension.
