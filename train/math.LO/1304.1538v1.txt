We study different representation theorems for various reducts of Heyting polyadic algebras. Superamalgamation is proved for several (natural reducts) and our results are compared to the finitizability problem in classical algebraic logic dealing with cylindric and polyadic (Boolean algebras). We also prove several new neat embedding theorems, and obtain that the class of representable algebras based on (a generalized) Kripke semantics coincide with the class of algebras having the neat embedding property, that is those algebras that are subneat reducts of algebras having \omega extra dimensions.
