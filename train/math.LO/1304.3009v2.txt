By using nonstandard analysis, and in particular iterated hyper-extensions, we give foundations to a peculiar way of manipulating ultrafilters on the natural numbers and their pseudo-sums. The resulting formalism is suitable for applications in Ramsey theory of numbers. To illustrate the use of our technique, we give a (rather) short proof of Milliken-Taylor's Theorem, and a ultrafilter version of Rado's theorem about partition regularity of diophantine equations.
