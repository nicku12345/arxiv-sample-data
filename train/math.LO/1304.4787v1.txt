We show that a natural, two sorted \cL_{\omega_1,\omega} theory involving the modular j-function is categorical in all uncountable cardinaities. It is also shown that a slight weakening of the adelic Mumford-Tate conjecture for products of elliptic curves is necessary and (along with a couple of other results from arithmetic geometry) sufficient for categoricity.
