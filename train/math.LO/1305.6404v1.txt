In this note we consider an arbitrary families of sets of s_0 ideal introduced by Marczewski-Szpilrajn. We show that in any uncountable Polish space X and under some combinatorial and set theoretical assumptions (cov(s_0)=\c for example), that for any family \ca\subseteq s_0 with \bigcup\ca =X, we can find a some subfamily \ca'\subseteq\ca such that the union \bigcup\ca' is not s-measurable. We have shown a consistency of the cov(s_0)=\omega_1<\c and existence a partition of the size \omega_1 \ca\in [s_0]^{\omega} of the real line \bbr, such that there exists a subfamily \ca'\subseteq\ca for which \bigcup\ca' is s-nonmeasurable. We also showed that it is relatively consistent with ZFC theory that \omega_1<\c and existence of m.a.d. family \ca such that \bigcup\ca is s-nonmeasurable in Cantor space 2^\omega or Baire space \omega^\omega. The consistency of a<cov(s_0) and cov(s_0)<a is proved also.
