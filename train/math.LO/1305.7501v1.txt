Kikyo and Shelah showed that if T is a theory with the Strict Order Property in some first-order language \mathcal{L}, then in the expanded language \mathcal{L}_\sigma := \mathcal{L}\cup\{\sigma\} with a new unary function symbol \sigma, the bigger theory T_\sigma := T\cup\{``\sigma \mbox{is an} \mathcal{L}\mbox{-automorphism''}\} does not have a model companion. We show in this paper that if, however, we restrict the automorphism and consider the theory T_\sigma as the base theory T together with a ``restricted'' class of automorphisms, then T_\sigma can have a model companion in \mathcal{L}_\sigma. We show this in the context of linear orders and ordered abelian groups.
