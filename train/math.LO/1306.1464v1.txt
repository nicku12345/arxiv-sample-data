We prove the result in the title. We infer, that unlike cylindric algebras, there is a first order axiomatization of the class of completely representable polyadic algebras of infinite dimension, though the one we obtain is infinite; in fact uncountable, but shares a single schema, stipulating that the (uncountably many)substitution operators are completely additive. Similar results are obtained for non commutative reducts of polyadic equality algebras of infinite dimensions, where we can drop complete additivity. However, it remains unknown to us whether there are atomic polyadic algebras of infinite dimension that are not completely additive; but we strongly conjecture that there are.
