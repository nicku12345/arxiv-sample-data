We prove, in ZF+\bf\Sigma^1_2-determinacy, that for any analytic equivalence relation E, the following three statements are equivalent: (1) E does not have perfectly many classes, (2) E satisfies hyperarithmetic-is-recursive on a cone, and (3) relative to some oracle, for every equivalence class [Y]_E we have that a real X computes a member of the equivalence class if and only if \om_1^X\geq\om_1^{[Y]}.   We also show that the implication from (1) to (2) is equivalent to the existence of sharps over ZF.
