We give foundational results for the model theory of the ring of finite adeles over a number field, construed as a restricted product of local fields. In contrast to Weispfenning we work in the language of ring theory, and various sortings interpretable therein. In particular we give a systematic treatment of the product valuation and the valuation monoid. Deeper results are given for the adelic version of Krasner's hyperfields, relating them to the Basarab-Kuhlmann formalism.
