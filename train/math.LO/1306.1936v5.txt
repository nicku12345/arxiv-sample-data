We show that many principles of first-order arithmetic, previously only known to lie strictly between \Sigma_1-induction and \Sigma_2-induction, are equivalent to the well-foundedness of \omega^\omega.   Among these principles are the iteration of partial functions (P\Sigma_1) of H\'ajek and Paris, the bounded monotone enumerations principle (non-iterated, BME_1) by Chong, Slaman, and Yang, the relativized Paris-Harrington principle for pairs, and the totality of the relativized Ackermann-P\'eter function.   With this we show that the well-foundedness of \omega^\omega is a far more widespread than usually suspected.   Further, we investigate the k-iterated version of the bounded monotone iterations principle (BME_k), and show that it is equivalent to the well-foundedness of the k+1-height \omega-tower.
