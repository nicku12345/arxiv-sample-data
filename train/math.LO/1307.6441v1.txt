It is shown the construction of a module structure [2] with universe over a set of a particular kind of mathematical proofs, the base ring of this module will be built on a maximal consistent extension of a set of propositions, this provides the possibility to do some linear algebra on proofs. It will also be presented an algorithmic proceeding in order to deal with these particular type of deductions.
