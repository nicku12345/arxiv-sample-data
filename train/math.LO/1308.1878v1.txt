Residuated lattices play an important role in the study of fuzzy logic based of t-norm. In this paper, we introduced the notions of n-fold implicative filters, n-fold positive implicative filters, n-fold boolean filters, n-fold fantastic filters, n-fold normal filters and n-fold obstinate filters in residuated lattices and study the relations among them. This generalized the similar existing results in BL-algebra with the connection of the work of Kerre and all in [14], Kondo and all in [7], [11] and Motamed and all in [9]. At the end of this paper, we draw two diagrams; the first one describe the relations between some type of n-fold filters in residuated lattices and the second one describe the relations between some type of n-fold residuated lattices.
