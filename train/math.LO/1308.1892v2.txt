Quasiminimal pregeometry classes were introduces by Zilber [2005a] to isolate the model theoretical core of several interesting examples. He proves that a quasiminimal pregeometry class satisfying an additional axiom, called excellence, is categorical in all uncountable cardinalities. Recently Bays et al. [2014] showed that excellence follows from the rest of axioms. In this paper we present a direct proof of the categoricity result without using excellence.
