We characterize all profinite MV-algebras, these are MV-algebras that are inverse limits of finite MV-algebras. It is shown that these are exactly direct product of finite \L ukasiewicz's chains. We also prove that the category \mathbb{M} of multisets is dually equivalent to the category \mathbb{P} of profinite MV-algebras and homomorphisms that reflect principal maximal ideals. Thus generalizing the corresponding result for finite MV-algebras, and finite multisets.
