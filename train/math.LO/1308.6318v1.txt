This report consists of two parts. The first part is a brief exposition of classical descriptive set theory. This part introduces some fundamental concepts, motivations and results from the classical theory and ends with a section on the important result of Addison that established the correspondence between classical and effective notions. The second part is about invariant descriptive set theory. It consists of a brief introduction to notions relevant to this branch of descriptive set theory and then describes in details some of the relatively recent results concerning equivalence relations between Polish metric spaces.
