We initiate a deep study of {\em Riesz MV-algebras} which are MV-algebras endowed with a scalar multiplication with scalars from [0,1]. Extending Mundici's equivalence between MV-algebras and \ell-groups, we prove that Riesz MV-algebras are categorically equivalent with unit intervals in Riesz spaces with strong unit. Moreover, the subclass of norm-complete Riesz MV-algebras is equivalent with the class of commutative unital C^*-algebras. The propositional calculus {\mathbb R}{\cal L} that has Riesz MV-algebras as models is a conservative extension of \L ukasiewicz \infty-valued propositional calculus and it is complete with respect to evaluations in the standard model [0,1]. We prove a normal form theorem for this logic, extending McNaughton theorem for \L ukasiewicz logic. We define the notions of quasi-linear combination and quasi-linear span for formulas in {\mathbb R}{\cal L} and we relate them with the analogue of de Finetti's coherence criterion for {\mathbb R}{\cal L}.
