We show that the number of types of sequences of tuples of a fixed length can be calculated from the number of 1-types and the length of the sequences. Specifically, if \kappa \leq \lambda, then \sup_{|A| = \lambda} |S^\kappa(A)| = (\sup_{|A| = \lambda} |S^1(A)|)^\kappa We show that this holds for any abstract elementary class with \lambda amalgamation, but it is new for first order theories when \kappa is infinite. No such calculation is possible for nonalgebraic types. We introduce a generalization of nonalgebraic types for which the same upper bound holds.
