In this thesis three topics on the model theory of partial differential fields are considered: the generalized Galois theory for partial differential fields, geometric axioms for the theory of partial differentially closed fields, and the existence and properties of the model companion of the theory of partial differential fields with an automorphism. The approach taken here to these subjects is to relativize the algebro geometric notions of prolongation and D-variety to differential notions with respect to a fixed differential structure.
