The concepts of a conditional set, a conditional inclusion relation and a conditional Cartesian product are introduced. The resulting conditional set theory is sufficiently rich in order to construct a conditional topology, a conditional real and functional analysis indicating the possibility of a mathematical discourse based on conditional sets. It is proved that the conditional power set is a complete Boolean algebra, and a conditional version of the axiom of choice, the ultrafilter lemma, Tychonoff's theorem, the Borel-Lebesgue theorem, the Hahn-Banach theorem, the Banach-Alaoglu theorem and the Krein-\v{S}mulian theorem are shown.
