In this paper, we introduce several classes of Prikry-type forcing notions, two of which are used to produce minimal generic extensions, and the third is applied in \alpha-recursion theory to produce minimal covers. The first forcing as a warm up yields a minimal generic extension at a measurable cardinal (in V), the second at an \omega-limit of measurable cardinals \langle\gamma_n\colon n<\omega\rangle such that each \gamma_n (n>0) carries \gamma_{n-1}-many normal measures. Via a notion of V_\gamma -degree (see Definition \ref{def:vgammadegree}), we transfer the second Prikry-type construction for minimal generic extensions to a construction for minimal degrees in \alpha-recursion theory. More explicitly, \begin{theorem*} Suppose \langle\gamma_n\colon n<\omega\rangle is a strictly increasing sequence of measurable cardinals such that for each n>0, \gamma_n carries at least \gamma_{n-1}-many normal measures. Let \gamma=\sup\{\gamma_n\colon n<\omega\}. %Then for each n, \gamma is \Sigma_n-admissible. Then there is an A\subset\gamma such that \begin{itemize} \item[(a)] (L_{\gamma},\in,A) is not admissible. \item[(b)] The \gamma-degree that contains A has a minimal cover. \end{itemize} \end{theorem*}
