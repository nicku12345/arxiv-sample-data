The main result of the present paper is that \mathfrak a_g, the minimal size of maximal cofinitary group, can be of countable cofinality. To prove this we define a natural poset for adding a maximal cofinitary group of a given cardinality, which enjoys certain combinatorial properties allowing it to be used within a similar template forcing construction. Additionally we obtain that \mathfrak a_p, the minimal size of a maximal family of almost disjoint permutations, and \mathfrak a_e, the minimal size of a maximal eventually different family, can be of countable cofinality.
