We introduce an analog to the notion of Polish space for spaces of weight \leq\kappa, where \kappa is an uncountable regular cardinal such that \kappa^{<\kappa}=\kappa. Specifically, we consider spaces in which player II has a winning strategy in a variant of the strong Choquet game which runs for \kappa many rounds. After discussing the basic theory of these games and spaces, we prove that there is a surjectively universal such space and that there are exactly 2^\kappa many such spaces up to homeomorphism. We also establish a Kuratowski-like theorem that under mild hypotheses, any two such spaces of size >\kappa are isomorphic by a \kappa-Borel function. We then consider a dynamic version of the Choquet game and show that in this case the existence of a winning strategy for player II implies the existence of a winning tactic, that is, a strategy that depends only on the most recent move. We also study a generalization of Polish ultrametric spaces where the ultrametric is allowed to take values in a set of size \kappa. We show that in this context, there is a family of universal Urysohn-type spaces, and we give a characterization of such spaces which are hereditarily \kappa-Baire.
