We work with a finite relational vocabulary with at least one relation symbol with arity at least 2. Fix any integer m > 1. For almost all finite structures (labelled or unlabelled) such that at least m elements are moved by some automorphisms, the automorphism group is (Z_2)^i for some i \leq (m+1)/2; and if some relation symbol has arity at least 3, then the automorphism group is almost always Z_2.
