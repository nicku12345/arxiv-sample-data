It is a celebrated result of McKinsey and Tarski [28] that S4 is the logic of the closure algebra X+ over any dense-in-itself separable metrizable space. In particular, S4 is the logic of the closure algebra over the reals R, the rationals Q, or the Cantor space C. By [5], each logic above S4 that has the finite model property is the logic of a subalgebra of Q+, as well as the logic of a subalgebra of C+. This is no longer true for R, and the main result of [5] states that each connected logic above S4 with the finite model property is the logic of a subalgebra of the closure algebra R+. In this paper we extend these results to all logics above S4. Namely, for a normal modal logic L, we prove that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) L is above S4, (ii) L is the logic of a subalgebra of Q+, (iii) L is the logic of a subalgebra of C+. We introduce the concept of a well-connected logic above S4 and prove that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) L is a well-connected logic, (ii) L is the logic of a subalgebra of the closure algebra T_2^+ over the infinite binary tree, (iii) L is the logic of a subalgebra of the closure algebra L_2^+ over the infinite binary tree with limits equipped with the Scott topology. Finally, we prove that a logic L above S4 is connected iff L is the logic of a subalgebra of R+, and transfer our results to the setting of intermediate logics.
