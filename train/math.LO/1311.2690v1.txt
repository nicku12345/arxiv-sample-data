Let \mathbf{A} be a finite algebra generating a finitely decidable variety and having nontrivial strongly solvable radical \tau. We provide an improved bound on the number of variables in which a term can be sensitive to changes within \tau. We utilize a multi-sorted algebraic construction, amalgamating the methods developed by Valeriote and McKenzie for the investigation of strongly abelian locally finite decidable varieties with those of Idziak for locally finite congruence modular finitely decidable varieties.
