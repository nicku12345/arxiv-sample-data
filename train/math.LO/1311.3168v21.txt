In this article we present an axiomatic definition of sets with individuals and a definition of natural numbers and ordinals. We use the axioms pairs, union, regularity and separation of standard set theory. We define the equality of sets and of individuals. There is no empty set. A single shoe is not a set but an individual, a pair of shoes is a set. We call limit ordinals first numbers, that is a first number of the Peano axioms. Then the axiom of infinity is postulated and we prove the Peano axioms for ordinals with a first number up to a first \omega^\omega-number.
