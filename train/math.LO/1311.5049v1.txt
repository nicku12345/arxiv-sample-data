We study the partial orderings of the form \langle {\mathbb P} ({\mathbb X}), \subset \rangle , where {\mathbb X} is a binary relational structure with the connectivity components isomorphic to a strongly connected structure {\mathbb Y} and {\mathbb P} ({\mathbb X}) is the set of (domains of) substructures of {\mathbb X} isomorphic to {\mathbb X}. We show that, for example, for a countable {\mathbb X}, the poset \langle {\mathbb P} ({\mathbb X}), \subset \rangle  is either isomorphic to a finite power of {\mathbb P} ({\mathbb Y}) or forcing equivalent to a separative atomless \sigma-closed poset and, consistently, to P(\omega )/Fin. In particular, this holds for each ultrahomogeneous structure {\mathbb X} such that {\mathbb X} or {\mathbb X} ^c is a disconnected structure and in this case {\mathbb Y} can be replaced by an ultrahomogeneous connected digraph.
