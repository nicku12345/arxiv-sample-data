In this paper we define the Boolean Lifting Property (BLP) for residuated lattices to be the property that all Boolean elements can be lifted modulo every filter, and study residuated lattices with BLP. Boolean algebras, chains, local and hyperarchimedean residuated lattices have BLP. BLP behaves interestingly in direct products and involutive residuated lattices, and it is closely related to arithmetic properties involving Boolean elements, nilpotent elements and elements of the radical. When BLP is present, strong representation theorems for semilocal and maximal residuated lattices hold.
