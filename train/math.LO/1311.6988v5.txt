IIn the context of a weak formal theory called Basic Intuitionistic Mathematics \mathsf{BIM}, we study Brouwer's Fan Theorem and a strong negation of the Fan Theorem, Kleene's Alternative (to the Fan Theorem). We prove that the Fan Theorem is equivalent to contrapositions of a number of intuitionistically accepted axioms of countable choice and that Kleene's Alternative is equivalent to strong negations of these statements. We also discuss finite and infinite games and introduce a constructively useful notion of determinacy. We prove that the Fan Theorem is equivalent to the Intuitionistic Determinacy Theorem, saying that every subset of Cantor space is, in our constructively meaningful sense, determinate, and show that Kleene's Alternative is equivalent to a strong negation of a special case of this theorem. We then consider a uniform intermediate value theorem and a compactness theorem for classical propositional logic, and prove that the Fan Theorem is equivalent to each of these theorems and that Kleene's Alternative is equivalent to strong negations of them. We end with a note on a possibly important statement, provable from principles accepted by Brouwer, that one might call a Strong Fan Theorem.
