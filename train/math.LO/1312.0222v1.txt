We study asymmetric regular types. If \frak p is regular and A-asymmetric then there exists a strict order such that Morley sequences in \frak p over A are strictly increasing (we allow Morley sequences to be indexed by elements of a linear order). We prove that for all M\supseteq A maximal Morley sequences in \frak p over A consisting of elements of M have the same (linear) order type, denoted by \Inv_{\frak p,A}(M), which does not depend on the particular choice of the order witnessing the asymmetric regularity. In the countable case we determine all possibilities for \Inv_{\frak p,A}(M): either it can be any countable linear order, or in any M\supseteq A it is a dense linear order (provided that it has at least two elements). Then we study relationship between \Inv_{\frak p,A}(M) and \Inv_{\frak q,A}(M) when \frak p and \frak q are strongly regular, A-asymmetric, and such that \frak p_{\strok A} and \frak q_{\strok A} are not weakly orthogonal. We distinguish two kinds on non-orthogonality: bounded and unbounded. In the bounded case we prove that \Inv_{\frak p,A}(M) and \Inv_{\frak q,A}(M) are either isomorphic or anti-isomorphic. In the unbounded case, \Inv_{\frak p,A}(M) and \Inv_{\frak q,A}(M) may have distinct cardinalities but we prove that their Dedekind completions are either isomorphic or anti-isomorphic. We provide examples of all four situations.
