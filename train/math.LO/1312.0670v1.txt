We prove that the satisfaction relation \mathcal{N}\models\varphi[\vec a] of first-order logic is not absolute between models of set theory having the structure \mathcal{N} and the formulas \varphi all in common. Two models of set theory can have the same natural numbers, for example, and the same standard model of arithmetic \langle\mathbb{N},{+},{\cdot},0,1,{\lt}\rangle, yet disagree on their theories of arithmetic truth; two models of set theory can have the same natural numbers and the same arithmetic truths, yet disagree on their truths-about-truth, at any desired level of the iterated truth-predicate hierarchy; two models of set theory can have the same natural numbers and the same reals, yet disagree on projective truth; two models of set theory can have the same \langle H_{\omega_2},{\in}\rangle or the same rank-initial segment \langle V_\delta,{\in}\rangle, yet disagree on which assertions are true in these structures.   On the basis of these mathematical results, we argue that a philosophical commitment to the determinateness of the theory of truth for a structure cannot be seen as a consequence solely of the determinateness of the structure in which that truth resides. The determinate nature of arithmetic truth, for example, is not a consequence of the determinate nature of the arithmetic structure \mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\ldots\} itself, but rather, we argue, is an additional higher-order commitment requiring its own analysis and justification.
