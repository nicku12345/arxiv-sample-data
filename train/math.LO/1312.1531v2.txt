We investigate the statement that the Lebesgue measure defined on all subsets of the Cantor space exists. As base system we take \mathsf{ACA}_0^\omega + (\mu). The system \mathsf{ACA}_0^\omega is the higher order extension of Friedman's system \mathsf{ACA}_0, and (\mu) denotes Feferman's \mu, that is a uniform functional for arithmetical comprehension defined by f(\mu(f))=0 if \exists n f(n)=0 for f\in \mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}.   Feferman's \mu will provide countable unions and intersections of sets of reals and is, in fact, equivalent to this. For this reasons \mathsf{ACA}_0^\omega + (\mu) is the weakest fragment of higher order arithmetic where \sigma-additive measures are directly definable.   We obtain that over \mathsf{ACA}_0^\omega + (\mu) the existence of the Lebesgue measure is \Pi^1_2-conservative over \mathsf{ACA}_0^\omega and with this conservative over \mathsf{PA}. Moreover, we establish a corresponding program extraction result.
