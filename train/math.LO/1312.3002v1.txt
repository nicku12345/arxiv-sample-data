We consider the constructive ordinal notation system for the ordinal {\epsilon_0} that were introduced by L.D. Beklemishev. There are fragments of this system that are ordinal notation systems for the smaller ordinals {\omega_n} (towers of {\omega}-exponentiations of the height n). This systems are based on Japaridze's provability logic \mathbf{GLP}. They are closely related with the technique of ordinal analysis of \mathbf{PA} and fragments of \mathbf{PA} based on iterated reflection principles. We consider this notation system and it's fragments as structures with the signatures selected in a natural way. We prove that the full notation system and it's fragments, for ordinals {\ge\omega_4}, have undecidable elementary theories. We also prove that the fragments of the full system, for ordinals {\le\omega_3}, have decidable elementary theories. We obtain some results about decidability of elementary theory, for the ordinal notation systems with weaker signatures.
