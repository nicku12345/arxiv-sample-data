We define and we characterize regular and c-regular cyclically ordered abelian groups. We prove that every dense c-regular cyclically ordered abelian group is elementarily equivalent to some cyclically ordered group of unimodular complex numbers, that every discrete c-regular cyclically ordered abelian group is elementarily equivalent to some ultraproduct of finite cyclic groups, and that the discrete regular non-c-regular cyclically ordered abelian groups are elementarily equivalent to the linearly cyclically ordered group of integers.
