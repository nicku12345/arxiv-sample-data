Let n be finite >2. We show that any class between S\Nr_n\CA_{n+3} and RCA_n is not atom canonical, and any class containing the class of completely representable algebras and contained in S_c\Nr_n\CA_{n+3} is not elementary. We show that there is no finite variable universal axiomatization of many diagonal free reducts of representable cylindric algebras of dimension n, like the varieties of representable diagonal-free cylindric algebras and Halmos' polyadic algebras (without equality). We apply our hitherto obtained algebraic results to show that the omitting types theorem fails for finite variable fragments of first order logic with and without equality, having n variables, even if we count in severely relativized models as candidates for omitting single non-principle types. Finally, we show that for many cylindric-like algebras, like diagonal free cylindric algebras and Halmos' polyadic algebras with and without equality the class of strongly representable atom structures of finite dimension >2 is not elementary.
