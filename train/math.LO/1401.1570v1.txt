For n\geq 3, define T_n to be the theory of the generic K_n-free graph, where K_n is the complete graph on n vertices. We prove a graph theoretic characterization of dividing in T_n, and use it to show that forking and dividing are the same for complete types. We then give an example of a forking and nondividing formula. Altogether, T_n provides a counterexample to a recent question of Chernikov and Kaplan.
