We prove field quantifier elimination for valued fields endowed with both an analytic structure and an automorphism that are \sigma-Henselian. From this result we can deduce various Ax-Kochen-Ersov type results with respect to completeness and the NIP property. The main example we are interested in is the field of Witt vectors on the algebraic closure of \mathbb{F}_{p} endowed with its natural analytic structure and the lifting of the Frobenius. It turns out we can give a (reasonable) axiomatization of its first order theory and that this theory is NIP.
