We characterize model theoretic properties of the Urysohn sphere as a metric structure in continuous logic. In particular, our first main result shows that the theory of the Urysohn sphere is \text{SOP}_n for all n\geq 3, but does not have the fully finite strong order property. Our second main result is a geometric characterization of dividing independence in the theory of the Urysohn sphere. We further show that this characterization satisfies the extension axiom, and so forking and dividing are the same for complete types. Our results require continuous analogs of several tools and notions in classification theory. While many of these results are undoubtedly known to researchers in the field, they have not previously appeared in publication. Therefore, we include a full exposition of these results for general continuous theories.
