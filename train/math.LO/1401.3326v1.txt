We explicitly present expansions of the complex field which are models of the theories of green points in the multiplicative group case and in the case of an elliptic curve without complex multiplication defined over \mathbb{R}. In fact, in both cases we give families of structures depending on parameters and prove that they are all models of the theories, provided certain instances of Schanuel's conjecture or an analogous conjecture for the exponential map of the elliptic curve hold. In the multiplicative group case, however, the results are unconditional for generic choices of the parameters.
