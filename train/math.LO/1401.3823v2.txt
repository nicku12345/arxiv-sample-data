We prove that the statement "there is a k such that for every f there is a k-bounded diagonally non-recursive function relative to f" does not imply weak K\"onig's lemma over \mathrm{RCA}_0 + \mathrm{B}\Sigma^0_2. This answers a question posed by Simpson. A recursion-theoretic consequence is that the classic fact that every k-bounded diagonally non-recursive function computes a 2-bounded diagonally non-recursive function may fail in the absence of \mathrm{I}\Sigma^0_2.
