First, an example of a 2-dependent group without a minimal subgroup of bounded index is given. Second, all infinite n-dependent fields are shown to be Artin-Schreier closed. Furthermore, the theory of any non separably closed PAC field has the IPn property for all natural numbers n and certain properties of dependent (NIP) valued fields extend to the n-dependent context.
