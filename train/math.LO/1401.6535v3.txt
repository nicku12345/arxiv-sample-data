Keisler proved that if \theta is a strong limit cardinal and \lambda is a singular cardinal, then the transfer relation \theta\longrightarrow\lambda holds. In a previous paper, we studied initial elementary submodels of the \lambda-like models produced in the proof of Keisler's transfer theorem when \theta is further assumed to be regular i.e., \theta is strongly inaccessible. In this paper we deal with a much more difficult situation. Some years ago Ali Enayat asked the author whether Keisler's singular-like models can have elementary end extensions. We give a positive answer to this question.
