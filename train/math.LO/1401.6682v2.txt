We study first-order as well as infinitary logics extended with quantifiers closed upwards under embeddings. In particular, we show that if a chain of quasi-homogeneous structures is sufficiently long then a given formula of such a logic is eventually equivalent to a quantifier-free formula in that chain. We use this fact to produce a number of undefinability results for logics with embedding-closed quantifiers. In the final section we introduce an Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e game that characterizes the L-equivalence between structures, where L is the infinitary logic L_{\infty \omega} extended with all embedding-closed quantifiers. In conclusion, we provide an application of this game illustrating its use.
