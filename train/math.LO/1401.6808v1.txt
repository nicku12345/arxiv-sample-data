We prove that it is consistent relative to a Mahlo cardinal that all sets of reals definable from countable sequences of ordinals are Lebesgue measurable, but at the same time, there is a \Delta^1_3 set without the Baire property. To this end, we introduce a notion of stratified forcing and stratified extension and prove an iteration theorem for these classes of forcings. Moreover we introduce a variant of Shelah's amalgamation technique that preserves stratification. The complexity of the set which provides a counterexample to the Baire property is optimal.
