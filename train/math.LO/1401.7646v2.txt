We propose a uniform way of defining for every logic {\sf L} intermediate between intuitionistic and classical logics, the corresponding intermediate minimal tense logic {\sf LK_t}. This is done by building the fusion of two copies of intermediate logic with a Galois connection {\sf LGC}, and then interlinking their operators by two Fischer Servi axioms. The resulting system is called here {\sf L2GC{+}FS}. In the cases of intuitionistic logic {\sf Int} and classical logic {\sf Cl}, it is noted that {\sf Int2GC{+}FS} is syntactically equivalent to intuitionistic minimal tense logic {\sf IK_t} by W. B. Ewald and {\sf Cl2GC{+}FS} equals classical minimal tense logic {\sf K_t}. This justifies to consider {\sf L2GC{+}FS} as minimal {\sf L}-tense logic {\sf LK_t} for any intermediate logic {\sf L}. We define H2GC+FS-algebras as expansions of HK1-algebras, introduced by E. Orlowska and I. Rewitzky. For each intermediate logic {\sf L}, we show algebraic completeness of {\sf L2GC{+}FS} and its conservativeness over {\sf L}. We prove relational completeness of {\sf Int2GC{+}FS} with respect to the models defined on {\sf IK}-frames introduced by G. Fischer Servi. We also prove a representation theorem stating that every H2GC+FS-algebra can be embedded into the complex algebra of its canonical {\sf IK}-frame.
