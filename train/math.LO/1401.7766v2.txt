In this paper we investigate the connections between Ramsey properties of Fraisse classes K and the universal minimal flow M(G_K) of the automorphism group G_K of their Fraisse limits. As an extension of a result of Kechris, Pestov and Todorcevic we show that if the class K has finite Ramsey degree for embeddings, then this degree equals the size of M(G_K). We give a partial answer to a question of Angel, Kechris and Lyons showing that if K is a relational Ramsey class and G_K is amenable, then M(G_K) admits a unique invariant Borel probability measure that is concentrated on a unique generic orbit.
