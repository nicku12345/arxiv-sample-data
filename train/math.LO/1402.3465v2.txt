In this paper, we prove a definable version of Kirszbraun's theorem in a non-Archimedean setting for definable families of functions in one variable. More precisely, we prove that every definable function f : X \times Y \to \mathbb{Q}_p^s, where X\subset \mathbb{Q}_p and Y \subset \mathbb{Q}_p^r, that is \lambda-Lipschitz in the first variable, extends to a definable function \tilde{f}:\mathbb{Q}_p\times Y \to \mathbb{Q}_p^s that is \lambda-Lipschitz in the first variable.
