Topological cylindric algebras of dimension \alpha, \alpha any ordinal are cylindric algebras with dimension \alpha expanded with \alpha S4 modalities. The S4 modalities in representable algebras are induced by a topology on the base of the representation of its cylindric reduct, that is not necessarily an Alexandrov topolgy. For \alpha>2, the class of representable algebras is a variety that is not axiomatized by a finite schema, and in fact all complexity results on representations for cylindric algebras, proved by Andreka (concerning number of variables needed for axiomatizations) Hodkinson (on Sahlqvist axiomatizations and canonicity) and others, transfer to the topological addition, by implementing a very simple procedure of `discretely topologizing a cylindric algebra' Given a cylindric algebra of dimension \alpha, one adds \alpha many interior identity operations, the latter algebra is representable as a topological cylindric algebra if and only if the former is; the representation induced by the discrete topology.   In this paper we investigate amalgamation properties for various classes of topological cylindric algebras of all dimensions. We recover, in the topological context, all of the results proved by Andreka, Comer Madarasz, Nemeti, Pigozzi, Sain, Sayed Ahmed, Sagi, Shelah, Simon, and others for cylindric algebras and much more.
