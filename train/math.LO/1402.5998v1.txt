We study what we call topological cylindric algebras and tense cylindric algebras defined for every ordinal \alpha. The former are cylindric algebras of dimension \alpha expanded with \sf S4 modalities indexed by \alpha. The semantics of representable topological algebras is induced by the interior operation relative to a topology defined on their bases. Tense cylindric algebras are cylindric algebras expanded by the modalities F(future) and P (past) algebraising predicate temporal logic.   We show for both tense and topological cylindric algebras of finite dimension n>2 that infinitely many varieties containing and including the variety of representable algebras of dimension n are not atom canonical. We show that any class containing the class of completely representable algebras having a weak neat embedding property is not elementary. From these two results we draw the same conclusion on omitting types for finite variable fragments of predicate topologic and temporal logic. We show that the usual version of the omitting types theorem restricted to such fragments when the number of variables is >2 fails dramatically even if we considerably broaden the class of models permitted to omit a single non principal type in countable atomic theories, namely, the non-principal type consting of co atoms.
