In this paper we investigate the fragment of intuitionistic logic which only uses conjunction (meet) and implication, using finite duality for distributive lattices and universal models. We give a description of the finitely generated universal models of this fragment and give a complete characterization of the up-sets of Kripke models of intuitionistic logic which can be defined by meet-implication-formulas. We use these results to derive a new version of subframe formulas for intuitionistic logic and to show that the uniform interpolants of meet-implication-formulas are not necessarily uniform interpolants in the full intuitionistic logic.
