For any MV-algebra A we equip the set I(A) of intervals in A with pointwise \L ukasiewicz negation \neg x=\{\neg \alpha\mid \alpha\in x\}, (truncated) Minkowski sum, x\oplus y=\{\alpha\oplus \beta\mid \alpha \in x,\,\,\beta\in y\}, pointwise \L ukasiewicz conjunction x\odot y=\neg(\neg x\oplus \neg y), the operators \Delta x=[\min x,\min x], \nabla x=[\max x,\max x], and distinguished constants 0=[0,0],\,\, 1=[1,1],\,\,\, \mathsf{i} = A. We list a few equations satisfied by the algebra \mathcal I(A)=(I(A),0,1,\mathsf{i},\neg,\Delta,\nabla,\oplus,\odot), call IMV-algebra every model ofthese equations, and show that, conversely, every IMV-algebra is isomorphic to the IMV-algebra \mathcal I(B) of all intervals in some MV-algebra B. We show that IMV-algebras are categorically equivalent to MV-algebras, and give a representation of free IMV-algebras. We construct \L ukasiewicz interval logic, with its coNP-complete consequence relation, which we prove to be complete for \mathcal I([0,1])-valuations. For any class \mathsf{Q} of partially ordered algebras with operations that are monotone or antimonotone in each variable, we consider the generalization \mathcal I_{\mathsf{Q}} of the MV-algebraic functor \mathcal I, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for \mathcal I_{\mathsf{Q}} to be a categorical equivalence. These conditions are satisfied, e.g., by all subquasivarieties of residuated lattices.
