We describe a framework for proving consistency results about singular cardinals of arbitrary cofinality and their successors. This framework allows the construction of models in which the Singular Cardinals Hypothesis fails at a singular cardinal of uncountable cofinality, while its successor enjoys various combinatorial properties.   As a sample application, we prove the consistency (relative to that of ZFC plus a supercompact cardinal) of there being a strong limit singular cardinal \kappa of uncountable cofinality where SCH fails and for which there is a collection of graphs on \kappa^+ whose size is less than 2^\kappa and such that any graph on \kappa^+ embeds into one of the graphs in the collection.
