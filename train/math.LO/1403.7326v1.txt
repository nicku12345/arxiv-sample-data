The text is based on notes from a class entitled {\em Model Theory of Berkovich Spaces}, given at the Hebrew University in the fall term of 2009, and retains the flavor of class notes. It includes an exposition of material from \cite{hhmcrelle}, \cite{hhm} and \cite{HL}, regarding definable types in the model completion of the theory of valued fields, and the classification of imaginary sorts. The latter is given a new proof, based on definable types rather than invariant types, and on the notion of {\em generic reparametrization}. I also try to bring out the relation to the geometry of \cite{HL} - stably dominated definable types as the model theoretic incarnation of a Berkovich point.
