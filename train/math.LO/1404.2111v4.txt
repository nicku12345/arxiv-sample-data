The resurrection axioms are forcing axioms introduced recently by Hamkins and Johnstone, developing on ideas of Chalons and Velickovi\'c. We introduce a stronger form of resurrection axioms (the \emph{iterated} resurrection axioms \textrm{RA}_\alpha(\Gamma) for a class of forcings \Gamma and a given ordinal \alpha), and show that \textrm{RA}_\omega(\Gamma) implies generic absoluteness for the first-order theory of H_{\gamma^+} with respect to forcings in \Gamma preserving the axiom, where \gamma=\gamma_\Gamma is a cardinal which depends on \Gamma (\gamma_\Gamma=\omega_1 if \Gamma is any among the classes of countably closed, proper, semiproper, stationary set preserving forcings).   We also prove that the consistency strength of these axioms is below that of a Mahlo cardinal for most forcing classes, and below that of a stationary limit of supercompact cardinals for the class of stationary set preserving posets. Moreover we outline that simultaneous generic absoluteness for H_{\gamma_0^+} with respect to \Gamma_0 and for H_{\gamma_1^+} with respect to \Gamma_1 with \gamma_0=\gamma_{\Gamma_0}\neq\gamma_{\Gamma_1}=\gamma_1 is in principle possible, and we present several natural models of the Morse Kelley set theory where this phenomenon occurs (even for all H_\gamma simultaneously). Finally, we compare the iterated resurrection axioms (and the generic absoluteness results we can draw from them) with a variety of other forcing axioms, and also with the generic absoluteness results by Woodin and the second author.
