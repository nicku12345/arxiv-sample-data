We show that adding a random real number destroys a large fragment of Martin's axiom, namely Martin's axiom for partial orders that have precalibre-\aleph_1, thus answering an old question of J. Roitman [9]. We also answer a question of J. Steprans and S. Watson [13] by showing that, by a forcing that preserves cardinals, one can destroy the precalibre-\aleph_1 property of a partial ordering while preserving its ccc-ness.
