Turing progressions have been often used to measure the proof-theoretic strength of mathematical theories. Turing progressions based on n-provability give rise to a \Pi_{n+1} proof-theoretic ordinal. As such, to each theory U we can assign the sequence of corresponding \Pi_{n+1} ordinals \langle |U|_n\rangle_{n>0}. We call this sequence a \emph{Turing-Taylor expansion} of a theory.   In this paper, we relate Turing-Taylor expansions of sub-theories of Peano Arithmetic to Ignatiev's universal model for the closed fragment of the polymodal provability logic {\mathbf{GLP}}_\omega. In particular, in this first draft we observe that each point in the Ignatiev model can be seen as Turing-Taylor expansions of formal mathematical theories.   Moreover, each sub-theory of Peano Arithmetic that allows for a Turing-Taylor expression will define a unique point in Ignatiev's model.
