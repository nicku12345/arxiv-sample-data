The derivation on the differential-valued field \mathbb{T}_{\log} of logarithmic transseries induces on its value group \Gamma_{\log} a certain map \psi. The structure (\Gamma_{\log},\psi) is a divisible asymptotic couple. We prove that the theory T_{\log} = {\rm Th}(\Gamma_{\log},\psi) admits elimination of quantifiers in a natural first-order language. All models (\Gamma,\psi) of T_{\log} have an important discrete subset \Psi:=\psi(\Gamma\setminus\{0\}). We give explicit descriptions of all definable functions on \Psi and prove that \Psi is stably embedded in \Gamma.
