We study reflection principles of Peano Arithmetic PA which are based on both proof and provability. Any such reflection principle in PA is equivalent to either \Box P\!\rightarrow\! P (\Box P stands for `P is provable') or \Box^k u\!\!:\!\!P\!\rightarrow\! P for some k\geq 0 (t:P states `t is a proof of P'). Reflection principles constitute a non-collapsing hierarchy with respect to their deductive strength u\!\!:\!\!P\!\rightarrow\! P\ \ \prec\ \ \Box u\!\!:\!\!P\!\rightarrow\! P\ \ \prec\ \ \Box^2 u\!\!:\!\!P\!\rightarrow\! P \ \ \prec\ \ldots\ \prec\ \ \Box P\!\rightarrow\! P.
