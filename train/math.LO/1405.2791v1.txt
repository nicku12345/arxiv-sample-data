Viale \cite{Viale_GuessingModel} introduced the notion of Generic Laver Diamond at \kappa---which we denote \Diamond_{\text{Lav}}(\kappa)---asserting the existence of a single function from \kappa \to H_\kappa that behaves much like a supercompact Laver function, except with generic elementary embeddings rather than internal embeddings. Viale proved that the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA) implies \Diamond_{\text{Lav}}(\omega_2). We strengthen his theorem by weakening the hypothesis to a statement strictly weaker than PFA. We also show that the principle \Diamond_{\text{Lav}}(\kappa) provides a uniform, simple construction of 2-cardinal diamonds, and prove that \Diamond_{\text{Lav}}(\kappa) is quite prevalent in models of set theory; in particular:   1) L satisfies \Diamond_{\text{Lav}}^+(\kappa) whenever \kappa is a successor cardinal, or when the appropriate version of Chang's Conjecture fails.   2) For any successor cardinal \kappa, there is a \kappa-directed closed class forcing---namely, the forcing from Friedman-Holy \cite{MR2860182}---that forces \Diamond_{\text{Lav}}(\kappa).
