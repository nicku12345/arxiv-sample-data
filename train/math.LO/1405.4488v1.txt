In this work we present some general categorial ideas on Abstract Elementary Classes (AECs) %\cite{She}, inspired by the totality of AECs of the form (Mod(T), \preceq), for a first-order theory T: (i) we define a natural notion of (funtorial) morphism between AECs; (ii) explore the following constructions of AECs: "generalized" theories, pullbacks of AECs, (Galois) types as AECs; (iii) apply categorial and topological ideas to encode model-theoretic notions on spaces of types %(see Michael Lieberman Phd thesis) ; (iv) present the "local" axiom for AECs here called "local Robinson's property" and an application (Robinson's diagram method); (v) introduce the category AEC of Grothendieck's gluings of all AECs (with change of basis); (vi) introduce the "global" axioms of "tranversal Robinson's property" (TRP) and "global Robinson's property" (GRP) and prove that TRP is equivalent to GRP and GRP entails a natural version of Craig interpolation property.
