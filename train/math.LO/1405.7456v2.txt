In this paper, we investigate connections between structures present in every generic extension of the universe V and computability theory. We introduce the notion of {\em generic Muchnik reducibility} that can be used to to compare the complexity of uncountable structures; we establish basic properties of this reducibility, and study it in the context of {\em generic presentability}, the existence of a copy of the structure in every extension by a given forcing. We show that every forcing notion making \omega_2 countable generically presents some countable structure with no copy in the ground model; and that every structure generically presentble by a forcing notion that does not make \omega_2 countable has a copy in the ground model. We also show that any countable structure \mathcal{A} that is generically presentable by a forcing notion not collapsing \omega_1 has a countable copy in V, as does any structure \mathcal{B} generically Muchnik reducible to a structure \mathcal{A} of cardinality \aleph_1. The former positive result yields a new proof of Harrington's result that counterexamples to Vaught's conjecture have models of power \aleph_1 with Scott rank arbitrarily high below \omega_2. Finally, we show that a rigid structure with copies in all generic extensions by a given forcing has a copy already in the ground model.
