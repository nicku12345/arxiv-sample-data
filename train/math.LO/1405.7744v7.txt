The `catuskoti' or tetralemma in Buddhist logic is a problematic subject from the modern logical point of view. Recently a many-valued paraconsistent logic was proposed in order to formalize catuskoti adequately by G. Priest. On the other hand a slight modification of the formalization of catuskoti seems to allow an appropriate interpretation in the framework of the classical propositional calculus in the mathematical logic developed by Russell-Whitehead and Hilbert-Ackermann.
