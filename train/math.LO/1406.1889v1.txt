Theory of operators generated by binary fuzzy relations is highly increasing for its nature and applicability. The main goal of the paper is to present several representation theorems for operators induced by fuzzy relations (for example closure operators used in formal concept analysis, monadic operators or tense operators). Consequently we establish algebraic models with their semantics which are usable in the non-classical logic research and in the computer science research. The obtained results are applied in the theory of Pavelka's algebras.
