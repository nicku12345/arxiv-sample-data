Extending recent investigations on the structure of Tukey types of ultrafilters on \mathcal{P}(\omega) to Boolean algebras in general, we classify the spectra of Tukey types of ultrafilters for several classes of Boolean algebras, including interval algebras, tree algebras, and pseudo-tree algebras.
