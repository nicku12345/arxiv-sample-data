We introduce and study several notions of computability-theoretic reducibility between subsets of \omega that are "robust" in the sense that if only partial information is available about the oracle, then partial information can be recovered about the output. These are motivated by reductions between \Pi^1_2 principles in the context of reverse mathematics, and also encompasses generic and coarse reducibilities, previously studied by Jockusch and Schupp (2012).
