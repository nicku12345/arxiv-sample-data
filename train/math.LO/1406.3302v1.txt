We develop a general framework for forcing with coherent adequate sets on H(\lambda) as side conditions, where \lambda \ge \omega_2 is a cardinal of uncountable cofinality. We describe a class of forcing posets which we call coherent adequate type forcings. The main theorem of the paper is that any coherent adequate type forcing preserves CH. We show that there exists a forcing poset for adding a club subset of \omega_2 with finite conditions while preserving CH, solving a problem of Friedman.
