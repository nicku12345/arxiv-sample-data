We prove that a wide class of strongly proper forcing posets have quotients with strong properties. Specifically, we prove that quotients of forcing posets which have simple universal strongly generic conditions on a stationary set of models by certain nice regular suborders satisfy the \omega_1-approximation property. We prove that the existence of stationarily many \omega_1-guessing models in P_{\omega_2}(H(\theta)), for sufficiently large cardinals \theta, is consistent with the continuum being arbitrarily large, solving a problem of Viale and Weiss.
