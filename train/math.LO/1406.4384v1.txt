We identify complete fragments of the Simple Theory of Types with Infinity (\mathrm{TSTI}) and Quine's \mathrm{NF} set theory. We show that \mathrm{TSTI} decides every sentence \phi in the language of type theory that is in one of the following forms:   (A) \phi= \forall x_1^{r_1} \cdots \forall x_k^{r_k} \exists y_1^{s_1} \cdots \exists y_l^{s_l} \theta where the superscripts denote the types of the variables, s_1 > \ldots > s_l and \theta is quantifier-free,   (B) \phi= \forall x_1^{r_1} \cdots \forall x_k^{r_k} \exists y_1^{s} \cdots \exists y_l^{s} \theta where the superscripts denote the types of the variables and \theta is quantifier-free.   This shows that \mathrm{NF} decides every stratified sentence \phi in the language of set theory that is in one of the following forms:   (A') \phi= \forall x_1 \cdots \forall x_k \exists y_1 \cdots \exists y_l \theta where \theta is quantifier-free and \phi admits a stratification that assigns distinct values to all of the variable y_1, \ldots, y_l,   (B') \phi= \forall x_1 \cdots \forall x_k \exists y_1 \cdots \exists y_l \theta where \theta is quantifier-free and \phi admits a stratification that assigns the same value to all of the variables y_1, \ldots, y_l.
