In this paper we consider the normal modal logics of elementary classes defined by first-order formulas of the form \forall x_0 \exists x_1 \dots \exists x_n \bigwedge x_i R_\lambda x_j. We prove that many properties of these logics, such as finite axiomatisability, elementarity, axiomatisability by a set of canonical formulas or by a single generalised Sahlqvist formula, together with modal definability of the initial formula, either simultaneously hold or simultaneously do not hold.
