We study the problem of extending an abstract independence notion for types of singletons (what Shelah calls a good frame) to longer types. Working in the framework of tame abstract elementary classes, we show that good frames can always be extended to types of independent sequences. As an application, we show that tameness and a good frame imply Shelah's notion of dimension is well-behaved, complementing previous work of Jarden and Sitton. We also improve a result of the first author on extending a frame to larger models.
