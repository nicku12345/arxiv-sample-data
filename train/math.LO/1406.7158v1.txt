We prove a strong form of model completenes for expansions of the field of real numbers by (the real and imaginary parts of) the modular function J, by the modular forms E_4 and E_6 and quasimodular form E_2 defined in the usual fundamental domain, and the restricted sine function and the (unrestricted) exponential function. This is done using ideas of Peterzil and Starchenko's paper \cite{peterzil-starchenko-wp2004} on the uniform definability of \wp function in \mathbb{R}_{\mathit{an}} (and of the modular function J). In the conclusion we pose some open problems related to this work.
