The Scott process of a relational structure M is the sequence of sets of formulas given by the Scott analysis of M. We present axioms for the class of Scott processes of structures in a relational vocabulary \tau, and use them to give a proof of an unpublished theorem of Leo Harrington from the 1970's, showing that a counterexample to Vaught's Conjecture has models of cofinally many Scott ranks below \omega_{2}. Our approach also gives a theorem of Harnik and Makkai, showing that if there exists a counterexample to Vaught's Conjecture, then there is a counterexample whose uncountable models have the same \mathcal{L}_{\omega_{1}, \omega}(\tau)-theory, and which has a model of Scott rank \omega_{1}. Moreover, we show that if \phi is a sentence of \mathcal{L}_{\omega_{1}, \omega}(\tau) giving rise to a counterexample to Vaught's Conjecture, then for every limit ordinal \alpha greater than the quantifier depth of \phi and below \omega_{2}, \phi has a model of Scott rank \alpha.
