We develop librationism, {\pounds}, and clarify some mathematical and philosophical matters which relate to the particular manner in which it deals with the paradoxes and to its usefulness as a foundation for mathematics and type free reasoning. We isolate a domination operation which unlike the power set operation is not paradoxical and which helps us isolate the definable real numbers. We show that {\pounds} plus a postulate and a postulation interprets ZFC; our strategy for achieving this involves extending an interpretation by Harvey Friedman of ZF in a system weaker than ZF with collection minus extensionality and a novel notion of librationist \ capture which entails collection, specification and choice in desired contexts.
