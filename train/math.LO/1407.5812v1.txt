A set F of formulas is complete relative to a given class of logics, if every logic from this class can be axiomatized by formulas from F. A set of formulas F is {\L}-complete relative to a given class of logics, if every logic of this class can be {\L}-axiomatized by formulas from F, that is, every of these logics can be defined by an \L-deductive system with axioms and anti-axioms from F and inference rules modus ponens, modus tollens, substitution and reverse substitution. We prove that every complete relative to \Ext\Int (or \Ext\KF) set of formulas is {\L}-complete. In particular, every logic from \Ext\Int (or \Ext\KF) can be {\L}-axiomatized by Zakharyaschev's canonical formulas.
