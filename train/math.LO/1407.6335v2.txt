We prove that large cardinals need not generally exhibit their large cardinal nature in HOD. For example, a supercompact cardinal \kappa need not be weakly compact in HOD, and there can be a proper class of supercompact cardinals in V, none of them weakly compact in HOD, with no supercompact cardinals in HOD. Similar results hold for many other types of large cardinals, such as measurable and strong cardinals.
