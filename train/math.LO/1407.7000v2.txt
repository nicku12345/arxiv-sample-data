We present an elementary three pass algorithm for computing addition in Ostrowski numeration systems. When a is quadratic, addition in the Ostrowski numeration system based on a is recognizable by a finite automaton. We deduce that a subset of X\subseteq \mathbb{N}^n is definable in (\mathbb{N},+,V_a), where V_a is the function that maps a natural number x to the smallest denominator of a convergent of a that appears in the Ostrowski representation based on a of x with a non-zero coefficient, if and only if the set of Ostrowski representations of elements of X is recognizable by a finite automaton. The decidability of the theory of (\mathbb{N},+,V_a) follows.
