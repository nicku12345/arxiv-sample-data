The theory of (\mathbb{R},<,+,\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z} a) is decidable if a is quadratic. If a is the golden ratio, (\mathbb{R},<,+,\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z} a) defines multiplication by a. The results are established by using the Ostrowski numeration system based on the continued fraction expansion of a to define the above structures in monadic second order logic of one successor. The converse that (\mathbb{R},<,+,\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z} a) defines monadic second order logic of one successor, will also be established.
