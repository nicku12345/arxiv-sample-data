We develop an analogue of the classical Scott analysis for metric structures and infinitary continuous logic. Among our results are the existence of Scott sentences for metric structures and a version of the Lopez-Escobar theorem. We also derive some descriptive set theoretic consequences: most notably, that isomorphism on a class of separable structures is a Borel equivalence relation iff their Scott rank is uniformly bounded below \omega_1. Finally, we apply our methods to study the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces and the Kadets distance between Banach spaces, showing that the set of spaces with distance 0 to a fixed space is a Borel set.
