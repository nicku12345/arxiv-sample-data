We provide a method of constructing better-quasi-orders by generalising a technique for constructing operator algebras that was developed by Pouzet. We then generalise the notion of \sigma-scattered to partial orders, and use our method to prove that the class of \sigma-scattered partial orders is better-quasi-ordered under embeddability. This generalises theorems of Laver, Corominas and Thomass\'{e} regarding \sigma-scattered linear orders and trees, countable forests and N-free partial orders respectively. In particular, a class of countable partial orders is better-quasi-ordered whenever the class of indecomposable subsets of its members satisfies a natural strengthening of better-quasi-order.
