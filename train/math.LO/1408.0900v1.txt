Let exp(x) be the function determined by the classical power series of the exponentiation. Then E_p(x):=exp(px) is well-defined on Zp, the ring of p-adic integer (for p not equal to 2, we set E_2(x)=exp(4x)). Furthermore, E_p determines a structure of exponential ring on Zp. In this paper, we prove that if a p-adic version of Schanuel's conjecture is true then the theory of (Zp, +, ., 0, 1, E_p) is decidable.
