An important theorem of geometric measure theory (first proved by Besicovitch and Davies for Euclidean space) says that every analytic set of non-zero s-dimensional Hausdorff measure \mathcal H^s contains a closed subset of non-zero (and indeed finite) \mathcal H^s-measure. We investigate the question how hard it is to find such a set, in terms of the index set complexity, and in terms of the complexity of the parameter needed to define such a closed set. Among other results, we show that given a (lightface) \Sigma^1_1 set of reals in Cantor space, there is always a \Pi^0_1(\mathcal{O}) subset on non-zero \mathcal H^s-measure definable from Kleene's \mathcal O. On the other hand, there are \Pi^0_2 sets of reals where no hyperarithmetic real can define a closed subset of non-zero measure.
