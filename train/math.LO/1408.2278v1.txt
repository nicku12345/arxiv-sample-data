Brownian motion and scaled and interpolated simple random walk can be jointly embedded in a probability space in such a way that almost surely the n-step walk is within a uniform distance O(n^{-1/2}\log n) of the Brownian path for all but finitely many positive integers n. Almost surely this n-step walk will be incompressible in the sense of Kolmogorov complexity, and all {Martin-L\"of random} paths of Brownian motion have such an incompressible close approximant. This strengthens a result of Asarin, who obtained the bound O(n^{-1/6} \log n). The result cannot be improved to o(n^{-1/2}{\sqrt{\log n}}).
