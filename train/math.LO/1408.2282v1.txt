The notions of almost everywhere (a.e.) domination and its uniform version were introduced and studied in reverse mathematics. This paper studies these notions from a recursion-theoretic point of view and explore their connections to notions such as randomness and genericity. It is shown that if Z is a.e. dominating then each 1-Z-random is 2-random. In other words, 0'\leq_{\rm LR} Z for every a.e. dominating Z, where {\rm LR} denotes low-for-random reducibility. Other results and corollaries are also given.
