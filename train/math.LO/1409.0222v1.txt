The~\emph{Rothberger number} \mathfrak{b} (\mathcal{I}) of a definable ideal \mathcal{I} on \omega is the least cardinal \kappa such that there exists a Rothberger gap of type (\omega,\kappa) in the quotient algebra \mathcal{P} (\omega) / \mathcal{I}. We investigate \mathfrak{b} (\mathcal{I}) for a subclass of the F_\sigma ideals, the fragmented ideals, and prove that for some of these ideals, like the linear growth ideal, the Rothberger number is \aleph_1 while for others, like the polynomial growth ideal, it is above the additivity of measure. We also show that it is consistent that there are infinitely many (even continuum many) different Rothberger numbers associated with fragmented ideals.
