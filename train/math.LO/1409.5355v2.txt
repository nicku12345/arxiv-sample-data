We consider an arbitrary topological group G definable in a structure \mathcal M, such that some basis for the topology of G consists of sets definable in \mathcal M.   To each such group G we associate a compact G-space of partial types S^\mu_G(M)=\{p_\mu:p\in S_G(M)\} which is the quotient of the usual type space S_G(M) by the relation of two types being "infinitesimally close to each other". In the o-minimal setting, if p is a definable type then it has a corresponding definable subgroup Stab_\mu(p), which is the stabilizer of p_\mu. This group is nontrivial when p is unbounded in the sense of \mathcal M; in fact it is a torsion-free solvable group.   Along the way, we analyze the general construction of S^\mu_G(M) and its connection to the Samuel compactification of topological groups.
