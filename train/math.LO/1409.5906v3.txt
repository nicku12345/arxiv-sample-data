Let \{\phi_p\} be an optimal G\"odel numbering of the family of computable functions (in Schnorr's sense), where p ranges over binary strings. Assume that a list of strings L(p) is computable from p and for all p contains a \phi-program for \phi_p whose length is at most \varepsilon bits larger that the length of the shortest \phi-program for \phi_p. We show that for infinitely many p the list L(p) must have 2^{|p|-\varepsilon-O(1)} strings. Here \varepsilon is an arbitrary function of p.
