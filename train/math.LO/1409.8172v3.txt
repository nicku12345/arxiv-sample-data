We study certain Banach spaces that are added in the extension by one Cohen real. Specifically, we show that adding just one Cohen real to any model adds a Banach space of density \aleph_1 which does not embed into any such space in the ground model such a Banach space can be chosen to be UG This has consequences on the the isomorphic universality number for Banach spaces of density \aleph_1, which is hence equal to \aleph_2 in the standard Cohen model and the same is true for UG spaces. Analogous universality results for Banach spaces are true for other cardinals, by a different proof.
