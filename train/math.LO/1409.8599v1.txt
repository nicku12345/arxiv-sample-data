We use pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms of surfaces in order to prove that the first order theory of non abelian free groups, T_{fg}, is n-ample for any n\in\omega. This result adds to the work of Pillay, that proved that T_{fg} is non CM -trivial. The sequence witnessing ampleness is a sequence of primitive elements in F_{\omega}.   Our result provides an alternative proof to the main result of a preprint by Ould Houcine-Tent.   We also add an appendix in which we make a few remarks on Sela's paper on imaginaries in torsion free hyperbolic groups. In particular we give alternative transparent proofs concerning the non-elimination of certain imaginaries.
