We give an exact value of the rank of an \mathcal{F}-Fubini sum of filters for the case where \mathcal{F} is a Borel filter of rank 1. We also consider \mathcal{F}-limits of filters \mathcal{F}_i, which are of the form \lim_\mathcal{F}\mathcal{F}_i=\left\{A\subset X: \left\{i\in I: A\in\mathcal{F}_i\right\}\in\mathcal{F}\right\}. We estimate the ranks of such filters; in particular we prove that they can fall to 1 for \mathcal{F} as well as for \mathcal{F}_i of arbitrarily large ranks. At the end we prove some facts concerning filters of countable type and their ranks.
