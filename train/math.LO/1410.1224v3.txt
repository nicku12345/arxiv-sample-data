Suppose that P is a forcing notion, L is a language (in V), \dot{\tau} a P-name such that P\Vdash "\dot{\tau} is a countable L-structure". In the product P\times P, there are names \dot{\tau_{1}},\dot{\tau_{2}} such that for any generic filter G=G_{1}\times G_{2} over P\times P, \dot{\tau}_{1}[G]=\dot{\tau}[G_{1}] and \dot{\tau}_{2}[G]=\dot{\tau}[G_{2}]. Zapletal asked whether or not P \times P \Vdash \dot{\tau}_{1}\cong\dot{\tau}_{2} implies that there is some M\in V such that P \Vdash \dot{\tau}\cong\check{M}. We answer this negatively and discuss related issues.
