Let \mathbb{B} be a complete Boolean algebra. We show, as an application of a previous result of the author, that if \lambda is an infinite cardinal and \mathbb{B} is weakly (\lambda^\omega, \omega)-distributive, then \mathbb{B} is (\lambda, 2)-distributive. Using a parallel result, we show that if \kappa is a weakly compact cardinal such that \mathbb{B} is weakly (2^\kappa, \kappa)-distributive and \mathbb{B} is (\alpha, 2)-distributive for each \alpha < \kappa, then \mathbb{B} is (\kappa, 2)-distributive.
