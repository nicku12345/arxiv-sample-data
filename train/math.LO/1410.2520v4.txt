Given a cardinal \kappa and a sequence \left(\alpha_i\right)_{i\in\kappa} of ordinals, we determine the least ordinal \beta (when one exists) such that the topological partition relation \[\beta\rightarrow\left(top\,\alpha_i\right)^1_{i\in\kappa}\] holds, including an independence result for one class of cases. Here the prefix "top" means that the homogeneous set must have the correct topology rather than the correct order type. The answer is linked to the non-topological pigeonhole principle of Milner and Rado.
