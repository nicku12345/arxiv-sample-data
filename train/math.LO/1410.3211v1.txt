A real is called integer-valued random if no integer-valued martingale can win arbitrarily much capital betting against it. A real is low for integer-valued randomness if no integer-valued martingale recursive in A can succeed on an integer-valued random real. We show that lowness for integer-valued randomness coincides with recursiveness, as is the case for computable randomness.
