Simpson and the second author asked whether there exists a characterization of the natural numbers by a second-order sentence which is provably categorical in the theory RCA^*_0. We answer in the negative, showing that for any characterization of the natural numbers which is provably true in WKL^*_0, the categoricity theorem implies \Sigma^0_1 induction. On the other hand, we show that RCA^*_0 does make it possible to characterize the natural numbers categorically by means of a set of second-order sentences. We also show that a certain \Pi^1_2-conservative extension of RCA^*_0 admits a provably categorical single-sentence characterization of the naturals, but each such characterization has to be inconsistent with WKL^*_0+superexp.
