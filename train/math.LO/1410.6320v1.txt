Let (R, \sim ) be the Rado graph, Emb (R) the monoid of its self-embeddings, \Pi (R)=\{ f[R]: f\in Emb (R)\} the set of copies of R contained in R, and {\mathcal I}_R the ideal of subsets of R which do not contain a copy of R. We consider the poset ( \Pi (R ), \subset ), the algebra P (R)/{\mathcal I _R}, and the inverse of the right Green's pre-order on Emb (R), and show that these pre-orders are forcing equivalent to a two step iteration of the form P \ast \pi, where the poset P is similar to the Sacks perfect set forcing: adds a generic real, has the \aleph _0-covering property and, hence, preserves \omega _1, has the Sacks property and does not produce splitting reals, while \pi codes an \omega-distributive forcing. Consequently, the Boolean completions of these four posets are isomorphic and the same holds for each countable graph containing a copy of the Rado graph.
