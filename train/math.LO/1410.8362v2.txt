In the 1970s M. Laczkovich posed the following problem: Let \mathcal{B}_1(X) denote the set of Baire class 1 functions defined on an uncountable Polish space X equipped with the pointwise ordering. \[\text{Characterize the order types of the linearly ordered subsets of \mathcal{B}_1(X).} \]The main result of the present paper is a complete solution to this problem.   We prove that a linear order is isomorphic to a linearly ordered family of Baire class 1 functions iff it is isomorphic to a subset of the following linear order that we call ([0,1]^{<\omega_1}_{\searrow 0},<_{altlex}), where [0,1]^{<\omega_1}_{\searrow 0} is the set of strictly decreasing transfinite sequences of reals in [0, 1] with last element 0, and <_{altlex}, the so called \emph{alternating lexicographical ordering}, is defined as follows: if (x_\alpha)_{\alpha\leq \xi}, (x'_\alpha)_{\alpha\leq \xi'} \in [0,1]^{<\omega_1}_{\searrow 0}, and \delta is the minimal ordinal where the two sequences differ then we say that \[ (x_\alpha)_{\alpha\leq \xi} <_{altlex} (x'_\alpha)_{\alpha\leq \xi'} \iff (\delta \text{ is even and } x_{\delta}<x'_{\delta}) \text{ or } (\delta \text{ is odd and } x_{\delta}>x'_{\delta}). \] Using this characterization we easily reprove all the known results and answer all the known open questions of the topic.
