MV-algebras and Riesz MV-algebras are categorically equivalent to abelian lattice-ordered groups with strong unit and, respectively, with Riesz spaces (vector-lattices) with strong unit. A standard construction in the literature of lattice-ordered groups is the vector-lattice hull of an archimedean lattice-ordered group. Following a similar approach, in this paper we define the Riesz hull of a semisimple MV-algebra.
