We study the model theory of countable right-angled buildings with infinite residues. For every Coxeter graph we obtain a complete theory with a natural axiomatisation, which is \omega-stable and equational. Furthermore, we provide sharp lower and upper bounds for its degree of ampleness, computed exclusively in terms of the associated Coxeter graph. This generalises and provides an alternative treatment of the free pseudospace.
