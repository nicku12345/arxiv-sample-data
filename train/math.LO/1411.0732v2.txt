We study algorithmic randomness notions via effective versions of almost-everywhere theorems from analysis and ergodic theory. The effectivization is in terms of objects described by a computably enumerable set, such as lower semicomputable functions. The corresponding randomness notions are slightly stronger than \ML\ (ML) randomness. We establish several equivalences. Given a ML-random real z, the additional randomness strengths needed for the following are equivalent.   \n (1) all effectively closed classes containing z have density 1 at z.   \n (2) all nondecreasing functions with uniformly left-c.e.\ increments are differentiable at z.   \n (3) z is a Lebesgue point of each lower semicomputable integrable function.   We also consider convergence of left-c.e.\ martingales, and convergence in the sense of Birkhoff's pointwise ergodic theorem. Lastly we study randomness notions for density of \Pi^0_n and \Sigma^1_1 classes.
