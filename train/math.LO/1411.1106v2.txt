In this paper we develop a technique for proving determinacy of classes of the form \omega^2-\Pi^1_1+\Gamma (a refinement of the difference hierarchy on the co-analytic sets lying between \omega^2-\Pi^1_1 and (\omega^2+1)-\Pi^1_1) from weak principles, establishing upper bounds for the determinacy-strength of the classes \omega^2-\Pi^1_1+\Sigma^0_\alpha for all computable \alpha and of \omega^2-\Pi^1_1+\Delta^1_1. This bridges the gap between previously known hypotheses implying determinacy in this region.
