We prove that if the linear-time and polynomial-time hierarchies coincide, then every model of \Pi_1(\mathbb{N}) + \neg \Omega_1 has a proper end-extension to a model of \Pi_1(\mathbb{N}), and so \Pi_1(\mathbb{N}) + \neg \Omega_1 \vdash \mathrm{B}\Sigma_1. Under an even stronger complexity-theoretic assumption which nevertheless seems hard to disprove using present-day methods, \Pi_1(\mathbb{N}) + \neg \mathrm{Exp} \vdash \mathrm{B}\Sigma_1. Both assumptions can be modified to versions which make it possible to replace \Pi_1(\mathbb{N}) by \mathrm{I}\Delta_0 as the base theory.   We also show that any proof that \mathrm{I}\Delta_0 + \neg \exp does not prove a given finite fragment of \mathrm{B}\Sigma_1 has to be "non-relativizing", in the sense that it will not work in the presence of an arbitrary oracle.
