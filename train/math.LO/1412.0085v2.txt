Let M be a fine structural mouse and let F\in M be such that M\models``F is a total extender'' and (M||\mathrm{lh}(F),F) is a premouse. We show that it follows that F\in\mathbb{E}^M, where \mathbb{E}^M is the extender sequence of M. We also prove generalizations of this fact.   Let M be a premouse with no largest cardinal and let \Sigma be a sufficient iteration strategy for M. We prove that if M knows enough of \Sigma\upharpoonright M then \mathbb{E}^M is definable over the universe \lfloor M\rfloor of M, so if also \lfloor M\rfloor\models\mathrm{ZFC} then \lfloor M\rfloor\models``V=\mathrm{HOD}''. We show that this result applies in particular to M=M_{\mathrm{nt}}|\lambda, where M_{\mathrm{nt}} is the least non-tame mouse and \lambda is any limit cardinal of M_{\mathrm{nt}}.   We also show that there is no iterable bicephalus (N,E,F) for which E is type 2 and F is type 1 or 3. As a corollary, we deduce a uniqueness property for maximal L[\mathbb{E}] constructions computed in iterable background universes.
