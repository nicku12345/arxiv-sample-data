In this paper we give characterizations of the super-stable theories, in terms of an external property called representation. In the sense of the representation property, the mentioned class of first-order theories can be regarded as "not very complicated". This was done for "stable" and for "aleph_0-stable". Here we give a complete answer for "superstable".
