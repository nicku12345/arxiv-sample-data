A function is diagonally non-computable (d.n.c.) if it diagonalizes against the universal partial computable function. D.n.c. functions play a central role in algorithmic randomness and reverse mathematics. Flood and Towsner asked for which functions h, the principle stating the existence of an h-bounded d.n.c. function (DNR_h) implies the Ramsey-type K\"onig's lemma (RWKL). In this paper, we prove that for every computable order h, there exists an~\omega-model of DNR_h which is not a not model of the Ramsey-type graph coloring principle for two colors (RCOLOR2) and therefore not a model of RWKL. The proof combines bushy tree forcing and a technique introduced by Lerman, Solomon and Towsner to transform a computable non-reducibility into a separation over omega-models.
