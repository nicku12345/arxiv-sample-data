We introduce a new device in the study of abstract elementary classes (AECs): Galois Morleyization, which consists in expanding the models of the class with a relation for every Galois type of length less than a fixed cardinal \kappa. We show:   \mathbf{Theorem} (The semantic-syntactic correspondence)   An AEC K is fully (<\kappa)-tame and type short if and only if Galois types are syntactic in the Galois Morleyization.   This exhibits a correspondence between AECs and the syntactic framework of stability theory inside a model. We use the correspondence to make progress on the stability theory of tame and type short AECs. The main theorems are:   \mathbf{Theorem}   Let K be a \text{LS}(K)-tame AEC with amalgamation. The following are equivalent:   * K is Galois stable in some \lambda \ge \text{LS}(K).   * K does not have the order property (defined in terms of Galois types).   * There exist cardinals \mu and \lambda_0 with \mu \le \lambda_0 < \beth_{(2^{\text{LS}(K)})^+} such that K is Galois stable in any \lambda \ge \lambda_0 with \lambda = \lambda^{<\mu}.   \mathbf{Theorem}   Let K be a fully (<\kappa)-tame and type short AEC with amalgamation, \kappa = \beth_{\kappa} > \text{LS} (K). If K is Galois stable, then the class of \kappa-Galois saturated models of K admits an independence notion ((<\kappa)-coheir) which, except perhaps for extension, has the properties of forking in a first-order stable theory.
