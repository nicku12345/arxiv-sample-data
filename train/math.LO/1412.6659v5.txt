We study the complexity with respect to Borel reducibility of the relations of isometry and isometric embeddability between ultrametric Polish spaces for which a set D of possible distances is fixed in advance. These are, respectively, an analytic equivalence relation and an analytic quasi-order and we show that their complexity depends only on the order type of D. When D contains a decreasing sequence, isometry is Borel bireducible with countable graph isomorphism and isometric embeddability has maximal complexity among analytic quasi-orders. If D is well-ordered the situation is more complex: for isometry we have an increasing sequence of Borel equivalence relations of length \omega_1 which are cofinal among Borel equivalence relations classifiable by countable structures, while for isometric embeddability we have an increasing sequence of analytic quasi-orders of length at least \omega+3.   We then apply our results to solve various open problems in the literature. For instance, we answer a long-standing question of Gao and Kechris by showing that the relation of isometry on locally compact ultrametric Polish spaces is Borel bireducible with countable graph isomorphism.
