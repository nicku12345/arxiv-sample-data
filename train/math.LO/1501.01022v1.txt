We show that the analogues of the Hamkins embedding theorems, proved for the countable models of set theory, do not hold when extended to the uncountable realm of \omega_1-like models of set theory. Specifically, under the \diamondsuit hypothesis and suitable consistency assumptions, we show that there is a family of 2^{\omega_1} many \omega_1-like models of ZFC, all with the same ordinals, that are pairwise incomparable under embeddability; there can be a transitive \omega_1-like model of ZFC that does not embed into its own constructible universe; and there can be an \omega_1-like model of PA whose structure of hereditarily finite sets is not universal for the \omega_1-like models of set theory.
