As far as algebraic properties are concerned, the usual addition on the class of ordinal numbers is not really well behaved; for example, it is not commutative, nor left cancellative etc. In a few cases, the natural Hessemberg sum is a better alternative, since it shares most of the usual properties of the addition on the naturals.   A countably infinite version of the natural sum has been used in a recent paper by V\"a\"an\"anen and Wang, with applications to infinitary logics. We provide an order theoretical characterization of this operation. We show that this countable natural sum differs from the more usual infinite ordinal sum only for an initial finite "head" and agrees on the remaining infinite "tail". We show how to evaluate the countable natural sum just by computing a finite natural sum. Various kinds of infinite mixed sums of ordinals are discussed.
