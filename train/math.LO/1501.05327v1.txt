Fixing some computably enumerable theory T, the Friedman-Goldfarb-Harrington (FGH) theorem says that over elementary arithmetic, each \Sigma_1 formula is equivalent to some formula of the form \Box_T \varphi provided that T is consistent. In this paper we give various generalizations of the FGH theorem. In particular, for n>1 we relate \Sigma_{n} formulas to provability statements [n]_T^{\sf True}\varphi which are a formalization of "provable in T together with all true \Sigma_{n+1} sentences". As a corollary we conclude that each [n]_T^{\sf True} is \Sigma_{n+1}-complete. This observation yields us to consider a recursively defined hierarchy of provability predicates [n+1]^\Box_T which look a lot like [n+1]_T^{\sf True} except that where [n+1]_T^{\sf True} calls upon the oracle of all true \Sigma_{n+2} sentences, the [n+1]^\Box_T recursively calls upon the oracle of all true sentences of the form \langle n \rangle_T^\Box\phi. As such we obtain a `syntax-light' characterization of \Sigma_{n+1} definability whence of Turing jumps which is readily extended beyond the finite. Moreover, we observe that the corresponding provability predicates [n+1]_T^\Box are well behaved in that together they provide a sound interpretation of the polymodal provability logic {\sf GLP}_\omega.
