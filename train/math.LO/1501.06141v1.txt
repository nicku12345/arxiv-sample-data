It is shown that admissible clauses and quasi-identities of quasivarieties generated by a single finite algebra, or equivalently, the quasiequational and universal theories of their free algebras on countably infinitely many generators, may be characterized using natural dualities. In particular, axiomatizations are obtained for the admissible clauses and quasi-identities of bounded distributive lattices, Stone algebras, Kleene algebras and lattices, and De Morgan algebras and lattices.
