We introduce the notion of a `pure` Abstract Elementary Class to block trivial counterexamples. We study classes of models of bipartite graphs and show:   Main Theorem (cf. Theorem 3.5.2 and Corollary 3.5.6): If (\lambda_i : i \le \alpha<\aleph_1) is a strictly increasing sequence of characterizable cardinals (Definition 2.1) whose models satisfy JEP(<\lambda_0), there is an L_{\omega_1,\omega} -sentence \psi whose models form a pure AEC and   (1) The models of \psi satisfy JEP(<\lambda_0), while JEP fails for all larger cardinals and AP fails in all infinite cardinals.   (2) There exist 2^{\lambda_i^+} non-isomorphic maximal models of \psi in \lambda_i^+, for all i \le \alpha, but no maximal models in any other cardinality; and   (3) \psi has arbitrarily large models. In particular this shows the Hanf number for JEP and the Hanf number for maximality for pure AEC with Lowenheim number \aleph_0 are at least \beth_{\omega_1}.   We show that although AP(\kappa) for each \kappa implies the full amalgamation property, JEP(\kappa) for each \kappa does not imply the full joint embedding property.   We show the main combinatorial device of this paper cannot be used to extend the main theorem to a complete sentence.
