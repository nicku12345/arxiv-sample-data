The separation between two theorems in reverse mathematics is usually done by constructing a Turing ideal satisfying a theorem P and avoiding the solutions to a fixed instance of a theorem Q. Lerman, Solomon and Towsner introduced a forcing technique for iterating a computable non-reducibility in order to separate theorems over omega-models. In this paper, we present a modularized version of their framework in terms of preservation of hyperimmunity and show that it is powerful enough to obtain the same separations results as Wang did with his notion of preservation of definitions.
