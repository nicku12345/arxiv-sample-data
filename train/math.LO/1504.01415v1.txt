This article is an investigation of a method of deriving a topology from a space and an elementary submodel containing it. We first define and give the basic properties of this construction, known as X/M. In the next section, we construct some examples and analyse the topological relationship between X and X/M. In the final section, we apply X/M to get novel results about Lindel\"{o}f spaces, giving partial answers to a question of F.D. Tall and another question of Tall and M. Scheepers.
