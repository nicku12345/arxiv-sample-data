Given a countable, totally ordered commutative monoid \mathcal{R}=(R,\oplus,\leq,0), with least element 0, there is a countable, universal and ultrahomogeneous metric space \mathcal{U}_\mathcal{R} with distances in \mathcal{R}. We refer to this space as the \mathcal{R}-Urysohn space, and consider the theory of \mathcal{U}_\mathcal{R} in a binary relational language of distance inequalities. This setting encompasses many classical structures of varying model theoretic complexity, including the rational Urysohn space, the free n^{\text{th}} roots of the complete graph (e.g. the random graph when n=2), and theories of refining equivalence relations (viewed as ultrametric spaces). We characterize model theoretic properties of \text{Th}(\mathcal{U}_\mathcal{R}) by algebraic properties of \mathcal{R}, many of which are first-order in the language of ordered monoids. This includes stability, simplicity, and Shelah's SOP_n-hierarchy. Using the submonoid of idempotents in \mathcal{R}, we also characterize superstability, supersimplicity, and weak elimination of imaginaries. Finally, we give necessary conditions for elimination of hyperimaginaries, which further develops previous work of Casanovas and Wagner.
