\begin{abstract} Suppose p is a computable real so that p \geq 1. It is shown that the halting set can compute a surjective linear isometry between any two computable copies of \ell^p. It is also shown that this result is optimal in that when p \neq 2 there are two computable copies of \ell^p with the property that any oracle that computes a linear isometry of one onto the other must also compute the halting set. Thus, \ell^p is \Delta_2^0-categorical and is computably categorical if and only if p = 2. It is also shown that there is a computably categorical Banach space that is not a Hilbert space and that \ell^p is linearly isometric to a computable Banach space if and only if p is computable. These results hold in both the real and complex case.
