For a rosy theory, we give a canonical surjective homomorphism from a Lascar group over A=\acl^{eq}(A) to a first homology group of a strong type over A, and we describe its kernel by an invariant equivalence relation. As a consequence, we show that the first homology groups of strong types in rosy theories have the cardinalities of one or at least 2^{\aleph_0}. We give two examples of rosy theories having non trivial first homology groups of strong types over \acl^{eq}(\emptyset). In these examples, these two homology groups are exactly isomorphic to their Lascar group over \acl^{eq}(\emptyset).
