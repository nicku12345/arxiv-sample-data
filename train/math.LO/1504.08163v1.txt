The 2014 Logic Blog starts with open questions from the May IMS program in Singapore. It contains results on randomness, including answers to some open questions in higher randomness. There are structural results on equivalence relations, and metric spaces. The last 20 pages contain a tutorial [arXiv:1407.4259] by Bienvenu and Shen on the coincidence of K-trivial and low for K, and related results. They formulate the golden run in game theoretic language.
