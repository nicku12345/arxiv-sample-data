We classify the ultrahomogeneous complete 3-edge-coloured graphs (3-graphs) with simple theory. This extends Lachlan's result (a corollary of the Effective Classification Theorem for stable structures) classifying the stable homogeneous 3-graphs.   The unstable structures in this class are:   + Primitive structures: The random 3-graph \Gamma^{i,j,k}   + Imprimitive structures with infinite classes:   * K_m^i[\Gamma^{j,k}], m\in\omega+1   * \Gamma^{i,j}[K_\omega^k]   * \mathcal B_n^{i,j}, n\in\omega, n\geq2   * \mathcal B^i   + Imprimitive structures with finite classes:   * C^i(\Gamma^{j,k})   * \Gamma^{i,j}[K_n^k], n\in\omega   Where \{i,j,k\}=\{R,S,T\}, \mathcal B_n^{i,j} is the random n-partite graph, and \mathcal B is the Fra\"iss\'e limit of the class of all finite 3-graphs in which the predicate i is an equivalence relation (i.e., the triangles iij and iik are forbidden). Finally, C^i(\Gamma^{j,k}) is the 3-graph obtained from the following construction: enumerate the Random Graph in predicates j,k as \{v_n:n\in\omega\}. For each vertex v_n, there are two vertices, a_n and b_n in C^i(\Gamma^{j,k}) which are i-related. There are no more i-edges, and if j(v_n,v_m) holds, declare j(a_n,a_m)\wedge j(b_n,b_m). All other edges are of type k.
