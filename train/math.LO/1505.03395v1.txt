Bounded stationary reflection at a cardinal \lambda is the assertion that every stationary subset of \lambda reflects but there is a stationary subset of \lambda that does not reflect at arbitrarily high cofinalities. We produce a variety of models in which bounded stationary reflection holds. These include models in which bounded stationary reflection holds at the successor of every singular cardinal \mu > \aleph_\omega and models in which bounded stationary reflection holds at \mu^+ but the approachability property fails at \mu.
