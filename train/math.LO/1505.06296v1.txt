We prove two \mathrm{ZFC} inequalities between cardinal invariants. The first inequality involves cardinal invariants associated with an analytic P-ideal, in particular the ideal of subsets of \omega of asymptotic density 0. We obtain an upper bound on the \ast-covering number, sometimes also called the weak covering number, of this ideal by proving in Section \ref{sec:covz0} that {\mathord{\mathrm{cov}}}^{\ast}({\mathcal{Z}}_{0}) \leq \mathfrak{d}. In Section \ref{sec:skbk} we investigate the relationship between the bounding and splitting numbers at regular uncountable cardinals. We prove in sharp contrast to the case when \kappa = \omega, that if \kappa is any regular uncountable cardinal, then {\mathfrak{s}}_{\kappa} \leq {\mathfrak{b}}_{\kappa}.
