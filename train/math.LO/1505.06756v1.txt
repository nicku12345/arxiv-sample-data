A set M\subset\mathbb{R} is microscopic if for each \varepsilon>0 there is a sequence of intervals (J_n)_{n\in\omega} covering M and such that |J_n|\leq \varepsilon^{n+1} for each n\in\omega. We show that there is a microscopic set which cannot be covered by a sequence (J_n)_{n\in\omega} with \{n\in\omega:J_n\neq\emptyset\} of lower asymptotic density zero. We prove (in ZFC) that additivity of the ideal of microscopic sets is \omega_1. This solves a problem of G. Horbaczewska. Finally, we discuss additivity of some generalizations of this ideal.
