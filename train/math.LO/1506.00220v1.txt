Let \mathbb{F}_2^\omega denote the countably infinite dimensional vector space over the two element field and \operatorname{GL}(\omega, 2) its automorphism group. Moreover, let \operatorname{Sym}(\mathbb{F}_2^\omega) denote the symmetric group acting on the elements of \mathbb{F}_2^\omega. It is shown that there are exactly four closed subgroups, G, such that \operatorname{GL}(\omega, 2)\leq G\leq \operatorname{Sym}(\mathbb{F}_2^\omega). As \mathbb{F}_2^\omega is an \omega-categorical (and homogeneous) structure, these groups correspond to the first order definable reducts of \mathbb{F}_2^\omega. These reducts are also analyzed. In the last section the closed groups containing the infinite symplectic group \operatorname{Sp}(\omega, 2) are classified.
