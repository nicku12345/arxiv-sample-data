If \langle \kappa_{n}: n<\omega \rangle is an increasing sequence of regular cardinals cofinal in \kappa, and \langle \mathbb{P}_n: n<\omega \rangle is a sequence of non-trivial separative forcing notions, such that each \mathbb{P}_n is \kappa_n-closed and of size < \kappa, then \prod_{n<\omega}\mathbb{P}_n collapses 2^\kappa into \kappa^+. The result answers a question of Sy Friedman.
