By classical results of Hurewicz, Kechris and Saint-Raymond, an analytic subset of a Polish space X is covered by a K_\sigma subset of X if and only if it does not contain a closed-in-X subset homeomorphic to the Baire space {}^\omega \omega. We consider the analogous statement (which we call Hurewicz dichotomy) for \Sigma^1_1 subsets of the generalized Baire space {}^\kappa \kappa for a given uncountable cardinal \kappa with \kappa=\kappa^{<\kappa}, and show how to force it to be true in a cardinal and cofinality preserving extension of the ground model. Moreover, we show that if the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) holds, then there is a cardinal preserving class-forcing extension in which the Hurewicz dichotomy for \Sigma^1_1 subsets of {}^\kappa \kappa holds at all uncountable regular cardinals \kappa, while strongly unfoldable and supercompact cardinals are preserved. On the other hand, in the constructible universe L the dichotomy for \Sigma^1_1 sets fails at all uncountable regular cardinals, and the same happens in any generic extension obtained by adding a Cohen real to a model of GCH. We also discuss connections with some regularity properties, like the \kappa-perfect set property, the \kappa-Miller measurability, and the \kappa-Sacks measurability.
