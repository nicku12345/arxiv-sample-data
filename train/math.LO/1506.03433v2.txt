We study conditions on automorphisms of Boolean algebras of the form P(\lambda)/I_\kappa (where \lambda is an uncountable cardinal and I_\kappa is the ideal of sets of cardinality less than \kappa) which allow one to conclude that a given automorphism is trivial. We show (among other things) that every cardinality-preserving automorphism of P(2^\kappa)/I_{\kappa^+} which is trivial on all sets of cardinality \kappa^+ is trivial, and that MA_{\aleph_1} implies that every automorphism of P(\mathbb{R})/Fin is trivial on a cocountable set.
