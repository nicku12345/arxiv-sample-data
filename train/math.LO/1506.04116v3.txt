We identify a premouse inner model L[\mathbb{E}], such that for any coarsely iterable background universe R modelling \mathrm{ZFC}, L[\mathbb{E}]^R is a proper class premouse of R inheriting all strong and Woodin cardinals from R. Moreover, for each \alpha\in\mathrm{OR}, L[\mathbb{E}]^R|\alpha is (\omega,\alpha)-iterable, via iteration trees which lift to coarse iteration trees on R.   We prove that (k+1)-condensation follows from (k+1)-solidity together with (k,\omega_1+1)-iterability (that is, roughly, iterability with respect to normal trees). We also prove that a slight weakening of (k+1)-condensation follows from (k,\omega_1+1)-iterability (without the (k+1)-solidity hypothesis).   The results depend on the theory of generalizations of bicephali, which we also develop.
