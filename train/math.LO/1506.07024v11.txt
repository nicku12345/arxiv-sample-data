We prove:   \mathbf{Theorem}   Let K be a universal class. If K is categorical in cardinals of arbitrarily high cofinality, then K is categorical on a tail of cardinals.   The proof stems from ideas of Adi Jarden and Will Boney, and also relies on a deep result of Shelah. As opposed to previous works, the argument is in ZFC and does not use the assumption of categoricity in a successor cardinal. The argument generalizes to abstract elementary classes (AECs) that satisfy a locality property and where certain prime models exist. Moreover assuming amalgamation we can give an explicit bound on the Hanf number and get rid of the cofinality restrictions:   \mathbf{Theorem}   Let K be an AEC with amalgamation. Assume that K is fully \operatorname{LS} (K)-tame and short and has primes over sets of the form M \cup \{a\}. Write H_2 := \beth_{\left(2^{\beth_{\left(2^{\operatorname{LS} (K)}\right)^+}}\right)^+}. If K is categorical in a \lambda > H_2, then K is categorical in all \lambda' \ge H_2.
