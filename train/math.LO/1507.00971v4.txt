Let \mathcal{F}=(F;+,\cdot,0,1,D) be a differentially closed field. We consider the question of definability of the derivation D in reducts of \mathcal{F} of the form \mathcal{F}_{R}=(F;+,\cdot,0,1,P)_{P \in R} where R is a collection of definable sets in \mathcal{F}. We give examples and non-examples and establish some criteria for definability of D. Finally, using the tools developed in the paper we prove that under the assumption of inductiveness of Th(\mathcal{F}_{R}) model completeness is a necessary condition for definability of D. This can be seen as part of a broader project where one is interested in finding Ax-Schanuel type inequalities (or predimension inequalities) for differential equations.
