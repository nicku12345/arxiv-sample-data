In this paper we prove:   Theorem 1. Let \mathcal{K} be an abstract elementary class which satisfies the joint embedding and amalgamation properties. Suppose \lambda>\mu\geq LS(\mathcal{K}) and \theta is a limit ordinal <\lambda^+. If \mathcal{K} is \mu superstable and \mu^+-superstable and satisfies \mu^+-symmetry, then for any increasing sequence \langle M_i\mid i<\theta\rangle of \mu^+-saturated models of cardinality \lambda, the model \bigcup_{i<\theta}M_i is \mu^+-saturated.
