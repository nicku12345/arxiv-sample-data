In this paper, we apply results of \cite{Va3} and use towers to transfer symmetry from \mu^+ down to \mu in superstable abstract elementary classes without using extra set-theoretic assumptions or tameness.   Theorem. Suppose \mathcal{K} is an abstract elementary class satisfying the amalgamation and joint embedding properties and that \mathcal{K} is both \mu- and \mu^+-superstable. If \mathcal{K} has symmetry for non-\mu^+-splitting, then \mathcal{K} has symmetry for non-\mu-splitting.   This is a new application of towers which were introduced by Shelah and Villaveces \cite{ShVi} and later used by VanDieren \cite{Va1}, \cite{Va2} and Grossberg, VanDieren, and Villaveces \cite{GVV} to prove the uniqueness of limit models.
