We prove:   Main Theorem: Let \mathcal{K} be an abstract elementary class satisfying the joint embedding and the amalgamation properties with no maximal models of cardinality \mu. Let \mu be a cardinal above the the L\"owenheim-Skolem number of the class. If \mathcal{K} is \mu-Galois-stable, has no \mu-Vaughtian Pairs, does not have long splitting chains, and satisfies locality of splitting, then any two (\mu,\sigma_\ell)-limits over M, for \ell\in\{1,2\}, are isomorphic over M.   This theorem extends results of Shelah from \cite{Sh394}, \cite{Sh576}, \cite{Sh600}, Kolman and Shelah in \cite{KoSh} and Shelah and Villaveces from \cite{ShVi}. A preliminary version of our uniqueness theorem, which was circulated in 2006, was used by Grossberg and VanDieren to prove a case of Shelah's categoricity conjecture for tame abstract elementary classes in \cite{GrVa2}. Preprints of this paper have also influenced the Ph.D. theses of Drueck \cite{Dr} and Zambrano \cite{Za}. This paper also serves the expository role of presenting together the arguments in \cite{Va1} and \cite{Va2} in a more natural context in which the amalgamation property holds and this work provides an approach to the uniqueness of limit models that does not rely on Ehrenfeucht-Mostowski constructions.
