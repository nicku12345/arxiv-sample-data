We show that dp-minimal valued fields are henselian and that a dp-minimal field admitting a definable type V topology is either real closed, algebraically closed or admits a non-trivial definable henselian valuation. We give classifications of dp-minimal ordered abelian groups and dp-minimal ordered fields without additional structure.
