We solve a well--known problem in the theory of compact scattered spaces and superatomic boolean algebras by showing that, under GCH and for each regular cardinal \kappa \geq \omega, there is a poset \mathcal P_\kappa preserving all cardinals and forcing the existence of a \kappa--thin very tall locally compact scattered space. For \kappa > \omega, we conceive the poset \mathcal P_\kappa as a higher analogue of the poset \mathcal P_\omega originally introduced by Asper\'{o} and Bagaria in the context of an (unpublished) alternative consistency proof.
