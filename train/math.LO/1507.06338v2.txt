We prove some existence results on parameterized strongly normal extensions for logarithmic equations. We generalize a result in [Wibmer, Existence of d-parameterized Picard-Vessiot extensions over fields with algebraically closed constants, J. Algebra, 361, 2012]. We also consider an extension of the results in [Kamensky and Pillay, Interpretations and differential Galois extensions, Preprint 2014] from the ODE case to the parameterized PDE case.
