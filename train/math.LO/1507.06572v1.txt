Ulm's Theorem presents invariants that classify countable abelian torsion groups up to isomorphism. Barwise and Eklof extended this result to the classification of arbitrary abelian torsion groups up to L_{\infty \omega}-equivalence. In this paper, we extend this classification to a class of mixed \mathbb{Z}_p-modules which includes all Warfield modules and is closed under L_{\infty\omega}-equivalence. The defining property of these modules is the existence of what we call a partial decomposition basis, a generalization of the concept of decomposition basis. We prove a complete classification theorem in L_{\infty\omega} using invariants deduced from the classical Ulm and Warfield invariants.
