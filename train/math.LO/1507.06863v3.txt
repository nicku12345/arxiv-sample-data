Let T be an NIP L-theory and T' be an enrichment. We give a sufficient condition on T' for the underlying L-type of any definable (respectively invariant) type over a model of T' to be definable (respectively invariant) as an L-type. Besides, we generalise work of Simon and Starchenko on the density of definable types among non forking types to this relative setting. These results are then applied to Scanlon's model completion of valued differential fields.
