Quasiminimal structures play an important role in non-elementary categoricity. In this paper we explore possibilities of constructing quasiminimal models of a given first-order theory. We present several constructions with increasing control of the properties of the outcome using increasingly stronger assumptions on the theory. We also establish an upper bound on the Hanf number of the existence of arbitrarily large quasiminimal models.
