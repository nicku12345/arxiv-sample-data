We point out a gap in Shelah's proof of the following result:   \mathbf{Claim}   Let K be an abstract elementary class categorical in unboundedly many cardinals. Then there exists a cardinal \lambda such that whenever M, N \in K have size at least \lambda, M \le N if and only if M \preceq_{L_{\infty, \text{LS} (K)^+}} N.   The importance of the claim lies in the following theorem, implicit in Shelah's work:   \mathbf{Theorem}   Assume the claim. Let K be an abstract elementary class categorical in unboundedly many cardinals. Then the class of \lambda such that:   1) K is categorical in \lambda;   2) K has amalgamation in \lambda; and   3) there is a good \lambda-frame with underlying class K_\lambda   is stationary.   We give a proof and discuss some related questions.
