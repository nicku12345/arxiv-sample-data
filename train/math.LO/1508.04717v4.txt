In this paper, we examine the locality condition for non-splitting and determine the level of uniqueness of limit models that can be recovered in some stable, but not superstable, abstract elementary classes. In particular we prove:   Suppose that K is an abstract elementary class satisfying   1. the joint embedding and amalgamation properties with no maximal model of cardinality \mu.   2. stabilty in \mu.   3. \kappa_{\mu}(K)<\mu^+.   4. continuity for non-\mu-splitting (i.e. if p\in gS(M) and M is a limit model witnessed by \langle M_i\mid i<\alpha\rangle for some limit ordinal \alpha<\mu^+ and there exists N so that p\restriction M_i does not \mu-split over N for all i<\alpha, then p does not \mu-split over N).   For \theta and \delta limit ordinals <\mu^+ both with cofinality \geq \kappa_{\mu}(K), if K satisfies symmetry for non-\mu-splitting (or just (\mu,\delta)-symmetry), then, for any M_1 and M_2 that are (\mu,\theta) and (\mu,\delta)-limit models over M_0, respectively, we have that M_1 and M_2 are isomorphic over M_0.
