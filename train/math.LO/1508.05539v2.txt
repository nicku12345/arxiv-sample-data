We consider the following dichotomy for \Sigma^0_2 finitary relations R on analytic subsets of the generalized Baire space for \kappa: either all R-independent sets are of size at most \kappa, or there is a \kappa-perfect R-independent set. This dichotomy is the uncountable version of a result found in (W. Kubi\'s, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 131 (2003), no 2.:619--623) and in (S. Shelah, Fund. Math. 159 (1999), no. 1:1--50). We prove that the above statement holds assuming \Diamond_\kappa and the set theoretical hypothesis I^-(\kappa), which is the modification of the hypothesis I(\kappa) suitable for limit cardinals. When \kappa is inaccessible, or when R is a closed binary relation, the assumption \Diamond_\kappa is not needed.   We obtain as a corollary the uncountable version of a result by G. S\'agi and the first author (Log. J. IGPL 20 (2012), no. 6:1064--1082) about the \kappa-sized models of a \Sigma^1_1(L_{\kappa^+\kappa})-sentence when considered up to isomorphism, or elementary embeddability, by elements of a K_\kappa subset of {}^\kappa\kappa. The role of elementary embeddings can be replaced by a more general notion that also includes embeddings, as well as the maps preserving L_{\lambda\mu} for \omega\leq\mu\leq\lambda\leq\kappa and the finite variable fragments of these logics.
