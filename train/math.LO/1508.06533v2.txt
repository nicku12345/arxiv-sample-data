We extend the hierarchy of finite-dimensional Ellentuck spaces to infinite dimensions. Using uniform barriers B on \omega as the prototype structures, we construct a class of continuum many topological Ramsey spaces \mathcal{E}_B which are Ellentuck-like in nature, and form a linearly ordered hierarchy under projection. We prove new Ramsey-classification theorems for equivalence relations on fronts, and hence also on barriers, on the spaces \mathcal{E}_B, extending the Pudlak-Rodl Theorem for barriers on the Ellentuck space.   The inspiration for these spaces comes from continuing the iterative construction of the forcings \mathcal{P}([\om]^k)/\Fin^{\otimes k} to the countable transfinite. The \sigma-closed partial order (\mathcal{E}_B, \sse^{\Fin^{B}}) is forcing equivalent to \mathcal{P}(B)/\Fin^{B}, which forces a non-p-point ultrafilter \mathcal{G}_B. The present work forms the basis for further work classifying the Rudin-Keisler and Tukey structures for the hierarchy of the generic ultrafilters \mathcal{G}_B.
