In [BKS15] examples of incomplete sentences are given with maximal models in more than one cardinality. The question was raised whether one can find similar examples of complete sentences.   In this paper we give examples of complete L_{\omega_1,\omega}-sentences with maximal models in more than one cardinality. From (homogeneous) characterizability of \kappa we construct sentences with maximal models in \kappa and in one of \kappa^+, \kappa^\omega, 2^\kappa and more. Indeed, consistently we find sentences with maximal models in uncountably many distinct cardinalities.
