For K an abstract elementary class with amalgamation and no maximal models, we show that categoricity in a high-enough cardinal implies structural properties such as the uniqueness of limit models and the existence of good frames. This improves several classical results of Shelah.   \mathbf{Theorem}   Let \mu \ge \text{LS} (K). If K is categorical in a \lambda \ge \beth_{\left(2^{\mu}\right)^+}, then:   1) Whenever M_0, M_1, M_2 \in K_\mu are such that M_1 and M_2 are limit over M_0, we have M_1 \cong_{M_0} M_2.   2) If \mu > \text{LS} (K), the model of size \lambda is \mu-saturated.   3) If \mu \ge \beth_{(2^{\text{LS} (K)})^+} and \lambda \ge \beth_{\left(2^{\mu^+}\right)^+}, then there exists a type-full good \mu-frame with underlying class the saturated models in K_\mu.   Our main tool is the symmetry property of splitting (previously isolated by the first author). The key lemma deduces symmetry from failure of the order property.
