Assume G is a definable group in a stable structure M. Newelski showed that the semigroup S_G(M) of complete types concentrated on G is an inverse limit of the \infty-definable (in M^{eq}) semigroups S_{G,\Delta}(M). He also shows that it is strongly \pi-regular: for every p\in S_{G,\Delta}(M) there exists n\in\mathbb{N} such that p^n is in a subgroup of S_{G,\Delta}(M). We show that S_{G,\Delta}(M) is in fact an intersection of definable semigroups, so S_G(M) is an inverse limit of definable semigroups and that the latter property is enjoyed by all \infty-definable semigroups in stable structures.
