Van Lambalgen's theorem states that a pair (\alpha,\beta) of bitsequences is Martin-L\"of random if and only if \alpha is Martin-L\"of random and \beta is Martin-L\"of random relative to \alpha. In [Information and Computation 209.2 (2011): 183-197, Theorem 3.3], Hayato Takahashi generalized van Lambalgen's theorem for computable measures P on a product of two Cantor spaces; he showed that the equivalence holds for each \beta for which the conditional probability P(\cdot | \beta) is computable. He asked whether this computability condition is necessary. We give a positive answer by providing a computable measure for which van Lambalgen's theorem fails. We also present a simple construction of a measure for which conditional measure is not computable. Such measures were first constructed by N. Ackerman, C. Freer and D. Roy in [Proceedings of the 26th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS), pp. 107-116. IEEE (2011)].
