A new case of Shelah's eventual categoricity conjecture is established:   \mathbf{Theorem}   Let K be an AEC with amalgamation. Write H_2 := \beth_{\left(2^{\beth_{\left(2^{\text{LS} (K)}\right)^+}}\right)^+}. Assume that K is H_2-tame and K_{\ge H_2} has primes over sets of the form M \cup \{a\}. If K is categorical in some \lambda > H_2, then K is categorical in all \lambda' \ge H_2.   The result had previously been established when the stronger locality assumptions of full tameness and shortness are also required.   An application of the method of proof of the theorem is that Shelah's categoricity conjecture holds in the context of homogeneous model theory (this was known, but our proof gives new cases):   \mathbf{Theorem}   Let D be a homogeneous diagram in a first-order theory T. If D is categorical in a \lambda > |T|, then D is categorical in all \lambda' \ge \min (\lambda, \beth_{(2^{|T|})^+}).
