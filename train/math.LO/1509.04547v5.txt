Given a set X of natural numbers, we may formalize "The formula \phi is a theorem of \omega-logic over the theory T using an oracle for X" by an expression [{\sf I}|X]_T \phi, defined using a least fixed point in the language of second-order arithmetic. We will prove that the consistency and reflection principles arising from this notion of provability lead to axiomatizations of \Pi^1_1-CA_0 and \Pi^1_1-CA_0 with bar induction. We compare this to well-known results that reflection for \omega-derivable formulas and \omega-model reflection are equivalent to bar induction.
