In this paper we generalize the Aldous-Hoover-Kallenberg theorem concerning representations of distributions of exchangeable arrays via collections of measurable maps. We give criteria when such a representation theorem exists for arrays which need only be preserved by a closed subgroup of \Sym{\Nats}. Specifically, for a countable structure \M we introduce the notion of an \emph{\Aut(\M)-recipe}, which is an \Aut(\M)-invariant array obtained via a collection of measurable functions indexed by the \Aut(\M)-orbits in \M. We further introduce the notion of a \emph{free structure} and then show that if \M is free then every \Aut(\M)-invariant measure on an \Aut(\M)-space is the distribution of an \Aut(\M)-recipe. We also show that if a measure is the distribution of an \Aut(\M)-recipe it must be the restriction of a measure on a free structure.
