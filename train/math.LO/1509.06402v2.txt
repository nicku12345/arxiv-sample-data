This article introduces a line of investigation into connections between creature forcings and topological Ramsey spaces. Three examples of sets of pure candidates for creature forcings are shown to contain dense subsets which are actually topological Ramsey spaces. A new variant of the product tree Ramsey theorem is proved in order to obtain the pigeonhole principles for two of these examples.
