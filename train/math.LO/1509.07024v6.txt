We show how to build primes models in classes of saturated models of abstract elementary classes (AECs) having a well-behaved independence relation:   \mathbf{Theorem.}   Let K be an almost fully good AEC that is categorical in \text{LS} (K) and has the \text{LS} (K)-existence property for domination triples. For any \lambda > \text{LS} (K), the class of Galois saturated models of K of size \lambda has prime models over every set of the form M \cup \{a\}.   This generalizes an argument of Shelah, who proved the result when \lambda is a successor cardinal.
