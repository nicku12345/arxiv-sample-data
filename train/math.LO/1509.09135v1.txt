We show the equivalence between the existence of winning strategies for G_{\delta \sigma} (also called \Sigma^{0}_{3}) games in Cantor or Baire space, and the existence of functions generalized-recursive in a higher type-2 functional. (Such recursions are associated with certain transfinite computational models.) We show, inter alia, that the set of indices of convergent recursions in this sense is a complete \Game \Sigma_{3}^{0} set: as paraphrase, the listing of those games at this level that are won by player I, essentially has the same information as the `halting problem' for this notion of recursion. Moreover the strategies for the first player in such games are recursive in this sense. We thereby establish the ordinal length of monotone \Game \Sigma^{0}_{3}-inductive operators, and characterise the first ordinal where such strategies are to be found in the constructible hierarchy.   In summary:   Theorem (a) The following sets are recursively isomorphic.   (i) The complete ittm-semi-recursive-in-{eJ} set, H^{eJ};   (ii) the \Sigma_{1}-theory of ( L_{\eta_{0}} , \in ) , where \eta_{0} is the closure ordinal of \Game \Sigma_{3}^{0}-monotone induction;   (iii) the complete \Game \Sigma_{3}^{0} set of integers.   (b) The ittm-recursive-in-{eJ} sets of integers are precisely those of L_{\eta_{0}}.
