In previous work, we have introduced and studied a lifting property in congruence--distributive universal algebras which we have defined based on the Boolean congruences of such algebras, and which we have called the Congruence Boolean Lifting Property. In a similar way, a lifting property based on factor congruences can be defined in congruence--distributive algebras; in this paper we introduce this property, which we have called the Factor Congruence Lifting Property, and study it, partly in relation to the Congruence Boolean Lifting Property, and to other lifting properties in particular classes of algebras.
