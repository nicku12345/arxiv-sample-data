I prove several theorems concerning upward closure and amalgamation in the generic multiverse of a countable transitive model of set theory. Every such model W has forcing extensions W[c] and W[d] by adding a Cohen real, which cannot be amalgamated in any further extension, but some nontrivial forcing notions have all their extensions amalgamable. An increasing chain W[G_0]\subseteq W[G_1]\subseteq\cdots has an upper bound W[H] if and only if the forcing had uniformly bounded essential size in W. Every chain W\subseteq W[c_0]\subseteq W[c_1]\subseteq\cdots of extensions adding Cohen reals is bounded above by W[d] for some W-generic Cohen real d.
