Relativization is one of the central topics in the study of algebras of relations. Some relativized relation algebras behave much nicer than the original relation algebras. In this paper, we study the atomicity of the finitely generated free algebras of these nice classes of relativized relation algebras. In particular, we give an answer for the open problem, posed by I. Nemeti in 1985, which asks whether the finitely generated free algebras of the class of the weak associative relation algebras WA are atomic or not.
