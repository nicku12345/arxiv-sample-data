The paper treats 4 different fragments of first-order logic induced by their respective versions of Kripke style semantics for modal intuitionistic logic. In order to capture these fragments, the notion of asimulation is modified and extended to yield Van Benthem type of semantic characterization of their respective expressive powers. It is shown, further, that this characterization can be easily carried over to arbitrary first-order definable subclasses of classical first-order models.
