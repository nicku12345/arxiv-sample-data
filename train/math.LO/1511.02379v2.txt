We prove that if T is a complete theory with weak elimination of imaginaries, then there is an explicit bijection between strict independence relations for T and strict independence relations for T^{\text{eq}}. We use this observation to show that if T is the theory of the Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} limit of finite metric spaces with integer distances, then T^{\text{eq}} has more than one strict independence relation. This answers a question of Adler [1, Question 1.7].
