We provide a model where u(\kappa) < 2^{\kappa} for a supercompact cardinal \kappa. Garti and Shelah have provided a sketch of how to obtain such a model by modifying the construction in a paper of Dzamonja and Shelah; we provide here a complete proof using a different modification and further study the values of other natural generalizations of classical cardinal characteristics in our model. For this purpose we generalize some standard facts that hold in the countable case as well as some classical forcing notions and their properties.
