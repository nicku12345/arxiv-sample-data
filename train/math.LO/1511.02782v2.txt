We shall construct by ordinary recursion method subsets to the set D of G\"odel numbers of the sentences of a language \mathcal L. That language is formed by sentences of a fully interpreted formal language L, called an MA language, and sentences containing a monadic predicate letter T. From the class of the constructed subsets of D we extract one set U by transfinite recursion method. Interpret those sentences whose G\"odel numbers are in U as true, and their negations as false. These sentences together form an MA language. It is a sublanguage of \mathcal L having L as its sublanguage, and T is its truth predicate.
