We study the existence of non-separable compact spaces that support a measure and are small from the topological point of view. In particular, we show that under Martin's axiom there is a non-separable compact space supporting a measure which has countable \pi-character and which cannot be mapped continuously onto [0,1]^{\omega_1}. On the other hand, we prove that in the random model there is no non-separable compact space having countable \pi-character and supporting a measure.
