We show that there is a strong connection between Weihrauch reducibility on one hand, and provability in EL_0, the intuitionistic version of RCA_0, on the other hand. More precisely, we show that Weihrauch reducibility to the composition of finitely many instances of a theorem is captured by provability in EL_0 together with Markov's principle, and that Weihrauch reducibility is captured by an affine subsystem of EL_0 plus Markov's principle.
