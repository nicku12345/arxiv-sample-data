We make explicit certain results around the Galois correspondence in the context of definable automorphism groups, and point out the relation to some recent papers dealing with the Galois theory of algebraic differential equations when the constants are not "closed" in suitable senses. We also improve the definitions and results on generalized strongly normal extensions.
