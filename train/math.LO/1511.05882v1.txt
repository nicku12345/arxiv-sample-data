Abashidze and Blass independently proved that the modal logic \sf{GL} is complete for its topological interpretation over any ordinal greater than or equal to \omega^\omega equipped with the interval topology. Icard later introduced a family of topologies \mathcal I_\lambda for \lambda < \omega, with the purpose of providing semantics for Japaridze's polymodal logic \sf{GLP} _{\omega}. Icard's construction was later extended by Joosten and the second author to arbitrary ordinals \lambda \geq \omega.   We further generalize Icard topologies in this article. Given a scattered space \mathfrak X = (X, \tau) and an ordinal \lambda, we define a topology \tau_{+\lambda} in such a way that \tau_{+0} is the original topology \tau and \tau_{+\lambda} coincides with \mathcal I_\lambda when \mathfrak X is an ordinal endowed with the left topology.   We then prove that, given any scattered space \mathfrak X and any ordinal \lambda>0 such that the rank of (X, \tau) is large enough, \sf{GL} is strongly complete for \tau_{+\lambda}. One obtains the original Abashidze-Blass theorem as a consequence of the special case where \mathfrak X=\omega^\omega and \lambda=1.
