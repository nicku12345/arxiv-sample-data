The paper continues the line of model-theoretic characterizations for versions of intuitionistic logic previously achieved by the author, further generalizing them. This results in a model-theoretic characterization of expressive powers of arbitrary finite sets of guarded connectives of degree not exceeding 1 and regular connectives of degree 2 over the language of bounded lattices.
