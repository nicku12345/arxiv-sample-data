We consider global analogues of model-theoretic tree properties. The main objects of study are the invariants related to Shelah's tree property \kappa_{\text{cdt}}(T), \kappa_{\text{sct}}(T), and \kappa_{\text{inp}}(T) and the relations that obtain between them. From strong colorings, we construct theories T with \kappa_{\text{cdt}}(T) > \kappa_{\text{sct}}(T) + \kappa_{\text{inp}}(T). We show that these invariants have distinct structural consequences, by investigating the decay of saturation in ultrapowers of models of T, where T is some theory with \kappa_{\text{cdt}}(T), \kappa_{\text{sct}}(T), or \kappa_{\text{inp}}(T) large and bounded. This answers some questions of Shelah.
