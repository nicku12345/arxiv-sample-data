The following will be shown: Let I be a \sigma-ideal on a Polish space X with the property that the associated forcing of I^+ Borel subsets ordered by \subseteq is a proper forcing. Let E be an analytic or coanalytic equivalence relation on this Polish space with all equivalence classes Borel. If sharps of certain sets exist, then there is an I^+ Borel subset C of X such that E \upharpoonright C is a Borel equivalence relation.
