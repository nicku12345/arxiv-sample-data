A set G \subseteq \omega is n-generic for a positive integer n if and only if every \Sigma^0_n formula of G is decided by a finite initial segment of G in the sense of Cohen forcing. It is shown here that every n-generic set G is properly \Sigma^0_n in some G-recursive X. As a corollary, we also prove that for every n > 1 and every n-generic set G there exists a G-recursive X which is generalized {\rm low}_n but not generalized {\rm low}_{n-1}. Thus we confirm two conjectures of Jockusch.
