The paper proves finite model property and decidability for a family of modal logics. A binary relation R is called pretransitive, if R^*=\cup_{i\leq m} R^i for some m\geq 0, where R^* is the transitive reflexive closure of R. By the height of (W,R) we mean the height of the preorder (W,R^*). Special partitionings (filtrations) are described for pretransitive frames of finite height, which implies finite model property and decidability of logics of these frames.
