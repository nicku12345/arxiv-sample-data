In this paper the lightface \Pi^{1}_{1}-Comprehension axiom is shown to be proof-theoretically strong even over \mbox{RCA}_{0}^{*}, and we calibrate the proof-theoretic ordinals of weak fragments of the theory \mbox{ID}_{1} of positive inductive definitions over natural numbers. Conjunctions of negative and positive formulas in the transfinite induction axiom of \mbox{ID}_{1} are shown to be weak, and disjunctions are strong. Thus we draw a boundary line between predicatively reducible and impredicative fragments of \mbox{ID}_{1}.
