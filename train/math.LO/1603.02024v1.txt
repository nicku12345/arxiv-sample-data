Assuming that every set is constructible, we find a \Pi^1_1 maximal cofinitary group of permutations of \mathbb N which is indestructible by Cohen forcing. Thus we show that the existence of such groups is consistent with arbitrarily large continuum. Our method also gives a new proof, inspired by the forcing method, of Kastermans' result that there exists a \Pi^1_1 maximal cofinitary group in L.
