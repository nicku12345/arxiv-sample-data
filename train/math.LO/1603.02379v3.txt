We show that Shelah cardinals are preserved under the canonical GCH forcing notion. We also show that if GCH holds and F:REG\rightarrow CARD is an Easton function which satisfies some weak properties, then there exists a cofinality preserving generic extension of the universe which preserves Shelah cardinals and satisfies \forall \kappa\in REG,~ 2^{\kappa}=F(\kappa). This gives a partial answer to a question asked by Cody [1] and independently by Honzik [5]. We also prove an indestructibility result for Shelah cardinals.
