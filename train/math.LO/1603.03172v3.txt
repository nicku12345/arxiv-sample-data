We determine the profinite completions of MV-algebras, and obtain a description that generalizes the well known profinite completions of Boolean algebras as the power sets of their Stone spaces. We also use the description found to characterize profinite MV-algebras that are isomorphic to the profinite completion of an MV-algebra. Finally, MV-algebras for which the profinite Completion and MacNeille completion are isomorphic are characterized.
