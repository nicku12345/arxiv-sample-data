Until the 1970s, proof theoretic investigations were mainly concerned with theories of inductive definitions, subsystems of analysis and finite type systems. With the pioneering work of Gerhard Jaeger in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the focus switched to set theories, furnishing ordinal-theoretic proof theory with a uniform and elegant framework. More recently it was shown that these tools can even sometimes be adapted to the context of strong axioms such as the powerset axiom, where one does not attain complete cut elimination but can nevertheless extract witnessing information and characterize the strength of the theory in terms of provable heights of the cumulative hierarchy. Here this technology is applied to intuitionistic Kripke-Platek set theories IKP(P) and IKP(E), where the operation of powerset and exponentiation, respectively, is allowed as a primitive in the separation and collection schemata. In particular, IKP(P) proves the powerset axiom whereas IKP(E) proves the exponentiation axiom. The latter expresses that given any sets A and B, the collection of all functions from A to B is a set, too. While IKP(P) can be dealt with in a similar vein as its classical cousin, the treatment of IKP(E) posed considerable obstacles. One of them was that in the infinitary system the levels of terms become a moving target as they cannot be assigned a fixed level in the formal cumulative hierarchy solely based on their syntactic structure. As adumbrated in an earlier paper, the results of this paper are an important tool in showing that several intuitionistic set theories with the collection axiom possess the existence property, i.e., if they prove an existential theorem then a witness can be provably described in the theory, one example being intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with bounded separation.
