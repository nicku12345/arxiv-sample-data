A poset is representable if it can be embedded in a field of sets in such a way that existing finite meets and joins become intersections and unions respectively (we say finite meets and joins are preserved). More generally, for cardinals \alpha and \beta a poset is said to be (\alpha,\beta)-representable if an embedding into a field of sets exists that preserves meets of sets smaller than \alpha and joins of sets smaller than \beta. We show using an ultraproduct/ultraroot argument that when 2\leq\alpha,\beta\leq \omega the class of (\alpha,\beta)-representable posets is elementary, but does not have a finite axiomatization in the case where either \alpha or \beta=\omega. We also show that the classes of posets with representations preserving either countable or all meets and joins are pseudoelementary.
