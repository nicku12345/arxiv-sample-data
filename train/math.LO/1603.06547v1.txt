We prove the algorithmic canonicity of two classes of \mu-inequalities in a constructive meta-theory of normal lattice expansions. This result simultaneously generalizes Conradie and Craig's canonicity for \mu-inequalities based on a bi-intuitionistic bi-modal language, and Conradie and Palmigiano's constructive canonicity for inductive inequalities (restricted to normal lattice expansions to keep the page limit). Besides the greater generality, the unification of these strands smoothes the existing treatments for the canonicity of \mu-formulas and inequalities. In particular, the rules of the algorithm ALBA used for this result have exactly the same formulation as those of Conradie and Palmigiano, with no additional rule added specifically to handle the fixed point binders. Rather, fixed points are accounted for by certain restrictions on the application of the rules, concerning the order-theoretic properties of the term functions associated with the formulas to which the rules are applied.
