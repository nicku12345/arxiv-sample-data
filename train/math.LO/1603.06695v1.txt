We classify a sharp phase transition threshold for Friedman's finite adjacent Ramsey theorem. We extend the method for showing this result to two previously known classifications involving Ramsey theorem variants: the Paris--Harrington theorem and the Kanamori--McAloon theorem. We also provide tools to remove ad-hoc arguments from the proofs of phase transition results as much as currently possible.
