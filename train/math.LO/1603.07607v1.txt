The aim of this article is a deepening of quantification notions in the aspect of the modular logic. Therefore, it approaches modulated logic of the plausible that seeks to formalize the quantifier of ubiquity. The text presents a proposal, introduced by Paul Halmos, to interpret a classical quantifier in algebraic models and as a original contribution, extends this model to an algebraic model for the quantifier of ubiquity.
