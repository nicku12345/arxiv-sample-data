We consider the strength and effective content of restricted versions of Hindman's Theorem in which the number of colors is specified and the length of the sums has a specified finite bound. Let \mathsf{HT}^{\leq n}_k denote the assertion that for each k-coloring c of \mathbb{N} there is an infinite set X \subseteq \mathbb{N} such that all sums \sum_{x \in F} x for F \subseteq X and 0 < |F| \leq n have the same color. We prove that there is a computable 2-coloring c of \mathbb{N} such that there is no infinite computable set X such that all nonempty sums of at most 2 elements of X have the same color. It follows that \mathsf{HT}^{\leq 2}_2 is not provable in \mathsf{RCA}_0 and in fact we show that it implies \mathsf{SRT}^2_2 in \mathsf{RCA}_0. We also show that there is a computable instance of \mathsf{HT}^{\leq 3}_3 with all solutions computing 0'. The proof of this result shows that \mathsf{HT}^{\leq 3}_3 implies \mathsf{ACA}_0 in \mathsf{RCA}_0.
