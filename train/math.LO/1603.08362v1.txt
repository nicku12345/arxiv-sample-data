The two parallel concepts of "small" sets of the real line are meagre sets and null sets. Those are equivalent to Cohen forcing and Random real forcing for aleph_0^aleph_0; in spite of this similarity, the Cohen forcing and Random Real Forcing have very different shapes. One of these differences is in the fact that the Cohen forcing has an easy natural generalization for lambda 2 while lambda greater than aleph 0, corresponding to an extension for the meagre sets, while the Random real forcing didn't seem to have a natural generalization, as Lebesgue measure doesn't have a generalization for space 2 lambda while lambda greater than aleph 0. In work [1], Shelah found a forcing resembling the properties of Random Real Forcing for 2 lambda while lambda is a weakly compact cardinal. Here we describe, with additional assumptions, such a forcing for 2 lambda while lambda is an Inaccessible Cardinal; this forcing is less than lambda-complete and satisfies the lambda^+-c.c hence preserves cardinals and cofinalities, however unlike Cohen forcing, does not add an undominated real.
