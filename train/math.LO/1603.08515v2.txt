We extend the theory of unified correspondence to a very broad class of logics with algebraic semantics given by varieties of normal lattice expansions (LEs), also known as `lattices with operators'. Specifically, we introduce a very general syntactic definition of the class of Sahlqvist formulas and inequalities, which applies uniformly to each LE-signature and is given purely in terms of the order-theoretic properties of the algebraic interpretations of the logical connectives. Together with this, we introduce a variant of the algorithm ALBA, specific to the setting of LEs, which effectively computes first-order correspondents of LE-inequalities, and is guaranteed to succeed on a wide class of inequalities (the so-called inductive inequalities) which significantly extend the Sahlqvist class. Further, we show that every inequality on which ALBA succeeds is canonical. The projection of these results yields state-of-the-art correspondence theory for many well known substructural logics, such as the Lambek calculus and its extensions, the Lambek-Grishin calculus, the logic of (not necessarily distributive) de Morgan lattices, and the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic.
