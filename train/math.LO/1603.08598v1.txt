We prove that the theory of a Henselian valued field of characteristic zero, with finite ramification, and whose value group is a Z-group, is model-complete in the language of rings if the theory of its residue field is model-complete in the language of rings. We apply this to prove that every infinite algebraic extension of the field of p-adic numbers \Bbb Q_p with finite ramification is model-complete in the language of rings. For this, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for model-completeness of the theory of a perfect pseudo-algebraically closed field with pro-cyclic absolute Galois group.
