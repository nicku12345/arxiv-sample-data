Carlson introduced the notion of a Ramsey space as a generalization to the Ellentuck space. When a Ramsey space is induced by an algebra, Carlson suggested a study of its purely combinatorial version now called Ramsey algebra. Some basic results for homogeneous algebras have been obtained. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a Ramsey algebra for heterogeneous algebras and derive some basic results. Then, we study the Ramsey-algebraic properties of vector spaces.
