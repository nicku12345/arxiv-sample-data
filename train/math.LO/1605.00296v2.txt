Let \mathbb{Q} denote the poset which adds a Cohen real then shoots a club through the complement of \big( [\omega_2]^\omega \big)^V with countable conditions. We prove that the version of Strong Chang's Conjecture from \cite{MR2965421} implies semiproperness of \mathbb{Q}, and that semiproperness of \mathbb{Q}---in fact semiproperness of any poset which is sufficiently \emph{nonreasonable} in the sense of Foreman-Magidor~\cite{MR1359154}---implies the version of Strong Chang's Conjecture from \cite{MR2723878} and \cite{MR1261218}. In particular, semiproperness of \mathbb{Q} has large cardinal strength, which answers a question of Friedman-Krueger~\cite{MR2276627}. One corollary of our work is that the version of Strong Chang's Conjecture from \cite{MR2965421} does not imply the existence of a precipitous ideal on \omega_1.
