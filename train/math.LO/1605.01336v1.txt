We propose in this article a definition of a MV-algebra structure on a class of subsets of some probability spaces and we work-out some examples. Our intention is to convey, by mean of the simplest possible examples, the idea that the topology of the geometric object under consideration might be reflected in the MV-algebraic structure. We also discuss an example of Chang and discuss similarities and differences with the proposed class of examples.
