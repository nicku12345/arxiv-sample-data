In this paper, we introduce some epistemic extensions of G\"odel fuzzy logic whose Kripke-based semantics have fuzzy truth values for propositions and also fuzzy accessibility relations such that soundness and completeness hold. We adopt belief as our epistemic operator, and then overview some fuzzy implications to justify the semantics defined for belief is appropriate. We propose a fuzzy version of the traditional muddy children problem and apply it to show that positive and negative introspections are not valid. In the sequel, we establish some Hilbert-style epistemic-fuzzy derivation systems K_F, B_F, T_F, B_F^n, and T_F^n, then prove that these extensions are sound and complete with respect to proper class of Kripke-based models.
