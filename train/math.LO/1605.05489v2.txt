We investigate questions involving Aronszajn trees, square principles, and stationary reflection. We first consider two strengthenings of \square(\kappa) introduced by Brodsky and Rinot for the purpose of constructing \kappa-Souslin trees. Answering a question of Rinot, we prove that the weaker of these strengthenings is compatible with stationary reflection at \kappa but the stronger is not. We then prove that, if \mu is a singular cardinal, \square_\mu implies the existence of a special \mu^+-tree with a \mathrm{cf}(\mu)-ascent path, thus answering a question of L\"ucke.
