We ask whether \mathbf{\Delta^1_2} or \mathbf{\Sigma^1_2} equivalence relations with I-small classes for I a \sigma-ideal must have perfectly many classes. We show that for a wide class of ccc \sigma-ideals, a positive answer for \mathbf{\Delta^1_2} equivalence relations is equivalent to the I-measurability of \mathbf{\Delta^1_2} sets. However, the analogous statement for \mathbf{\Sigma^1_2} equivalence relations is false: \mathbf{\Sigma^1_2} equivalence relations with meager classes have a perfect set of pairwise inequivalent elements if and only if \mathbf{\Delta^1_2} sets have the Baire property.
