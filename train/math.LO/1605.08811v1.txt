This thesis consists of two parts: the construction of a jointly universal family of graphs, and then an exploration of set-theoretic geology.   Firstly we shall construct a model in which 2^{\aleph_{\omega_1}}=2^{\aleph_{\omega_1+1}}=\aleph_{\omega_1+3} but there is a jointly universal family of size \aleph_{\omega_1+2} of graphs on \aleph_{\omega_1+1}. We take a supercompact cardinal \kappa and will use Radin forcing with interleaved collapses to change \kappa into \aleph_{\omega_1}. Prior to the Radin forcing we perform a preparatory iteration to add functions from \kappa^+ into Radin names for what will become members of the jointly universal family on \kappa^+. The same technique can be used with any uncountable cardinal in place of \omega_1.   Secondly we explore various topics in set-theoretic geology. We begin by showing that a class Easton support iteration of \mathrm{Add}(\kappa,1) at \kappa regular results in a universe that is its own generic mantle. We then consider set forcings \mathbb{P}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R} and \mathbb{S} with respective generics G, H, I and J such that V[G][I]=V[H][J] and show that V[G] and V[H] must have a shared ground via (|\mathbb{R}|+|\mathbb{S}|)^+-cc forcing. This allows a similar analysis of the related situation when \mathbb{P} is replaced by a class iteration and V[H] by a generic ground of V[G]. We conclude with a simple characterisation of the mantle of a class forcing extension, and an investigation of the possibilities for a version of the intermediate model theorem that applies to class forcing.
