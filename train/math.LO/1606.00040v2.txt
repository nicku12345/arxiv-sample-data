An ideal I on a cardinal \kappa is called \emph{rigid} if all automorphisms of P(\kappa)/I are trivial. An ideal is called \emph{\mu-minimal} if whenever G\subseteq P(\kappa)/I is generic and X\in P(\mu)^{V[G]}\setminus V, it follows that V[X]=V[G]. We prove that the existence of a rigid saturated \mu-minimal ideal on \mu^+, where \mu is a regular cardinal, is consistent relative to the existence of large cardinals. The existence of such an ideal implies that GCH fails. However, we show that the existence of a rigid saturated ideal on \mu^+, where \mu is an \emph{uncountable} regular cardinal, is consistent with GCH relative to the existence of an almost-huge cardinal. Addressing the case \mu=\omega, we show that the existence of a rigid \emph{presaturated} ideal on \omega_1 is consistent with CH relative to the existence of an almost-huge cardinal. The existence of a \emph{precipitous} rigid ideal on \mu^+ where \mu is an uncountable regular cardinal is equiconsistent with the existence of a measurable cardinal.
