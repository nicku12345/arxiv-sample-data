We give several new examples of computable structures of high Scott rank. For earlier known computable structures of Scott rank \omega_1^{CK}, the computable infinitary theory is \aleph_0-categorical. Millar and Sacks asked whether this was always the case. We answer this question by constructing an example whose computable infinitary theory has non-isomorphic countable models.   The standard known computable structures of Scott rank \omega_1^{CK}+1 have infinite indiscernible sequences. We give two constructions with no indiscernible ordered triple.
