Let (K;+,\cdot, ', 0, 1) be a differentially closed field. In this paper we explore the connection between Ax-Schanuel type theorems (predimension inequalities) for a differential equation E(x,y) and the geometry of the set U:=\{ y:E(t,y) \wedge y' \neq 0 \} where t is an element with t'=1. We show that certain types of predimension inequalities imply strong minimality and geometric triviality of U. Moreover, the induced structure on Cartesian powers of U is given by special subvarieties. If E has some special form then all fibres U_s:=\{ y:E(s,y) \wedge y' \neq 0 \} (with s non-constant) have the same properties. In particular, since the j-function satisfies an Ax-Schanuel theorem of the required form (due to Pila and Tsimerman), our results will give another proof for a theorem of Freitag and Scanlon stating that the differential equation of j defines a strongly minimal set with trivial geometry (which is not \aleph_0-categorical though).
