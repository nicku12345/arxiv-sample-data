For a class \mathcal K of countable relational structures, a countable Borel equivalence relation E is said to be \mathcal K-structurable if there is a Borel way to put a structure in \mathcal K on each E-equivalence class. We study in this paper the global structure of the classes of \mathcal K-structurable equivalence relations for various \mathcal K. We show that \mathcal K-structurability interacts well with several kinds of Borel homomorphisms and reductions commonly used in the classification of countable Borel equivalence relations. We consider the poset of classes of \mathcal K-structurable equivalence relations for various \mathcal K, under inclusion, and show that it is a distributive lattice; this implies that the Borel reducibility preordering among countable Borel equivalence relations contains a large sublattice. Finally, we consider the effect on \mathcal K-structurability of various model-theoretic properties of \mathcal K. In particular, we characterize the \mathcal K such that every \mathcal K-structurable equivalence relation is smooth, answering a question of Marks.
