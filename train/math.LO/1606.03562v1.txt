In this paper we present analytic tableau proof systems for various justification logics. We show that the tableau systems are sound and complete with respect to Mkrtychev models. In order to prove the completeness of the tableaux, we give a syntactic proof of cut elimination. We also show the subformula property for our tableaux, and prove the decidability of justification logics for finite constant specifications.
