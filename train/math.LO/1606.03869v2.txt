We give an algebraic characterization of pre-Hilbert spaces with an orthonormal basis. This characterization is used to show that there are pre-Hilbert spaces X of dimension and density \lambda for any uncountable \lambda without any orthonormal basis.   Let us call a pre-Hilbert space without any orthonormal bases pathological. The pair of the cardinals \kappa\leq\lambda such that there is a pre-Hilbert space of dimension \kappa and density \lambda are known to be characterized by the inequality \lambda\leq\kappa^{\aleph_0}. Our result implies that there are pathological pre-Hilbert spaces with dimension \kappa and density \lambda for all combinations of such \kappa and \lambda including the case \kappa=\lambda.   A Singular Compactness Theorem on pathology of pre-Hilbert spaces is obtained. A reflection theorem asserting that for any pathological pre-Hilbert space X there are stationarily many pathological sub-inner-product-spaces Y of X of smaller density is shown to be equivalent with Fodor-type Reflection Principle (FRP).
