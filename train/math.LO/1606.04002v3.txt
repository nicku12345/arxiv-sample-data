Given a model \mathcal{M} of set theory, and a nontrivial automorphism j of \mathcal{M}, let \mathcal{I}_{\mathrm{fix}}(j) be the submodel of \mathcal{M} whose universe consists of elements m of \mathcal{M} such that j(x)=x for every x in the transitive closure of m (where the transitive closure of m is computed within \mathcal{M}). Here we study the class \mathcal{C} of structures of the form \mathcal{I}_{\mathrm{fix}}(j), where the ambient model \mathcal{M} satisfies a frugal yet robust fragment of \mathrm{ZFC} known as \mathrm{MOST}, and j(m)=m whenever m is a finite ordinal in the sense of \mathcal{M}. We show that every structure in \mathcal{C} satisfies \mathrm{MOST}+\Delta_0^\mathcal{P}\textrm{-Collection}. We also show that the following countable structures are in \mathcal{C}: (a) transitive models of \mathrm{MOST}+\Delta_0^\mathcal{P}\textrm{-Collection}, (b) recursively saturated models of \mathrm{MOST}+\Delta_0^\mathcal{P}\textrm{-Collection}, (c) models of \mathrm{ZFC}. It follows from (b) that the theory of \mathcal{C} is precisely \mathrm{MOST+\Delta}_{0}^{\mathcal{P}}-Collection. We conclude by proving a refinement of a result due to Amir Togha.
