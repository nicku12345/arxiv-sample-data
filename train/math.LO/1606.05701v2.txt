A set A is coarsely computable with density r \in [0,1] if there is an algorithm for deciding membership in A which always gives a (possibly incorrect) answer, and which gives a correct answer with density at least r. To any Turing degree \mathbf{a} we can assign a value \Gamma_T(\mathbf{a}): the minimum, over all sets A in \mathbf{a}, of the highest density at which A is coarsely computable. The closer \Gamma_T(\mathbf{a}) is to 1, the closer \mathbf{a} is to being computable. Andrews, Cai, Diamondstone, Jockush, and Lempp noted that \Gamma_T can take on the values 0, 1/2, and 1, but not any values in strictly between 1/2 and 1. They asked whether the value of \Gamma_T can be strictly between 0 and 1/2. This is the Gamma question.   Replacing Turing degrees by many-one degrees, we get an analogous question, and the same arguments show that \Gamma_m can take on the values 0, 1/2, and 1, but not any values strictly between 1/2 and 1. We will show that for any r \in [0,1/2], there is an m-degree \mathbf{a} with \Gamma_m(\mathbf{a}) = r. Thus the range of \Gamma_m is [0,1/2] \cup \{1\}.   Benoit Monin has recently announced a solution to the Gamma question for Turing degrees. Interestingly, his solution gives the opposite answer: the only possible values of \Gamma_T are 0, 1/2, and 1.
