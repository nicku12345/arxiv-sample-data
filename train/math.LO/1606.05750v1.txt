In the context of Hrushovski constructions we take a language  \mathcal{L}  with a ternary relation  R  and consider the theory of the generic models  M^{*}_{\alpha},  of the class of finite  \mathcal{L}-structures equipped with predimension functions  \delta_{\alpha},  for  \alpha\in(0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q} . The theory of generic structures of non-AC smooth classes have been investigated from different points of view, including decidability and their power in interpreting known structures and theories. For a rational  \alpha\in(0,1],  first we prove that the theory of  M^{*}_{\alpha}  admits a quantifier elimination down to a meaningful class of formulas, called \textit{closure formulas}; and on the other hand we prove that  Th(M^{*}_{\alpha})  does not have the finite model property.
