We establish the decidability of the \Sigma_2 theory of both the arithmetic and hyperarithmetic degrees in the language of uppersemilattices i.e. the language with \leq, 0 and \sqcup. This is achieved by using Kumabe-Slaman forcing - along with other known results - to show that given finite uppersemilattices \mathcal{M} and \mathcal{N}, where \mathcal{M} is a subuppersemilattice of \mathcal{N}, then for both degree structures, every embedding of \mathcal{M} into the structure extends to one of \mathcal{N} iff \mathcal{N} is an end-extension of \mathcal{M}.
