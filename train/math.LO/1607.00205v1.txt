We show that in Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory without the Axiom of Choice a surjectively modified continuum function \theta(\kappa) can take almost arbitrary values for all infinite cardinals. This choiceless version of Easton's Theorem is in sharp contrast to the situation in ZFC, where for singular cardinals \kappa, the value of 2^\kappa is strongly influenced by the behaviour of the continuum function below.   Our construction can roughly be described as follows: In a ground model V \models ZFC + GCH with a "reasonable" function F: Card \rightarrow Card on the infinite cardinals, a class forcing {\mathbb P} is introduced, which blows up the power sets of all cardinals according to F . The eventual model N \models ZF is a symmetric extension by {\mathbb P} such that \theta^N(\kappa) = F(\kappa) holds for all \kappa.
