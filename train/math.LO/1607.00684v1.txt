Small forcing always ruins the indestructibility of an indestructible supercompact cardinal. In fact, after small forcing, any cardinal \kappa becomes superdestructible---any further {<}\kappa-closed forcing which adds a subset to \kappa will destroy the measurability, even the weak compactness, of \kappa. Nevertheless, after small forcing indestructible cardinals remain resurrectible, but never strongly resurrectible.
