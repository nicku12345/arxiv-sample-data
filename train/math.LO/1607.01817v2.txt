This is my working paper on a proposed logical framework for the practice of mathematics, which is paralleled by philosophical considerations and a computer implementation (a variant of Automath). Updated 10/27/2016 with a version from 10/22/2016. New versions are regularly posted on the author's web page at http://math.boisestate.edu/%7Eholmes/automath/ which is a directory containing various related files.
