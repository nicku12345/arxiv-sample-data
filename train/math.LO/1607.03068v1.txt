We begin the study of categorical logic for continuous model theory. In particular, we 1. introduce the notions of metric logical categories and functors as categorical equivalents of a metric theory and interpretations, 2. prove a continuous version of conceptual completeness showing that T^\eq is the maximal conservative expansion of T, and 3. define the concept of a metric pre-topos.
