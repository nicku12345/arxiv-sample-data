For a fixed natural number n \geq 1, the Hart-Shelah example is an abstract elementary class (AEC) with amalgamation that is categorical exactly in the infinite cardinals less than or equal to \aleph_n.   We investigate recently-isolated properties of AECs in the setting of this example. We isolate the exact amount of type-shortness holding in the example and show that it has a type-full good \aleph_{n-1}-frame which fails the existence property for uniqueness triples. This gives the first example of such a frame. Along the way, we develop new tools to build and analyze good frames.
