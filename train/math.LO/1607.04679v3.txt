This paper explores a novel definition of Schnorr randomness for noncomputable measures. We say x is uniformly Schnorr \mu-random if t(\mu,x)<\infty for all lower semicomputable functions t(\mu,x) such that \mu\mapsto\int t(\mu,x)\,d\mu(x) is computable. We prove a number of theorems demonstrating that this is the correct definition which enjoys many of the same properties as Martin-L\"of randomness for noncomputable measures. Nonetheless, a number of our proofs significantly differ from the Martin-L\"of case, requiring new ideas from computable analysis.
