We develop a forcing poset with finite conditions which adds a partial square sequence on a given stationary set, with adequate sets of models as side conditions. We then develop a kind of side condition product forcing for simultaneously adding partial square sequences on multiple stationary sets. We show that certain quotients of such forcings have the \omega_1-approximation property. We apply these ideas to prove, assuming the consistency of a greatly Mahlo cardinal, that it is consistent that the approachability ideal I[\omega_2] does not have a maximal set modulo clubs.
