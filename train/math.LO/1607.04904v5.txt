We show that for many pairs of infinite cardinals \kappa > \mu^+ > \mu, (\kappa^{+}, \kappa)\twoheadrightarrow (\mu^+, \mu) is consistent relative to the consistency of a supercompact cardinal. We also show that it is consistent, relative to a huge cardinal that (\kappa^{+}, \kappa)\twoheadrightarrow (\mu^+, \mu) for every successor cardinal \kappa and every \mu < \kappa, answering a question of Foreman.
