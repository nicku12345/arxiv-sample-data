A poset is (\omega,C)-representable if it can be embedded into a field of sets in such a way that all existing joins, and all existing \emph{finite} meets are preserved. We show that the class of (\omega,C)-representable posets cannot be axiomatized in first order logic using the standard language of posets. We generalize this result to (\alpha,\beta)-representable posets for certain values of \alpha and \beta.
