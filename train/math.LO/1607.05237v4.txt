In 1979 Schwichtenberg showed that the System \text{T} definable functionals are closed under a rule-like version Spector's bar recursion of lowest type levels 0 and 1. More precisely, if the functional Y which controls the stopping condition of Spector's bar recursor is \text{T}-definable, then the corresponding bar recursion of type levels 0 and 1 is already \text{T}-definable. Schwichtenberg's original proof, however, relies on a detour through Tait's infinitary terms and the correspondence between ordinal recursion for \alpha < \varepsilon_0 and primitive recursion over finite types. This detour makes it hard to calculate on given concrete system \text{T} input, what the corresponding system \text{T} output would look like. In this paper we present an alternative (more direct) proof based on an explicit construction which we prove correct via a suitably defined logical relation. We show through an example how this gives a straightforward mechanism for converting bar recursive definitions into \text{T}-definitions under the conditions of Schwichtenberg's theorem. Finally, with the explicit construction we can also easily state a sharper result: if Y is in the fragment \text{T}_i then terms built from \text{BR}^{\mathbb{N}, \sigma} for this particular Y are definable in the fragment \text{T}_{i + \max \{ 1, \text{level}{\sigma} \} + 2}.
