It is common knowledge in the set theory community that there exists a duality relating the commutative C^*-algebras with the family of B-names for complex numbers in a boolean valued model for set theory V^B. Several aspects of this correlation have been considered in works of the late 1970's and early 1980's, for example by Takeuti, and by Jech. Generalizing Jech's results, we extend this duality so as to be able to describe the family of boolean names for elements of any given Polish space Y (such as the complex numbers) in a boolean valued model for set theory V^B as a space C^+(X,Y) consisting of functions f whose domain X is the Stone space of B, and whose range is contained in Y modulo a meager set. We also outline how this duality can be combined with generic absoluteness results in order to analyze, by means of forcing arguments, the theory of C^+(X,Y).
