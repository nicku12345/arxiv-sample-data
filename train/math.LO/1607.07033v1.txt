An \aleph_1-Souslin tree is a complicated combinatorial object whose existence cannot be decided on the grounds of ZFC alone. But 15 years after Tennenbaum and independently Jech devised notions of forcing for introducing such a tree, Shelah proved that already the simplest forcing notion --- Cohen forcing --- adds an \aleph_1-Souslin tree.   In this paper, we identify a rather large class of notions of forcing that, assuming a GCH-type assumption, add a \lambda^+-Souslin tree. This class includes Prikry, Magidor and Radin forcing.
