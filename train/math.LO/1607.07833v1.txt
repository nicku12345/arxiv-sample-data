We show there exists a complete theory in a language of size continuum possessing a unique atomic model which is not constructible. We also show it is consistent with ZFC + \aleph_1 < 2^{\aleph_0} that there is a complete theory in a language of size \aleph_1 possessing a unique atomic model which is not constructible. Finally we show it is consistent with ZFC + \aleph_1 < 2^{\aleph_0} that for every complete theory T in a language of size \aleph_1, if T has uncountable atomic models but no constructible models, then T has 2^{\aleph_1} atomic models of size \aleph_1.
