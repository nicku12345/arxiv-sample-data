Several variants of the Halpern-L\"auchli Theorem for trees of uncountable height are investigated. For \kappa weakly compact, we prove that the various statements are all equivalent. We show that the strong tree version holds for one tree on any infinite cardinal. For any finite d \ge 2, we prove the consistency of the Halpern-L\"auchli Theorem on d many \kappa-trees at a measurable cardinal \kappa, given the consistency of a \kappa+d-strong cardinal. This follows from a more general consistency result at measurable \kappa, which includes the possibility of infinitely many trees, assuming partition relations which hold in models of AD.
