An H-field is a type of ordered valued differential field with a natural interaction between ordering, valuation, and derivation. The main examples are Hardy fields and fields of transseries. Aschenbrenner and van den Dries proved in~\cite{MZ} that every H-field K has either exactly one or exactly two Liouville closures up to isomorphism over K, but the precise dividing line between these two cases was unknown. We prove here that this dividing line is determined by \uplambda-freeness, a property of H-fields that prevents certain deviant behavior. In particular, we show that under certain types of extensions related to adjoining integrals and exponential integrals, the property of \uplambda-freeness is preserved. In the proofs we introduce a new technique for studying H-fields, the \emph{yardstick argument} which involves the rate of growth of pseudoconvergence.
