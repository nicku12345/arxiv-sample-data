Fix 2<n<\omega. Let L_n denote first order logic restricted to the first n variables. CA_n denotes the class of cylindric algebras of dimension n and for m>n, Nr_n\CA_m(\subseteq CA_n) denotes the class of n-neat reducts of CA_m's. The existence of certain finite relation algebras and finite CA_n's lacking relativized complete representations is shown to imply that the omitting types theorem (OTT) fails for L_n with respect to clique guarded semantics (which is an equivalent formalism of its packed fragments), and for the multi-dimensional modal logic S5^n. Several such relation and cylindric algebras are explicitly exhibited using rainbow constructions and Monk-like algebras. Certain CA_n constructed to show non-atom canonicity of the variety S\Nr_n\CA_{n+3} are used to show that Vaught's theorem (VT) for L_{\omega, \omega}, looked upon as a special case of OTT for L_{\omega, \omega}, fails almost everywhere (a notion to be defined below) when restricted to L_n. That VT fails everywhere for L_n, which is stronger than failing almost everywhere as the name suggests, is reduced to the existence, for each n<m<\omega, of a finite relation algebra R_m having a so-called m-1 strong blur, but R_m has no m-dimensional relational basis. VT for other modal fragments and expansions of L_n, like its guarded fragments, n-products of uni-modal logics like K^n, and first order definable expansions, is approached. It is shown that any multi-modal canonical logic L, such that K^n\subseteq L\subseteq S5^n, L cannot be axiomatized by canonical equations. In particular, L is not Sahlqvist. Elementary generation and di-completeness for L_n and its clique guarded fragments are proved. Positive omitting types theorems are proved for L_n with respect to standard semantics.
