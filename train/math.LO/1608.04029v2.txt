In this paper, three semilinear substructural logics ULw, IULw and HpsUL*w are constructed. Then the completeness of ULw and IULw with respect to classes of finite UL and IUL-algebras, respectively, is proved. Algebraically, non-integral ULw and IULw-algebras have the finite embeddability property, which gives a characterization for finite UL and IUL-algebras. Furthermore, the standard completeness of ULw, IULw and HpsUL*w is proved, which shows that they are substructural fuzzy logics.
