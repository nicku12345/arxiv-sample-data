In \mathsf{ZFC}, if there is a measurable cardinal with infinitely many Woodin cardinals below it, then for every equivalence relation E \in L(\mathbb{R}) on \mathbb{R} with all \mathbf{\Delta}_1^1 classes and every \sigma-ideal I on \mathbb{R} so that the associated forcing \mathbb{P}_I of I^+ \mathbf{\Delta}_1^1 subsets is proper, there exists some I^+ \mathbf{\Delta}_1^1 set C so that E \upharpoonright C is a \mathbf{\Delta}_1^1 equivalence relation. In \mathsf{ZF} + \mathsf{DC} + \mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R} + V = L(\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{R})), for every equivalence relation E on \mathbb{R} with all \mathbf{\Delta}_1^1 classes and every \sigma-ideal I on \mathbb{R} so that the associated forcing \mathbb{P}_I is proper, there is some I^+ \mathbf{\Delta}_1^1 set C so that E \upharpoonright C is a \mathbf{\Delta}_1^1 equivalence relation.
