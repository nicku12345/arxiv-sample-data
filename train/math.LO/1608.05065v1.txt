We study functions from reals to reals which are uniformly degree-invariant from Turing-equivalence to many-one equivalence, and compare them "on a cone." We prove that they are in one-to-one correspondence with the Wadge degrees, which can be viewed as a refinement of the uniform Martin's conjecture for uniformly invariant functions from Turing- to Turing-equivalence. Our proof works in the general case of many-one degrees on \mathcal{Q}^\omega and Wadge degrees of functions \omega^\omega\to\mathcal{Q} for any better quasi ordering \mathcal{Q}.
