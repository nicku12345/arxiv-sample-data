We study various classes of maximality principles, \rm{MP}(\kappa,\Gamma), introduced by J.D. Hamkins, where \Gamma defines a class of forcing posets and \kappa is a cardinal. We explore the consistency strength and the relationship of \textsf{MP}(\kappa,\Gamma) with various forcing axioms when \kappa \in\{\omega,\omega_1\}. In particular, we give a characterization of bounded forcing axioms for a class of forcings \Gamma in terms of maximality principles MP(\omega_1,\Gamma) for \Sigma_1 formulas. A significant part of the paper is devoted to studying the principle MP(\kappa,\Gamma) where \kappa\in\{\omega,\omega_1\} and \Gamma defines the class of stationary set preserving forcings. We show that MP(\kappa,\Gamma) has high consistency strength; on the other hand, if \Gamma defines the class of proper forcings or semi-proper forcings, then by Hamkins, it is shown that MP(\kappa,\Gamma) is consistent relative to V=L.
