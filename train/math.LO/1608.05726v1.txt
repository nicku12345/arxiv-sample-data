This paper explores the consistency strength of The Proper Forcing Axiom (\textsf{PFA}) and the theory (T) which involves a variation of the Viale-Wei\ss guessing hull principle. We show that (T) is consistent relative to a supercompact cardinal. The main result of the paper implies that the theory "\sf{AD}_\mathbb{R} + \Theta is regular" is consistent relative to (T) and to \textsf{PFA}. This improves significantly the previous known best lower-bound for consistency strength for (T) and \textsf{PFA}, which is roughly "\sf{AD}_\mathbb{R} + \textsf{DC}".
