The notion of random sequence was introduced by Martin-Loef in 1966. At the same time he defined the so-called randomness deficiency function that shows how close are random sequences to non-random (in some natural sense). Other deficiency functions can be obtained from the Levin-Schnorr theorem, that describes randomness in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. The difference between all of these deficiencies is bounded by a logarithmic term. In this paper we show that the difference between some deficiencies can be as large as possible.
