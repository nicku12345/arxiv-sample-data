We provide mutual elementary recursive order isomorphisms between classical ordinal notations, based on Skolem hulling, and notations from pure elementary patterns of resemblance of order 2, showing that the latter characterize the proof-theoretic ordinal of the fragment \Pi^1_1-\mathrm{CA}_0 of second order number theory, or equivalently the set theory \mathrm{KPl}_0. As a corollary, we prove that Carlson's result on the well-quasi orderedness of respecting forests of order 2 implies transfinite induction up to the ordinal of \mathrm{KPl}_0. We expect that our approach will facilitate analysis of more powerful systems of patterns.
