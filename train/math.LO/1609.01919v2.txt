As suggested by the title, it has recently become clear that theorems of Nonstandard Analysis (NSA) give rise to theorems in computability theory (no longer involving NSA). Now, the aforementioned discipline divides into classical and higher-order computability theory, where the former (resp. the latter) sub-discipline deals with objects of type zero and one (resp. of all types). The aforementioned results regarding NSA deal exclusively with the higher-order case; we show in this paper that theorems of NSA also give rise to theorems in classical computability theory by considering so-called textbook proofs.
