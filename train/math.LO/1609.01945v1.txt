The Loeb measure is one of the cornerstones of Nonstandard Analysis. The traditional development of the Loeb measure makes use of saturation and external sets. Inspired by [13], we give meaning to special cases of the Loeb measure in the weak fragment \textsf{P} of Nelson's internal set theory from [1]. Perhaps surprisingly, our definition of the Loeb measure has computational content in the sense of the `term extraction' framework from [1].
