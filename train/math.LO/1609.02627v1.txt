The tree theorem for pairs (\mathsf{TT}^2_2), first introduced by Chubb, Hirst, and McNicholl, asserts that given a finite coloring of pairs of comparable nodes in the full binary tree 2^{<\omega}, there is a set of nodes isomorphic to 2^{<\omega} which is homogeneous for the coloring. This is a generalization of the more familiar Ramsey's theorem for pairs (\mathsf{RT}^2_2), which has been studied extensively in computability theory and reverse mathematics. We answer a longstanding open question about the strength of \mathsf{TT}^2_2, by showing that this principle does not imply the arithmetic comprehension axiom (\mathsf{ACA}_0) over the base system, recursive comprehension axiom (\mathsf{RCA}_0), of second-order arithmetic. In addition, we give a new and self-contained proof of a recent result of Patey that \mathsf{TT}^2_2 is strictly stronger than \mathsf{RT}^2_2. Combined, these results establish \mathsf{TT}^2_2 as the first known example of a natural combinatorial principle to occupy the interval strictly between \mathsf{ACA}_0 and \mathsf{RT}^2_2. The proof of this fact uses an extension of the bushy tree forcing method, and develops new techniques for dealing with combinatorial statements formulated on trees, rather than on \omega.
