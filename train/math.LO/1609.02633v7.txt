Hamkins and L\"{o}we asked whether there can be a model N of set theory with the property that N\equiv N[g] whenever g is a generic collapse of a cardinal of N onto \omega. We give equiconsistency results for two weaker versions of this property. We also include a proof of Woodin's result that the consistency of the full Hamkins-L\"{o}we property follows from that of a Woodin cardinal with an inaccessible above.
