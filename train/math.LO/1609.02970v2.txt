We develop the notion of coherent ultrafilters (extenders without normality or well-foundedness). We then use definable coherent ultraproducts to characterize any extension of a model M in any fragment of \mathbb{L}_{\infty, \omega} that defines Skolem functions by a sufficiently complete (but in ZFC) coherent ultrafilter. We apply this method to various elementary classes and AECs.
