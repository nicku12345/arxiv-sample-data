We prove a topological completeness theorem for the modal logic GLP containing operators \langle\lambda\rangle for \lambda \in Ord intended to capture progressively stronger notions of consistency in mathematical theories. We show that, given a scattered space X of large-enough rank, any sentence \phi consistent with GLP can be satisfied in a polytopological space based on the finitely many Icard topologies over X that correspond to the finitely many modalities appearing in \phi.
