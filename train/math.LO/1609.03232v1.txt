We consider modal logics of products of neighborhood frames. We define n-product of modal logics as the logic of all products of neighborhood frames of corresponding logics and find n-product of any two pretransitive Horn axiomatizable logics. As a corrolary we find the d-logic of products of topological spaces for some classes of topological spaces.
