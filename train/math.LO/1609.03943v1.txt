To any fixed, finite relational structure, \mathbb{D}, there is an associated decision problem, CSP(\mathbb{D}), which is a restricted version of the constraint satisfaction problem. In [8], the so called "algebraic approach" to the constraint satisfaction problem was established. The authors showed that to any finite relational structure, there is a corresponding finite algebra, and that the complexity of CSP(\mathbb{D}) depends only on this algebra. Therefore, they associate a decision problem, CSP({\bf D}) to an algebra, {\bf D}, and ignore the relational structure. Their "algebraic dichotomy conjecture" suggests that a technical condition on {\bf D} implies CSP({\bf D}) has a polynomial time algorithm. A significant sub-problem is the case when some reduct of {\bf D} has a congruence, \theta so that {\bf D}/\theta has operations implying the local consistency algorithm correctly solves CSP({\bf D}/\theta), and each \theta-equivalence class, B, has operations implying the few subpowers algorithm correctly solves CSP({\bf B}). We give an algorithm for the case when {\bf D} has a binary term operation which is a 2-semilattice operation on some quotient, {\bf D}/\theta of {\bf D}, a projection on each \theta-class, and two other technical conditions are satisfied. Using this, we confirm the conjecture in the case that {\bf D} is in the join of two varieties, one of which has an edge term and the other is term equivalent to the variety of 2-semilattices.
