We investigate a certain class of posets arising from semilattice actions. Let S be a semilattice with identity. Let S act on a set C. For c,d\in C put c\leq d iff there is some s\in S with ds=c. Then (C,\leq) is a poset. Let's call the posets that arise in this way \downarrow-posets. We give a reasonable second order characterization of \downarrow-posets and show that there is no first order characterization.
