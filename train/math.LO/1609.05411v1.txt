In the absence of the Axiom of Choice, the "small" cardinal \omega_1 can exhibit properties more usually associated with large cardinals, such as strong compactness and supercompactness. For a local version of strong compactness, we say that \omega_1 is X-strongly compact (where X is any set) if there is a fine, countably complete measure on \mathcal{P}_{\omega_1}(X). Working in \mathsf{ZF} + \mathsf{DC}, we prove that the \mathcal{P}(\omega_1)-strong compactness and \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})-strong compactness of \omega_1 are equiconsistent with \mathsf{AD} and \mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R} + \mathsf{DC} respectively, where \mathsf{AD} denotes the Axiom of Determinacy and \mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R} denotes the Axiom of Real Determinacy. The \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})-supercompactness of \omega_1 is shown to be slightly stronger than \mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R} + \mathsf{DC}, but its consistency strength is not computed precisely. An equiconsistency result at the level of \mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R} without \mathsf{DC} is also obtained.
