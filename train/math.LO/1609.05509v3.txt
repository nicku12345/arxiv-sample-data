We propose a new method for constructing Turing ideals satisfying principles of reverse mathematics below the Chain-Antichain Principle (CAC). Using this method, we are able to prove several new separations in the presence of Weak Konig's Lemma (WKL), including showing that CAC+WKL does not imply the thin set theorem for pairs, and that the principle "the product of well-quasi-orders is a well-quasi-order" is strictly between CAC and the Ascending/Descending Sequences principle, even in the presence of WKL.
