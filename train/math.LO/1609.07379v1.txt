Lindenbaum method is named after the Polish logician Adolf Lindenbaum who prematurely and without a clear trace disappeared in the turmoil of the Second World War at the age of about 37. The method is based on the symbolic nature of formalized languages of deductive systems and opens a gate for applications of algebra to logic and, thereby, to Abstract algebraic logic.
