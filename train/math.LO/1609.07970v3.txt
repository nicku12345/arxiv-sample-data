In this paper it is introduced a generic large cardinal akin to I0, and its consequences are analyzed in the case that \aleph_\omega is such a generic large cardinal. In this case \aleph_\omega is J\'{o}nsson, and in a choiceless inner model many properties hold that are in contrast with PCF in ZFC.
