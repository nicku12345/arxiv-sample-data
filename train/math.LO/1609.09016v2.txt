We develop local forms of Ramsey-theoretic dichotomies for block sequences in infinite-dimensional vector spaces, analogous to Mathias' selective coideal form of Silver's theorem for analytic partitions of [\mathbb{N}]^\infty. Under large cardinals, these results are extended to partitions in \mathbf{L}(\mathbb{R}) and \mathbf{L}(\mathbb{R})-generic filters of block sequences are characterized. Variants of these results are also established for block sequences in Banach spaces and for projections in the Calkin algebra.
