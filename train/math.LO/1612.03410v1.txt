The aim of this work is to provide a special kind of conservative translation between abstract logics, namely an \textit{abstract Glivenko's theorem}. Firstly we define institutions on the categories of logic, algebraizable logics, and Lindenbaum algebraizable logic. In the sequel, we introduce the notion os Glivenko's context relating two algebraizable logics (respectively, Lindenbaum algebraizable logics) and we prove that for each Glivenko's context can be associated an institutions morphism between the corresponding logical institutions. As a consequence of the existence of such institutions morphisms, we have established abstract versions of Glivenko's theorem between those algebraizable logics (Lindenbaum algebraizable logics), generalizing the results presented in \cite{To}. In particular, considering the institutions of classical logic and of intuitionistic logic, we build a Glivenko's context and thus an abstract Glivenko's theorem that is exactly the traditional Glivenko's theorem. Finally we present a category of algebraizable logic with Glivenko's context as morphisms. We can interpret the results of this work as an evidence of the (virtually unexplored) relevance of institution theory in the study of propositional logic.
