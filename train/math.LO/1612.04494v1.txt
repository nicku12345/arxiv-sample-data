We discuss sufficiently fast-growing sequences of Turing degrees. The key result is that, assuming sufficient determinacy, if \phi is a formula with one free variable, and S and T are sufficiently fast-growing sequences of Turing degrees of length \omega_1, then \phi(S) \iff \phi(T). We also define degrees for subsets of \omega_1 analogous to Turing degrees, and prove that under sufficient determinacy and CH, all sufficiently high degrees are also effectively indistinguishable.
