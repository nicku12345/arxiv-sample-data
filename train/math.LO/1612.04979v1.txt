This paper builds on our contribution [Havlena and Hlinena, 2016] which studied modelling of the conjunction in human language. We have discussed three different ways of constructing conjunction. We have dealt with generated t-norms, generated means and Choquet integral.   In this paper we construct the residual operators based on the above conjunctions. The only operator based on a t-norm is an implication. We show that this implication belongs to the class of generated implications I^g_N which was introduced in [Smutna, 1999] and studied in [Biba and Hlinena, 2012]. We study its properties. More, we investigate this class of generated implications. Some important properties, including relations between some classes of implications, are given.
