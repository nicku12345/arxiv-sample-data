We establish some basic properties of quotients of projective Fra\"iss\'e limits and exhibit some classes of compact metric spaces that are the quotient of a projective Fra\"iss\'e limit of a projective Fra\"iss\'e family in a finite language. We prove the result for the arcs directly, and by applying some closure properties we obtain all hypercubes and graphs as well.
