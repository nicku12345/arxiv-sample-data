How many permutations of the natural numbers are needed so that every conditionally convergent series of real numbers can be rearranged to no longer converge to the same sum? We define the \emph{rearrangement number}, a new cardinal characteristic of the continuum, as the answer to this question. We compare the rearrangement number with several natural variants, for example one obtained by requiring the rearranged series to still converge but to a new, finite limit. We also compare the rearrangement number with several well-studied cardinal characteristics of the continuum. We present some new forcing constructions designed to add permutations that rearrange series from the ground model in particular ways, thereby obtaining consistency results going beyond those that follow from comparisons with familiar cardinal characteristics. Finally, we deal briefly with some variants concerning rearrangements by a special sort of permutation and with rearranging some divergent series to become (conditionally) convergent.
