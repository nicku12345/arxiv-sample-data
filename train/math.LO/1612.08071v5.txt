A new \theta function primitive is proposed that almost achieves the combined efficiency of the addition, multiplication and successor growth operations. This \theta function symbol enables the constructing of an "IQFS(PA+)" axiom system that can corroborate a fragmentary definition of its own Hilbert consistency, while it will simultaneously verify isomorphic counterparts of all Peano Arithmetic's \Pi_1 theorems. Many propositions and intermediate results are also established. Only one intermediate result, which most readers will intuit should be true, does remain formally unproven.
