This year's logic blog contains a variety of results, some of them available only here. Highlights include the resolution of the Gamma question by Monin, and a number of entries on topological group theory and its connection to logic. There's also a new proof by Yu of Harrington's 1978 result that a Pi-11 set of hyperdegrees with a perfect subset contains an upper cone. Also there's quite a bit of reverse mathematics, including its connection to randomness, and variants of Hindman's theorem in this setting.
