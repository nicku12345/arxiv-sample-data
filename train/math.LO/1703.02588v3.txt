We investigate the structure of fixed point sets of self-embeddings of models of arithmetic. In particular, given a countable nonstandard model M of a modest fragment of Peano arithimetic, we provide complete characterizations of (a) the initial segments of M that can be realized as the longest initial segment of fixed points of a nontrivial self-embedding of M onto a proper initial segment of M; and (b) the initial segments of M that can be realized as the fixed point set of some nontrivial self-embedding of M onto a proper initial segement of M. Moreover, we demonstrate the the standard cut is strong in M iff there is a self-embedding of M onto a proper initial segment of itself that moves every element that is not definable in M by an existential formula.
