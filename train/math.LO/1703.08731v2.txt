In this short note, using results of Bourgain, Fremlin, and Talagrand \cite{BFT}, we show that for a countable structure M, a saturated elementary extension M^* of M and a formula \phi(x,y) the following are equivalent:   (i) \phi(x,y) is NIP on M (in the sense of Definition 2.1).   (ii) Whenever p(x)\in S_\phi(M^*) is finitely satisfiable in M then it is Baire 1 definable over M (in sense of Definition 2.5).
