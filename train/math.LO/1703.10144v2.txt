If (X,d) is a Polish metric space of dimension 0, then by Wadge's lemma, no more than two Borel subsets of X can be incomparable with respect to continuous reducibility. In contrast, our main result shows that for any metric space (X,d) of positive dimension, there are uncountably many Borel subsets of (X,d) that are pairwise incomparable with respect to continuous reducibility.   The reducibility that is given by the collection of continuous functions on a topological space (X,\tau) is called the \emph{Wadge quasi-order} for (X,\tau). We further show that this quasi-order, restricted to the Borel subsets of a Polish space (X,\tau), is a \emph{well-quasiorder (wqo)} if and only if (X,\tau) has dimension 0, as an application of the main result.   Moreover, we give further examples of applications of the technique, which is based on a construction of graph colorings.
