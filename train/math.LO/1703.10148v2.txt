We extend Solovay's theorem about definable subsets of the Baire space to the generalized Baire space {}^\lambda\lambda, where \lambda is an uncountable cardinal with \lambda^{<\lambda}=\lambda. In the first main theorem, we show that that the perfect set property for all subsets of {}^{\lambda}\lambda that are definable from elements of {}^\lambda\mathrm{Ord} is consistent relative to the existence of an inaccessible cardinal above \lambda. In the second main theorem, we introduce a Banach-Mazur type game of length \lambda and show that the determinacy of this game, for all subsets of {}^\lambda\lambda that are definable from elements of {}^\lambda\mathrm{Ord} as winning conditions, is consistent relative to the existence of an inaccessible cardinal above \lambda. We further obtain some related results about definable functions on {}^\lambda\lambda and consequences of resurrection axioms for definable subsets of {}^\lambda\lambda.
