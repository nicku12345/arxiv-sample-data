Let \mathbf{K} be the class of countable structures M with the strong small index property and locally finite algebraicity, and \mathbf{K}_* the class of M \in \mathbf{K} such that acl_M(\{ a \}) = \{ a \} for every a \in M. For homogeneous M \in \mathbf{K}, we introduce what we call the expanded group of automorphisms of M, and show that it is second-order definable in Aut(M). We use this to prove that for M, N \in \mathbf{K}_*, Aut(M) and Aut(N) are isomorphic as abstract groups if and only if (Aut(M), M) and (Aut(N), N) are isomorphic as permutation groups. In particular, we deduce that for \aleph_0-categorical structures the combination of strong small index property and no algebraicity implies reconstruction up to bi-definability, in analogy with Rubin's well-known \forall \exists-interpretation technique of [7]. Finally, we show that every finite group can be realized as the outer automorphism group of Aut(M) for some countable \aleph_0-categorical homogeneous structure M with the strong small index property and no algebraicity.
