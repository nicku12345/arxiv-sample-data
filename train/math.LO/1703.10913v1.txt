We study the properties of algebraic independence and pointwise algebraic independence in a class of continuous theories, the randomizations T^R of complete first order theories T. If algebraic and definable closure coincide in T, then algebraic independence in T^R satisfies extension and has local character with the smallest possible bound, but has neither finite character nor base monotonicity. For arbitrary T, pointwise algebraic independence in T^R satisfies extension for countable sets, has finite character, has local character with the smallest possible bound, and satisfies base monotonicity if and only if algebraic independence in T does.
