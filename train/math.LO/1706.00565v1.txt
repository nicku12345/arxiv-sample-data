The notion of a topological Ramsey space was introduced by Carlson some 30 years ago. Studying the topological Ramsey space of variable words, Carlson was able to derive many classical combinatorial results in a unifying manner. For the class of spaces generated by algebras, Carlson had suggested that one should attempt a purely combinatorial approach to the study. This approach was later formulated and named Ramsey algebra. In this paper, we continue to look at heterogeneous Ramsey algebras, mainly characterizing various Ramsey algebras involving matrices.
