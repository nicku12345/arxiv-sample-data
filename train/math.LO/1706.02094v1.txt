Results of Smale (1957) and Dugundji (1969) allow to compare the homotopy groups of two topological spaces X and Y whenever a map f:X\to Y with strong connectivity conditions on the fibers is given. We apply similar techniques in o-minimal expansions of fields to compare the o-minimal homotopy of a definable set X with the homotopy of some of its bounded hyperdefinable quotients X/E. Under suitable assumption, we show that \pi_{n}(X)^{\rm def}\cong\pi_{n}(X/E) and \dim(X)=\dim_{\mathbb R}(X/E). As a special case, given a definably compact group, we obtain a new proof of Pillay's group conjecture "\dim(G)=\dim_{\mathbb R}(G/G^{00})" largely independent of the group structure of G. We also obtain different proofs of various comparison results between classical and o-minimal homotopy.
