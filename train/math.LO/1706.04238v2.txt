In [FHK13], the authors considered the question whether model-existence of L_{\omega_1,\omega}-sentences is absolute for transitive models of ZFC, in the sense that if V \subseteq W are transitive models of ZFC with the same ordinals, \varphi\in V and V\models "\varphi \text{ is an } L_{\omega_1,\omega}\text{-sentence}", then V \models "\varphi \text{ has a model of size } \aleph_\alpha" if and only if W \models "\varphi \text{ has a model of size } \aleph_\alpha".   From [FHK13] we know that the answer is positive for \alpha=0,1 and under the negation of CH, the answer is negative for all \alpha>1. Under GCH, and assuming the consistency of a supercompact cardinal, the answer remains negative for each \alpha>1, except the case when \alpha=\omega which is an open question in [FHK13].   We answer the open question by providing a negative answer under GCH even for \alpha=\omega. Our examples are incomplete sentences. In fact, the same sentences can be used to prove a negative answer under GCH for all \alpha>1 assuming the consistency of a Mahlo cardinal. Thus, the large cardinal assumption is relaxed from a supercompact in [FHK13] to a Mahlo cardinal.   Finally, we consider the absoluteness question for the \aleph_\alpha-amalgamation property of L_{\omega_1,\omega}-sentences (under substructure). We prove that assuming GCH, \aleph_\alpha-amalgamation is non-absolute for 1<\alpha<\omega. This answers a question from [SS]. The cases \alpha=1 and \alpha infinite remain open. As a corollary we get that it is non-absolute that the amalgamation spectrum of an L_{\omega_1,\omega}-sentence is empty.
