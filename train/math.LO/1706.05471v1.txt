We provide an algebraic characterization of strong ordered Abelian groups: An ordered Abelian group is strong iff it has bounded regular rank and almost finite dimension. Moreover, we show that any strong ordered Abelian group has finite Dp-rank.   We also provide a formula that computes the exact valued of the Dp-rank of any ordered Abelian group. In particular characterizing those ordered Abelian groups with Dp-rank equal to n. We also show the Dp-rank coincides with the Vapnik-Chervonenkis density.
