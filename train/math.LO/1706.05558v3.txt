We introduce the notion of a {\it semi-retraction}. Given two structures \A and \B, \A is a semi-retraction of \B if there exist quantifier-free type respecting maps f: \B \raw \A and g: \A \raw \B such that f \circ g is an embedding. We say that a structure has the Ramsey property if its age does. Given two locally finite ordered structures \A and \B, if \A is a semi-retraction of \B and \B has the Ramsey property, then \A also has the Ramsey property. We introduce notation for what we call semi-direct product structures, after the group construction known to preserve the Ramsey property.~\cite{kpt05} We introduce the notion of a color-homogenizing map, and use this notion to give a finitary argument that the semi-direct product structure of ordered relational structures with the Ramsey property must also have the Ramsey property. Finally, we characterize NIP theories using a generalized indiscernible sequence indexed by a semi-direct product structure.
