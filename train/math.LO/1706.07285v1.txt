The assertion that every definable set has a definable element is equivalent over ZF to the principle V=\text{HOD}, and indeed, we prove, so is the assertion merely that every \Pi_2-definable set has an ordinal-definable element. Meanwhile, every model of ZFC has a forcing extension satisfying V\neq\text{HOD} in which every \Sigma_2-definable set has an ordinal-definable element. Similar results hold for \text{HOD}(\mathbb{R}) and \text{HOD}(\text{Ord}^\omega) and other natural instances of \text{HOD}(X).
