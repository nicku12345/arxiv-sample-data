Let GCH hold and let j:V\longrightarrow M be a definable elementary embedding such that crit(j)=\kappa, ^{\kappa}M\subseteq M and \kappa^{++}=\kappa_{M}^{++}. H. Woodin proved that there is a cofinality preserving generic extension in which \kappa is measurable and GCH fails at it. This is done by using an Easton support iteration of Cohen forcings for blowing the power of every inaccessible \alpha\leq\kappa to \alpha^{++}, and then adding another forcing on top of that. We show that it is enough to use the iterated forcing, and that the latter forcing is not needed. We will show this not only for the case where \kappa^{++}=\kappa_{M}^{++}, but for every successor ordinal \gamma, where 0< \gamma< \kappa, we will show it when the assumption is \kappa^{+\gamma}=\kappa_{M}^{+\gamma}.
