We investigate the effects of various forcings on several forms of the Halpern-L\"auchli Theorem. For inaccessible \kappa, we show they are preserved by forcings of size less than \kappa. Combining this with work of Zhang in \cite{Zhang17} yields that the polarized partition relations associated with finite products of the \kappa-rationals are preserved by all forcings of size less than \kappa over models satisfying the Halpern-L\"auchli Theorem at \kappa. We also show that the Halpern-L\"auchli Theorem is preserved by {{<}\kappa}-closed forcings assuming \kappa is measurable, following some observed reflection properties.
