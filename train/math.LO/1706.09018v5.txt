In Sh506, Shelah develops the theory of \mathrm{pcf}_I(A) without the assumption that |A|<\min (A), going so far as to get generators for every \lambda\in\mathrm{pcf}_I(A) under some assumptions on I. Our main theorem is that we can also generalize Shelah's trichotomy theorem to the same setting. Using this, we present a different proof of the existence of generators for \mathrm{pcf}_I(A) which is more in line with the modern exposition. Finally, we discuss some obstacles to further generalizing the classical theory.
