A linear order L is strongly surjective if L can be mapped onto any of its suborders in an order preserving way. We prove various results on the existence and non-existence of uncountable strongly surjective linear orders answering questions of Camerlo, Carroy and Marcone. In particular, \diamondsuit^+ implies the existence of a lexicographically ordered Suslin-tree which is strongly surjective and minimal; every strongly surjective linear order must be an Aronszajn type under 2^{\aleph_0}<2^{\aleph_1} or in the Cohen and other canonical models (where 2^{\aleph_0}=2^{\aleph_1}); finally, we prove that it is consistent with CH that there are no uncountable strongly surjective linear orders at all. We end the paper with a healthy list of open problems.
