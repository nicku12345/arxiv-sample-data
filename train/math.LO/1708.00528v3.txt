We prove the consistency, assuming an ineffable cardinal, that any two normal countably closed \omega_2-Aronszajn trees are club isomorphic. This work generalizes to higher cardinals the property of Abraham-Shelah that any two normal \omega_1-Aronszajn trees are club isomorphic, which follows from \textsf{PFA}. The statement that any two normal countably closed \omega_2-Aronszajn trees are club isomorphic implies that there are no \omega_2-Suslin trees, so our proof also expands on the method of Laver-Shelah for obtaining the \omega_2-Suslin hypothesis.
