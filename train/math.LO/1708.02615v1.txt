We defined a notion of quantum 2-torus T_\theta in "Masanori Itai and Boris Zilber, Notes on a model theory of quantum 2-torus T_q^2 for generic q, arXiv:1503.06045v1 [mathLO]" and studied its model theoretic property. In this note we associate quantum 2-tori T_\theta with the structure over {\mathbb C}_\theta = ({\mathbb C}, +, \cdot, y = x^\theta), where \theta \in {\mathbb R} \setminus {\mathbb Q}, and introduce the notion of geometric isomorphisms between such quantum 2-tori.   We show that this notion is closely connected with the fundamental notion of Morita equivalence of non-commutative geometry. Namely, we prove that the quantum 2-tori T_{\theta_1} and T_{\theta_2} are Morita equivalent if and only if \theta_2 = {\displaystyle \frac{a \theta_1 + b}{c \theta_1 + d}} for some  \left( \begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c & d \end{array} \right)   \in {\rm GL}_2({\mathbb Z}) with |ad - bc| = 1. This is our version of Rieffel's Theorem in "M. A. Rieffel and A. Schwarz, Morita equivalence of multidimensional noncummutative tori, Internat. J. Math. 10, 2 (1999) 289-299" which characterises Morita equivalence of quantum tori in the same terms.   The result in essence confirms that the representation T_\theta in terms of model-theoretic geometry \cite{IZ} is adequate to its original definition in terms of non-commutative geometry.
