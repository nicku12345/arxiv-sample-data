We show that if cf(2^{\aleph_0})=\aleph_1, then any non-trivial \aleph_1-closed forcing notion of size \leq 2^{\aleph_0} is forcing equivalent to Add(\aleph_1, 1), the Cohen forcing for adding a new Cohen subset of \omega_1. We also produce, relative to the existence of suitable large cardinals, a model of ZFC in which 2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_2 and all \aleph_1-closed forcing notion of size \leq 2^{\aleph_0} collapse \aleph_2, and hence are forcing equivalent to Add(\aleph_1, 1). These results answer a question of Scott Williams from 1978. We also extend a result of Todorcevic and Foreman-Magidor-Shelah by showing that it is consistent that every partial order which adds a new subset of \aleph_2, collapses \aleph_2 or \aleph_3.
