Let \mathcal M=\langle M, <, +, \dots\rangle be an o-minimal expansion of an ordered group, and P\subseteq M a dense set such that certain tameness conditions hold. We introduce the notion of a `product cone' in \widetilde{\mathcal M}=\langle \cal M, P\rangle, and prove: if \mathcal M expands a real closed field, then \widetilde{\mathcal M} admits a product cone decomposition. If \mathcal M is linear, then it does not. In particular, we settle a question from [10].
