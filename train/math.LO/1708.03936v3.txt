The Pila-Wilkie theorem states that if a set X\subseteq \mathbb R^n is definable in an o-minimal structure \mathcal R and contains `many' rational points, then it contains an infinite semialgebraic set. In this paper, we extend this theorem to an expansion \widetilde{\mathcal R}=\langle \mathcal R, P\rangle of \mathcal R by a dense set P, which is either an elementary substructure of \mathcal R, or it is independent, as follows. If X is definable in \widetilde{\mathcal R} and contains many rational points, then it is dense in an infinite semialgebraic set. Moreover, it contains an infinite set which is \emptyset-definable in \langle \overline{\mathbb R}, P\rangle, where \overline {\mathbb R} is the real field.
