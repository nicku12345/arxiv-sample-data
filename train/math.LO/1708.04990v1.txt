We present a systematic study of join-extensions and join-completions of ordered algebras, which naturally leads to a refined and simplified treatment of fundamental results and constructions in the theory of ordered structures ranging from properties of the Dedekind-MacNeille completion to the proof of the finite embeddability property for a number of varieties of ordered algebras.
