We derive a forcing axiom from the conjunction of square and diamond, and present a few applications, primary among them being the existence of super-Souslin trees. It follows that for every uncountable cardinal \lambda, if \lambda^{++} is not a Mahlo cardinal in G\"odel's constructible universe, then 2^\lambda = \lambda^+ entails the existence of a \lambda^+-complete \lambda^{++}-Souslin tree.
