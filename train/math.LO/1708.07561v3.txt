We consider compactness characterizations of large cardinals. Based on results of Benda \cite{b-sccomp}, we study compactness for omitting types in various logics. In \bL_{\kappa, \kappa}, this allows us to characterize any large cardinal defined in terms of normal ultrafilters, and we also analyze second-order and sort logic. In particular, we give a compactness for omitting types characterization of huge cardinals, which have consistency strength beyond Vop\v{e}nka's Principle.
