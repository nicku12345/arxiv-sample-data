We examine recursive monotonic functions on the Lindenbaum algebra of \mathsf{EA}. We prove that no such function sends every consistent \varphi to a sentence with deductive strength strictly between \varphi and (\varphi\wedge\mathsf{Con}(\varphi)). We generalize this result to iterates of consistency into the effective transfinite. We then prove that for any recursive monotonic function f, if there is an iterate of \mathsf{Con} that bounds f everywhere, then f must be somewhere equal to an iterate of \mathsf{Con}.
