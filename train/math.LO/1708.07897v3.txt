It is shown that in infinitary propositional standard G\"odel logics, enhanced with constant value formulas corresponding to the rational values contained in the unit interval, it is possible to define formulas over these constants using said infinitary connections which provide an internal definition for constant value formulas corresponding to the irrational values of [0,1]. Therefore, irrational and from this all real constant value formulas are embedded in the presented logic and in conclusion equal expressivity is provided between the infinitary propositional G\"odel logics enhanced with rational and real constants.
