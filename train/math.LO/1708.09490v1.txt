Hemi-implicative semilattices (lattices), originally defined under the name of weak implicative semilattices (lattices), were introduced by the second author of the present paper. A hemi-implicative semilattice is an algebra (H,\wedge,\rightarrow,1) of type (2,2,0) such that (H,\wedge) is a meet semilattice, 1 is the greatest element with respect to the order, a\rightarrow a = 1 for every a\in H and for every a, b, c\in H, if a\leq b\rightarrow c then a\wedge b \leq c. A bounded hemi-implicative semilattice is an algebra (H,\wedge,\rightarrow,0,1) of type (2,2,0,0) such that (H,\wedge,\rightarrow,1) is a hemi-implicative semilattice and 0 is the first element with respect to the order. A hemi-implicative lattice is an algebra (H,\wedge,\vee,\rightarrow,0,1) of type (2,2,2,0,0) such that (H,\wedge,\vee,0,1) is a bounded distributive lattice and the reduct algebra (H,\wedge,\rightarrow,1) is a hemi-implicative semilattice.   In this paper we introduce an equivalence for the categories of bounded hemi-implicative semilattices and hemi-implicative lattices, respectively, which is motivated by an old construction due J. Kalman that relates bounded distributive lattices and Kleene algebras.
