This is a followup to a paper by the author where the disjointness relation for definable functions from {^\omega \omega} to {^\omega \omega} is analyzed. In that paper, for each a \in {^\omega \omega} we defined a Baire class one function f_a : {^\omega \omega} \to {^\omega \omega} which encoded a in a certain sense. Given g : {^\omega \omega} \to {^\omega \omega}, let \Psi(g) be the statement that g is disjoint from at most countably many of the functions f_a. We show the consistency strength of (\forall g)\, \Psi(g) is that of an inaccessible cardinal. We show that \textrm{AD}^+ implies (\forall g)\, \Psi(g). Finally, we show that assuming large cardinals, (\forall g)\, \Psi(g) holds in models of the form L(\mathbb{R})[\mathcal{U}] where \mathcal{U} is a selective ultrafilter on \omega.
