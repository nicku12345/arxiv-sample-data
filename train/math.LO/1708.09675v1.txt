We develop an extension of institution theory that accommodates implicitly the partiality of the signature morphisms and its syntactic and semantic effects. This is driven primarily by applications to conceptual blending, but other application domains are possible (such as software evolution). The particularity of this extension is a reliance on ordered-enriched categorical structures.
