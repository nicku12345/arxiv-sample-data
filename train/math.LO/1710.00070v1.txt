We analyze the Dual Ramsey Theorem for k partitions and \ell colors (\mathsf{DRT}^k_\ell) in the context of reverse math, effective analysis, and strong reductions. Over \mathsf{RCA}_0, the Dual Ramsey Theorem stated for Baire colorings is equivalent to the statement for clopen colorings and to a purely combinatorial theorem \mathsf{cDRT}^k_\ell.   When the theorem is stated for Borel colorings and k\geq 3, the resulting principles are essentially relativizations of \mathsf{cDRT}^k_\ell. For each \alpha, there is a computable Borel code for a \Delta^0_\alpha coloring such that any partition homogeneous for it computes \emptyset^{(\alpha)} or \emptyset^{(\alpha-1)} depending on whether \alpha is infinite or finite.   For k=2, we present partial results giving bounds on the effective content of the principle. A weaker version for \Delta^0_n reduced colorings is equivalent to \mathsf{D}^n_2 over \mathsf{RCA}_0+\mathsf{I}\Sigma^0_{n-1} and in the sense of strong Weihrauch reductions.
