Moisil in 1941, while constructing the algebraic models of n-valued {\L}ukasiewicz logic defined the set B^{[n]},where B is a Boolean algebra and `n' being a natural number. Further it was proved by Moisil himself the representations of n-valued {\L}ukasiewicz Moisil algebra in terms of B^{[n]}. In this article, structural representation results for Stone, dual Stone and double Stone algebras are proved similar to Moisil's work by showing that elements of these algebras can be looked upon as monotone ordered tuple of sets. 3-valued semantics of logic for Stone algebra, dual Stone algebras and 4-valued semantics of logic for double Stone algebras are proposed and established soundness and completeness results.
