We study the notion of tightly stationary sets which was introduced by Foreman and Magidor in \cite{ForMag-MS}. We obtain two consistency results which show that it is possible for a sequence of regular cardinals ( \kappa_n )_{n < \omega} to have the property that for every sequence \vec{S}, of some fixed-cofinality stationary sets S_n \subseteq \kappa_n, \vec{S} is tightly stationary in a generic extension. The results are obtained using variations of the short-extenders forcing method.
