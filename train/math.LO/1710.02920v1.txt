We prove a version of a small index property theorem for strong amalgamation classes. Our result builds on an earlier theorem by Lascar and Shelah (in their case, for saturated models of uncountable first-order theories). We then study versions of the small index property for various non-elementary classes. In particular, we obtain the small index property for quasiminimal pregeometry structures.
