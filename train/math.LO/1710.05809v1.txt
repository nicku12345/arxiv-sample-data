We prove the following continuous analogue of Vaught's Two-Cardinal Theorem: if for some \kappa>\lambda\geq \aleph_0, a continuous theory T has a model with density character \kappa which has a definable subset of density character \lambda, then T has a model with density character \aleph_1 which has a separable definable subset. We also show that if we assume that T is \omega-stable, then if T has a model of density character \aleph_1 with a separable definable set, then for any uncountable \kappa we can find a model of T with density character \kappa which has a separable definable subset. In order to prove this, we develop an approximate notion of quasi-minimality for the continuous setting. We apply these results to show a continuous version of the forward direction of the Baldwin-Lachlan characterization of uncountable categoricity: if a continuous theory T is uncountably categorical, then T is \omega-stable and has no Vaughtian pairs.
