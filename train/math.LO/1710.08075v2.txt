We study several cardinal characteristics of closed graphs G on compact metrizable spaces. In particular, we address the question when it is consistent for the bounding number to be strictly smaller than the smallest size of a set not covered by countably many compact G-anticliques. We also provide a descriptive set theoretic characterization of the class of analytic graphs with countable coloring number.
