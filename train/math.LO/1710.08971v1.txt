A theorem of single-sorted algebra states that, for a closure space (A,J) and a natural number n, the closure operator J on the set A is n-ary if, and only if, there exists a single-sorted signature \Sigma and a \Sigma-algebra \mathbf{A} such that every operation of \mathbf{A} is of an arity \leq n and J = \mathrm{Sg}_{\mathbf{A}}, where \mathrm{Sg}_{\mathbf{A}} is the subalgebra generating operator on A determined by \mathbf{A}. On the other hand, a theorem of Tarski asserts that if J is an n-ary closure operator on a set A with n\geq 2, and if i<j with i, j\in \mathrm{IrB}(A,J), where \mathrm{IrB}(A,J) is the set of all natural numbers n such that (A,J) has an irredundant basis (\equiv minimal generating set) of n elements, such that \{i+1,\ldots, j-1\}\cap \mathrm{IrB}(A,J) = \varnothing, then j-i\leq n-1. In this article we state and prove the many-sorted counterparts of the above theorems. But, we remark, regarding the first one under an additional condition: the uniformity of the many-sorted closure operator.
