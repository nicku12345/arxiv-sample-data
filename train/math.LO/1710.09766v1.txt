We study \Sigma_1(\omega_1)-definable sets (i.e. sets that are equal to the collection of all sets satisfying a certain \Sigma_1-formula with parameter \omega_1) in the presence of large cardinals. Our results show that the existence of a Woodin cardinal and a measurable cardinal above it imply that no well-ordering of the reals is \Sigma_1(\omega_1)-definable, the set of all stationary subsets of \omega_1 is not \Sigma_1(\omega_1)-definable and the complement of every \Sigma_1(\omega_1)-definable Bernstein subset of {}^{\omega_1}\omega_1 is not \Sigma_1(\omega_1)-definable. In contrast, we show that the existence of a Woodin cardinal is compatible with the existence of a \Sigma_1(\omega_1)-definable well-ordering of \mathrm{H}({\omega_2}) and the existence of a \Delta_1(\omega_1)-definable Bernstein subset of {}^{\omega_1}\omega_1. We also show that, if there are infinitely many Woodin cardinals and a measurable cardinal above them, then there is no \Sigma_1(\omega_1)-definable uniformization of the club filter on \omega_1. Moreover, we prove a perfect set theorem for \Sigma_1(\omega_1)-definable subsets of {}^{\omega_1}\omega_1, assuming that there is a measurable cardinal and the non-stationary ideal on \omega_1 is saturated. The proofs of these results use iterated generic ultrapowers and Woodin's \mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{max}}-forcing. Finally, we also prove variants of some of these results for \Sigma_1(\kappa)-definable subsets of {}^{\kappa}\kappa, in the case where \kappa itself has certain large cardinal properties.
