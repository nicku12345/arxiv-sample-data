We study the algorithmic complexity of embeddings between bi-embeddable equivalence structures. We define the notions of computable bi-embeddable categoricity, (relative) \Delta^0_\alpha bi-embeddable categoricity, and degrees of bi-embeddable categoricity. These notions mirror the classical notions used to study the complexity of isomorphisms between structures. We show that the notions of \Delta^0_\alpha bi-embeddable categoricity and relative \Delta^0_\alpha bi-embeddable categoricity coincide for equivalence structures for \alpha=1,2,3. We also prove that computable equivalence structures have degree of bi-embeddable categoricity \mathbf{0},\mathbf{0}', or \mathbf{0}''. We obtain results on index sets of computable equivalence structure with respect to bi-embeddability.
