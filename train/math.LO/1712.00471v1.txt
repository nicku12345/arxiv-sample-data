In the following paper we propose a model-theoretical way of comparing the "strength" of various truth theories which are conservative over PA.   Let \mathfrak{Th} denote the class of models of PA which admit an expansion to a model of theory Th. We show (combining some well known results and original ideas) that \mathfrak{PA}\supset \mathfrak{TB}\supset \mathfrak{RS}\supset \mathfrak{UTB}\supseteq\mathfrak{CT^-}, where \mathfrak{PA} denotes simply the class of all models of PA and \mathfrak{RS} denotes the class of recursively saturated models of PA. Our main original result is that every model of PA which admits an expansion to a model of CT{}^-, admits also an expanion to a model of UTB. Moreover, as a corollary to one of the results we conclude that UTB is not relatively interpretable in TB, thus answering the question of Fujimoto.
