This paper is a follow-up to "Models of PT{}^- with internal induction for total formulae." We give a strenghtening of the main result on the semantical non-conservativity of the theory of PT{}^- with internal induction for total formulae (PT{}^- + INT(tot)). We show that if to PT{}^- the axiom of internal induction for all arithmetical formulae is added (PT{}^-), then this theory is semantically stronger than PT{}^- + INT(tot). In particular the latter is not relatively truth definable (in the sense of Fujimoto) in the former. Last but not least we provide an axiomatic theory of truth which meets the requirements put forward by Fischer and Horsten in "The expressive power of truth."
