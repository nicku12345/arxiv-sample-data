We present a model of set theory, in which, for a given n\ge2, there exists a non-ROD-uniformizable planar lightface \varPi^1_n set in \mathbb R\times\mathbb R, whose all vertical cross-sections are countable sets (and in fact Vitali classes), while all planar boldface \bf\Sigma^1_n sets with countable cross-sections are \bf\Delta^1_{n+1}-uniformizable. Thus it is true in this model, that the ROD-uniformization principle for sets with countable cross-sections first fails precisely at a given projective level.
