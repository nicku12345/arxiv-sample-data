Let \mathscr{L} be a recursive language. Let S(\mathscr{L}) be the set of \mathscr{L}-structures with domain \omega. Let \Phi : {}^\omega 2 \rightarrow S(\mathscr{L}) be a \Delta_1^1 function with the property that for all x,y \in {}^\omega 2, \omega_1^x = \omega_1^y if and only if \Phi(x) \approx_{\mathscr{L}} \Phi(y). Then there is some x \in {}^\omega 2 so that \mathrm{SR}(\Phi(x)) = \omega_1^x + 1.
