For p \in [0,1] let \mathcal D(p) be the mass problem of infinite bit sequences~y (i.e., \{0,1\}-valued functions) such that for each computable bit sequence x, the bit sequence  x \leftrightarrow y has asymptotic lower density at most p (where x \leftrightarrow y has a 1 in position n iff x(n) = y(n)).   We show that all members of this family of mass problems parameterized by a real p with 0 < p<1/2  have the same complexity in the sense of Muchnik reducibility. We prove this by showing Muchnik equivalence of the problems \mathcal D(p) with the mass problem \mathrm{IOE}(2^ { 2^ n}).   As a dual of the problem \mathcal D(p), define \mathcal B(p), for 0 \le p < 1/2, to be the set of bit sequences y such that \underline \rho (x \leftrightarrow y) > p for each computable set~x. We prove that the Medvedev (and hence Muchnik) complexity of the mass problems \mathcal B(p) is the same for all p \in (0, 1/2), by showing that they are Medvedev equivalent to the mass problem of functions bounded by 2^{2^ n} that are almost everywhere different from each computable function.   Together with Joseph Miller, we obtain a proper hierarchy of the mass problems of type \mathrm{IOE}: We study cardinal characteristics in the sense of set theory that are analogous to the highness properties above.
