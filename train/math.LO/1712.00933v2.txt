Suppose T is totally transcendental and every minimal non-locally-modular type is nonorthogonal to a nonisolated minimal type over the empty set. It is shown that a finite rank type p=tp(a/A) is isolated if and only if a is independent from q(\mathcal U) over Ab for every b\in \operatorname{acl}(Aa) and q\in S(Ab) nonisolated and minimal. This applies to the theory of differentially closed fields -- where it is motivated by the differential Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence problem -- and the theory of compact complex manifolds.
