Rado's Conjecture is a compactness/reflection principle that says any nonspecial tree of height \omega_1 has a nonspecial subtree of size \leq \aleph_1. Though incompatible with Martin's Axiom, Rado's Conjecture turns out to have many interesting consequences that are consequences of forcing axioms. In this paper, we obtain consistency results concerning Rado's Conjecture and its Baire version. In particular, we show a fragment of PFA, that is the forcing axiom for \emph{Baire Indestructibly proper forcings}, is compatible with the Baire Rado's Conjecture. As a corollary, Baire Rado's Conjecture does not imply Rado's Conjecture. Then we discuss the strength and limitations of the Baire Rado's Conjecture regarding its interaction with simultaneous stationary reflection and some families of weak square principles. Finally we investigate the influence of the Rado's Conjecture on some polarized partition relations.
