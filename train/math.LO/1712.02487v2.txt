We discuss the generalized Kurepa hypothesis KH_{\lambda} at singular cardinals \lambda. In particular, we answer questions of Erd\"{o}s-Hajnal [1] and Todorcevic [6], [7] by showing that GCH does not imply KH_{\aleph_\omega} nor the existence of a family  \mathcal{F} \subseteq [\aleph_\omega]^{\aleph_0} of size \aleph_{\omega+1} such that \mathcal{F} \restriction X has size \aleph_0 for every X \subseteq S, |X|=\aleph_0.
