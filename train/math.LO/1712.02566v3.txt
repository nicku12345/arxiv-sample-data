We introduce and study a notion of canonical set theoretical truth, which means truth in a `canonical model', i.e. a transitive class model that is uniquely characterized by some \in-formula. We show that this notion of truth is `informative', i.e. there are statements that hold in all canonical models but do not follow from ZFC, such as Reitz' ground model axiom or the nonexistence of measurable cardinals. We also show that ZF+V=L[\mathbb{R}]+AD has no canonical models. On the other hand, we show that there are canonical models for `every real has sharp'. Moreover, we consider `theory-canonical' statements that only fix a transitive class model of ZFC up to elementary equivalence and show that it is consistent relative to large cardinals that there are theory-canonical models with measurable cardinals and that theory-canonicity is still informative in the sense explained above.
