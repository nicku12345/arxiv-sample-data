Shelah has provided sufficient conditions for an L_{\omega_1, \omega}-sentence \psi to have arbitrarily large models and for a Morley-like theorem to hold of \psi. These conditions involve structural and set-theoretic assumptions on all the \aleph_n's. Using tools of Boney, Shelah, and the second author, we give assumptions on \aleph_0 and \aleph_1 which suffice when \psi is restricted to be universal:   \mathbf{Theorem} Assume 2^{\aleph_{0}} < 2 ^{\aleph_{1}}. Let \psi be a universal L_{\omega_{1}, \omega}-sentence.   - If \psi is categorical in \aleph_{0} and 1 \leq I(\psi, \aleph_{1}) < 2 ^{\aleph_{1}}, then \psi has arbitrarily large models and categoricity of \psi in some uncountable cardinal implies categoricity of \psi in all uncountable cardinals.   - If \psi is categorical in \aleph_1, then \psi is categorical in all uncountable cardinals.   The theorem generalizes to the framework of L_{\omega_1, \omega}-definable tame abstract elementary classes with primes.
