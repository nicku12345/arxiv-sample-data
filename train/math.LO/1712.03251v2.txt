Let \operatorname{Con}(\mathbf T)\!\restriction\!x denote the finite consistency statement "there are no proofs of contradiction in \mathbf T with \leq x symbols". For a large class of natural theories \mathbf T, Pudl\'ak has shown that the lengths of the shortest proofs of \operatorname{Con}(\mathbf T)\!\restriction\!n in the theory \mathbf T itself are bounded by a polynomial in n. At the same time he conjectures that \mathbf T does not have polynomial proofs of the finite consistency statements \operatorname{Con}(\mathbf T+\operatorname{Con}(\mathbf T))\!\restriction\!n. In contrast we show that Peano arithmetic (\mathbf{PA}) has polynomial proofs of \operatorname{Con}(\mathbf{PA}+\operatorname{Con}^*(\mathbf{PA}))\!\restriction\!n, where \operatorname{Con}^*(\mathbf{PA}) is the slow consistency statement for Peano arithmetic, introduced by S.-D. Friedman, Rathjen and Weiermann. We also obtain a new proof of the result that the usual consistency statement \operatorname{Con}(\mathbf{PA}) is equivalent to \varepsilon_0 iterations of slow consistency. Our argument is proof-theoretic, while previous investigations of slow consistency relied on non-standard models of arithmetic.
