The main result of this paper is an improvement of the upper bound on the cardinal invariant {\mathord{\mathrm{cov}}}^{\ast}({\mathcal{Z}}_{0}) that was discovered by Raghavan and Shelah in an earlier paper. Here {\mathcal{Z}}_{0} is the ideal of subsets of the set of natural numbers that have asymptotic density zero. This improved upper bound is also dualized to get a better lower bound on the cardinal {\mathord{\mathrm{non}}}^{\ast}({\mathcal{Z}}_{0}). En route some variations on the splitting number are introduced and several relationships between these variants are proved.
