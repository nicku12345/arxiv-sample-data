A subset of a model of {\sf PA} is called neutral if it does not change the \mathrm{dcl} relation. A model with undefinable neutral classes is called neutrally expandable. We study the existence and non-existence of neutral sets in various models of {\sf PA}. We show that cofinal extensions of prime models are neutrally expandable, and \omega_1-like neutrally expandable models exist, while no recursively saturated model is neutrally expandable. We also show that neutrality is not a first-order property. In the last section, we study a local version of neutral expandability.
