Given a collection A of holomorphic functions, we consider how to describe all the holomorphic functions locally definable from A. The notion of local definability of holomorphic functions was introduced by Wilkie, who gave a complete description of all functions locally definable from A in the neighbourhood of a generic point. We prove that this description is no longer complete in the neighbourhood of non-generic points. More precisely, we produce three examples of holomorphic functions which suggest that at least three new operations need to be added to Wilkie's description in order to capture local definability in its entirety. The constructions illustrate the interaction between resolution of singularities and definability in the o-minimal setting.
