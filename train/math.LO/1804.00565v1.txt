An explicit categorical equivalence is defined between a proper subvariety of the class of PMV-algebras, as defined by Di Nola and Dvure\check{c}enskij, to be called PMV_f-algebras, and the category of semi-low f_u-rings. This categorical representation is done using the prime spectrum of the MV-algebras, through the equivalence between MV-algebras and l_u-groups established by Mundici, from the perspective of the Dubuc-Poveda approach, that extends the construction defined by Chang on chains. As a particular case, semi-low f_u-rings associated to Boolean algebras are characterized. Besides we show that class of PMV_f-algebras is coextensive.
