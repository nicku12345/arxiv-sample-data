Plonka sums consist of an algebraic construction similar, in some sense to direct limits, which allows to represent classes of algebras defined by means of regular identities (namely those equations where the same set of variables appears on both sides). Recently, Plonka sums have been connected to logic, as they provide algebraic semantics to logics obtained by imposing a syntactic filter to given logics. In this paper, I present a very general topological duality for classes of algebras admitting a Plonka sum representation in terms of dualisable algebras.
