We prove under V=L that the inclusion modulo the non-stationary ideal is a \Sigma_1^1-complete quasi-order in the generalized Borel-reducibility hierarchy (\kappa>\omega). This improvement to known results in L has many new consequences concerning the \Sigma_1^1-completeness of quasi-orders and equivalence relations such as the embeddability of dense linear orders as well as the equivalence modulo various versions of the non-stationary ideal. This serves as a partial or complete answer to several open problems stated in literature. Additionally the theorem is applied to prove a dichotomy in L: If the isomorphism of a countable first-order theory (not necessarily complete) is not \Delta_1^1, then it is \Sigma_1^1-complete.   We also study the case V\ne L and prove \Sigma_1^1-completeness results for weakly ineffable and weakly compact \kappa.
