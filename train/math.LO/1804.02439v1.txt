We show that the (typical) quantitative considerations about proper (as too big) and small classes are just tangential facts regarding the consistency of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with Choice. Effectively, we will construct a first-order logic theory D-ZFC (Dual theory of ZFC) strictly based on (a particular sub-collection of) proper classes with a corresponding special membership relation, such that ZFC and D-ZFC are meta-isomorphic frameworks (together with a more general dualization theorem). More specifically, for any standard formal definition, axiom and theorem that can be described and deduced in ZFC, there exists a corresponding `dual' version in D-ZFC and vice versa. Finally, we prove the meta-fact that (classic) mathematics (i.e. theories grounded on ZFC) and dathematics (i.e. dual theories grounded on D-ZFC) are meta-isomorphic. This shows that proper classes are as suitable (primitive notions) as sets for building a foundational framework for mathematics.
