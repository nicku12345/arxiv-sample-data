A relation algebra is measurable if the identity element is a sum of atoms, and the square x;1;x of each subidentity atom x is a sum of non-zero functional elements. These functional elements form a group Gx. We prove that a measurable relation algebra in which the groups Gx are all finite and cyclic is completely representable. A structural description of these algebras is also given.
