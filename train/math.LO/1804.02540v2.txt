Danos and Regnier (1989) introduced the par-switching condition for the multiplicative proof-structures and simplified the sequentialization theorem of Girard (1987) by the use of par-switching. Danos and Regner (1989) also generalized the par-switching to a switching for n-ary connectives (an n-ary switching, in short) and showed that the "expansion" property which means that any "excluded-middle" formula has a correct proof-net in the sense of their n-ary switching. They added a remark that the sequentialization theorem does not hold with their switching. Their definition of switching for n-ary connectives is a natural generalization of the original switching for the binary connectives. However, there are many other possible definitions of switching for n-ary connectives. We give an alternative and "natural" definition of n-ary switching, and we remark that the proof of sequentialization theorem by Olivier Laurent with the par-switching works for our n-ary switching; hence that the sequentialization theorem holds for our n-ary switching. On the other hand, we remark that the "expansion" property does not hold with our switching anymore. We point out that no definition of n-ary switching satisfies both the sequentialization theorem and the "expansion" property at the same time except for the purely tensor-based (or purely par-based) connectives.
