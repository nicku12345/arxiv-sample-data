This note characterizes a universal Kripke frame for the variable-free fragment of the reflection calculus with conservativity operators RC^\nabla. The frame here is obtained from the set of all filters on the Ignatiev RC^\nabla-algebra which is an isomorphic presentation of the Lindenbaum--Tarski algebra of the variable-free fragment of RC^\nabla. We give a constructive `coordinatewise' characterization of the set of filters and of the frame relations corresponding to the modalities of the algebra.
