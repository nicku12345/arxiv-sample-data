Boudou and the authors have recently introduced the intuitionistic temporal logic \sf ITL^e and shown it to be decidable. In this article we show that the `henceforth'-free fragment of this logic is complete for the class of non-deterministic quasimodels introduced by Fern\'andez-Duque. From this and results of Boudou, Romero and the authors, we conclude that this fragment is also complete for the standard semantics of \sf ITL^e over the class of expanding posets.
