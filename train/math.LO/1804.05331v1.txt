The blog is somewhat shorter than in previous years, It contains new insights in a variety of areas, including computability, quantum algorithmic version of the SMB theorem, descriptions of groups (both discrete and profinite), metric spaces. There are also lots of open questions in computability, randomness, and computable model theory.
