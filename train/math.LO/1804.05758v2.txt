In this paper we analyze the connection between some properties of partially strongly compact cardinals: the completion of filters of certain size and instances of the compactness of \mathcal{L}_{\kappa,\kappa}. Using this equivalence we show that if any \kappa-complete filter on \lambda can be extended to a \kappa-complete ultrafilter and \lambda^{<\kappa} = \lambda then \square(\mu) fails for all regular \mu\in[\kappa,2^\lambda]. As an application, we improve the lower bound for the consistency strength of \kappa-compactness, a case which was explicitly considered by Mitchell.
