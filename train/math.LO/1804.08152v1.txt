Let \mbox{TFAG} be the theory of torsion-free abelian groups. We show that if there is no countable transitive model of ZFC^- + \kappa(\omega) exists, then \mbox{TFAG} is a \Delta^1_2-complete; in particular, this is consistent with ZFC. We define the \alpha-ary Schr\"{o}der- Bernstein property, and show that \mbox{TFAG} fails the \alpha-ary Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein property for every \alpha < \kappa(\omega). We leave open whether or not \mbox{TFAG} can have the \kappa(\omega)-ary Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein property; if it did, then it would not be a \Delta^1_2-complete, and hence not Borel complete.
