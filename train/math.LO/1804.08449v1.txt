We employ the theory of canonical extensions to study residuation algebras whose associated relational structures are functional, i.e., for which the ternary relations associated to the expanded operations admit an interpretation as (possibly partial) functions. Providing a partial answer to a question of Gehrke, we demonstrate that no universal first-order sentence in the language of residuation algebras is equivalent to the functionality of the associated relational structures.
