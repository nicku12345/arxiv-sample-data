Building off of recent results on Keisler's order, we show that consistently, \leq_{SP} has infinitely many classes. In particular, we define the property of \leq k-type amalgamation for simple theories, for each 2 \leq k < \omega. If we let T_{n, k} be the theory of the random k-ary, n-clique free random hyper-graph, then T_{n, k} has \leq k-1-type amalgamation but not \leq k-type amalgamation. We show that consistently, if T has \leq k-type amalgamation then T_{k+1, k} \not \leq_{SP} T, thus producing infinitely many \leq_{SP}-classes. The same construction gives a simplified proof of Shelah's theorem that consistently, the maximal \leq_{SP}-class is exactly the class of unsimple theories. Finally, we show that consistently, if T has <\aleph_0-type amalgamation, then T \leq_{SP} T_{rg}, the theory of the random graph.
