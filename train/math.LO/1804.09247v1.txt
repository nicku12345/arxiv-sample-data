We present the (Lascar) Galois group of any countable theory as a quotient of a compact Polish group by an F_\sigma normal subgroup: in general, as a topological group, and under NIP, also in terms of Borel cardinality. This allows us to obtain similar results for arbitrary strong types defined on a single complete type over \emptyset. As an easy conclusion of our main theorem, we get the main result from our recent paper joint with Andand Pillay, which says that for any strong type defined on a single complete type over \emptyset, smoothness is equivalent to type-definability.   We also explain how similar results are obtained in the case of bounded quotients of type-definable groups. This gives us a generalization of a former result from the aforementioned paper about bounded quotients of type-definable subgroups of definable groups.
