In this work, we investigate the commutative monoids over which the axiomatizable class of regular S-acts is primitive normal and antiadditive. We prove that the primitive normality of an axiomatizable class of regular S-acts over the commutative monoid S is equivalent to the antiadditivity of this class and it is equivalent to the linearity of the order on a semigroup R such that an S-act SR is a maximal (under the inclusion) regular subact of the S-act SS.
