In this paper, we study the provability logic of intuitionistic theories of arithmetic that prove their own completeness. We prove a completeness theorem for theories equipped with two provability predicates \Box and \triangle that prove the schemes A\to\triangle A and \Box\triangle S\to\Box S for S\in\Sigma_1. Using this theorem, we determine the logic of fast provability for a number of intuitionistic theories. Furthermore, we reprove a theorem previously obtained by M. Ardeshir and S. Mojtaba Mojtahedi determining the \Sigma_1-provability logic of Heyting Arithmetic.
