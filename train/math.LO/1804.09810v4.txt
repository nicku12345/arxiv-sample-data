Given a class \mathcal C of models, a binary relation {\mathcal R} between models, and a model-theoretic language L, we consider the modal logic and the modal algebra of the theory of \mathcal C in L where the modal operator is interpreted via \mathcal R. We discuss how modal theories of \mathcal C and {\mathcal R} depend on the model-theoretic language, their Kripke completeness, and expressibility of the modality inside L. We calculate such theories for the submodel and the quotient relations. We prove a downward L\"owenheim--Skolem theorem for first-order language expanded with the modal operator for the extension relation between models.
