We generalise the \alpha-Ramsey cardinals introduced in Holy and Schlicht (2018) for cardinals \alpha to arbitrary ordinals \alpha, and answer several questions posed in that paper. In particular, we show that \alpha-Ramseys are downwards absolute to the core model K for all \alpha of uncountable cofinality, that strategic \omega-Ramsey cardinals are equiconsistent with remarkable cardinals and that strategic \alpha-Ramsey cardinals are equiconsistent with measurable cardinals for all \alpha>\omega. We also show that the n-Ramseys satisfy indescribability properties and use them to provide a game-theoretic characterisation of completely ineffable cardinals, as well as establishing further connections between the \alpha-Ramsey cardinals and the Ramsey-like cardinals introduced in Gitman (2011), Feng (1990) and Sharpe and Welch (2011).
