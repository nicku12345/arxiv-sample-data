In arXiv:1604.08705 we introduced the propositional modal logic \textbf{TSC} (which stands for Turing Schmerl Calculus) which adequately describes the provable interrelations between different kinds of Turing progressions. In arXiv:1709.04715 we defined a model \mathcal{J} which is proven to be a universal model for \textbf{TSC} based on the intensively studied Ignatiev's universal model for the closed fragment of \textbf{GLP} (G\"odel L\"ob's polymodal provability logic). In the current paper we present a new universal frame \mathcal{H}, which is a slight modification of \mathcal{J}, and whose domain allows for a modal definability of each of its worlds.
