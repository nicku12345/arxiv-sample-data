Fuzzy Epistemic Logic is an important formalism for approximate reasoning. It extends the well known basic propositional logic BL, introduced by H\'ajek, by offering the ability to reason about possibility and necessity of fuzzy propositions. We consider an algebraic approach to study this logic, introducing Epistemic BL-algebras. These algebras turn to be a generalization of both, Pseudomonadic Algebras introduced by \cite{Bez2002} and serial, euclidean and transitive Bi-modal G\"odel Algebras proposed by \cite{CaiRod2015}. We present the connection between this class of algebras and fuzzy possibilistic frames, as a first step to solve an open problem proposed by H\'ajek \cite[chap. ~8]{HajekBook98}.
