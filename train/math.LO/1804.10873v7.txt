In this paper, we give a duality theorem between the category of \kappa-additive complete atomic modal algebras and the category of \kappa-downward directed multi-relational Kripke frames, for any cardinal number \kappa. Multi-relational Kripke frames are not Kripke frames for multi-modal logic, but frames for monomodal logics in which the modal operator \Diamond does not distribute over (possibly infinite) disjunction, in general. We first define homomorphisms of multi-relational Kripke frames, and then show the equivalence between the category of \kappa-downward directed multi-relational Kripke frames and the category \kappa-complete neighborhood frames, from which the duality theorem follows. We also present another direct proof of this duality based on the technique given by Minari.
