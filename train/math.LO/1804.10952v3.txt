We work with a pre-\lambda-frame, which is an abstract elementary class (AEC) endowed with a collection of basic types and a non-forking relation satisfying certain natural properties with respect to models of cardinality \lambda.   We investigate the density of uniqueness triples in a given pre-\lambda-frame \mathfrak s, that is, under what circumstances every basic triple admits a non-forking extension that is a uniqueness triple. Prior results in this direction required strong hypotheses on \mathfrak s.   Our main result is an improvement, in that we assume far fewer hypotheses on \mathfrak s. In particular, we do not require \mathfrak s to satisfy the extension, uniqueness, stability, or symmetry properties, or any form of local character, though we do impose the amalgamation and stability properties in \lambda^+, and we do assume \diamondsuit(\lambda^+).   As a corollary, by applying our main result to the trivial \lambda-frame, it follows that in any AEC \mathbf K satisfying modest hypotheses on \mathbf K_\lambda and \mathbf K_{\lambda^+}, the set of *-domination triples in \mathbf K_\lambda is dense among the non-algebraic triples. We also apply our main result to the non-splitting relation, obtaining the density of uniqueness triples from very few hypotheses.
