We study the positions in the Weihrauch lattice of parallel products of various combinatorial principles related to Ramsey's theorem. Among other results, we obtain an answer to a question of Brattka, by showing that Ramsey's theorem for pairs (\mathsf{RT}^2_2) is strictly Weihrauch below the parallel product of the stable Ramsey's theorem for pairs and the cohesive principle (\mathsf{SRT}^2_2 \times \mathsf{COH}).
