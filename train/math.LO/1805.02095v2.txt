It is well-known that natural axiomatic theories are well-ordered by consistency strength. However, it is possible to construct descending chains of artificial theories with respect to consistency strength. We provide an explanation of this well-orderness phenomenon by studying a coarsening of the consistency strength order, namely, the \Pi^1_1 reflection strength order. We prove that there are no descending sequences of \Pi^1_1 sound extensions of \mathsf{ACA}_0 in this order. Accordingly, we can attach a rank in this order, which we call reflection rank, to any \Pi^1_1 sound extension of \mathsf{ACA}_0. We prove that for any \Pi^1_1 sound theory T extending \mathsf{ACA}_0^+, the reflection rank of T equals the proof-theoretic ordinal of T. We also prove that the proof-theoretic ordinal of \alpha iterated \Pi^1_1 reflection is \varepsilon_\alpha. Finally, we use our results to provide straightforward well-foundedness proofs of ordinal notation systems based on reflection principles.
