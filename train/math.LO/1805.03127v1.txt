For a complete, stable theory T we construct, in a reasonably canonical way, a related stable theory T^* which has higher independent amalgamation properties over the algebraic closure of the empty-set. The theory T^* is an algebraic cover of T and we give an explicit description of the finite covers involved in the construction of T^* from T. This follows an approach of E. Hrushovski. If T is almost strongly minimal with a 0-definable strongly minimal set, then we show that T^* has higher amalgamation over any algebraically closed subset.
