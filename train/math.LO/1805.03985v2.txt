Let \mathcal{K}:=(K;+,\cdot, D, 0, 1) be a differentially closed field of characteristic 0 with field of constants C.   In the first part of the paper we explore the connection between Ax-Schanuel type theorems (predimension inequalities) for a differential equation E(x,y) and the geometry of the fibres U_s:=\{ y:E(s,y) \wedge y \notin C \} where s is a non-constant element. We show that certain types of predimension inequalities imply strong minimality and geometric triviality of U_s. Moreover, the induced structure on the Cartesian powers of U_s is given by special subvarieties. In particular, since the j-function satisfies an Ax-Schanuel inequality of the required form (due to Pila and Tsimerman), applying our results to the j-function we recover a theorem of Freitag and Scanlon stating that the differential equation of j defines a strongly minimal set with trivial geometry.   In the second part of the paper we study strongly minimal sets in the j-reducts of differentially closed fields. Let E_j(x,y) be the (two-variable) differential equation of the j-function. We prove a Zilber style classification result for strongly minimal sets in the reduct \mathsf{K}:=(K;+, \cdot, E_j). More precisely, we show that in \mathsf{K} all strongly minimal sets are geometrically trivial or non-orthogonal to C. Our proof is based on the Ax-Schanuel theorem and a matching Existential Closedness statement which asserts that systems of equations in terms of E_j have solutions in \mathsf{K} unless having a solution contradicts Ax-Schanuel.
