Given a space X we investigate the descriptive complexity class \G_X of the set \FF_0(X) of all its closed zero-dimensional subsets, viewed as a subset of the hyperspace \FF(X) of all closed subsets of X. We prove that   \max \{ \G_X; \ X \text{ analytic } \}=\pca  and   \sup \{ \G_X; \ X \text{ Borel } \borm \xi\} \supseteq \Game \bora \xi for any countable ordinal \xi\geq1. In particular we prove that there exists a one-dimensional Polish subpace of 2^\wo\times \R^2 for which \FF_0(X) is not in the smallest non trivial pointclass closed under complementation and the Souslin operation \mathcal A\,.
