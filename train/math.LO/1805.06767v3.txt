A Steiner triple system is a set S together with a collection \mathcal{B} of subsets of S of size 3 such that any two elements of S belong to exactly one element of \mathcal{B}. It is well known that the class of finite Steiner triple systems has a Fra\"{\i}ss\'e limit M_{\mathrm{F}}. Here we show that the theory T^\ast_\mathrm{Sq} of M_{\mathrm{F}} is the model completion of the theory of Steiner triple systems. We also prove that T^\ast_\mathrm{Sq} is not small and it has quantifier elimination, \mathrm{TP}_2, \mathrm{NSOP}_1, elimination of hyperimaginaries and weak elimination of imaginaries.
