Suppose that T^* is an \omega_1-Aronszajn tree with no stationary antichain. We introduce a forcing axiom PFA(T^*) for proper forcings which preserve these properties of T^*. We prove that PFA(T^*) implies many of the strong consequences of PFA, such as the failure of very weak club guessing, that all of the cardinal characteristics of the continuum are greater than \omega_1, and the P-ideal dichotomy. On the other hand, PFA(T^*) implies some of the consequences of diamond principles, such as the existence of Knaster forcings which are not stationarily Knaster.
