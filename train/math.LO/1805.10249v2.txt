A computable structure \mathcal{A} has degree of categoricity \mathbf{d} if \mathbf{d} is exactly the degree of difficulty of computing isomorphisms between isomorphic computable copies of \mathcal{A}. Fokina, Kalimullin, and Miller showed that every degree d.c.e. in and above \mathbf{0}^{(n)}, for any n < \omega, and also the degree \mathbf{0}^{(\omega)}, are degrees of categoricity. Later, Csima, Franklin, and Shore showed that every degree \mathbf{0}^{(\alpha)} for any computable ordinal \alpha, and every degree d.c.e. in and above \mathbf{0}^{(\alpha)} for any successor ordinal \alpha, is a degree of categoricity. We show that every degree c.e. in and above \mathbf{0}^{(\alpha)}, for \alpha a limit ordinal, is a degree of categoricity. We also show that every degree c.e. in and above \mathbf{0}^{(\omega)} is the degree of categoricity of a prime model, making progress towards a question of Bazhenov and Marchuk.
