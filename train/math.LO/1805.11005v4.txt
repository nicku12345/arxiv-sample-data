Using a countable support product of creature forcing posets, we show that consistently, for uncountably many different functions the associated Yorioka ideals' uniformity numbers can be pairwise different. In addition we show that, in the same forcing extension, for two other types of simple cardinal characteristics parametrised by reals (localisation and anti-localisation cardinals), for uncountably many parameters the corresponding cardinals are pairwise different.
