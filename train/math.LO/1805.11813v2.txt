We calculate denotations under the Sweedler semantics of the Ehrhard-Regnier derivatives of various encodings of Turing machines into linear logic. We show that these derivatives calculate the rate of change of probabilities naturally arising in the Sweedler semantics of linear logic proofs. The resulting theory is applied to the problem of synthesising Turing machines by gradient descent.
