Ali Enayat had asked whether there is a nonstandard model of Peano arithmetic (PA) that can be represented as \langle\mathbb{Q},\oplus,\otimes\rangle, where \oplus and \otimes are continuous functions on the rationals \mathbb{Q}. We prove, affirmatively, that indeed every countable model of PA has such a continuous presentation on the rationals. More generally, we investigate the topological spaces that arise as such topological models of arithmetic. The reals \mathbb{R}, the reals in any finite dimension \mathbb{R}^n, the long line and the Cantor space do not, and neither does any Suslin line; many other spaces do; the status of the Baire space is open.
