In a recent work Foulis and Pulmannov\' a \cite{Foulis2012} studied the logical connectives in lattice effect algebras. In this paper we extend their study and investigate further the logical calculus for which the lattice effect algebras can serve as semantic models. We shall first focus on some properties of lattice effect algebras and will then give a complete axiomatisation of this logic.
