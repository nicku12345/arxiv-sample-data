We investigate the strength of a randomness notion \mathcal R as a set-existence principle in second-order arithmetic: for each Z there is an X that is \mathcal R-random relative to Z. We show that the equivalence between 2-randomness and being infinitely often C-incompressible is provable in \mathsf{RCA}_0. We verify that \mathsf{RCA}_0 proves the basic implications among randomness notions: 2-random \Rightarrow weakly 2-random \Rightarrow Martin-L\"{o}f random \Rightarrow computably random \Rightarrow Schnorr random. Also, over \mathsf{RCA}_0 the existence of computable randoms is equivalent to the existence of Schnorr randoms. We show that the existence of balanced randoms is equivalent to the existence of Martin-L\"{o}f randoms, and we describe a sense in which this result is nearly optimal.
