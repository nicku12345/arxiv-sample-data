We investigate maximal free sequences in the Boolean algebra \mathcal{P}(\omega)/\mathrm{fin}, as defined by D. Monk. We provide some information on the general structure of these objects and we are particularly interested in the minimal cardinality of a free sequence, a cardinal characteristic of the continuum denoted \mathfrak{f}. Answering a question of Monk, we demonstrate the consistency of \omega_1 = \mathfrak{i} = \mathfrak{f} < \mathfrak{u} = \omega_2. In fact, this consistency is demonstrated in the model of S. Shelah for \mathfrak{i} < \mathfrak{u}. Our paper provides a streamlined and mostly self contained presentation of this construction.
