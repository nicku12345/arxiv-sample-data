We give a complete description of the size of the conjugacy classes of the automorphism group of the random graph with respect to Christensen's Haar null ideal. It is shown that every non-Haar null class contains a translated copy of a nonempty portion of every compact set and that there are continuum many non-Haar null conjugacy classes. Our methods also yield a new proof of an old result of Truss.
