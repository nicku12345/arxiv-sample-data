In the present paper, we endow the logics of topological quasi Boolean algebras, topological quasi Boolean algebras 5, intermediate algebras of types 1-3, and pre-rough algebras with proper multi-type display calculi which are sound, complete, conservative, and enjoy cut elimination and subformula property. Our proposal builds on an algebraic analysis and applies the principles of the multi-type methodology in the design of display calculi.
