We introduce Strong Measuring, a maximal strengthening of J. T. Moore's Measuring principle, which asserts that every collection of fewer than continuum many closed bounded subsets of \omega_1 is measured by some club subset of \omega_1. The consistency of Strong Measuring with the negation of CH is shown, solving an open problem from about parametrized measuring principles. Specifically, we prove that Strong Measuring follows from MRP together with Martin's Axiom for \sigma-centered forcings, as well as from BPFA. We also consider strong versions of Measuring in the absence of the Axiom of Choice.
