Reverse Mathematics (RM hereafter) is a program in the foundations of mathematics founded by Friedman and developed extensively by Simpson and others. The aim of RM is to find the minimal axioms needed to prove a theorem of ordinary, i.e. non-set-theoretic, mathematics. As suggested by the title, this paper deals with the study of the topological notions of dimension and paracompactness, inside Kohlenbach's higher-order RM. As to splittings, there are some examples in RM of theorems A, B, C such that A\leftrightarrow(B\wedge C), i.e. A can be split into two independent (fairly natural) parts B and C, and the aforementioned topological notions give rise to a number of splittings involving highly natural A, B, C. Nonetheless, the higher-order picture is markedly different from the second-one: in terms of comprehension axioms, the proof in higher-order RM of e.g. the paracompactness of the unit interval requires full second-order arithmetic, while the second-order/countable version of paracompactness of the unit interval is provable in the base theory of second-order RM. We obtain similarly 'exceptional' results for the Urysohn identity, the Lindel\"of lemma, and partitions of unity. We show that our results exhibit a certain robustness, in that they do not depend on the exact definition of cover, even in the absence of the axiom of choice.
