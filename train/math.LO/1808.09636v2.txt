Bilattices provide an algebraic tool with which to model simultaneously knowledge and truth. They were introduced by Belnap in 1977 in a paper entitled \emph{How a computer should think}. Belnap argued that instead of using a logic with two values, for `true' (t) and `false' (f), a computer should use a logic with two further values, for `contradiction' (\top) and `no information' (\bot). The resulting structure is equipped with two lattice orders, a \emph{knowledge order} and a \emph{truth order}, and hence is called a \emph{bilattice}.   Prioritised default bilattices include not only values for `true' (t_0), `false' (f_0), `contradiction' and `no information', but also indexed families of default values, t_1, \dots, t_n and f_1, \dots, f_n, for simultaneous modelling of degrees of knowledge and truth.   We focus on a new family of prioritised default bilattices: \mathbf J_n, for n \in \omega. The bilattice \mathbf J_0 is precisely Belnap's seminal example. We address mathematical rather than logical aspects of our prioritised default bilattices. We obtain a single-sorted topological representation for the bilattices in the quasivariety \mathcal J_n generated by \mathbf J_n, and separately a multi-sorted topological representation for the bilattices in the variety \mathcal V_n generated by \mathbf J_n. Our results provide an interesting example where the multi-sorted duality for the variety has a simpler structure than the single-sorted duality for the quasivariety.
