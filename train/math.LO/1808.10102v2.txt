We investigate which infinite binary sequences (reals) are effectively random with respect to some continuous (i.e., non-atomic) probability measure. We prove that for every n, all but countably many reals are n-random for such a measure, where n indicates the arithmetical complexity of the Martin-L\"of tests allowed. The proof is based on a Borel determinacy argument and presupposes the existence of infinitely many iterates of the power set of the natural numbers. In the second part of the paper we present a metamathematical analysis showing that this assumption is indeed necessary. More precisely, there exists a computable function G such that, for any n, the statement `All but countably many reals are G(n)-random with respect to a continuous probability measure' cannot be proved in ZFC^-_n. Here ZFC^-_n stands for Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice, where the Power Set Axiom is replaced by the existence of n-many iterates of the power set of the natural numbers. The proof of the latter fact rests on a very general obstruction to randomness, namely the presence of an internal definability structure.
