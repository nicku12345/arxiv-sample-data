We show that if M is a countable transitive model of ZF and if a,b are reals not in M, then there is a G generic over M such that b \in L[a,G]. We then present several applications such as the following: if J is any countable transitive model of ZFC and M \not\subseteq J is another countable transitive model of ZFC of the same ordinal height \alpha, then there is a forcing extension N of J such that M \cup N is not included in any transitive model of ZFC of height \alpha. Also, assuming 0^\# exists, letting S be the set of reals generic over L, although S is disjoint from the Turing cone above 0^\#, we have that for any non-constructible real a, \{ a \oplus s : s \in S \} is cofinal in the Turing degrees.
