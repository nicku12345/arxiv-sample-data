We use the core model for sequences of measures to prove a new lower bound for the consistency strength of the failure of the SCH:   THEOREM   (i) If there is a singular strong limit cardinal \kappa such that 2^\kappa > kappa^+ then there is an inner model with a cardinal \kappa such that for all ordinals \alpha<\kappa there is an ordinal \nu < \kappa with o(\nu) > \alpha.   (ii) If there is a singular strong limit cardinal \kappa of uncountable cofinality such that 2^\kappa > \kappa^+ then there is an inner model with o(\kappa) = \kappa^{++}.   Since this paper was originally submitted, Gitik has improved this result to give exact lower bounds.
