We consider algebras with one binary operation \cdot and one generator ({\it monogenic}) and satisfying the left distributive law a\cdot (b\cdot c)=(a\cdot b)\cdot (a\cdot c). One can define a sequence of finite left-distributive algebras A_n, and then take a limit to get an infinite monogenic left-distributive algebra~A_\infty. Results of Laver and Steel assuming a strong large cardinal axiom imply that A_\infty is free; it is open whether the freeness of A_\infty can be proved without the large cardinal assumption, or even in Peano arithmetic. The main result of this paper is the equivalence of this problem with the existence of a certain algebra of increasing functions on natural numbers, called an {\it embedding algebra}. Using this and results of the first author, we conclude that the freeness of A_\infty is unprovable in primitive recursive arithmetic.
