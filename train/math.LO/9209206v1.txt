We study the relationship between Amoeba forcing (the partial order which generically adds a measure one set of random reals) and projective measurability. Given a universe V of set theory and a forcing notion P in V we say that V is Sigma^1_n - P - absolute iff for every Sigma^1_n-sentence phi with parameters in V we have V models phi iff V^P models phi.   We show that Sigma^1_4-Amoeba-absoluteness implies that forall a in omega^omega (omega_1^{L[a]} < omega_1^V), and hence Sigma^1_3-measurability. This answers a question of Haim Judah (private communication).
