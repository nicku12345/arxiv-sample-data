Let \kappa be a regular cardinal. Consider the Baire numbers of the spaces (2^{\theta})_\kappa (functions from \theta to 2 and the less than \kappa topology) for various \theta \geq \kappa. Let l be the number of such different Baire numbers. Models of set theory with l=1 or l=2 are known and it is also known that l is finite. We show here that if \kappa > \omega, then l could be any given finite number. We do not know whether the same is true for \kappa = \omega.
