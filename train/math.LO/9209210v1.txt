Let M be a transitive model of ZFC and let {\bf B} be a M-complete Boolean algebra in M. (In general a proper class.) We define a generalized notion of forcing with such Boolean algebras, ^*forcing. (A ^* forcing extension of M is a transitive set of the form M[{\bf G}] where {\bf G} is an M-complete ultrafilter on {\bf B}.) We prove that   1. If {\bf G} is a ^*forcing complete ultrafilter on {\bf B}, then M[{\bf G}]\models ZFC.   2. Let H\sub M. If there is a least transitive model N such that H\in M, Ord^M=Ord^N, and N\models ZFC, then we denote N by M[H]. We show that all models of ZFC of the form M[H] are ^*forcing extensions of M.   As an immediate corollary we get that L[0^{\#}] is a ^*forcing extension of L.
