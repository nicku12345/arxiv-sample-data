We show that square(theta) implies that there is a first countable <theta-collectionwise Hausdorff space that is not weakly theta-collectionwise Hausdorff. We also show that in the model obtained by Levy collapsing a weakly compact (supercompact) cardinal to omega_2, first countable aleph_1-collectionwise Hausdorff spaces are weakly aleph_2-collectionwise Hausdorff (weakly collectionwise Hausdorff). In the last section we show that assuming E^omega_theta, a certain theta-family of integer valued functions exists and that in the model obtained by Levy collapsing a supercompact cardinal to omega_2, these families do not exist.
