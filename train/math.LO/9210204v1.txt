We can generalize the definition of {\it splitting number } s(\kappa ) for \kappa uncountable regular: s(\kappa )=min\{ |\Cal S|:\Cal S\subset \Cal P(\kappa ) \forall a\in \kappa ^\kappa \exists b\in \Cal S |a\cap b|=|a\setminus b|=\kappa\} However,\exists \kappa>\aleph_0 s(\kappa )>\kappa ^+ becomes a considerable hypothesis,shown consistent from a supercompact.We show that it implies inner models of \exists \alpha :o(\alpha )=\alpha ^{++}
