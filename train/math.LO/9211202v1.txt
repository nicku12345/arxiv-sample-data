In this work we use a notion of rank first introduced by James Baumgartner and Peter Dordal and later developed independently by the third author to show that adding a Hechler real has strong combinatorial consequences.   We prove:   1) assuming omega_1^V = omega_1^L, there is no real in V[d] which is eventually different from the reals in L[d], where d is Hechler over V;   2) adding one Hechler real makes the invariants on the left-hand side of Cicho'n's diagram equal omega_1 and those on the right-hand side equal 2^omega and produces a maximal almost disjoint family of subsets of omega of size omega_1;   3) there is no perfect set of random reals over V in V[r][d], where r is random over V and d Hechler over V[r], thus answering a question of the first and second authors.   As an intermediate step in the proof of 3) we show that given models M subseteq N of ZFC such that there is a perfect set of random reals in N over M, either there is a dominating real in N over M or mu (2^omega cap M) = 0 in N.
