The purpose of this article is to indicate how a reformulation of Jensen's \Sigma^* theory (developed for the study of core models) can be used to provide a more satisfactory treatment of uniformization, hulls and Skolem functions for the J_\alpha's. Then we use this approach to fine structure to formulate a principle intended to capture the combinatorial content of the axiom V=L.
