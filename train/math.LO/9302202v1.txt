A stationary subset S of a regular uncountable cardinal \kappa {\it reflects fully} at regular cardinals if for every stationary set T \subseteq \kappa of higher order consisting of regular cardinals there exists an \alpha \in T such that S \cap \alpha is a stationary subset of \alpha. {\it Full Reflection} states that every stationary set reflects fully at regular cardinals. We will prove that under a slightly weaker assumption than \kappa having Mitchell order \kappa^{++} it is consistent that Full Reflection holds at every \lambda \leq \kappa and \kappa is measurable.
