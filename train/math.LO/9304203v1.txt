This paper is a technical continuation of ``Natural Axiom Schemata Extending ZFC. Truth in the Universe?'' In that paper we argue that CIFS is a natural axiom schema for the universe of sets. In particular it is a natural closure condition on V and a natural generalization of IFS(L). Here we shall prove the consistency of ZFC\ +\ CIFS relative to the existence of a transitive model of ZFC using the compactness theorem together with a class forcing.
