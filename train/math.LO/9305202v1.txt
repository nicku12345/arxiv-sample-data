We show that many spaces that look like the half~line~\halfline=[0,\infty) have, under~\CH, a \v{C}ech-Stone-remainder that is homeomorphic to~\Hstar. We also show that \CH is equivalent to the statement that all standard subcontinua of~\Hstar are homeomorphic. The proofs use Model-theoretic tools like reduced products and elementary equivalence; rather than constructing homeomorphisms we show that the spaces in question have isomorphic bases for the closed sets.
