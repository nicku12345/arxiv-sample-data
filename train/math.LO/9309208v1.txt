A category used by de Paiva to model linear logic also occurs in Vojtas's analysis of cardinal characteristics of the continuum. Its morphisms have been used in describing reductions between search problems in complexity theory. We describe this category and how it arises in these various contexts. We also show how these contexts suggest certain new multiplicative connectives for linear logic. Perhaps the most interesting of these is a sequential composition suggested by the set-theoretic application.
