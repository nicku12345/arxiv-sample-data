If S,T are stationary subsets of a regular uncountable cardinal \kappa, we say that S reflects fully in T, S<T, if for almost all \alpha \in T (except a nonstationary set) S \cap \alpha is stationary in \alpha . This relation is known to be a well founded partial ordering. We say that a given poset P is realized by the reflection ordering if there is a maximal antichain \langle X_p ; p \in P \rangle of stationary subsets of Reg(\kappa) so that   \forall p,q \in P \; \forall S\subseteq X_p, T\subseteq X_q \text{ stationary}:(S<T \leftrightarrow p<_P q ) .   We prove that if \kappa is \Cal P _2 \kappa -strong and P an arbitrary well founded poset of cardinality \leq \k^+ then there is a generic extension where P is realized by the reflection ordering on \kappa .
