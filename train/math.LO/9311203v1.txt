In this paper we isolate the notion of Stratified class forcing and show that Stratification implies cofinality-preservation and is preserved by iterations with the appropriate support. Many familiar class forcings are stratified and therefore can be simultaneously iterated without changing cofinalities, provided the proper support is used. Easton forcing, Backward Easton forcings and some modifications of Jensen coding are stratified. Jensen coding is not stratified but instead obeys a related property, Delta-Stratification, which is also preservedby iteration with an appropriate larger support.
