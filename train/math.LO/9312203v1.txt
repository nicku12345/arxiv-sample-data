Let U_0,U_1 be two normal measures on \kappa . We say that U_0 is in the Mitchell ordering less then U_1, U_0\vartriangleleft U_1, if U_0 \in Ult(V,U_1) . The ordering is well-known to be transitive and well-founded. It has been an open problem to find a model where the Mitchell ordering embeds the four-element poset |\; | . We show that in the Kunen-Paris extension all well-founded posets are embeddable. Hence there is no structural restriction on the Mitchell ordering. Moreover we show that it is possible to have two vartriangleleft-incomparable measures that extend in a generic extension into two \vartriangleleft-comparable measures.
