Let dec be the least cardinal kappa such that every function of first Baire class can be decomposed into kappa continuous functions. Cichon, Morayne, Pawlikowski and Solecki proved that cov(Meager) <= dec <= d and asked whether these inequalities could, consistently, be strict. By cov(Meager) is meant the least number of closed nowhere dense sets required to cover the real line and by d is denoted the least cardinal of a dominating family in omega^omega. Steprans showed that it is consistent that cov(Meager) not= dec. In this paper we show that the second inequality can also be made strict. The model where dec is different from d is the one obtained by adding omega_2 Miller - sometimes known as super-perfect or rational-perfect - reals to a model of the Continuum Hypothesis. It is somewhat surprising that the model used to establish the consistency of the other inequality, cov(Meager) not= dec, is a slight modification of the iteration of super-perfect forcing.
