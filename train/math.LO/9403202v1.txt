We study cohabitation of the poset P_S shooting a club through a given stationary subset S of \omega _1 with finite conditions with other forcings. Sample results:   (1) P_S "sometimes" preserves presaturatedness of NS_{\omega _1}   (2) P_S=P_T if S=T mod NS_{\omega _1} (in Boolean algebra sense)   (3) Cons ( one can embed Q, the poset adding \aleph _1 Cohen reals, to P_S such that reals in V^Q are the same as reals in V^{P_S}. )
