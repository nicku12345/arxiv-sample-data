A property of a filter, a kind of large cardinal property, suffices for the proof in Liu Shelah [LiSh:484] and is proved consistent as required there. A natural property which looks better, not only is not obtained here, but is shown to be false. On earlier related theorems see Gitik Shelah [GiSh310].
