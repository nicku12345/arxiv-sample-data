We call a bipartite graph {\it homogeneous} if every finite partial automorphism which respects left and right can be extended to a total automorphism.   A (\kappa,{\lambda} ) bipartite graph is a bipartite graph with left side of size \kappa and right side of size {\lambda}. We show, using a theorem of Hrushovski on finite graphs, that there is a homogeneous ({\aleph_0},2^{\aleph_0} ) bipartite graph of girth 4 (thus answering negatively a question by Kupitz and Perles), and that depending on the underlying set theory all homogeneous ({\aleph_0},\aleph_1) bipartite graphs may be isomorphic, or there may be 2^{\aleph_1} many isomorphism types of (\aleph_0,\aleph_1) homogeneous graphs.
