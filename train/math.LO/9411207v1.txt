Let j be an elementary embedding of V_{\lambda} into V_{\lambda} that is not the identity, and let \kappa be the critical point of j. Let \Cal A be the closure of \{j\} under the operation a (b) of application, and let \Omega be the closure of \{\kappa\} under the operation \min \{\xi: a(\xi) \ge b(\alpha)\}. We give a complete description of the set \Omega under an assumption (Threshold Hypothesis) on cyclic left distributive algebras.
