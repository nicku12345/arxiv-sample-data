There exists a family \{B_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha<\omega_1} of sets of countable ordinals such that   o \max B_{\alpha}=\alpha,   o if \alpha\in B_{\beta} then B_{\alpha}\subseteq B_{\beta},   o if \lambda\leq \alpha and \lambda is a limit ordinal then B_{\alpha}\cap\lambda is not in the ideal generated by the B_{\beta}, \beta<\alpha, and by the bounded subsets of \lambda,   o there is a partition \{A_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty} of \omega_1 such that for every \alpha and every n, B_{\alpha}\cap A_n is finite.
