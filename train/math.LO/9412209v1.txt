This is a continuation of "Some results on nonstationry ideal". The upper bound on precipitousness of NS_lambda^+ for a regular lambda given in this paper is proved to be exact.It is shown that saturatedness of NS_kappa^aleph_0 over inaccessible kappa requires at least o(kappa)=kappa^++.The upper bounds on the strength of NS_kappa precipitous for inaccessible kappa are reduced quite close to the lower bounds.
