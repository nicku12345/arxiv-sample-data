We consider families F of sequences converging to +infinity that F satisfies the following condition (C):   (C): if an open set U in the real line is unbounded above then there exists a sequence belonging to F, which has an infinite number of terms belonging to U.   For the functions f,g from {0,1,2,...} to {0,1,2,...} we define: f =< g if and only if {i: f(i) > g(i)} is finite.   Let b denote the smallest cardinality of a unbounded (in the sense of =<) family of functions from {0,1,2,...} to {0,1,2,...}, see [1].   Theorem 1. If F is a family of sequences converging to +infinity and card F < b, then F does not satisfy condition (C).   Corollary. Every family of sequences converging to +infinity which satisfies the condition (C) is uncountable, Martin's axiom implies that each such family has cardinality continuum (because Martin's axiom implies that b=continuum, see [1], [2]).   Theorem 2. There exists a family of sequences converging to +infinity which satisfies condition (C) and has cardinality b.   References   [ 1 ] R. Frankiewicz, P.
