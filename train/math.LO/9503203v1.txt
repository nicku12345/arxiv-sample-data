We are proving the following:   (1) If \kap is a weakly inaccessible then NS_\kap is not \kap^+-saturated.   (2) If \kap is a weakly inaccessible and \tet <\kap is regular then NS^\tet_\kap is not \kap^+-saturated.   (3) If \kap is singular then NS^{cf\kap}_{\kap^+} is not \kap^{++}-saturated.   Combining this with previous results of Shelah, one obtains the following:   (A) If \kap >\aleph_1 then NS_\kap is not \kap^+-saturated.   (B) If \tet^+<\kap then NS^\tet_\kap is not \kap^+-saturated.
