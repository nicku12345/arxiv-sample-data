We show that all finite powers of a Hausdorff space X do not contain uncountable weakly separated subspaces iff there is a c.c.c poset P such that 1_P forces that ``X is a countable union of 0-dimensional subspaces of countable weight.''   We also show that this theorem is sharp in two different senses:   (i) we can't get rid of using generic extensions,   (ii) we have to consider all finite powers of X.
