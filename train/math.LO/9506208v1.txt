We investigate classes of Boolean algebras related to the notion of forcing that adds Cohen reals. A >>Cohen algebra<< is a Boolean algebra that is dense in the completion of a free Boolean algebra. We introduce and study generalizations of Cohen algebras: semi-Cohen algebras, pseudo-Cohen algebras and potentially Cohen algebras. These classes of Boolean algebras are closed under completion.
