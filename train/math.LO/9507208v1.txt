Answering two questions of D. Fremlin [Real-valued measurable cardinals, in Set Theory of the Reals, H. Judah ed. 1993, 151-305 ] we show the following:   (1) If c is real-valued measurable then the Maharam type of (c,P(c),sigma) is 2^c.   (2) It is consistent to have k real-valued measurable but for every submodel V_1 with k measurable in it there are no k reals which are random over V_1.
