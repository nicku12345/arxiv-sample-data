For every uncountable cardinal \lambda, suitable negations of the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis imply:   - For all infinite \alpha and \beta, there is no universal K_{\alpha,\beta}-free graphs in \lambda   - For all \alpha\ge 3, there is no universal K_\alpha-free graph in \lambda   The instance K_{\omega,\omega_1} for \lambda=\aleph_1 was settled by Komjath and Pach from the principle \diamondsuit(\omega_1).
