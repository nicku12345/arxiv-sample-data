A few steps are made towards representation theory of embeddability among uncountable graphs. A monotone class of graphs is defined by forbidding countable subgraphs, related to the graph's end-structure. Using a combinatorial theorem of Shelah it is proved:   - The complexity of the class in every regular uncountable \l>\aleph_1 is at least \lambda^+ + \sup\{\mu^{\aleph_0}:\mu^+<\lambda\}   - For all regular uncountable \lambda>\aleph_1 there are 2^\lambda pairwise non embeddable graphs in the class having strong homogeneity properties.   - It is characterized when some invariants of a graph G\in \Cal G_\lambda have to be inherited by one of fewer than \lambda subgraphs whose union covers G.   All three results are obtained as corollaries of a representation theorem that asserts the existence of a surjective homomorphism from the relation of embeddability over isomorphism types of regular cardinality \lambda>\aleph_1 onto set inclusion over all subsets of reals or cardinality \lambda or less. Continuity properties of the homomorphism are used to extend the first result to all singular cardinals below the first cardinal fixed point of second order.   The first result shows that, unlike what Shelah showed in the class of all graphs, the relations of embeddability in this class is not independent of negations of the GCH.
