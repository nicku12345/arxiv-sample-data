We prove several results giving lower bounds for the large cardinal strength of a failure of the singular cardinal hypothesis. The main result is the following theorem:   Theorem: Suppose \kappa is a singular strong limit cardinal and 2^\kappa >= \lambda where \lambda is not the successor of a cardinal of cofinality at most \kappa.   (i) If \cofinality(\kappa)>\gw then o(\kappa)\ge\lambda.   (ii) If \cofinality(\kappa)=\gw then either o(\kappa)\ge\lambda or \set{\ga:K\sat o(\ga)\ge\ga^{+n}} is cofinal in \kappa for each n\in\gw.   In order to prove this theorem we give a detailed analysis of the sequences of indiscernibles which come from applying the covering lemma to nonoverlapping sequences of extenders.
