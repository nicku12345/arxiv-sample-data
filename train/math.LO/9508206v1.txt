We prove that if \bI is a p.\ o. set in a countable transitive model \gM of \ZFC then \gM can be extended by a generic sequence of reals \a_\i, \i\in\bI, such that \aleph_1^\gM is preserved and every \a_\i is Sacks generic over \gM[\ang{\a_\j:\j<\i}].   The structure of the degrees of \dd\gM constructibility of reals in the extension is investigated.   As an application, we obtain a model in which the \is12 equivalence relation x \E y iff \rL[x]=\rL[y] (x,\,y are reals) does not admit a reasonable form of the Glimm -- Effros theorem.
