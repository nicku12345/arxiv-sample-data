We regard Forcing Notions P adding real numbers and the algebras of P-measurable sets. As for Cohen- and Random-Forcing we can show that each analytic set is P-measurable using Solovay's Unfolding Trick for infinite games. To show this we develop the notion of strategic fusion and give a proof of a uniform unfolding theorem which allows us to reduce the proof of analytic measurability to the definition of a certain function.
