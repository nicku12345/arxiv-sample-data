One aim of this work is to get a universe in which weak versions of Martin axioms holds for some forcing notions of cardinality aleph_0, aleph_1 and aleph_2 while on aleph_2 club, the ``small'' brother of diamond, holds. As a consequence we get the consistency of ``there is no Gross space''. Another aim is to present a case of ``Historic iteration''.
