We continue the investigations in the author's book on cardinal arithmetic, assuming some knowledge of it. We deal with the cofinality of (S_{<= aleph_0}(kappa), subseteq) for kappa real valued measurable (Section 3), densities of box products (Section 5,3), prove the equality cov(lambda, lambda, theta^+,2)=pp(lambda) in more cases even when cf(lambda)= aleph_0 (Section 1), deal with bounds of pp(lambda) for lambda limit of inaccessible (Section 4) and give proofs to various claims I was sure I had already written but did not find (Section 6).
