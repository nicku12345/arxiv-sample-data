The existence of End Elementary Extensions of models M of ZFC is related to the ordinal height of M, according to classical results due to Keisler, Morley and Silver. In this paper, we further investigate the connection between the height of M and the existence of End Elementary Extensions of M. In particular, we prove that the theory `ZFC + GCH + there exist measurable cardinals + all inaccessible non weakly compact cardinals are possible heights of models with no End Elementary Extensions' is consistent relative to the theory `ZFC + GCH + there exist measurable cardinals + the weakly compact cardinals are cofinal in ON'. We also provide a simpler coding that destroys GCH but otherwise yields the same result.
