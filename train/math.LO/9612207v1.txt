We investigate the sequential topology \tau_s on a complete Boolean algebra B determined by algebraically convergent sequences in B. We show the role of weak distributivity of B in separation axioms for the sequential topology. The main result is that a necessary and sufficient condition for B to carry a strictly positive Maharam submeasure is that B is ccc and that the space (B,\tau_s) is Hausdorff. We also characterize sequential cardinals.
