The preservation theorems for semi-properness, hemi-properness, and pseudo-completeness hold for countable support iterations as well as revised countable support iterations, notwithstanding the fact that the "factor lemma" fails for the countable support versions.   Example: The countable support iteration of Namba forcing over a ground model of CH does not add reals.   Example: A countable support iteration built from Namba forcing and Cohen forcing, over a ground model of CH, does not collapse omega_1
