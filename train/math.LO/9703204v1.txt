If G is a centreless group, then \tau(G) denotes the height of the automorphism tower of G. We prove that it is consistent that for every cardinal \lambda and every ordinal \alpha < \lambda, there exists a centreless group G such that (a) \tau(G) = \alpha; and (b) if \beta is any ordinal such that 1 \leq \beta < \lambda, then there exists a notion of forcing P, which preserves cofinalities and cardinalities, such that \tau(G) = \beta in the corresponding generic extension V^{P}.
