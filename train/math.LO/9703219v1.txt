We prove that there is a certain degree of independence between stationary reflection phenomena at different cofinalities; e.g. it is consistent that every stationary subset of S_1^3 reflects at a point of cofinality aleph_2 while every stationary subset of S^3_0 has a non-reflecting stationary subset
