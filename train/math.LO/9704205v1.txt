Let CH be the class of compacta (i.e., compact Hausdorff spaces), with BS the subclass of Boolean spaces. For each ordinal alpha and pair (K,L) of subclasses of CH, we define Lev_{>=alpha}(K,L), the class of maps of level at least alpha from spaces in K to spaces in L, in such a way that, when alpha < omega, Lev}_{>=alpha}(BS,BS) consists of the Stone duals of Boolean lattice embeddings that preserve all prenex first-order formulas of quantifier rank alpha. Maps of level >=0 are just the continuous surjections, and the maps of level >=1 are the co-existential maps. Co-elementary maps are of level >=alpha for all ordinals alpha; of course in the Boolean context, the co-elementary maps coincide with the maps of level >=omega. The results of this paper include:   (i) every map of level >=omega is co-elementary;   (ii) the limit maps of an omega-indexed inverse system of maps of level >=alpha are also of level >=alpha; and   (iii) if K is a co-elementary class, k < omega and Lev_{>=k}(K,K) = Lev_{>=k+1}(K,K), then Lev_{>=k}(K,K}) = Lev_{>=omega}(K,K).   A space X in K is co-existentially closed in K if Lev_{>=0}(K,{X}) = Lev_{>=1}(K,{X}). We showed in an earlier paper that every infinite member of a co-inductive co-elementary class (such as CH itself, BS, or the class CON of continua) is a continuous image of a space of the same weight that is co-existentially closed in that class. We show here that every compactum that is co-existentially closed in CON (a "co-existentially closed continuum") is both indecomposable and of covering dimension one.
