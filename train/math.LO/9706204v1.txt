We prove that if \leq is an analytic partial order then either \leq can be extended to a (boldface) \Delta^1_2 linear order similar to an antichain in 2^{<\omega_1} ordered lexicographically or a certain Borel partial order \leq_0 embeds in \leq. Some corollaries for analytic equivalence relations are given, for instance, if E is a \Sigma^1_1[z] equivalence relation such that E_0 does not embed in E then E is determined by intersections with E-invariand Borel sets coded in L[z].
