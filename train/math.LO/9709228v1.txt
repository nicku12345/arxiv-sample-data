We present two different types of models where, for certain singular cardinals lambda of uncountable cofinality, lambda -> (lambda, omega+1)^2, although lambda is not a strong limit cardinal. We announce, here, and will present in a subsequent paper, that, for example, consistently, aleph_{omega_1} not-> (aleph_{omega_1}, omega+1)^2 and consistently, 2^{aleph_0} not-> (2^{aleph_0},omega +1)^2 .
