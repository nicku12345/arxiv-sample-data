Theorem: Let n\ge 2. There is a CCC in L forcing notion P=P_n\in L such that P-generic extensions of L are of the form L[a], where a\subseteq\omega and   1) a is \Delta^1_{n+1} in L[a]; and   2) if b\in L[a], b\subseteq\omega is \Sigma^1_n in L[a] then b\in L and b is \Sigma^1_n in L.   In addition, if a model M extends L and contains two different P-generic sets a,\,a'\subseteq\omega, then \omega^M_1 > \omega^L_1.   Comment: For n=2, this is a result of Jensen and Johnsbr{\aa}ten, 1974. In this case, 2) is a corollary of the Shoenfield absoluteness theorem.
