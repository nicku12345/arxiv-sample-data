We investigate categoricity of abstract elementary classes without any remnants of compactness (like non-definability of well ordering, existence of E.M. models or existence of large cardinals). We prove (assuming a weak version of GCH around lambda) that if K is categorical in lambda, lambda^+, LS(K) <= lambda and 1 <= I(lambda^{++},K)< 2^{lambda^{++}} then K has a model in lambda^{+++} .
