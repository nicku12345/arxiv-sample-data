We deal with (< kappa)-supported iterated forcing notions which are (E_0,E_1)-complete, have in mind problems on Whitehead groups, uniformizations and the general problem. We deal mainly with the successor of a singular case. This continues [Sh:587]. We also deal with complimentary combinatorial results.
