We prove that on many inaccessible there is a Jonsson algebra, so e.g. the first regular Jonsson cardinal lambda which is lambda x omega-Mahlo. We give further restrictions on successor of singulars which are Jonsson cardinals. E.g. there is a Jonsson algebra on the successor of beth_omega. Lastly, we give further information on guessing of clubs.
