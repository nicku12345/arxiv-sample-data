In this paper we introduce some families of fuzzy L-systems and investigate their properties. We further discuss the relationship between fuzzy L languages and the fuzzy languages generated by fuzzy grammar proposed in Ref.[3,5]. A measure of fuzziness for a string, called the fuzzy entropy of a string with respect to a given fuzzy L system, will be defined. The relationship between fuzzy L languages and the ordinary L languages is also discussed.
