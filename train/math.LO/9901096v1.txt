We show: There are pairs of universes V_1 subseteq V_2 and there is a notion of forcing P in V_1 such that the change mentioned in the title occurs when going from V_1[G] to V_2[G] for a P-generic filter G over V_2. We use forcing iterations with partial memories. Moreover, we implement highly transitive automorphism groups into the forcing orders.
