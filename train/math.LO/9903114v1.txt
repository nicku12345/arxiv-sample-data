We show that in the aleph_2-stage countable support iteration of Mathias forcing over a model of CH the complete Boolean algebra generated by absolutely divergent series under eventual dominance is not isomorphic to the completion of P(omega)/fin. This complements Vojtas' result, that under cf(c)=p the two algebras are isomorphic
