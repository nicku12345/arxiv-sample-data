We prove that if ZF is consistent then ZFC+GCH is consistent with the following statement: There is for every k<omega a model of cardinality aleph_1 which is L_{infty,omega_1}-equivalent to exactly k non-isomorphic models of cardinality aleph_1. In order to get this result we introduce ladder systems and colourings different from the ``standard'' counterparts, and prove the following purely combinatorial result: For each prime number p and positive integer m it is consistent with ZFC+GCH that there is a ``good'' ladder system having exactly p^m pairwise nonequivalent colourings.
