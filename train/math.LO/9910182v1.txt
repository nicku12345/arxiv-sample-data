We introduce the concept of indexed identity, where the usual notion of identity is a particular case. Our mathematical framework allows us a generalized method for `indexing' predicates, which corresponds to `fuzzification' of properties, in an intuitive sense. It can be established a relationship between this indexed mathematics and fuzzy mathematics. We show some few examples that illustrate our ideas.
