How much of the combinatorial structure of a pointed polyhedron is contained in its vertex-facet incidences? Not too much, in general, as we demonstrate by examples. However, one can tell from the incidence data whether the polyhedron is bounded. In the case of a polyhedron that is simple and "simplicial," i.e., a d-dimensional polyhedron that has d facets through each vertex and d vertices on each facet, we derive from the structure of the vertex-facet incidence matrix that the polyhedron is necessarily bounded. In particular, this yields a characterization of those polyhedra that have circulants as vertex-facet incidence matrices.
