Let n\ge1 and B\ge2. A real-valued function f defined on the n-simplex \Delta_n is approximately convex with respect to \Delta_{B-1} iff f(\sum_{i=1}^B t_ix_i) \le \sum_{i=1}^B t_if(x_i) +1 for all x_1,...,x_B \in \Delta_n and all (t_1,...,t_B)\in \Delta_{B-1}. We determine explicitly the extremal (i.e. pointwise largest) function of this type which vanishes on the vertices of \Delta_n. We also prove a stability theorem of Hyers-Ulam type which yields as a special case the best constants in the Hyers-Ulam stability theorem for \epsilon-convex functions.
