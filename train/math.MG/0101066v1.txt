The Descartes circle theorem states that if four circles are mutually tangent with disjoint intersion, then their curvatures (or "bends) b_j = 1/r_j satisfy the relation (b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4)^2 = 2(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + b_3^2 + b_4^2). We show that similar relations hold involving the centers of the circles in such a configuration, coordinatized as complex numbers, yielding a complex Descartes theorem. These relations have matrix generalizations to the n-dimensional case, in each of Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic geometries, and they include a Descartes circle theorem for spherical and hyperbolic space.
