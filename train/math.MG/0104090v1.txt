A {\it cluster of cycles} (or {\it (r,q)-polycycle}) is a simple planar 2--co nnected finite or countable graph G of girth r and maximal vertex-degree q, which admits {\it (r,q)-polycyclic realization} on the plane, denote it by P(G), i.e. such that: (i) all interior vertices are of degree q, (ii) all interior faces (denote their number by p_r) are combinatorial r-gons and (implied by (i), (ii)) (iii) all vertices, edges and interior faces form a cell-complex.   An example of (r,q)-polycycle is the skeleton of (r^q), i.e. of the q-valent partition of the sphere S^2, Euclidean plane R^2 or hyperbolic plane H^2 by regular r-gons. Call {\it spheric} pairs (r,q)=(3,3),(3,4),(4,3),(3,5),(5,3); for those five pairs P(r^q) is (r^q) without the exterior face; otherwise P(r^q)=(r^q).   We give here a compact survey of results on (r,q)-polycycles.
