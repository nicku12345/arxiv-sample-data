A building is a simplicial complex with a covering by Coxeter complexes (called apartments) satisfying certain combinatorial conditions. A building whose apartments are spherical (respectively Euclidean) Coxeter complexes has a natural piecewise spherical (respectively Euclidean) metric with nice geometric properties. We show that spherical and Euclidean buildings are completely characterized by some simple, geometric properties.
