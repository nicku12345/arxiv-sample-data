The hypermetric cone HYP_n is the set of vectors (d_{ij})_{1\leq i< j\leq n} satisfying the inequalities \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} b_ib_jd_{ij}\leq 0 with b_i\in\Z and \sum_{i=1}^{n}b_i=1. A Delaunay polytope of a lattice is called extremal if the only affine bijective transformations of it into a Delaunay polytope, are the homotheties; there is a correspondance between such Delaunay polytopes and extreme rays of HYP_n. We show that unique Delaunay polytopes of root lattice A_1 and E_6 are the only extreme Delaunay polytopes of dimension at most 6. We describe also the skeletons and adjacency properties of HYP_7 and of its dual.
