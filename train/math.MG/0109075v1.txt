We prove that iterated spaces of directions of a limit of a noncollapsing sequence of manifolds with lower curvature bound are topologically spheres. As an application we show that for any finite dimensional Alexandrov space   X^n with n\ge 5 there exists an Alexandrov space Y homeomorphic to X which can not be obtained as such a limit.
