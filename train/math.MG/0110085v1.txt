A paradoxist Smarandache geometry combines Euclidean, hyperbolic, and elliptic geometry into one space along with other non-Euclidean behaviors of lines that would seem to require a discrete space. A class of continuous spaces is presented here together with specific exmples that exhibit almost all of these phenomena and suggest the prospect of a continuous paradoxist geometry.
