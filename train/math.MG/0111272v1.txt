The L^p-cosine transform of an even, continuous function f\in C_e(\Sn) is defined by: H(x)=\int_{\Sn}|\ip{x}{\xi}|^pf(\xi) d\xi,\quad x\in {\R}^n. It is shown that if p is not an even integer then all partial derivatives of even order of H(x) up to order p+1 (including p+1 if p is an odd integer) exist and are continuous everywhere in {\R}^n\backslash\{0\}. As a result of the corresponding differentiation formula, we show that if f is a positive bounded function and p>1 then H^{1/p} is a support function of a convex body whose boundary has everywhere positive Gauss-Kronekcer curvature.
