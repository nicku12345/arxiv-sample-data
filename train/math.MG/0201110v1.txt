Every polyhedral cone can be described either by its facets or by its extreme rays. Computation of one description from the other is a problem that can be very complex, i.e. one encounter the combinatorial explosion. We present here several methods which allow us to use symmetries for the computation of extreme rays and facets of cones. I give an algorithm for computing adjacencies using a linear programming approach. I give a complete description of the method of incidence, adjacency decomposition method and of the subcone method used for computing with symmetric cones.
