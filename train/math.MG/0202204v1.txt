This is a survey on algorithmic questions about combinatorial and geometric properties of convex polytopes. We give a list of 35 problems; for each the current state of knowledege on its theoretical complexity status is reported. The problems are grouped into the sections ``Coordinate Descriptions'', ``Combinatorial Structure'', ``Isomorphism'', ``Optimization'', ``Realizability'', and ``Beyond Polytopes''.
