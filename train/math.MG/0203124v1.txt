Voronoi conjectured that any parallelotope is affinely equivalent to a Voronoi polytope. A parallelotope is defined by a set of m facet vectors p_i and defines a set of m lattice vectors t_i, 1\le i\le m. We show that Voronoi's conjecture is true for an n-dimensional parallelotope P if and only if there exist scalars \gamma_i and a positive definite n\times n matrix Q such that \gamma_i p_i=Qt_i for all i. In this case the quadratic form f(x)=x^TQx is the metric form of P.   As an example, we consider in detail the case of a zonotopal parallelotope. We show that Q=(Z_{\beta}Z^T_{\beta})^{-1} for a zonotopal parallelotope P(Z) which is the Minkowski sum of column vectors z_j of the n\times r matrix Z. Columns of the matrix Z_{\beta} are the vectors \sqrt{2\beta_j}z_j, where the scalars \beta_j, 1\le j\le r, are such that the system of vectors \{\beta_jz_j:1\le j\le r\} is unimodular. P(Z) defines a dicing lattice which is the set of intersection points of the dicing family of hyperplanes H(j,k)=\{x:x^T(\beta_jQz_j)=k\}, where k takes all integer values and 1\le j\le r.
