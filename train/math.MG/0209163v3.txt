Let G be a word hyperbolic group in the sense of Gromov and P its associated Rips complex. We prove that the fixed point set P^H is contractible for every finite subgroups H of G. This is the main ingredient for proving that P is a finite model for the universal space e.g. of proper actions. As a corollary we get that a hyperbolic group has only finitely many conjugacy classes of finite subgroups.
