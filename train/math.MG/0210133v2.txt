It is shown how the Beneath-and-Beyond algorithm can be used to yield another proof of the equivalence of V- and H-representations of convex polytopes. In this sense this paper serves as the sketch of an introduction to polytope theory with a focus on algorithmic aspects. Moreover, computational results are presented to compare Beneath-and-Beyond to other convex hull implementations.
