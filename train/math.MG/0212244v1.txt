Let P be a simplex in S^n and G_P be a group generated by the reflections with respect to the facets of P. We are interested in the case when the group G_P is discrete. In this case we say that G generates the discrete reflection group G_P. We develop the criteria for a simplex generating a discrete reflection group. We also describe all indecomposable spherical simplices generating discrete reflection groups.
