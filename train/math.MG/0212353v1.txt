Given a lattice L, a full dimensional polytope P is called a {\em Delaunay polytope} if the set of its vertices is S\cap L with S being an {\em empty sphere} of the lattice. Extending our previous work \cite{DD-hyp} on the {\em hypermetric cone} HYP_7, we classify the six-dimensional Delaunay polytopes according to their {\em combinatorial type}. The list of 6241 combinatorial types is obtained by a study of the set of faces of the polyhedral cone HYP_7.
