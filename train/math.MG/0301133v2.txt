In this paper, we classify all the hyperbolic non-compact Coxeter polytopes of finite volume combinatorial type of which is either a pyramid over a product of two simplices or a product of two simplices of dimension greater than one. Combined with results of Kaplinskaja (1974) and Esselmann (1996) this completes the classification of hyperbolic Coxeter n-polytopes of finite volume with n+2 facets.
