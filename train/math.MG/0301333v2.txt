Let P be a (non necessarily convex) embedded polyhedron in \R^3, with its vertices on an ellipsoid. Suppose that the interior of P can be decomposed into convex polytopes without adding any vertex. Then P is infinitesimally rigid. More generally, let P be a polyhedron bounding a domain which is the union of polytopes C_1, ..., C_n with disjoint interiors, whose vertices are the vertices of P. Suppose that there exists an ellipsoid which contains no vertex of P but intersects all the edges of the C_i. Then P is infinitesimally rigid. The proof is based on some geometric properties of hyperideal hyperbolic polyhedra.
