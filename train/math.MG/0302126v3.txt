For any finite set \A of n points in \R^2, we define a (3n-3)-dimensional simple polyhedron whose face poset is isomorphic to the poset of ``non-crossing marked graphs'' with vertex set \A, where a marked graph is defined as a geometric graph together with a subset of its vertices. The poset of non-crossing graphs on \A appears as the complement of the star of a face in that polyhedron.   The polyhedron has a unique maximal bounded face, of dimension 2n_i +n -3 where n_i is the number of points of \A in the interior of \conv(\A). The vertices of this polytope are all the pseudo-triangulations of \A, and the edges are flips of two types: the traditional diagonal flips (in pseudo-triangulations) and the removal or insertion of a single edge.   As a by-product of our construction we prove that all pseudo-triangulations are infinitesimally rigid graphs.
