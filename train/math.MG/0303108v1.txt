Given two measured laminations mu and nu in a hyperbolic surface which fill up the surface, Kerckhoff [Lines of Minima in Teichmueller space, Duke Math J. 65 (1992) 187-213] defines an associated line of minima along which convex combinations of the length functions of mu and nu are minimised. This is a line in Teichmueller space which can be thought as analogous to the geodesic in hyperbolic space determined by two points at infinity. We show that when mu is uniquely ergodic, this line converges to the projective lamination [mu], but that when mu is rational, the line converges not to [mu], but rather to the barycentre of the support of mu. Similar results on the behaviour of Teichmueller geodesics have been proved by Masur [Two boundaries of Teichmueller space, Duke Math. J. 49 (1982) 183-190].
