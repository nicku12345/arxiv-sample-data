Suppose that K \subseteq \RR^d is a 0-symmetric convex body which defines the usual norm  \Norm{x}_K = \sup\Set{t\ge 0: x \notin tK}  on \RR^d. Let also A\subseteq\RR^d be a measurable set of positive upper density \rho. We show that if the body K is not a polytope, or if it is a polytope with many faces (depending on \rho), then the distance set  D_K(A) = \Set{\Norm{x-y}_K: x,y\in A}  contains all points t\ge t_0 for some positive number t_0. This was proved by Katznelson and Weiss, by Falconer and Marstrand and by Bourgain in the case where K is the Euclidean ball in any dimension. As corollaries we obtain (a) an extension to any dimension of a theorem of Iosevich and \L aba regarding distance sets with respect to convex bodies of well-distributed sets in the plane, and also (b) a new proof of a theorem of Iosevich, Katz and Tao about the nonexistence of Fourier spectra for smooth convex bodies.
