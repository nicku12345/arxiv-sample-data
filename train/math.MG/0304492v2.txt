We describe and analyze a new construction that produces new Eulerian lattices from old ones. It specializes to a construction that produces new strongly regular cellular spheres (whose face lattices are Eulerian). The construction does not always specialize to convex polytopes; however, in a number of cases where we can realize it, it produces interesting classes of polytopes. Thus we produce an infinite family of rational 2-simplicial 2-simple 4-polytopes, as requested by Eppstein, Kuperberg and Ziegler. We also construct for each d\ge3 an infinite family of (d-2)-simplicial 2-simple d-polytopes, thus solving a problem of Gr\"unbaum.
