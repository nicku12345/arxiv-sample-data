Let G be a discrete group generated by reflections in hyperbolic or Euclidean space, and H\subset G be a finite index subgroup generated by reflections. Suppose that the fundamental chamber of G is a finite volume polytope with k facets. In this paper, we prove that the fundamental chamber of H has at least k facets.
