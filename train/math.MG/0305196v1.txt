A Delaunay polytope P is said to be {\em extreme} if the only (up to isometries) affine bijective transformations f of \R^n, for which f(P) is again a Delaunay polytope, are the homotheties. This notion was introduced in \cite{DGL92}; also some examples in dimension 1, 6, 7, 15, 16, 22, 23 were constructed and it was proved that in dimension less than 6 there are no extreme Delaunay polytopes, except the segment. In this note, for every n\geq 6 we build an extreme Delaunay polytope ED_n of dimension n.
