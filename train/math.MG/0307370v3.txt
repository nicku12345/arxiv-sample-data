We prove that a planar graph is generically rigid in the plane if and only if it can be embedded as a pseudo-triangulation. This generalizes the main result of math.CO/0307347 which treats the minimally generically rigid case.   The proof uses the concept of combinatorial pseudo-triangulation, CPT, in the plane and has two main steps: showing that a certain ``generalized Laman property'' is a necessary and sufficient condition for a CPT to be ``stretchable'', and showing that all generically rigid plane graphs admit a CPT assignment with that property.   Additionally, we propose the study of combinatorial pseudo-triangulations on closed surfaces.
