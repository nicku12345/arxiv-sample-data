We characterize the perimeter-minimizing double bubbles on all flat two-tori and, as corollaries, on the flat infinite cylinder and the flat infinite strip with free boundary. Specifically, we show that there are five distinct types of minimizers on flat two-tori, depending on the areas to be enclosed.
