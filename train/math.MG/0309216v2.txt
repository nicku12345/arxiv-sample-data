A generalized hyperbolic tetrahedra is a polyhedron (possibly non-compact) with finite volume in hyperbolic space, obtained from a tetrahedron by the polar truncation at the vertices lying outside the space. In this paper it is proved that a volume formula for ordinary hyperbolic tetrahedra devised by J. Murakami and M. Yano can be applied to such ones. There are two key tools for the proof; one is so-called Schlafli's differential formula for hyperbolic polyhedra, and the other is a necessary and sufficient condition for given numbers to be the dihedral angles of a generalized hyperbolic simplex with respect to their dihedral angles.
