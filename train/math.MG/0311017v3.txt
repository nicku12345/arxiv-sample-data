We provide a characterization of the radii minimal projections of polytopes onto j-dimensional subspaces in Euclidean space \E^n. Applied on simplices this characterization allows to reduce the computation of an outer radius to a computation in the circumscribing case or to the computation of an outer radius of a lower-dimensional simplex. In the second part of the paper, we use this characterization to determine the sequence of outer (n-1)-radii of regular simplices (which are the radii of smallest enclosing cylinders). This settles a question which arose from the incidence that a paper by Wei{\ss}bach (1983) on this determination was erroneous. In the proof, we first reduce the problem to a constrained optimization problem of symmetric polynomials and then to an optimization problem in a fixed number of variables with additional integer constraints.
