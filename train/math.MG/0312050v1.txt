We defined several functionals on the set of all triangulations of the finite system of points in d-space achieving global minimum on the Delaunay triangulation (DT). We consider a so called "parabolic" functional and prove it attains its minimum on DT in all dimensions. As the second example we treat "mean radius" functional (mean of circumcircle radii of triangles) for planar triangulations. As the third example we treat a so called "harmonic" functional. For a triangle this functional equals the sum of squares of sides over area. Finally, we consider a discrete analog of the Dirichlet functional. DT is optimal for these functionals only in dimension two.
