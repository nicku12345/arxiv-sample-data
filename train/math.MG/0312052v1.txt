A set S of n points in general position in R^d defines the unique Voronoi diagram of S. Its dual tessellation is the Delaunay triangulation (DT) of S. In this paper we consider the parabolic functional on the set of triangulations of S and prove that it attains its minimum at DT in all dimensions. The Delaunay triangulation of S is corresponding to a vertex of the secondary polytope of S. We proposed an algorithm for DT's construction, where the parabolic functional and the secondary polytope are used. Finally, we considered a discrete analog of the Dirichlet functional. DT is optimal for this functional only in two dimensions.
