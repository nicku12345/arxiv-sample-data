A new method of constructing translation invariant continuous valuations on convex subsets of the quaternionic space \HH^n is presented. In particular new examples of Sp(n)Sp(1)-invariant translation invariant continuous valuations are constructed. This method is based on the theory of plurisubharmonic functions of quaternionic variables.
