We consider {\em monotone} embeddings of a finite metric space into low dimensional normed space. That is, embeddings that respect the order among the distances in the original space. Our main interest is in embeddings into Euclidean spaces. We observe that any metric on n points can be embedded into l_2^n, while, (in a sense to be made precise later), for almost every n-point metric space, every monotone map must be into a space of dimension \Omega(n).   It becomes natural, then, to seek explicit constructions of metric spaces that cannot be monotonically embedded into spaces of sublinear dimension. To this end, we employ known results on {\em sphericity} of graphs, which suggest one example of such a metric space - that defined by a complete bipartitegraph. We prove that an \delta n-regular graph of order n, with bounded diameter has sphericity \Omega(n/(\lambda_2+1)), where \lambda_2 is the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph, and 0 < \delta \leq \half is constant. We also show that while random graphs have linear sphericity, there are {\em quasi-random} graphs of logarithmic sphericity.   For the above bound to be linear, \lambda_2 must be constant. We show that if the second eigenvalue of an n/2-regular graph is bounded by a constant, then the graph is close to being complete bipartite. Namely, its adjacency matrix differs from that of a complete bipartite graph in only o(n^2) entries. Furthermore, for any 0 < \delta < \half, and \lambda_2, there are only finitely many \delta n-regular graphs with second eigenvalue at most \lambda_2.
