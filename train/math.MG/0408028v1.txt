For a convex body K\subset\R^n and i\in\{1,...,n-1\}, the function assigning to any i-dimensional subspace L of \R^n, the i-dimensional volume of the orthogonal projection of K to L, is called the i-th projection function of K. Let K, K_0\subset \R^n be smooth convex bodies of class C^2_+, and let K_0 be centrally symmetric. Excluding two exceptional cases, that of (i,j)=(1,n-1) and (i,j)=(n-2,n-1), we prove that K and K_0 are homothetic if they have two proportional projection functions. The special case when K_0 is a Euclidean ball provides an extension of Nakajima's classical three-dimensional characterization of spheres to higher dimensions.
