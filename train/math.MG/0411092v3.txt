We construct a new 2-parameter family E_mn of self-dual 2-simple and 2-simplicial 4-polytopes, with flexible geometric realisations. E_44 is the 24-cell. For large m,n the f-vectors have ``fatness'' close to 6.   The E_t-construction of Paffenholz and Ziegler applied to products of polygons yields cellular spheres with the combinatorial structure of E_mn. Here we prove polytopality of these spheres. More generally, we construct polytopal realisations for spheres obtained from the E_t-construction applied to products of polytopes in any dimension d>=3, if these polytopes satisfy some consistency conditions.   We show that the projective realisation space of E_33 is at least nine dimensional and that of E_44 at least four dimensional. This proves that the 24-cell is not projectively unique. All E_mn for relatively prime m,n>= 5 have automorphisms of their face lattice not induced by an affine transformation of any geometric realisation. The group Z_m x Z_n generated by rotations in the two polygons is a subgroup of the automorphisms of the face lattice of E_mn. However, there are only five pairs (m,n) for which this subgroup is geometrically realisable.
