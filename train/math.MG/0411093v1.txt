We investigate the geometric properties of simplices in Euclidean d-dimensional space for which two or more of the analogues of the classical triangle centers (including the centroid, circumcenter, incenter, orthocenter or Monge point, and the Fermat-Torricelli point) coincide. We also investigate the geometric significance of the cevian line segments through a given center having the same length. We give a unified presentation, including known results for d=2 and d=3.
