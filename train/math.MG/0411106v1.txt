This note shows that an interesting property arises when considering the relation between the hypersphere volumes at dimensions n+1 and n, if the hyperspheres circumscribe unitary hypercubes in n+1 and n dimensions, respectively . In the limit of large n, the ratio \frac{V_{n+1}}{V_{n}} is constant and equal to the irrational number \sqrt{\frac{\pi e}{2}}. Some consequences of this result are explored.
