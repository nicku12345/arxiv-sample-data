Suppose that we have the unit Euclidean ball in \R^n and construct new bodies using three operations - linear transformations, closure in the radial metric and multiplicative summation defined by \|x\|_{K+_0L} = \sqrt{\|x\|_K\|x\|_L}. We prove that in dimension 3 this procedure gives all origin symmetric convex bodies, while this is no longer true in dimensions 4 and higher. We introduce the concept of embedding of a normed space in L_0 that naturally extends the corresponding properties of L_p-spaces with p\ne0, and show that the procedure described above gives exactly the unit balls of subspaces of L_0 in every dimension. We provide Fourier analytic and geometric characterizations of spaces embedding in L_0, and prove several facts confirming the place of L_0 in the scale of L_p-spaces.
