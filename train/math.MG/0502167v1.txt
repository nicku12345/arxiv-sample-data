This note is a comment to the paper by D.R.Heath-Brown and B.Z.Moroz (Math Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 125 (1999)). That paper concerns with the projective surface S in \mathbb{P}^{3} defined by the equation x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}=x_{4}^{3}. It is shown there that the evaluation of the leading term of the asymptotic formula for the number of rational points of bounded height in S(\Q) is equivalent to the evaluation of the volume of some 6-dimensional polytope \P. The volume of \P is known from several papers; we calculate this volume by elementary method using symmetry of the polytope \P. We also discuss a combinatorial structure of \P.
