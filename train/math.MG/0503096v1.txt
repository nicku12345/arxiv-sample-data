In this paper, we first introduce a new concept of {\it dual quermassintegral sum function} of two star bodies and establish Minkowski's type inequality for dual quermassintegral sum of mixed intersection bodies, which is a general form of the Minkowski inequality for mixed intersection bodies. Then, we give the Aleksandrov--Fenchel inequality and the Brunn--Minkowski inequality for mixed intersection bodies and some related results. Our results present, for intersection bodies, all dual inequalities for Lutwak's mixed prosection bodies inequalities.
