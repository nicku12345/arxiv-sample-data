A simple closed curve in the Euclidean plane is said to have property C_n(R) if at each point we can inscribe a unique regular n-gon with edges length R. C_2(R) is equivalent to having constant diameter. We show that smooth curves satisfying C_n(R) other than the circle do exist for all n, and that the circle is the only C^2 regular curve satisfying C_2(R) and C_4(R') where R'=R/\sqrt{2}. In an addendum, we show that the last assertion holds for any R and R'. The proofs use only elementary differential calculus and geometry.
