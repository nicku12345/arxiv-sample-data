We present a polynomial time algorithm to compute any fixed number of the highest coefficients of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of a rational simplex. Previously such algorithms were known for integer simplices and for rational polytopes of a fixed dimension. The algorithm is based on the formula relating the kth coefficient of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of a rational polytope to volumes of sections of the polytope by affine lattice subspaces parallel to k-dimensional faces of the polytope. We discuss possible extensions and open questions.
