We introduce a natural definition of L^p-convergence of maps, p \ge 1, in the case where the domain is a convergent sequence of measured metric space with respect to the measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology and the target is a Gromov-Hausdorff convergent sequence. With the L^p-convergence, we establish a theory of variational convergences. We prove that the Poincar\'e inequality with some additional condition implies the asymptotic compactness. The asymptotic compactness is equivalent to the Gromov-Hausdorff compactness of the energy-sublevel sets. Supposing that the targets are \CAT(0)-spaces, we study convergence of resolvents. As applications, we investigate the approximating energy functional over a measured metric space and convergence of energy functionals with a lower bound of Ricci curvature.
