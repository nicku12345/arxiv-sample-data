We give a general lower bound for the normal Gromov norm of genuine laminations in terms of the topology of the complementary regions.   In the special case of 3-manifolds, this yields a generalization of Agol's inequality from incompressible surfaces to tight laminations. In particular, the inequality excludes the existence of tight laminations with nonempty guts on 3-manifolds of small simplicial volume.
