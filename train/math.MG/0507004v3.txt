We prove the convex combination theorem for hyperbolic n-manifolds. Applications are given both in high dimensions and in 3 dimensions. One consequence is that given two geometrically finite subgroups of a discrete group of isometries of hyperbolic n-space, satisfying a natural condition on their parabolic subgroups, there are finite index subgroups which generate a subgroup that is an amalgamated free product. Constructions of infinite volume hyperbolic n-manifolds are described by gluing lower dimensional manifolds. It is shown that every slope on a cusp of a hyperbolic 3-manifold is a multiple immersed boundary slope. If a 3-manifold contains a maximal surface group not carried by an embedded surface then it contains the fundamental group of a book of I-bundles with more than two pages.
