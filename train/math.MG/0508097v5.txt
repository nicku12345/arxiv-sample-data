For a Banach space V we define its Lipschitz extension constant, \cL\cE(V), to be the infimum of the constants c such that for every metric space (Z,\rho), every X \subset Z, and every f: X \to V, there is an extension, g, of f to Z such that L(g) \le cL(f), where L denotes the Lipschitz constant. The basic theorem is that when V is finite-dimensional we have \cL\cE(V) = \cP\cC(V) where \cP\cC(V) is the well-known projection constant of V. We obtain some direct consequences of this theorem, especially when V = M_n(\bC). We then apply techniques for calculating projection constants, involving averaging projections, to calculate \cL\cE((M_n(\bC))^{sa}). We also discuss what happens if we also require that \|g\|_{\infty} = \|f\|_{\infty}.
