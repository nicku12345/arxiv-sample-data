In this paper we prove some approximation results for biLipschitz maps in the Heisenberg group. Namely, we show that a biLipschitz map with biLipschitz constant close to one can be pointwise approximated, quantitatively on any fixed ball, by an isometry. This leds to an approximation in BMO norm for the map's Pansu derivative. We also prove that a global quasigeodesic can be approximated by a geodesic in any fixed segment.
