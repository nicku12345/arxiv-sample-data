A flat complete causal Lorentzian manifold is called {\it strictly causal} if the past and the future of each its point are closed near this point. We consider strictly causal manifolds with unipotent holonomy groups and assign to a manifold of this type four nonnegative integers (a signature) and a parabola in the cone of positive definite matrices. Two manifolds are equivalent if and only if their signatures coincides and the corresponding parabolas are equal (up to a suitable automorphism of the cone and an affine change of variable). Also, we give necessary and sufficient conditions, which distinguish parabolas of this type among all parabolas in the cone.
