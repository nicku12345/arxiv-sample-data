This article is the third part of the series of articles where the theory of valuations on manifolds is constructed. In math.MG/0503399 the notion of a smooth valuation on a manifold was introduced. The goal of this article is to put a canonical multiplicative structure on the space of smooth valuations on general manifolds, thus extending some of the affine constructions from math.MG/0301148, math.MG/0503397.
