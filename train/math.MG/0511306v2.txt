Planar coincidence site lattices and modules with N-fold symmetry are well understood in a formulation based on cyclotomic fields, in particular for the class number one case, where they appear as certain principal ideals in the corresponding ring of integers. We extend this approach to multiple coincidences, which apply to triple or multiple junctions. In particular, we give explicit results for spectral, combinatorial and asymptotic properties in terms of Dirichlet series generating functions.
