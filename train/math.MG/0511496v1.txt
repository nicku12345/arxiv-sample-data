For given finite system of convex polygons in the plane which have no transversal, find such homothety transformations of polygons (having fixed centres inside given polygons) with minimal similarity ratio c>1 that the transformed system has a transversal. We prove that in this minimal configuration, we can always find three polygons (two of them lying in distinct halfplanes determined by the transversal), for which the transversal is also the tangent line.
