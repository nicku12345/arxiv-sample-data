We prove that for the uniquely ergodic {\bf R}^d action associated with a primitive substitution tiling of finite local complexity, every measurable eigenfunction coincides with a continuous function almost everywhere. Thus, topological weak-mixing is equivalent to measure-theoretic weak-mixing for such actions. If the expansion map for the substitution is a pure dilation by \theta>1 and the substitution has a fixed point, then failure of weak-mixing is equivalent to \theta being a Pisot number.
