We introduce two axioms in Laguerre geometry and prove that they provide a characterization of miquelian planes over fields of the characteristic different from 2. They allow to describe an involutory automorphism that sheds some new light on a Laguerre inversion as well as on a symmetry with respect to a pair of generators.
