For a convex body K\subset\R^n, the kth projection function of K assigns to any k-dimensional linear subspace of \R^n the k-volume of the orthogonal projection of K to that subspace. Let K and K_0 be convex bodies in \R^n, and let K_0 be centrally symmetric and satisfy a weak regularity and curvature condition (which includes all K_0 with \f K_0 of class C^2 with positive radii of curvature). Assume that K and K_0 have proportional 1st projection functions (i.e., width functions) and proportional kth projection functions. For 2\le k<(n+1)/2 and for k=3, n=5 we show that K and K_0 are homothetic. In the special case where K_0 is a Euclidean ball, we thus obtain characterizations of Euclidean balls as convex bodies of constant width and constant k-brightness.
