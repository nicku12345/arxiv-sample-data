The author defines and analyzes the 1/k length spectra, L_{1/k}(M), whose union, over all k\in \NN is the classical length spectrum. These new length spectra are shown to converge in the sense that \lim_{i\to\infty} L_{1/k}(M_i) \subset \{0\}\cup L_{1/k}(M) as M_i\to M in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Energy methods are introduced to estimate the shortest element of L_{1/k}, as well as a concept called the minimizing index which may be used to estimate the length of the shortest closed geodesic of a simply connected manifold in any dimension. A number of gap theorems are proven, including one for manifolds, M^n, with Ricci\ge (n-1) and volume close to Vol(S^n). Many results in this paper hold on compact length spaces in addition to Riemannian manifolds.
