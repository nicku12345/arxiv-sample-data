The aim of these lecture notes is, after having quickly described various compactifications of the Teichm\"{u}ller space of a compact connected oriented surface minus finitely many points, to give a construction, by the equivariant Gromov topology introduced by the author, of Thurston's compactification of this Teichm\"{u}ller space.
