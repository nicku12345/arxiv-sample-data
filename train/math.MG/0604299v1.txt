We give an alternative proof of a recent result of Klartag on the existence of almost subgaussian linear functionals on convex bodies. If K is a convex body in {\mathbb R}^n with volume one and center of mass at the origin, there exists x\neq 0 such that |\{y\in K: |< y,x> |\gr t\|<\cdot, x>\|_1\}|\ls\exp (-ct^2/\log^2(t+1)) for all t\gr 1, where c>0 is an absolute constant. The proof is based on the study of the L_q--centroid bodies of K. Analogous results hold true for general log-concave measures.
