We prove that the Hilbert geometry of a convex domain in {\mathbb R}^n has bounded local geometry, i.e., for a given radius, all balls are bilipschitz to a euclidean domain of {\mathbb R}^n. As a consequence, if the Hilbert geometry is also Gromov hyperbolic, then the bottom of its spectrum is strictly positive. We also give a counter exemple in dimension three which shows that the reciprocal is not true for non plane Hilbert geometries.
