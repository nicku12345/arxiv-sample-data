We consider convex sets whose modulus of convexity is uniformly quadratic. First, we observe several interesting relations between different positions of such ``2-convex'' bodies; in particular, the isotropic position is a finite volume-ratio position for these bodies. Second, we prove that high dimensional 2-convex bodies posses one-dimensional marginals that are approximately Gaussian. Third, we improve for 1<p<=2 some bounds on the isotropic constant of quotients of subspaces of L_p and S_p^m, the Schatten Class space.
