We consider the symmetries of coincidence site lattices of 3-dimensional cubic lattices. This includes the discussion of the symmetry groups and the Bravais classes of the CSLs. We derive various criteria and necessary conditions for symmetry operations of CSLs. They are used to obtain a complete list of the symmetry groups and the Bravais classes of those CSLs that are generated by a rotation through the angle \pi.
