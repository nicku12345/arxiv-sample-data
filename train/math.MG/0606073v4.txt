We prove Gaussian approximation theorems for specific k-dimensional marginals of convex bodies which possess certain symmetries. In particular, we treat bodies which possess a 1-unconditional basis, as well as simplices. Our results extend recent results for 1-dimensional marginals due to E. Meckes and the author.
