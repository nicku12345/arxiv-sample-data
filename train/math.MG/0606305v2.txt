We prove that the reciprocal of the volume of the polar bodies, about the Santal\'o point, of a {\em shadow system} of convex bodies K_t, is a convex function of t. Thus extending to the non-symmetric case a result of Campi and Gronchi. The case that the reciprocal of the volume is an affine function of t is also investigated and is characterized under certain conditions.   We apply these results to prove exact reverse Santal\'o inequality for polytopes in \rd{d} that have at most d+3 vertices.
