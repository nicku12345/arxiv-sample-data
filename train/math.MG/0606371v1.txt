Let S be a finite set with n elements in a real linear space. Let \cJ_S be a set of n intervals in \nR. We introduce a convex operator \co(S,\cJ_S) which generalizes the familiar concepts of the convex hull \conv S and the affine hull \aff S of S. We establish basic properties of this operator. It is proved that each homothet of \conv S that is contained in \aff S can be obtained using this operator. A variety of convex subsets of \aff S can also be obtained. For example, this operator assigns a regular dodecagon to the 4-element set consisting of the vertices and the orthocenter of an equilateral triangle. For \cJ_S which consists of bounded intervals, we give the upper bound for the number of vertices of the polytope \co(S,\cJ_S).
