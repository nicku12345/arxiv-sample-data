The goal of this article is to present a survey of the recent theory of plurisubharmonic functions of quaternionic variables, and its applications to theory of valuations on convex sets and HKT-geometry (HyperK\"ahler with Torsion). The exposition follows the articles math.CV/0104209, math.CV/0208005, math.MG/0401219 by the author and math.CV/0510140 by M. Verbitsky and the author.
