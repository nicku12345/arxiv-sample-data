In 1960 Reifenberg proved the topological disc property. He showed that a subset of R^n which is well approximated by m-dimensional affine spaces at each point and at each (small) scale is locally a bi-H\"older image of the unit ball in R^m. In this paper we prove that a subset of R^3 which is well approximated by a minimal cone at each point and at each (small) scale is locally a bi-H\"older deformation of a minimal cone. We also prove an analogous result for more general cones in R^n
