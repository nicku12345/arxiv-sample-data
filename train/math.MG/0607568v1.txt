The main results of the paper are: \begin{Prop}\label{GenSvarc-Milnor} A group G acting coarsely on a coarse space (X,\CC) induces a coarse equivalence g\to g\cdot x_0 from G to X for any x_0\in X. \end{Prop}   Theorem: \label{GenGromovThm} Two coarse structures \CC_1 and \CC_2 on the same set X are equivalent if the following conditions are satisfied: \begin{enumerate} \item Bounded sets in \CC_1 are identical with bounded sets in \CC_2, \item There is a coarse action \phi_1 of a group G_1 on (X,\CC_1) and a coarse action \phi_2 of a group G_2 on (X,\CC_2) such that \phi_1 commutes with \phi_2. \end{enumerate}   They generalize the following two basic results of coarse geometry:   Proposition: [\v{S}varc-Milnor Lemma {\cite[Theorem 1.18]{Roe lectures}}] \label{Svarc-Milnor} A group G acting properly and cocompactly via isometries on a length space X is finitely generated and induces a quasi-isometry equivalence g\to g\cdot x_0 from G to X for any x_0\in X.   Theorem: [Gromov {\cite[page 6]{Gro asym invar}}] \label{GromovThm} Two finitely generated groups G and H are quasi-isometric if and only if there is a locally compact space X admitting proper and cocompact actions of both G and H that commute.
