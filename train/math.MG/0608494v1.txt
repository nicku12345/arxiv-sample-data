The electric capacity of a conductor in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space R^3  is defined as a ratio of a given positive charge on the conductor to the value of potential on the surface. This definition of the capacity is independent of the given charge. The capacity of a set as a mathematical notion was defined first by N. Wiener (1924) and was developed by O. Forstman, C. J. de La Vallee Poussin, and several other French mathematicians in connection with potential theory. This paper develops the theory of conformal invariants for Finsler manifolds. More precisely we prove: The capacity of a compact set and the capacity of the condenser of two closed sets are conformally invariant. By mean of the notion of capacity, we construct and study four conformal invariant functions  \rho,  \nu, \mu and \lambda which have similarities with the classical invariants on S^n,  R^n  or H^n. Their properties and especially their continuity are efficient tools for solving some problems of conformal geometry in the large.
