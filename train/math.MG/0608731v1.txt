The structure of the coincidence symmetry group of an arbitrary n-dimensional lattice in the n-dimensional Euclidean space is considered by describing a set of generators. Particular attention is given to the coincidence isometry subgroup (the subgroup formed by those coincidence symmetries which are elements of the orthogonal group). Conditions under which the coincidence isometry group can be generated by reflections defined by vectors of the lattice will be discussed, and an algorithm to decompose an arbitrary element of the coincidence isometry group in terms of reflections defined by vectors of the lattice will be given.
