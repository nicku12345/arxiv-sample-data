We introduce the idea of semigroup-controlled asymptotic dimension. This notion generalizes the asymptotic dimension and the asymptotic Assouad-Nagata dimension in the large scale. There are also semigroup controlled dimensions for the small scale and the global scale. Many basic properties of the asymptotic dimension theory are satisfied by a semigroup-controlled asymptotic dimension. We study how these new dimensions could help in the understanding of coarse embeddings and uniform embeddings. In particular we have introduced uncountable many invariants under quasi-isometries and uncountable many bi-Lipschitz invariants. Hurewicz type theorems are generalized and some applications to geometric group theory are shown.
