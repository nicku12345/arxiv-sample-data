We give estimates on asymptotic dimensions of products of general hyperbolic spaces with following applications to the hyperbolic groups. We give examples of strict inequality in the product theorem for the asymptotic dimension in the class of the hyperbolic groups; and examples of strict inequality in the product theorem for the hyperbolic dimension. We prove that R is dimensionally full for the asymptotic dimension in the class of the hyperbolic groups.
