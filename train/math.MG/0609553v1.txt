We establish new functional versions of the Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality on the volume product of a convex body which generalize to the non-symmetric setting an inequality of K. Ball and we give a simple proof of the case of equality. As a corollary, we get some inequalities for \log-concave functions and Legendre transforms which extend the recent result of Artstein, Klartag and Milman, with its equality case.
