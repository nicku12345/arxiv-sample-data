In this paper,we obtain two results on closed Reimainnian manifold M\times [0,T].When T is small enough,to any prescribed scalar curvature, the existence and uniqueness of metrics are obtained on the volume element preserving deformation.When T is large and the given scalar curvature is small enough,the same result holds.
