We prove algorithmic and hardness results for the problem of finding the largest set of a fixed diameter in the Euclidean space. In particular, we prove that if A^* is the largest subset of diameter r of n points in the Euclidean space, then for every \epsilon>0 there exists a polynomial time algorithm that outputs a set B of size at least |A^*| and of diameter at most r(\sqrt{2}+\epsilon). On the hardness side, roughly speaking, we show that unless P=NP for every \epsilon>0 it is not possible to guarantee the diameter r(\sqrt{4/3}-\epsilon) for B even if the algorithm is allowed to output a set of size ({95\over 94}-\epsilon)^{-1}|A^*|.
