The property of measure concentration is that an arbitrary 1-Lipschitz function f:X\to \mathbb{R} on an mm-space X is almost close to a constant function. In this paper, we prove that if such a concentration phenomenon arise, then any 1-Lipschitz map f from X to a space Y with a doubling measure also concentrates to a constant map. As a corollary, we get any 1-Lipschitz map to a Riemannian manifold with a lower Ricci curvature bounds also concentrates to a constant map.
