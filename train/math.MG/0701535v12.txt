The measure concentration property of an mm-space X is roughly described as that any 1-Lipschitz map on X to a metric space Y is almost close to a constant map. The target space Y is called the screen. The case of Y=\mathbb{R} is widely studied in many literature (see \cite{gromov}, \cite{ledoux}, \cite{mil2}, \cite{milsch}, \cite{sch}, \cite{tal}, \cite{tal2} and its reference). M. Gromov developed the theory of measure concentration in the case where the screen Y is not necessarily \mathbb{R} (cf. \cite{gromovcat}, {gromov2}, \cite{gromov}). In this paper, we consider the case where the screen Y is a nonpositively curved manifolds. We also show that if the screen Y is so big, then the mm-space X does not concentrate.
