Similar sublattices of the root lattice A_4 are possible, according to a result of Conway, Rains and Sloane, for each index that is the square of a non-zero integer of the form m^2 + mn - n^2. Here, we add a constructive approach, based on the arithmetic of the quaternion algebra \mathbb{H} (\mathbb{Q} (\sqrt{5})) and the existence of a particular involution of the second kind, which also provides the actual sublattices and the number of different solutions for a given index. The corresponding Dirichlet series generating function is closely related to the zeta function of the icosian ring.
