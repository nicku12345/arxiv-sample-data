Given a degenerate (n+1)-simplex in a d-dimensional space M^d (Euclidean, spherical or hyperbolic space, and d\geq n), for each k, 1\leq k\leq n, Radon's theorem induces a partition of the set of k-faces into two subsets. We prove that if the vertices of the simplex vary smoothly in M^d for d=n, and the volumes of k-faces in one subset are constrained only to decrease while in the other subset only to increase, then any sufficiently small motion must preserve the volumes of all k-faces; and this property still holds in M^d for d\geq n+1 if an invariant c_{k-1}(\alpha^{k-1}) of the degenerate simplex has the desired sign. This answers a question posed by the author, and the proof relies on an invariant c_k(\omega) we discovered for any k-stress \omega on a cell complex in M^d. We introduce a characteristic polynomial of the degenerate simplex by defining f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n+1}(-1)^{i}c_i(\alpha^i)x^{n+1-i}, and prove that the roots of f(x) are real for the Euclidean case. Some evidence suggests the same conjecture for the hyperbolic case.
