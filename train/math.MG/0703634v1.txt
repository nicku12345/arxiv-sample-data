Some geometric facts concerning sets with positive reach in the Euclidean d-dimensional space {\bf E}^d are proved. For x_1 and x_2 in {\bf E}^d and R>0 let us denote by {\mathfrak H}(x_1,x_2,R) the intersection of all closed balls of radius R containing x_1 and x_2. For a compact subset K of {bf E}^d we prove that {\rm reach}(K)\ge R if and only if for every x_1,x_2\in K such that \Vert x_1-x_2\Vert< 2R, {\mathfrak H}(x_1,x_2,R)\cap K is connected. A corollary is that if {\rm reach}(K)\ge R>0 and D is a closed ball of radius less than or equal to R (intersecting K) then {\rm reach}(K\cap D)\ge R. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition such that A\subset{\bf E}^d admits a minimal cover (with respect to inclusion) of {\rm reach}\ge R.
