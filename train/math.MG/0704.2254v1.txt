We present an extremely elementary construction of the simple Lie algebras over the complex numbers in all of their minuscule representations, using the vertices of various polytopes. The construction itself requires no complicated combinatorics and essentially no Lie theory other than the definition of a Lie algebra; in fact, the Lie algebras themselves appear as by-products of the construction.
