By using the links between generalized roundness, negative type inequalities and equivariant Hilbert space compressions, we obtain that the generalized roundness of the usual Cayley graph of finitely generated free groups and free abelian groups of rank \geq 2 equals 1. This answers a question of J-F. Lafont and S. Prassidis.
