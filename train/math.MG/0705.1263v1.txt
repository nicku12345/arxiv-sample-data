For any bounded regular domain \Omega of a real analytic Riemannian manifold M, we denote by \lambda_{k}(\Omega) the k-th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian of \Omega. In this paper, we consider \lambda_k and as a functional upon the set of domains of fixed volume in M. We introduce and investigate a natural notion of critical domain for this functional. In particular, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a domain to be critical, locally minimizing or locally maximizing for \lambda_k. These results rely on Hadamard type variational formulae that we establish in this general setting.
