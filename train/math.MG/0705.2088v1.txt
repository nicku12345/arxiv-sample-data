In 1921 Blichfeldt gave an upper bound on the number of integral points contained in a convex body in terms of the volume of the body. More precisely, he showed that #(K\cap\Z^n)\leq n! \vol(K)+n, whenever K\subset\R^n is a convex body containing n+1 affinely independent integral points. Here we prove an analogous inequality with respect to the surface area \F(K), namely  #(K\cap\Z^n) < \vol(K) + ((\sqrt{n}+1)/2) (n-1)! \F(K). The proof is based on a slight improvement of Blichfeldt's bound in the case when K is a non-lattice translate of a lattice polytope, i.e., K=t+P, where t\in\R^n\setminus\Z^n and P is an n-dimensional polytope with integral vertices. Then we have #((t+P)\cap\Z^n)\leq n! \vol(P).   Moreover, in the 3-dimensional case we prove a stronger inequality, namely #(K\cap\Z^n) < \vol(K) + 2 \F(K).
