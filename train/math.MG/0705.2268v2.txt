We study the interpolation property of Sobolev spaces of order 1 denoted by W^{1}_{p,V}, arising from Schr\"{o}dinger operators with positive potential. We show that for 1\leq p_1<p<p_2<q_{0} with p>s_0, W^{1}_{p,V} is a real interpolation space between W_{p_1,V}^{1} and W_{p_2,V}^{1} on some classes of manifolds and Lie groups. The constants s_{0}, q_{0} depend on our hypotheses.
