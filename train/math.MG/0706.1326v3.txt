We study the oscillation stability problem for the Urysohn sphere, an analog of the distortion problem for \ell_2 in the context of the Urysohn space \Ur. In particular, we show that this problem reduces to a purely combinatorial problem involving a family of countable ultrahomogeneous metric spaces with finitely many distances.
