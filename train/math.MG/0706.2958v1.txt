We discuss the concept of the shadow boundary of a centrally symmetric convex ball K (actually being the unit ball of a Minkowski normed space) with respect to a direction {\bf x} of the Euclidean n-space R^n. We introduce the concept of general parameter spheres of K corresponding to this direction and prove that the shadow boundary is a topological manifold if all of the non-degenerated general parameter spheres are, too. In this case, using the approximation theorem of cell-like maps we get that they are homeomorphic to the (n-2)-dimensional sphere S^{(n-2)}. We also prove that the bisector (equidistant set of the corresponding normed space) in the direction {\bf x} is homeomorphic to R^{(n-1)} iff all of the non-degenerated general parameter spheres are (n-2)-manifolds implying that if the bisector is a homeomorphic copy of R^{(n-1)} then the corresponding shadow boundary is a topological (n-2)-sphere.
