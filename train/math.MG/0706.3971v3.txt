We study the L^p-distortion of finite quotients of amenable groups. In particular, for every number p larger or equal than 2, we prove that the l^p-distortion of the finite lamplighter group grows like (\log n)^{1/p}. We also give the asymptotic behavior of the l^p-distortion of finite quotients of certain metabelian polycyclic groups and of the solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(m,1). The proofs are short and elementary.
