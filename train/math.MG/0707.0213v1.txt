We show that the maximum number of unit distances or of diameters in a set of n points in d-dimensional Euclidean space is attained only by specific types of Lenz constructions, for all d >= 4 and n sufficiently large, depending on d. As a corollary we determine the exact maximum number of unit distances for all even d >= 6, and the exact maximum number of diameters for all d >= 4, for all n sufficiently large, depending on d.
