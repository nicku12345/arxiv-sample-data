The hypermetric cone \HYP_{n+1} is the parameter space of basic Delaunay polytopes in n-dimensional lattice. The cone \HYP_{n+1} is polyhedral; one way of seeing this is that modulo image by the covariance map \HYP_{n+1} is a finite union of L-domains, i.e., of parameter space of full Delaunay tessellations.   In this paper, we study this partition of the hypermetric cone into L-domains. In particular, it is proved that the cone \HYP_{n+1} of hypermetrics on n+1 points contains exactly {1/2}n! principal L-domains. We give a detailed description of the decomposition of \HYP_{n+1} for n=2,3,4 and a computer result for n=5 (see Table \ref{TableDataHYPn}). Remarkable properties of the root system \mathsf{D}_4 are key for the decomposition of \HYP_5.
