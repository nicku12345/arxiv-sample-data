Based on the notion of dilatation structure arXiv:math/0608536, we give an intrinsic treatment to sub-riemannian geometry, started in the paper arXiv:0706.3644 .   Here we prove that regular sub-riemannian manifolds admit dilatation structures. From the existence of normal frames proved by Bellaiche we deduce the rest of the properties of regular sub-riemannian manifolds by using the formalism of dilatation structures.
