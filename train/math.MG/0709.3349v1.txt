Let M be a closed hypersurface in a simply connected rank-1 symmetric space \olm. In this paper, we give an upper bound for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian of M in terms of the Ricci curvature of \olm and the square of the length of the second fundamental form of the geodesic spheres with center at the center-of-mass of M.
