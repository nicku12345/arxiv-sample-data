These pages serve two purposes. First, they are notes to accompany the talk "Hyperbolic and projective geometry in constraint programming for CAD" by Walter Whiteley at the "Janos Bolyai Conference on Hyperbolic Geometry", 8--12 July 2002, in Budapest, Hungary. Second, they sketch results that will be included in a forthcoming paper that will present the equivalence of the first-order rigidity theories of bar-and-joint frameworks in various geometries, including Euclidean, hyperbolic and spherical geometry. The bulk of the theory is outlined here, with remarks and comments alluding to other results that will make the final version of the paper.
