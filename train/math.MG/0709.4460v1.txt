Let Q(z,w)=-\prod_{k=1}^n [(z-a_k)(\bar{w}-\bar{a}_k)-R_k^2]. M. Putinar and B. Gustafsson proved recently that the matrix Q(a_i,a_j), 1\leq i,j\leq n, is positive definite if disks |z-a_i|<R_i form a disjoint collection. We extend this result on symmetric collections of discs with overlapping. More precisely, we show that in the case when the nodes a_j are situated at the vertices of a regular n-gon inscribed in the unit circle and \forall i: R_i\equiv R, the matrix Q(a_i,a_j) is positive definite if and only if R<\rho_n, where z=2\rho_n^2-1 is the smallest \ne-1 zero of the Jacobi polynomial \mathcal{P}^{n-2\nu,-1}_\nu(z), \nu=[n/2].
