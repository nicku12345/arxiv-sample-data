We say a map f:X \to Y is an \epsilon-embedding if it is continuous and the diameter of the fibres is less than \epsilon. This type of maps is used in the notion of Urysohn width (sometimes referred to as Alexandrov width), a_n(X). It is the smallest real number such that there exists an \epsilon-embedding from X to a n-dimensional polyhedron. Surprisingly few estimations of these numbers can be found, and one of the aims of this paper is to present some. Following Gromov, we take the slightly different point of view by looking at the smallest dimension n for which there exists a \epsilon-embedding to a polyhedron of dimension n. While bounds are obtained using Hadamard matrices, the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, the filling radius of spheres, and lower bounds for the diameter of sets of n+1 points not contained in a hemisphere (obtained by methods very close to those of Ivanov and Pichugov). We are also able to give a complete description in dimension 3 for 1 \leq p \leq 2.
