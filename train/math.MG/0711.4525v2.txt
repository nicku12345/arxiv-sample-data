We address the problem of determining finite subsets of Delone sets \varLambda\subset\R^d with long-range order by X-rays in prescribed \varLambda-directions, i.e., directions parallel to non-zero interpoint vectors of \varLambda. Here, an X-ray in direction u of a finite set gives the number of points in the set on each line parallel to u. For our main result, we introduce the notion of algebraic Delone sets \varLambda\subset\R^2 and derive a sufficient condition for the determination of the convex subsets of these sets by X-rays in four prescribed \varLambda-directions.
