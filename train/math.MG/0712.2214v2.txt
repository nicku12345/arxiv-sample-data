In this paper we provide the final steps in the proof, announced by Eskin-Fisher-Whyte, of quasi-isometric rigidity of a class of non-nilpotent polycyclic groups. To this end, we prove a rigidity theorem on the boundaries of certain negatively curved homogeneous spaces and combine it with work of Eskin-Fisher-Whyte and Peng on the structure of quasi-isometries of certain solvable Lie groups.
