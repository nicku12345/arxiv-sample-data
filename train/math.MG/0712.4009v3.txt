It is presented the simplest known disproof of the Borsuk conjecture stating that if a bounded subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space contains more than n points, then the subset can be partitioned into n+1 nonempty parts of smaller diameter.   The argument is due to N. Alon and is a remarkable application of combinatorics and algebra to geometry. This note is purely expository and is accessible for students.
