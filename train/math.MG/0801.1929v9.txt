A simple plane closed curve \Gamma satisfies the DNA Inequality if the average curvature of any closed curve contained inside \Gamma exceeds the average curvature of \Gamma. In 1997 Lagarias and Richardson proved that all convex curves satisfy the DNA Inequality and asked whether this is true for any non-convex curve. They conjectured that the DNA Inequality holds for certain L-shaped curves. In this paper, we disprove this conjecture for all L-Shapes and construct a large class of non-convex curves for which the DNA Inequality holds. We also give a polynomial-time procedure for determining whether any specific curve in a much larger class satisfies the DNA Inequality.
