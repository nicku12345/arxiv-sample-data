We introduce the idea of Assur graphs, a concept originally developed and exclusively employed in the literature of the kinematics community. The paper translates the terminology, questions, methods and conjectures from the kinematics terminology for one degree of freedom linkages to the terminology of Assur graphs as graphs with special properties in rigidity theory. Exploiting recent works in combinatorial rigidity theory we provide mathematical characterizations of these graphs derived from minimal linkages. With these characterizations, we confirm a series of conjectures posed by Offer Shai, and offer techniques and algorithms to be exploited further in future work.
