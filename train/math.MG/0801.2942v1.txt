Let C_n be the n-th generation in the construction of the middle-half Cantor set. The Cartesian square K_n of C_n consists of 4^n squares of side-length 4^{-n}. The chance that a long needle thrown at random in the unit square will meet K_n is essentially the average length of the projections of K_n, also known as the Favard length of K_n. A classical theorem of Besicovitch implies that the Favard length of K_n tends to zero. It is still an open problem to determine its exact rate of decay. Until recently, the only explicit upper bound was \exp(- c\log_* n), due to Peres and Solomyak. (\log_* n is the number of times one needs to take log to obtain a number less than 1 starting from n). We obtain a power law bound by combining analytic and combinatorial ideas.
