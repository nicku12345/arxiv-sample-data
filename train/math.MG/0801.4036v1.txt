In the paper we study the infimum convolution inequalites. Such an inequality was first introduced by B. Maurey to give the optimal concentration of measure behaviour for the product exponential measure. We show how IC-inequalities are tied to concentration and study the optimal cost functions for an arbitrary probability measure. In particular, we show the optimal IC-inequality for product log-concave measures and for uniform measures on the l_p^n balls. Such an optimal inequality implies, for a given measure, in particular the Central Limit Theorem of Klartag and the tail estimates of Paouris.
