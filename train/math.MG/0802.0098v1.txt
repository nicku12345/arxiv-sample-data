We give a new proof of the Gromov theorem: For any C>0 and integer n>1 there exists a function \Delta_{C,n} such that if the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between complete Riemannian n-manifolds V and W is not greater than \delta, absolute values of their sectional curvatures |K_{\sigma}|\leq C, and their injectivity radii \geq 1/C, then the Lipschitz distance between V and W is less than \Delta_{C,n}(\delta) and \Delta_{C,n}\to 0 as \delta\to 0.
