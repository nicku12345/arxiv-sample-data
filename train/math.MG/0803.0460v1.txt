Theorem A. Let x_1,...,x_{2k+1} be unit vectors in a normed plane. Then there exist signs \epsi_1,...,\epsi_{2k+1}\in\{\pm 1\} such that \norm{\sum_{i=1}^{2k+1}\epsi_i x_i}\leq 1.   We use the method of proof of the above theorem to show the following point facility location result, generalizing Proposition 6.4 of Y. S. Kupitz and H. Martini (1997).   Theorem B. Let p_0,p_1,...,p_n be distinct points in a normed plane such that for any 1\leq i<j\leq n the closed angle \angle p_ip_0p_j contains a ray opposite some \overrightarrow{p_0p_k}, 1\leq k\leq n. Then p_0 is a Fermat-Toricelli point of \{p_0,p_1,...,p_n\}, i.e. x=p_0 minimizes \sum_{i=0}^n\norm{x-p_i}.   We also prove the following dynamic version of Theorem A.   Theorem C. Let x_1,x_2,... be a sequence of unit vectors in a normed plane. Then there exist signs \epsi_1,\epsi_2,...\in\{\pm 1\} such that \norm{\sum_{i=1}^{2k}\epsi_i x_i}\leq 2 for all k\in\N.   Finally we discuss a variation of a two-player balancing game of J. Spencer (1977) related to Theorem C.
