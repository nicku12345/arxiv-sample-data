Let D be a closed disk centered at the origin in the horizontal hyperplane \{t=0\} of the sub-Riemannian Heisenberg group \hh^n, and C the vertical cylinder over D. We prove that any finite perimeter set E such that D\subset E\subset C has perimeter larger than or equal to the one of the rotationally symmetric sphere with constant mean curvature of the same volume, and that equality holds only for the spheres using a recent result by Monti and Vittone [12].
