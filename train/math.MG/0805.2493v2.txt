We consider sequential random packing of cubes z+[0,1]^n with z\in \frac{1}{N}\ZZ^n into the cube [0,2]^n and the torus \QuotS{\RR^n}{2\ZZ^n} as N\to\infty. In the cube case [0,2]^n as N\to\infty the random cube packings thus obtained are reduced to a single cube with probability 1-O(\frac{1}{N}). In the torus case the situation is different: for n\leq 2, sequential random cube packing yields cube tilings, but for n\geq 3 with strictly positive probability, one obtains non-extensible cube packings.   So, we introduce the notion of combinatorial cube packing, which instead of depending on N depend on some parameters. We use use them to derive an expansion of the packing density in powers of \frac{1}{N}. The explicit computation is done in the cube case. In the torus case, the situation is more complicate and we restrict ourselves to the case N\to\infty of strictly positive probability. We prove the following results for torus combinatorial cube packings: We give a general Cartesian product construction. We prove that the number of parameters is at least \frac{n(n+1)}{2} and we conjecture it to be at most 2^n-1. We prove that cube packings with at least 2^n-3 cubes are extensible. We find the minimal number of cubes in non-extensible cube packings for n odd and n\leq 6.
