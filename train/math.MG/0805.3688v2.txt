We study the max-plus or tropical analogue of the notion of polar: the polar of a cone represents the set of linear inequalities satisfied by its elements. We establish an analogue of the bipolar theorem, which characterizes all the inequalities satisfied by the elements of a tropical convex cone. We derive this characterization from a new separation theorem. We also establish variants of these results concerning systems of linear equalities.
