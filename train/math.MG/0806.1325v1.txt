This paper constructs a class of complete K\"{a}hler metrics of positive holomorphic sectional curvature on {\bf C}^n and finds that the constructed metrics satisfy the following properties: As the geodesic distance \rho\to\infty, the volume of geodesic balls grows like O(\rho^{\frac{2(\beta+1)n}{\beta+2}}) and the Riemannian scalar curvature decays like O(\rho^{-\frac{2(\beta+1)}{\beta+2}}), where \beta\geq 0.
