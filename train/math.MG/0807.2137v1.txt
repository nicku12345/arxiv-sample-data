Bosse et al. conjectured that for every natural number d \ge 2 and every d-dimensional polytope P in \real^d there exist d polynomials p_0(x),...,p_{d-1}(x) satisfying P=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d : p_0(x) \ge 0, >..., p_{d-1}(x) \ge 0 \}. We show that for dimensions d \le 3 even every d-dimensional polyhedron can be described by d polynomial inequalities. The proof of our result is constructive.
