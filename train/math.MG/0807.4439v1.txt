We find all intrinsic measures of C^{1,1} smooth submanifolds in the Engel group, showing that they are equivalent to the corresponding d-dimensional spherical Hausdorff measure restricted to the submanifold. The integer d is the degree of the submanifold. These results follow from a different approach to negligibility, based on a blow-up technique.
