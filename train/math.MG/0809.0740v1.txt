Let (X, d) be a compact metric space and let \mathcal{M}(X) denote the space of all finite signed Borel measures on X. Define I \colon \mathcal{M}(X) \to \R by \[I(\mu) = \int_X \int_X d(x,y) d\mu(x) d\mu(y),\] and set M(X) = \sup I(\mu), where \mu ranges over the collection of signed measures in \mathcal{M}(X) of total mass 1.   The metric space (X, d) is quasihypermetric if for all n \in \N, all \alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n \in \R satisfying \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i = 0 and all x_1, ..., x_n \in X, one has \sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j d(x_i, x_j) \leq 0. Without the quasihypermetric property M(X) is infinite, while with the property a natural semi-inner product structure becomes available on \mathcal{M}_0(X), the subspace of \mathcal{M}(X) of all measures of total mass 0. This paper explores: operators and functionals which provide natural links between the metric structure of (X, d), the semi-inner product space structure of \mathcal{M}_0(X) and the Banach space C(X) of continuous real-valued functions on X; conditions equivalent to the quasihypermetric property; the topological properties of \mathcal{M}_0(X) with the topology induced by the semi-inner product, and especially the relation of this topology to the weak-* topology and the measure-norm topology on \mathcal{M}_0(X); and the functional-analytic properties of \mathcal{M}_0(X) as a semi-inner product space, including the question of its completeness. A later paper [Peter Nickolas and Reinhard Wolf, Distance Geometry in Quasihypermetric Spaces. II] will apply the work of this paper to a detailed analysis of the constant M(X).
