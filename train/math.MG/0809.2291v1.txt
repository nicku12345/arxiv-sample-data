A locally finite face-to-face tiling of euclidean d-space by convex polytopes is called combinatorially multihedral if its combinatorial automorphism group has only finitely many orbits on the tiles. The paper describes a local characterization of combinatorially multihedral tilings in terms of centered coronas. This generalizes the Local Theorem for Monotypic Tilings, established in an earlier paper, which characterizes the case of combinatorial tile-transitivity.
