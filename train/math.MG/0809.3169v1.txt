Let G_{\infty}=(C_m^d)_{\infty} denote the graph whose set of vertices is \{1,..., m\}^d, where two distinct vertices are adjacent iff they are either equal or adjacent in C_m in each coordinate. Let G_{1}=(C_m^d)_1 denote the graph on the same set of vertices in which two vertices are adjacent iff they are adjacent in one coordinate in C_m and equal in all others. Both graphs can be viewed as graphs of the d-dimensional torus. We prove that one can delete O(\sqrt d m^{d-1}) vertices of G_1 so that no topologically nontrivial cycles remain. This improves an O(d^{\log_2 (3/2)}m^{d-1}) estimate of Bollob\'as, Kindler, Leader and O'Donnell. We also give a short proof of a result implicit in a recent paper of Raz: one can delete an O(\sqrt d/m) fraction of the edges of G_{\infty} so that no topologically nontrivial cycles remain in this graph. Our technique also yields a short proof of a recent result of Kindler, O'Donnell, Rao and Wigderson; there is a subset of the continuous d-dimensional torus of surface area O(\sqrt d) that intersects all nontrivial cycles. All proofs are based on the same general idea: the consideration of random shifts of a body with small boundary and no- nontrivial cycles, whose existence is proved by applying the isoperimetric inequality of Cheeger or its vertex or edge discrete analogues.
