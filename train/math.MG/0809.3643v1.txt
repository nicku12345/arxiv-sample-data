We study relations of some classes of k-convex, k-visible bodies in Euclidean spaces. We introduce and study \textrm{circular projections} in normed linear spaces and classes of bodies related with families of such maps, in particular, \textrm{k-circular convex} and \textrm{k-circular visible} ones.   Investigation of these bodies more general than k-convex and k-visible ones allows us to generalize some classical results of geometric tomography and find their new applications.
