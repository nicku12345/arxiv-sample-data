It is shown that the volume entropy of a Hilbert geometry associated to an n-dimensional convex body of class C^{1,1} equals n-1. To achieve this result, a new projective invariant of convex bodies, similar to the centro-affine area, is constructed. In the case n=2, and without any assumption on the boundary, it is shown that the entropy is bounded above by \frac{2}{3-d} \leq 1, where d is the Minkowski dimension of the extremal set of K. An example of a plane Hilbert geometry with entropy strictly between 0 and 1 is constructed.
