We show that there are not pure \mathcal{C}^5 regular y-global Landsberg surfaced. The proof is based on the averaged connection associated with the linear Chern's connection and the classification of irreducibles holonomies of torsion-free affine connections. The structure consists on exausting all the possible cases and showing that in dimension 2 Landsberg condition implies Berwald condition.
