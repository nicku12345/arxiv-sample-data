Let G be a non-elementary group of isometries of a proper CAT(0)-space with limit set L. We survey properties of the action of G on L under the assumption that G contains a rank-one element. Among others, we show that there is a dense orbit for the action of G on the complement of the diagonal in LxL and that pairs of fixed points of rank-one elements are dense in the complement of the diagonal of LxL.
