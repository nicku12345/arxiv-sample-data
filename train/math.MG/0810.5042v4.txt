We introduce length dilatation structures on metric spaces, tempered dilatation structures and coherent projections and explore the relations between these objects and the Radon-Nikodym property and Gamma-convergence of length functionals. Then we show that the main properties of sub-riemannian spaces can be obtained from pairs of length dilatation structures, the first being a tempered one and the second obtained via a coherent projection.   Thus we get an intrinsic, synthetic, axiomatic description of sub-riemannian geometry, which transforms the classical construction of a Carnot-Caratheodory distance on a regular sub-riemannian manifold into a model for this abstract sub-riemannian geometry.
