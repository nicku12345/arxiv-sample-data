For an oriented n-dimensional Lipschitz manifold M we give meaning to the integral \int_M f dg_1 \wedge ... \wedge dg_n in case the functions f, g_1, >..., g_n are merely H\"older continuous of a certain order by extending the construction of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral to higher dimensions. More generally, we show that for \alpha \in (\frac{n}{n+1},1] the n-dimensional locally normal currents in a locally compact metric space (X,d) represent a subspace of the n-dimensional currents in (X,d^\alpha). On the other hand, for n \geq 1 and \alpha \leq \frac{n}{n+1} the latter space consists of the zero functional only.
