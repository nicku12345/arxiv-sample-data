Some aspects of a mathematical theory of rigidity and flexibility are developed for general infinite frameworks and two main results are obtained. In the first sufficient conditions, of a uniform local nature, are obtained for the existence of a proper flex of an infinite framework. In the second it is shown how continuous paths in the plane may be simulated by infinite Kempe linkages.
