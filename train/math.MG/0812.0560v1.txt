The number theoretic analogue of a net in metric geometry suggests new problems and results in combinatorial and additive number theory. For example, for a fixed integer g > 1, the study of h-nets in the additive group of integers with respect to the generating set A_g = {g^i:i=0,1,2,...} requires a knowledge of the word lengths of integers with respect to A_g. A g-adic representation of an integer is described that algorithmically produces a representation of shortest length. Additive complements and additive asymptotic complements are also discussed, together with their associated minimality problems.
