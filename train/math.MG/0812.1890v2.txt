In this article we study asymptotic properties of certain discrete groups \Gamma acting by isometries on a product \XX=\XX_1\times \XX_2 of locally compact Hadamard spaces. The motivation comes from the fact that Kac-Moody groups over finite fields, which can be seen as generalizations of arithmetic groups over function fields, belong to this class of groups. Hence one may ask whether classical properties of discrete subgroups of higher rank Lie groups as in [MR1437472] and [MR1933790] hold in this context.   In the first part of the paper we describe the structure of the geometric limit set of \Gamma and prove statements analogous to the results of Benoist in [MR1437472]. The second part is concerned with the exponential growth rate \delta_\theta(\Gamma) of orbit points in \XX with a prescribed so-called "slope" \theta\in (0,\pi/2), which appropriately generalizes the critical exponent in higher rank. In analogy to Quint's result in [MR1933790] we show that the homogeneous extension \Psi_\Gamma to \RR_{\ge 0}^2 of \delta_\theta(\Gamma) as a function of \theta is upper semi-continuous and concave.
