The purpose of this paper is to understand the geometric structure of the L^2-Wasserstein space \pp over the Euclidean space.For this sake, we focus on its cone structure.One of our main results is that the L^2-Wasserstein space over a Polish space has a cone structure if and only if so does the underlying space.In particular, \pp turns out to have a cone structure.It is also shown that \pp splits \R^d isometrically but not \R^{d+1}.
