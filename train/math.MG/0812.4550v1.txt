We prove new Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequalities and new affine isoperimetric inequalities for mixed p-affine surface areas. We introduce a new class of bodies, the illumination surface bodies, and establish some of their properties. We show, for instance, that they are not necessarily convex. We give geometric interpretations of L_p affine surface areas, mixed p-affine surface areas and other functionals via these bodies. The surprising new element is that not necessarily convex bodies provide the tool for these interpretations.
