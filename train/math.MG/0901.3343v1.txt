For a given convex body K in R^d, a random polytope K^{(n)} is defined (essentially) as the intersection of n independent closed halfspaces containing K and having an isotropic and (in a specified sense) uniform distribution. We prove upper and lower bounds, of optimal orders, for the difference of the mean widths of K^{(n)} and K, as n tends to infinity. For a simplicial polytope P, a precise asymptotic formula for the difference of the mean widths of P^{(n)} and P is obtained.
