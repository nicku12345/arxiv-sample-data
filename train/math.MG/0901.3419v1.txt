Let K be a d-dimensional convex body, and let K^{(n)} be the intersection of n halfspaces containing K whose bounding hyperplanes are independent and identically distributed. Under suitable distributional assumptions, we prove an asymptotic formula for the expectation of the difference of the mean widths of K^{(n)} and K, and another asymptotic formula for the expectation of the number of facets of K^{(n)}. These results are achieved by establishing an asymptotic result on weighted volume approximation of K and by "dualizing" it using polarity.
