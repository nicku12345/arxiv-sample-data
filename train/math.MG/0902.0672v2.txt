We prove a Gauss-Bonnet formula for the extrinsic curvature of complete surfaces in hyperbolic space under some assumptions on the asymptotic behaviour. The result is given in terms of the measure of geodesics intersecting the surface non-trivially, and of a conformal invariant of the curve at infinity.
