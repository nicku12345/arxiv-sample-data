Under study is the new class of geometrical extremal problems in which it is required to achieve the best result in the presence of conflicting goals; e.g., given the surface area of a convex body \mathfrak x, we try to maximize the volume of \mathfrak x and minimize the width of \mathfrak x simultaneously. These problems are addressed along the lines of multiple criteria decision making.
