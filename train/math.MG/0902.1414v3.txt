If X is a convex surface in a Euclidean space, then the squared intrinsic distance function \dist^2(x,y) is DC (d.c., delta-convex) on X\times X in the only natural extrinsic sense. An analogous result holds for the squared distance function \dist^2(x,F) from a closed set F \subset X. Applications concerning r-boundaries (distance spheres) and the ambiguous locus (exoskeleton) of a closed subset of a convex surface are given.
