Let (X, d) be a compact metric space and let \mathcal{M}(X) denote the space of all finite signed Borel measures on X. Define I \colon \mathcal{M}(X) \to \R by I(mu) = \int_X \int_X d(x,y) d\mu(x) d\mu(y), and set M(X) = \sup I(mu), where \mu ranges over the collection of measures in \mathcal{M}(X) of total mass 1. The space (X, d) is \emph{quasihypermetric} if I(\mu) \leq 0 for all measures \mu in \mathcal{M}(X) of total mass 0 and is \emph{strictly quasihypermetric} if in addition the equality I(\mu) = 0 holds amongst measures \mu of mass 0 only for the zero measure.   This paper explores the constant M(X) and other geometric aspects of X in the case when the space X is finite, focusing first on the significance of the maximal strictly quasihypermetric subspaces of a given finite quasihypermetric space and second on the class of finite metric spaces which are L^1-embeddable. While most of the results are for finite spaces, several apply also in the general compact case. The analysis builds upon earlier more general work of the authors [Peter Nickolas and Reinhard Wolf, \emph{Distance geometry in quasihypermetric spaces. I}, \emph{II} and \emph{III}].
