We study geodesically complete and locally compact Hadamard spaces X whose Tits boundary is a connected irreducible spherical building. We show that X is symmetric iff complete geodesics in X do not branch and a Euclidean building otherwise. Furthermore, every boundary equivalence (cone topology homeomorphism preserving the Tits metric) between two such spaces is induced by a homothety. As an application, we can extend the Mostow and Prasad rigidity theorems to compact singular (orbi)spaces of nonpositive curvature which are homotopy equivalent to a quotient of a symmetric space or Euclidean building by a cocompact group of isometries.
