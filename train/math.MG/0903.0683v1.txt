Given a measured lamination on a finite area hyperbolic surface we consider a natural measure Mon the real line obtained by taking the push-forward of the volume measure of the unit tangent bundle of the surface under an intersection function associated with the lamination. We show that the measure M gives summation identities for the Rogers dilogarithm function on the moduli space of a surface.
