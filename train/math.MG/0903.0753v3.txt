Viviani's theorem states that the sum of distances from any point inside an equilateral triangle to its sides is constant. We consider extensions of the theorem and show that any convex polygon can be divided into parallel segments such that the sum of the distances of the points to the sides on each segment is constant. A polygon possesses the CVS property if the sum of the distances from any inner point to its sides is constant. An amazing result, concerning the converse of Viviani's theorem is deduced; Three non-collinear points which have equal sum of distances to the sides inside a convex polygon, is sufficient for possessing the CVS property. For concave polygons the situation is quite different, while for polyhedra analogous results are deduced.
