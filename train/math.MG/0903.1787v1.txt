In the works of Darboux and Walsh it was remarked that a one to one self mapping of \rr^3 which sends convex sets to convex ones is affine. It can be remarked also that a \calc^2-diffeomorphism F:U\to U^{'} between two domains in \cc^n, n\ge 2, which sends pseudoconvex hypersurfaces to pseudoconvex ones is either holomorphic or antiholomorphic.   \smallskip In this note we are interested in the self mappings of \cc^n which send convex hypersurfaces to pseudoconvex ones. Their characterization is the following: {\it A \calc^2 - diffeomorphism F:U'\to U (where U', U\subset \cc^n are domains) sends convex hypersurfaces to pseudoconvex ones if and only if the inverse map \Phi\deff F^{-1} is weakly pluriharmonic, i.e. it satisfies some nice second order PDE very close to \d\bar\d \Phi = 0.} In fact all pluriharmonic \Phi-s do satisfy this equation, but there are also other solutions.
