In connection with an unsolved problem of Bang (1951) we give a lower bound for the sum of the base volumes of cylinders covering a d-dimensional convex body in terms of the relevant basic measures of the given convex body. As an application we establish lower bounds on the number of k-dimensional flats (i.e. translates of k-dimensional linear subspaces) needed to cover all the integer points of a given convex body in d-dimensional Euclidean space for 0<k<d.
