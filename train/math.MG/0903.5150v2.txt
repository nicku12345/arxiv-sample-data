Under an infinitesimal version of the Bishop-Gromov relative volume comparison condition for a measure on an Alexandrov space, we prove a topological splitting theorem of Cheeger-Gromoll type. As a corollary, we prove an isometric splitting theorem for Riemannian manifolds with singularities of nonnegative (Bakry-Emery) Ricci curvature.
