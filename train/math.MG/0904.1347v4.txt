The product of smooth valuations on manifolds is described in terms of differential forms, Gelfand transforms and blow-up spaces. It is shown that the product extends partially to generalized valuations and corresponds geometrically to transversal intersections. This result is used to prove a general kinematic formula on compact rank one symmetric spaces.
