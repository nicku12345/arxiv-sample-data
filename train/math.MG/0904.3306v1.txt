We show that the isometry group of a polyhedral Hilbert geometry coincides with its group of collineations (projectivities) if and only if the polyhedron is not an n-simplex with n>=2. Moreover, we determine the isometry group of the Hilbert geometry on the n-simplex, and find that it has the collineation group as an index-two subgroup. These results confirm, for the class of polyhedral Hilbert geometries, several conjectures posed by P. de la Harpe.
