In this paper we construct and study a new 15-vertex triangulation X of the complex projective plane \CP^2. The automorphism group of X is isomorphic to S_4\times S_3. We prove that the triangulation X is the minimal by the number of vertices triangulation of \CP^2 admitting a chess colouring of four-dimensional simplices. We provide explicit parametrizations for simplices of X and show that the automorphism group of X can be realized as a group of isometries of the Fubini--Study metric. We provide a 33-vertex subdivision \bX of the triangulation X such that the classical moment mapping \mu:\CP^2\to\Delta^2 is a simplicial mapping of the triangulation \bX onto the barycentric subdivision of the triangle \Delta^2. We study the relationship of the triangulation X with complex crystallographic groups.
