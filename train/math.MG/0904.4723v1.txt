This paper considers compressed sensing matrices and neighborliness of a centrally symmetric convex polytope generated by vectors \pm X_1,...,\pm X_N\in\R^n, (N\ge n). We introduce a class of random sampling matrices and show that they satisfy a restricted isometry property (RIP) with overwhelming probability. In particular, we prove that matrices with i.i.d. centered and variance 1 entries that satisfy uniformly a sub-exponential tail inequality possess this property RIP with overwhelming probability. We show that such "sensing" matrices are valid for the exact reconstruction process of m-sparse vectors via \ell_1 minimization with m\le Cn/\log^2 (cN/n). The class of sampling matrices we study includes the case of matrices with columns that are independent isotropic vectors with log-concave densities. We deduce that if K\subset \R^n is a convex body and X_1,..., X_N\in K are i.i.d. random vectors uniformly distributed on K, then, with overwhelming probability, the symmetric convex hull of these points is an m-centrally-neighborly polytope with m\sim n/\log^2 (cN/n).
