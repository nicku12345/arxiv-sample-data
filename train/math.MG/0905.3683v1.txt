We construct a flexible (non immersed) suspension with a hexagonal equator in Euclidean 3-space and study its properties related to the Strong Bellows Conjecture which reads as follows: if an immersed polyhedron \Cal P in Euclidean 3-space is obtained from another immersed polyhedron \Cal Q by a continuous flex then \Cal P and \Cal Q are scissors congruent.
