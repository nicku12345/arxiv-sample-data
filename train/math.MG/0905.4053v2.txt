The n-skeleton of the canonical cubulation \cal C of \mathbb{R}^{n+2} into unit cubes is called the {\it canonical scaffolding} {\cal{S}}. In this paper, we prove that any smooth, compact, closed, n-dimensional submanifold of \mathbb{R}^{n+2} with trivial normal bundle can be continuously isotoped by an ambient isotopy to a cubic submanifold contained in {\cal{S}}. In particular, any smooth knot \mathbb{S}^{n}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n+2} can be continuously isotoped to a knot contained in {\cal{S}}.
