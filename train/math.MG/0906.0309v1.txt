Let K be a d dimensional convex body with a twice continuously differentiable boundary and everywhere positive Gauss-Kronecker curvature. Denote by K_n the convex hull of n points chosen randomly and independently from K according to the uniform distribution. Matching lower and upper bounds are obtained for the orders of magnitude of the variances of the s-th intrinsic volumes V_s(K_n) of K_n for s\in\{1, ..., d\}. Furthermore, strong laws of large numbers are proved for the intrinsic volumes of K_n. The essential tools are the Economic Cap Covering Theorem of B\'ar\'any and Larman, and the Efron-Stein jackknife inequality.
