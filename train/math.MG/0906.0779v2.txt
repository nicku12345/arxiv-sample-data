We show that canonical Carnot-Caratheodory spherical and horospherical metrics, which are defined on the boundary at infinity of every rank one symmetric space of non-compact type, are visual, i.e., they are bilipschitz equivalent with universal bilipschitz constants to the inverse exponent of Gromov products based in the space and on the boundary at infinity respectively.
