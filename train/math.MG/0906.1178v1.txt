A polygonal complex in euclidean 3-space is a discrete polyhedron-like structure with finite or infinite polygons as faces and finite graphs as vertex-figures, such that a fixed number r of faces surround each edge. It is said to be regular if its symmetry group is transitive on the flags. The present paper and its successor describe a complete classification of regular polygonal complexes in 3-space. In particular, the present paper establishes basic structure results for the symmetry groups, discusses geometric and algebraic aspects of operations on their generators, characterizes the complexes with face mirrors as the 2-skeletons of the regular 4-apeirotopes in 3-space, and fully enumerates the simply flag-transitive complexes with mirror vector (1,2). The second paper will complete the enumeration.
