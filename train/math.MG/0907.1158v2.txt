We give a variety of uniqueness results for minimal ellipsoids circumscribing and maximal ellipsoids inscribed into a convex body. Uniqueness follows from a convexity or concavity criterion on the function used to measure the size of the ellipsoid. Simple examples with non-unique minimal or maximal ellipsoids conclude this article.
