The goal of this paper is to prove the conjecture of Krzyz posed in 1968 that for nonvanishing holomorphic functions f(z) = c_0 + c_1 z + ... in the unit disk with |f(z)| \le 1, we have the sharp bound |c_n| \le 2/e for all n \ge 1, with equality only for the function f(z) = \exp [(z^n - 1)/(z^n + 1)] and its rotations. The problem was considered by many researchers, but only partial results have been established. The desired estimate has been proved only for n \le 5.   Our approach is completely different and relies on complex geometry and pluripotential features of convex domains in complex Banach spaces.
