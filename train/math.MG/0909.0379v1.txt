The paper contains a characterization of compact groups G\subseteq\GL(V), where V is a finite dimensional real vector space, which have the following property \SP{}: the family of convex hulls of G-orbits is a semigroup with respect to the Minkowski addition. If G is finite, then \SP{} holds if and only if G is a Coxeter group; if G is connected then \SP{} is true if and only if G is polar. In general, G satisfies \SP{} if and only if it is polar and its Weyl group is a Coxeter group.
