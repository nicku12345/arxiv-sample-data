Two consequences of the stability version of the one dimensional Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality are presented. One is the stability version of the Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality, and the other is a stability version of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality for even functions in higher dimensions, where a recent stability version of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality is also used in an essential way.
