We show how circumradius and asymptotic behavior of curves in CAT(0) and CAT(K) spaces(K>0) are controlled by growth rates of total curvature. We apply our results to pursuit and evasion games of capture type with simple pursuit motion, generalizing results that are known for convex Euclidean domains, and obtaining results that are new for convex Euclidean domains and hold on playing fields vastly more general than these.
