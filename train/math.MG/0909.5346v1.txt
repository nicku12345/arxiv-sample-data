We give upper bounds for the eigenvalues of the La-place-Beltrami operator of a compact m-dimensional submanifold M of \R^{m+p}. Besides the dimension and the volume of the submanifold and the order of the eigenvalue, these bounds depend on either the maximal number of intersection points of M with a p-plane in a generic position (transverse to M), or an invariant which measures the concentration of the volume of M in \R^{m+p}. These bounds are asymptotically optimal in the sense of the Weyl law. On the other hand, we show that even for hypersurfaces (i.e., when p=1), the first positive eigenvalue cannot be controlled only in terms of the volume, the dimension and (for m\ge 3) the differential structure.
