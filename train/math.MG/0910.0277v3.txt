We show that for every \alpha > 0, there exist n-point metric spaces (X,d) where every "scale" admits a Euclidean embedding with distortion at most \alpha, but the whole space requires distortion at least \Omega(\sqrt{\alpha \log n}). This shows that the scale-gluing lemma [Lee, SODA 2005] is tight, and disproves a conjecture stated there. This matching upper bound was known to be tight at both endpoints, i.e. when \alpha = \Theta(1) and \alpha = \Theta(\log n), but nowhere in between.   More specifically, we exhibit n-point spaces with doubling constant \lambda requiring Euclidean distortion \Omega(\sqrt{\log \lambda \log n}), which also shows that the technique of "measured descent" [Krauthgamer, et. al., Geometric and Functional Analysis] is optimal. We extend this to obtain a similar tight result for L_p spaces with p > 1.
