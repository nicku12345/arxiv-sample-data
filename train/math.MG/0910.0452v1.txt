Sequences of polygons generated by performing iterative processes on an initial polygon have been studied extensively. One of the most popular sequences is the one sometimes referred to as {\it Kasner polygons}. Given a polygon K, the first Kasner descendant K' of K is obtained by placing the vertices of K' at the midpoints of the edges of K.   More generally, for any fixed m in (0,1) one may define a sequence of polygons \{K^{t}\}_{t\ge 0} where each polygon K^{t} is obtained by dividing every edge of K^{t-1} into the ratio m:(1-m) in the counterclockwise (or clockwise) direction and taking these division points to be the vertices of K^{t}.   We are interested in the following problem   {\it Let m be a fixed number in (0,1) and let n\ge 3 be a fixed integer. Further, let K be a convex n-gon and denote by K', the first m-Kasner descendant of K, that is, the vertices of K' divide the edges of K into the ratio m:(1-m). What can be said about the ratio between the area of K' and the area of K, when K varies in the class of convex n-gons?}   We provide a complete answer to this question.
