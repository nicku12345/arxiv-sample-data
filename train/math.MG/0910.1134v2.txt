Products of simplices, called simplotopes, and their triangulations arise naturally in algorithmic applications in game theory and optimization. We develop techniques to derive lower bounds for the size of simplicial covers and triangulations of simplotopes, including those with interior vertices. We establish that a minimal triangulation of a product of two simplices is given by a vertex triangulation, i.e., one without interior vertices. For products of more than two simplices, we produce bounds for products of segments and triangles. Aside from cubes, these are the first known lower bounds for triangulations of simplotopes with three or more factors, and our techniques suggest extensions to products of other kinds of simplices. We also construct a minimal triangulation of size 10 for the product of a triangle and a square using our lower bound.
