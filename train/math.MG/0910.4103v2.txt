For an arbitrary cocompact hyperbolic Coxeter group G with finite generator set S and complete growth function P(x)/Q(x), we provide a recursion formula for the coefficients of the denominator polynomial Q(x) which allows to determine recursively the Taylor coefficients and the pole behavior of the growth function of G in terms of its Coxeter subgroup structure. We illustrate this in the easy case of compact right-angled hyperbolic n-polytopes. Finally, we provide detailed insight into the case of Coxeter groups with at most 6 generators, acting cocompactly on hyperbolic 4-space, by considering the three combinatorially different families discovered and classified by Lanner, Kaplinskaya and Esselmann, respectively.
