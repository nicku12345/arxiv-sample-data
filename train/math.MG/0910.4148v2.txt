We show that for some absolute (explicit) constant C, the following holds for every finitely generated group G, and all d >0:   If there is some  R_0 > \exp(\exp(Cd^C)) for which the number of elements in a ball of radius R_0 in a Cayley graph of G is bounded by R_0^d, then G has a finite index subgroup which is nilpotent (of step <C^d). An effective bound on the finite index is provided if "nilpotent" is replaced by 'polycyclic", thus yielding a non-trivial result for finite groups as well.
