Let K be a convex body in \bbR^n and \d>0. The homothety conjecture asks: Does K_{\d}=c K imply that K is an ellipsoid? Here K_{\d} is the (convex) floating body and c is a constant depending on \d only. In this paper we prove that the homothety conjecture holds true in the class of the convex bodies B^n_p, 1\leq p\leq \infty, the unit balls of l_p^n; namely, we show that (B^n_p)_{\d} = c B^n_p if and only if p=2. We also show that the homothety conjecture is true for a general convex body K if \d is small enough. This improvs earlier results by Sch\"utt and Werner \cite{SW1994} and Stancu \cite{Stancu2009}.
