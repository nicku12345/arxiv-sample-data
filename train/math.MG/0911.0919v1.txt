The aim of this article is to prove a Lipschitz extension theorem for partially defined Lipschitz maps to jet spaces endowed with a left-invariant sub-Riemannian Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance. The jet spaces give a model for a certain class of Carnot groups, including in particular all Heisenberg groups. The proofs or our theorems are rather elementary, they are inspired by ideas in papers of Gromov, Young, and Lang-Schlichenmaier.
