The goal of the article is to prove that four explicitly given transformations, two Heisenberg translations, a rotation and an involution generate the Picard modular group with Gaussian integers acting on the two dimensional complex hyperbolic space. The result answers positively a question raised by A. Kleinschmidt and D. Persson.
