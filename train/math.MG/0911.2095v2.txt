We develop the concept of integral Menger curvature for a large class of nonsmooth surfaces. We prove uniform Ahlfors regularity and a C^{1,\lambda}-a-priori bound for surfaces for which this functional is finite. In fact, it turns out that there is an explicit length scale R>0 which depends only on an upper bound E for the integral Menger curvature M_p(\Sigma) and the integrability exponent p, and \emph{not} on the surface \Sigma itself; below that scale, each surface with energy smaller than E looks like a nearly flat disc with the amount of bending controlled by the (local) M_p-energy. Moreover, integral Menger curvature can be defined a priori for surfaces with self-intersections or branch points; we prove that a posteriori all such singularities are excluded for surfaces with finite integral Menger curvature. By means of slicing and iterative arguments we bootstrap the H\"{o}lder exponent \lambda up to the optimal one, \lambda=1-(8/p), thus establishing a new geometric `Morrey-Sobolev' imbedding theorem.   As two of the various possible variational applications we prove the existence of surfaces in given isotopy classes minimizing integral Menger curvature with a uniform bound on area, and of area minimizing surfaces subjected to a uniform bound on integral Menger curvature.
