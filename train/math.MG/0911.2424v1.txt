We show that if the joints of a bar and joint framework (G,p) are positioned as `generically' as possible subject to given symmetry constraints and (G,p) possesses a `fully-symmetric' infinitesimal flex (i.e., the velocity vectors of the infinitesimal flex remain unaltered under all symmetry operations of (G,p)), then (G,p) also possesses a finite flex which preserves the symmetry of (G,p) throughout the path. This and other related results are obtained by symmetrizing techniques described by L. Asimov and B. Roth in their paper `The Rigidity Of Graphs' from 1978 and by using the fact that the rigidity matrix of a symmetric framework can be transformed into a block-diagonalized form by means of group representation theory. The finite flexes that can be detected with these symmetry-based methods can in general not be found with the analogous non-symmetric methods.
