Let F \subset \R^n be a closed set and n=2 or n=3. S. Ferry (1975) proved that then, for almost all r>0, the level set (distance sphere, r-boundary) S_r(F):= \{x \in \R^n: \dist(x,F) = r\} is a topological (n-1)-dimensional manifold. This result was improved by J.H.G. Fu (1985). We show that Ferry's result is an easy consequence of the only fact that the distance function d(x)= \dist(x,F) is locally DC and has no stationary point in \R^n\setminus F. Using this observation, we show that Ferry's (and even Fu's) result extends to sufficiently smooth normed linear spaces X with \dim X \in \{2,3\} (e.g., to \ell^p_n, n=2,3, p\geq 2), which improves and generalizes a result of R. Gariepy and W.D. Pepe (1972). By the same method we also generalize Fu's result to Riemannian manifolds and improve a result of K. Shiohama and M. Tanaka (1996) on distance spheres in Alexandrov spaces.
