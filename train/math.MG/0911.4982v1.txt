Finding a good bound on the maximal edge diameter \Delta(d,n) of a polytope in terms of its dimension d and the number of its facets n is one of the basic open questions in polytope theory \cite{BG}. Although some bounds are known, the behaviour of the function \Delta(d,n) is largely unknown. The Hirsch conjecture, formulated in 1957 and reported in \cite{GD}, states that \Delta(d,n) is linear in n and d: \Delta(d,n) \leq n-d. The conjecture is known to hold in small dimensions, i.e., for d \leq 3 \cite{VK}, along with other specific pairs of d and n (Table \ref{before}). However, the asymptotic behaviour of \Delta(d,n) is not well understood: the best upper bound -- due to Kalai and Kleitman -- is quasi-polynomial \cite{GKDK}.   In this article we will show that \Delta(4,12)=7 and present strong evidence for \Delta(5,12)=\Delta(6,13)=7. The first of these new values is of particular interest since it indicates that the Hirsch bound is not sharp in dimension 4.
