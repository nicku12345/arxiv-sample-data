We consider the geometry of four spatial displacements, arranged in cyclic order, such that the relative motion between neighbouring displacements is a pure rotation. We compute the locus of points whose homologous images lie on a circle, the locus of oriented planes whose homologous images are tangent to a cone of revolution, and the locus of oriented lines whose homologous images form a skew quadrilateral on a hyperboloid of revolution.
