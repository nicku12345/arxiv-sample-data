In analogy with the Poisson algebra of the quadratic forms on the symplectic plane, and the notion of duality in the projective plane introduced by Arnold in \cite{Arn}, where the concurrence of the triangle altitudes is deduced from the Jacobi identity, we consider the Poisson algebras of the first degree harmonics on the sphere, the pseudo-sphere and on the hyperboloid, to obtain analogous duality notions and similar results for the spherical, pseudo-spherical and hyperbolic geometry. Such algebras, including the algebra of quadratic forms, are isomorphic, as Lie algebras, either to the Lie algebra of the vectors in \R^3, with vector product, or to algebra sl_2(\R). The Tomihisa identity, introduced in \cite{Tom} for the algebra of quadratic forms, holds for all these Poisson algebras and has a geometrical interpretation. The relation between the different definitions of duality in projective geometry inherited by these structures is shown.
