We answer two questions of Beardon and Minda that arose from their study of the conformal symmetries of circular regions in the complex plane. We show that a configuration of closed balls in the N-sphere is determined up to M\"{o}bius transformations by the signed inversive distances between pairs of its elements, except when the boundaries of the balls have a point in common, and that a configuration of points in the N-sphere is determined by the absolute cross-ratios of 4-tuples of its elements. The proofs use the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic (N+1)-space.
