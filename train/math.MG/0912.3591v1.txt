In this paper we study certain groups of bilipschitz maps of the boundary minus a point of a negatively curved space that is an abelian-by-cyclic solvable Lie group, where the extension is given by a matrix whose eigenvalues all lie outside of the unit circle. The case where the extension matrix is diagonal was previously studied by Dymarz. As an application, combined with work of Eskin-Fisher-Whyte and Peng, we provide the last steps in the proof of quasi-isometric rigidity for a class of lattices in solvable Lie groups.
