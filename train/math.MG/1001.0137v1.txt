In \cite{Mul} one-parameter planar motion was first introduced and the relations between absolute, relative, sliding velocities (and accelerations) in the Euclidean plane \mathbb{E}^2 were obtained. Moreover, the relations between the Complex velocities one-parameter motion in the Complex plane were provided by \cite{Mul}. One-parameter planar homothetic motion was defined in the Complex plane, \cite{Kur}. In this paper, analogous to homothetic motion in the Complex plane given by \cite{Kur}, one-parameter planar homothetic motion is defined in the Hyperbolic plane. Some characteristic properties about the velocity vectors, the acceleration vectors and the pole curves are given. Moreover, in the case of homothetic scale h identically equal to 1, the results given in \cite{Yuc} are obtained as a special case. In addition, three hyperbolic planes, of which two are moving and the other one is fixed, are taken into consideration and a canonical relative system for one-parameter planar hyperbolic homothetic motion is defined. Euler-Savary formula, which gives the relationship between the curvatures of trajectory curves, is obtained with the help of this relative system.
