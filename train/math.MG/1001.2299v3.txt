Let M_k be the complete, simply connected, Riemannian 2-manifold of constant curvature k \le 0. Let E be a closed, simply connected subspace of M_k with the property that every two points in E is connected by a rectifiable path in E. We show that under the induced path metric, E is a complete CAT(k) space. We also show that the natural notions of angle coming from the intrinsic and extrinsic metrics coincide for all simple geodesic triangles.
