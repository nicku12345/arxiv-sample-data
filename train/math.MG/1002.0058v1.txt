It is well known that the description of topological and geometric properties of bisectors in normed spaces is a non-trivial subject. In this paper we introduce the concept of bounded representation of bisectors in finite dimensional real Banach spaces. This useful notion combines the concepts of bisector and shadow boundary of the unit ball, both corresponding with the same spatial direction. The bounded representation visualizes the connection between the topology of bisectors and shadow boundaries (Lemma 1) and gives the possibility to simplify and to extend some known results on radial projections of bisectors. Our main result (Theorem 1) says that in the manifold case the topology of the closed bisector and the topology of its bounded representation are the same; they are closed, (n-1)-dimensional balls embedded in Euclidean n-space in the standard way.
