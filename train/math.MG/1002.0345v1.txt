The Fermat-Weber center of a planar body Q is a point in the plane from which the average distance to the points in Q is minimal. We first show that for any convex body Q in the plane, the average distance from the Fermat-Weber center of Q to the points of Q is larger than {1/6} \cdot \Delta(Q), where \Delta(Q) is the diameter of Q. This proves a conjecture of Carmi, Har-Peled and Katz. From the other direction, we prove that the same average distance is at most \frac{2(4-\sqrt3)}{13} \cdot \Delta(Q) < 0.3490 \cdot \Delta(Q). The new bound substantially improves the previous bound of \frac{2}{3 \sqrt3} \cdot \Delta(Q) \approx 0.3849 \cdot \Delta(Q) due to Abu-Affash and Katz, and brings us closer to the conjectured value of {1/3} \cdot \Delta(Q). We also confirm the upper bound conjecture for centrally symmetric planar convex bodies.
