The book contents: the notion of Myller configurations, Darboux frame, fundamental formulae and fundamental theorem of existence. The complete system of invariants allows to introduce the notions of Myller parallelism and concurrence as well as a famous Klein's formula. By way it is obtained an important generalization of the Levi-Civita parallelism. The applications to the theory of surfaces and nonholonomic manifolds end the book.
