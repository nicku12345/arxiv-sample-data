We show that a d-dimensional polyhedron S in \real^d can be represented by d-polynomial inequalities, that is, S = \{x \in \real^d : p_0(x) \ge 0, >..., p_{d-1}(x) \ge 0 \}, where p_0,...,p_{d-1} are appropriate polynomials. Furthermore, if an elementary closed semialgebraic set S is given by polynomials q_1,...,q_k and for each x \in S at most s of these polynomials vanish in x, then S can be represented by s+1 polynomials (and by s polynomials under the extra assumption that the number of points x \in S in which s q_i's vanish is finite).
