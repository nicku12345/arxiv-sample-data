We show that every (possibly unbounded) convex polygon P in R^2 with m edges can be represented by inequalities p_1 \ge 0,...,p_n \ge 0, where the p_i's are products of at most k affine functions each vanishing on an edge of P and n=n(m,k) satisfies s(m,k) \le n(m,k) \le (1+\epsilon_m) s(m,k) with s(m,k):=\max \{m/k,\log_2 m\} and \epsilon_m \to 0 as m \to \infty. This choice of n is asymptotically best possible. An analogous result on representing the interior of P in the form p_1 > 0,..., p_n > 0 is also given. For k \le m/\log_2 m these statements remain valid for representations with arbitrary polynomials of degree not exceeding k.
