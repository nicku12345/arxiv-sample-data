Let M be a subset of \mathbb{R}^k. It is an important question in the theory of linear inequalities to estimate the minimal number h=h(M) such that every system of linear inequalities which is infeasible over M has a subsystem of at most h inequalities which is already infeasible over M. This number h(M) is said to be the Helly number of M. In view of Helly's theorem, h(\mathbb{R}^n)=n+1 and, by the theorem due to Doignon, Bell and Scarf, h(\mathbb{Z}^d)=2^d. We give a common extension of these equalities showing that h(\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{Z}^d) = (n+1) 2^d. We show that the fractional Helly number of the space M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d (with the convexity structure induced by \mathbb{R}^d) is at most d+1 as long as h(M) is finite. Finally we give estimates for the Radon number of mixed integer spaces.
