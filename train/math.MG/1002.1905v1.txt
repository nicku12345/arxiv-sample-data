In this paper we describe a function F_n:{\bf R}_+ \to {\bf R}_{+} such that for any hyperbolic n-manifold M with totally geodesic boundary \partial M \neq \emptyset, the volume of M is equal to the sum of the values of F_n on the {\em orthospectrum} of M. We derive an integral formula for F_n in terms of elementary functions. We use this to give a lower bound for the volume of a hyperbolic n-manifold with totally geodesic boundary in terms of the area of the boundary.
