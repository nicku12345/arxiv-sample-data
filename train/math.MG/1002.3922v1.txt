A simple n-gon is a polygon with n edges with each vertex belonging to exactly two edges and every other point belonging to at most one edge. Brass asked the following question: For n \geq 5 odd, what is the maximum perimeter of a simple n-gon contained in a Euclidean unit disk?   In 2009, Audet, Hansen and Messine answered this question, and showed that the optimal configuration is an isosceles triangle with a multiple edge, inscribed in the disk. In this note we give a shorter and simpler proof of their result, which we generalize also for hyperbolic disks, and for spherical disks of sufficiently small radii.
