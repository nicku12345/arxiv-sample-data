A closed, convex set K in \mathbb{R}^2 with non-empty interior is called lattice-free if the interior of K is disjoint with \mathbb{Z}^2. In this paper we study the relation between the area and the lattice width of a planar lattice-free convex set in the general and centrally symmetric case. A correspondence between lattice width on the one hand and covering minima on the other, allows us to reformulate our results in terms of covering minima introduced by Kannan and Lov\'asz. We obtain a sharp upper bound for the area for any given value of the lattice width. The lattice-free convex sets satisfying the upper bound are characterized. Lower bounds are studied as well. Parts of our results are applied in a paper by the authors and Weismantel for cutting plane generation in mixed integer linear optimization, which was the original inducement for this paper. We further rectify a result of Kannan and Lov\'asz with a new proof.
