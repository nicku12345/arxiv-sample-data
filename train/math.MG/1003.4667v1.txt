In a Riemannian manifold a regular convex domain is said to be \lambda-convex if its normal curvature at each point is greater than or equal to \lambda. In a Hadamard manifold, the asymptotic behaviour of the quotient \vol(\Omega(t))/\vol(\partial\Omega(t)) for a family of \lambda-convex domains \Omega(t) expanding over the whole space has been studied and general bounds for this quotient are known. In this paper we improve this general result in the complex hyperbolic space \CH, a Hadamard manifold with constant holomorphic curvature equal to -4k^2. Furthermore, we give some specific properties of convex domains in \CH and we prove that \lambda-convex domains of arbitrary radius exists if \lambda\leq k.
