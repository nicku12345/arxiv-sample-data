The subject of this paper is the history of the Minkowski-Funk Transform. After introducing the Minkowski-Funk Transform as well as its dual transform and a generalization of both, we will present an inversion formula of the Minkowski-Funk Transform. Then we will discuss the history of this problem: related work by Minkowski and Funk and the connection between their work.
