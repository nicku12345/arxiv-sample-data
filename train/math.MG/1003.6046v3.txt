Let A be an expanding integer n\times n matrix and D be a finite subset of Z^n. The self-affine set T=T(A,D) is the unique compact set satisfying the equality A(T)=\cup_{d\in D} (T+d). We present an effective algorithm to compute the Lebesgue measure of the self-affine set T, the measure of intersection T\cap (T+u) for u\in Z^n, and the measure of intersection of self-affine sets T(A,D_1)\cap T(A,D_2) for different sets D_1,D_2\subset Z^n.
