In this paper we prove that the asymptotic dimension of a finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complex is bounded above by the dimension. To achieve this we prove a controlled colouring theorem for the complex. We also show that every CAT(0) cube complex is a contractive retraction of an infinite dimensional cube. As an example of the dimension theorem we obtain bounds on the asymptotic dimension of small cancellation groups.
