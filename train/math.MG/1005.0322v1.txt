The main theorem of this paper establishes conditions under which the "chaos game" algorithm almost surely yields the attractor of an iterated function system. The theorem holds in a very general setting, even for non contractive iterated function systems, and under weaker conditions on the random orbit of the chaos game than obtained previously.
