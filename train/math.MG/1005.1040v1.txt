We give a definition of convergence of differential of Lipschitz functions with respect to measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology. As their applications, we give a characterization of harmonic functions with polynomial growth on asymptotic cones of manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth, and distributional Laplacian comparison theorem on limit spaces of Riemannian manifolds.
