Braided sets which are also spaces with dilations are presented and explored in this paper, in the general frame of emergent algebras arxiv:0907.1520. Examples of such spaces are the sub-riemannian symmetric spaces. Keywords: braided sets, quandles; emergent algebras; dilatation structures (spaces with dilations); sub-riemannian symmetric spaces.
