It is proven that for any system of n points z_1, ..., z_n on the (complex) unit circle, there exists another point z of norm 1, such that   \sum 1/|z-z_k|^2 \leq n^2/4. Equality holds iff the point system is a rotated copy of the nth unit roots.   Two proofs are presented: one uses a characterisation of equioscillating rational functions, while the other is based on Bernstein's inequality.
