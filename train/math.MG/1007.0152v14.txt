Sectors at centre of affine quadrics with point symmetry are investigated over arbitrary fields of characteristic different from two. As an application we demonstrate nice formulas for the area and the volume of such planar and spatial sectors, respectively, in euclidean space. It seems that up to now there has been atmost little research in this field up to very special cases.
