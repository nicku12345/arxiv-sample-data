Fractal Lipschitz-Killing curvature measures C^f_k(F,.), k = 0, ..., d, are determined for a large class of self-similar sets F in R^d. They arise as weak limits of the appropriately rescaled classical Lipschitz-Killing curvature measures C_k(F_r,.) from geometric measure theory of parallel sets F_r for small distances r>0. Due to self-similarity the limit measures appear to be constant multiples of the normalized Hausdorff measures on F, and the constants agree with the corresponding total fractal curvatures C^f_k(F). This provides information on the 'second order' geometric fine structure of such fractals.
