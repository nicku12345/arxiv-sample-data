Three circles define each of the Brocard points of a triangle. If one adds the three circles through a pair of vertices and the orthocentre one has nine circles. It is described how each of the nine centres of these circles lies at the vertex of two triangles producing six triangles. These triangles are each similar to the original triangle, three being directly similar and three indirectly similar. These latter three are mutually in perspective with the circumcentre as perspector.
