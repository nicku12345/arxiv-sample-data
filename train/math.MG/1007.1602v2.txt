An n-simplex is called circumscriptible (or edge-incentric) if there is a sphere tangent to all its n(n + 1)/2 edges. We obtain a closed formula for the radius of the circumscribed sphere of the circumscriptible n-simplex, and also prove a double inequality involving the circumradius and the edge-inradius of such simplices. Among this inequality settles affirmatively a part of a problem posed by the authors.
