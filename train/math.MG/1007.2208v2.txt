The definition of n-width of a bounded subset A in a normed linear space X is based on the existence of n-dimensional subspaces. Although the concept of an n-dimensional subspace is not available for metric trees, in this paper, using the properties of convex and compact subsets, we present a notion of n-widths for a metric tree, called Tn-widths. Later we discuss properties of Tn-widths, and show that the compact width is attained. A relationship between the compact widths and Tn-widths is also obtained.
