This concerns theory first developed by Hagge and Speckman in the Edwardian era. Speckman investigated triangles that were simultaneously in perspective and indirectly similar. On the other hand Hagge studied circles that pass through the orthocentre of a given triangle. Superficially these subjects look unrelated, but this is not the case, as we describe.
