Given \Delta ABC and angles \alpha,\beta,\gamma\in(0,\pi) with \alpha+\beta+\gamma=\pi, we study the properties of the triangle DEF which satisfies: (i) D\in BC, E\in AC, F\in AB, (ii) \aangle D=\alpha, \aangle E=\beta, \aangle F=\gamma, (iii) \Delta DEF has the minimal area in the class of triangles satisfying (i) and (ii). In particular, we show that minimizer \Delta DEF, exists, is unique and is a pedal triangle, corresponding to a certain pedal point P. Permuting the roles played by the angles \alpha,\beta,\gamma in (ii), yields a total of six such area-minimizing triangles, which are pedal relative to six pedal points, say, P_1,....,P_6. The main result of the paper is the fact that there exists a circle which contains all six points.
