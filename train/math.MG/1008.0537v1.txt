The ten pairs of directly similar triangles in perspective in the Wood-Desargues' configuration have ten common Hagge circle centres. These centres are known to lie one each of the ten perspectrices. It is shown in this paper that these centres also lie at the vertices of five cyclic quadrangles, which are similar to the five cyclic quadrangles of the initial Wood-Desargues' configuration and that these five new cyclic quadrangles have a common circumradius.
