Isaak Moiseevich Yaglom deduced complete classification of geometric spaces. In this work, supposed to your attention, author formalizes Yaglom's approach and constructs uniform theory of geometric spaces on analytic level. Among its advantages there are its universality and the fact it is easy to use. It isn't limited to specific dimension. The theory becomes the background of the GeomSpace project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/geomspace/).
