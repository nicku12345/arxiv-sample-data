A theorem of Laman gives a combinatorial characterisation of the graphs that admit a realisation as a minimally rigid generic bar-joint framework in \bR^2. A more general theory is developed for frameworks in \bR^3 whose vertices are constrained to move on a two-dimensional smooth submanifold \M. Furthermore, when \M is a union of concentric spheres, or a union of parallel planes or a union of concentric cylinders, necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions are obtained for the minimal rigidity of generic frameworks.
