Let Delta be a random spherical triangle (meaning that vertices are independent and uniform on the unit sphere). A closed-form expression for the area density of Delta has been known since 1867; a complicated integral expression for the perimeter density was found in 1994. Does there exist a closed-form expression for the latter? We attempt to answer this question from several directions. An outcome of our work is the exact value of the perimeter density at the point pi.
