For a large class of self-similar sets F in R^d analogues of the higher order mean curvatures of differentiable submanifolds are introduced, in particular, the fractal Gauss-type curvature. They are shown to be the densities of associated fractal curvature measures, which are all multiples of the corresponding Hausdorff measures on F, due to its self-similarity. This local approach based on ergodic theory for an associated dynamical system enables us to extend former global curvature results.
