In 1999, Bates, Johnson, Lindenstrauss, Preiss and Schechtman asked whether a Banach space that is a uniform quotient of \ell_p, 1 < p \neq 2 < \infty, must be isomorphic to a linear quotient of \ell_p. We apply the geometric property (\beta) of Rolewicz to the study of uniform and Lipschitz quotient maps, and answer the above question positively for the case 1<p<2. We also give a necessary condition for a Banach space to have c_0 as a uniform quotient.
