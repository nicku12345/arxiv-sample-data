Improving a result of K\'arolyi, Pach and T\'oth, we construct an arrangement of n segments in the plane with at most n^{\log{8} / \log{169}} pairwise crossing or pairwise disjoint segments. We use the recursive method based on flattenable arrangements which was established by Larman, Matou\v{s}ek, Pach and T\"or\H{o}csik. We also show that not every arrangement can be flattened, by constructing an intersection graph of segments which cannot be realized by an arrangement of segments crossing a common line. Moreover, we also construct an intersection graph of segments crossing a common line which cannot be realized by a flattenable arrangement.
