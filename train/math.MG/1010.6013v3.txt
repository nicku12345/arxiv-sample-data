N. Dolbilin and M. Tanemura studied the convex hulls of finite subsets of the Clifford torus T in E^4. They have completely studied the combinatorial structure of the convex hull for a periodic point set. Moreover, there was performed a numerical simulation of the convex hull for the Poisson point process on T that showed that the mean valence of a vertex of the convex hull has asymptotics O^*(\ln \lambda) where \lambda is the rate of the process.   N. Dolbilin suggested the author to prove the conjecture on the logarithmic growth of the mean degree of a vertex.   In this paper we prove this conjecture and some related theorems.
