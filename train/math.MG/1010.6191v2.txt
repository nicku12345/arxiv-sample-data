We will prove the following generalization of the ham sandwich Theorem, conjectured by Imre B\'ar\'any. Given a positive integer k and d nice measures \mu_1, \mu_2,..., \mu_d in \mathbb{R}^d such that \mu_i (\mathds{R}^d) = k for all i, there is a partition of \mathbb{R}^d in k interior-disjoint convex parts C_1, C_2,..., C_k such that \mu_i (C_j) = 1 for all i,j. If k=2 this gives the ham sandwich Theorem.
