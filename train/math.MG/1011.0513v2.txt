If a sequence of Riemannian manifolds, X_i, converges in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a limit space, X_\infty, and if E_i are vector bundles over X_i endowed with metrics of Sasaki-type with a uniform upper bound on rank, then a subsequence of the E_i converges in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a metric space, E_\infty. The projection maps \pi_i converge to a limit submetry \pi_\infty and the fibers converge to its fibers; the latter may no longer be vector spaces but are homeomorphic to \R^k/G, where G is a closed subgroup of O(k) ---called the {\em wane group}--- that depends on the basepoint and that is defined using the holonomy groups on the vector bundles. The norms \mu_i=\|\cdot\|_i converges to a map \mu_{\infty} compatible with the re-scaling in \R^k/G and the \R-action on E_i converges to an \R-action on E_{\infty} compatible with the limiting norm.   In the special case when the sequence of vector bundles has a uniform lower bound on holonomy radius (as in a sequence of collapsing flat tori to a circle), the limit fibers are vector spaces. Under the opposite extreme, e.g. when a single compact n-dimensional manifold is re-scaled to a point, the limit fiber is \R^n/H where H is the closure of the holonomy group of the compact manifold considered.   An appropriate notion of parallelism is given to the limiting spaces by considering curves whose length is unchanged under the projection. The class of such curves is invariant under the \R-action and each such curve preserves norms. The existence of parallel translation along rectifiable curves with arbitrary initial conditions is also exhibited. Uniqueness is not true in general, but a necessary condition is given in terms of the aforementioned wane groups G.
