Author developed a uniform model for different spaces where distance and angle measure kinds are parameters. This model is calculus centric, but can also be used in theoretical research. It is useful in the following domains: deduction of uniform equations among geometric spaces, uniform model applied to any space, which provides an easy way to calculate distances, plane and dihedral angles of any dimension, areas and volumes as well as parallel (where applied) and orthogonal property detection, study of not yet described spaces and more.
