The relationship between the coincidence indices of a lattice \Gamma_1 and a sublattice \Gamma_2 of \Gamma_1 is examined via the colouring of \Gamma_1 that is obtained by assigning a unique colour to each coset of \Gamma_2. In addition, the idea of colour symmetry, originally defined for symmetries of lattices, is extended to coincidence isometries of lattices. An example involving the Ammann-Beenker tiling is provided to illustrate the results in the quasicrystal setting.
