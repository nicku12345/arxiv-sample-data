The {\sc c-Balanced Separator} problem is a graph-partitioning problem in which given a graph G, one aims to find a cut of minimum size such that both the sides of the cut have at least cn vertices. In this paper, we present new directions of progress in the {\sc c-Balanced Separator} problem. More specifically, we propose a family of mathematical programs, that depend upon a parameter p > 0, and is an extension of the uniform version of the SDPs proposed by Goemans and Linial for this problem. In fact for the case, when p=1, if one can solve this program in polynomial time then simply using the Goemans-Williamson's randomized rounding algorithm for {\sc Max Cut} \cite{WG95} will give an O(1)-factor approximation algorithm for {\sc c-Balanced Separator} improving the best known approximation factor of O(\sqrt{\log n}) due to Arora, Rao and Vazirani \cite{ARV}. This family of programs is not convex but one can transform them into so called \emph{\textbf{concave programs}} in which one optimizes a concave function over a convex feasible set. It is well known that the optima of such programs lie at one of the extreme points of the feasible set \cite{TTT85}. Our main contribution is a combinatorial characterization of some extreme points of the feasible set of the mathematical program, for p=1 case, which to the best of our knowledge is the first of its kind. We further demonstrate how this characterization can be used to solve the program in a restricted setting. Non-convex programs have recently been investigated by Bhaskara and Vijayaraghvan \cite{BV11} in which they design algorithms for approximating Matrix p-norms although their algorithmic techniques are analytical in nature.
