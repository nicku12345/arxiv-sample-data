I try to give mathematical evidence to the following equivalence, which is based on ideas from Plato (Timaeus): reality emerges from a more primitive, non-geometrical, reality in the same way as the brain construct (understands, simulates, transforms, encodes or decodes) the image of reality, starting from intensive properties (like a bunch of spiking signals sent by receptors in the retina), without any use of extensive (i.e. spatial or geometric) properties.
