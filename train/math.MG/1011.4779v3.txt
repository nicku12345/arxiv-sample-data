We compare two approaches to Ricci curvature on non-smooth spaces, in the case of the discrete hypercube \{0,1\}^N. While the coarse Ricci curvature of the first author readily yields a positive value for curvature, the displacement convexity property of Lott, Sturm and the second author could not be fully implemented. Yet along the way we get new results of a combinatorial and probabilistic nature, including a curved Brunn--Minkowski inequality on the discrete hypercube.
