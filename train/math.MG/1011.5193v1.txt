We demonstrate the construction of several families of flexible polyhedra by extending Bricard octahedra to form larger composite flexible polyhedra. These flexible polyhedra are of genus 0 and 1, have dihedral angles that are non-constant under flexion, exhibit self-intersections and are of indefinite size, the smallest of which is a decahedron with seven vertexes.
