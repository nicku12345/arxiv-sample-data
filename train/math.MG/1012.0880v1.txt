This article provides a simple pictorial introduction to universal hyperbolic geometry. We explain how to understand the subject using only elementary projective geometry, augmented by a distinguished circle. This provides a completely algebraic framework for hyperbolic geometry, valid over the rational numbers (and indeed any field not of characteristic two), and gives us many new and beautiful theorems. These results are accurately illustrated with colour diagrams, and the reader is invited to check them with ruler constructions and measurements.
