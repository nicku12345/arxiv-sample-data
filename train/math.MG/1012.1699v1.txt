The paper initiates a systematic study of Moebius structures and Ptolemy spaces. We conjecture that every compact Ptolemy space with circles and many space inversions is Moebius equivalent to the boundary at infinity of a rank one symmetric space of noncompact type. We prove this conjecture for the class of complex hyperbolic spaces as our main result.
