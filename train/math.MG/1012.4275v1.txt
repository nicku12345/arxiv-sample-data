We define twelve variants of a Reifenberg's affine approximation property, which are known to be connected with the singular sets of minimal surfaces. With this motivation we investigate the regularity of the sets possessing these. We classify the properties with respect to whether j-dimensional Hausdorff dimension, locally finite j-dimensional Hausdorff measure or countable j-rectifiability hold. In showing that varying levels of regularity hold for the differing properties, quasi-self-similar sets, interesting in their own right, are constructed as counter examples. These counter examples also admit a connection to number theory via the use of the normal number theorem. Additionally, the intriguing result that such complexity in the counter examples is actually a necessity is shown.
