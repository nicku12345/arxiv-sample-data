Let Q_n denote the n-dimensional hypercube with the vertex set V_n=\{0,1}^n. A 0/1-polytope of Q_n is a convex hull of a subset of V_n. This paper is concerned with the enumeration of equivalence classes of full-dimensional 0/1-polytopes under the symmetries of the hypercube. With the aid of a computer program, Aichholzer completed the enumeration of equivalence classes of full-dimensional 0/1-polytopes for Q_4, Q_5, and those of Q_6 up to 12 vertices. In this paper, we present a method to compute the number of equivalence classes of full-dimensional 0/1-polytopes of Q_n with more than 2^{n-3} vertices. As an application, we finish the counting of equivalence classes of full-dimensional 0/1-polytopes of Q_6 with more than 12 vertices.
