Let P be a finite simplicial comple with underlying space (union of simplices in P) |P|. Let Q be a subcomplex of P. Let a \geq 0. Then there exists K < \infty, \emph{depending only on a and Q,} with the following property. Let \mathcal{S} \subset |P| be closed and suppose \Phi is a continuous map of |P| \setminus \mathcal{S} into some topological space \mathcal{F}. Suppose \dim (\tilde{\mathcal{S}} \cap |Q|) \leq a, where "\dim" = Hausdorff dimension. Then there exists \tilde{\mathcal{S}} \subset |P| such that \tilde{\mathcal{S}} \cap |Q| is the underlying space of a subcomplex of Q and there is a continuous map \tilde{\Phi} of |P| \setminus \tilde{\mathcal{S}} into \mathcal{F} such that \mathcal{H}^{a} \bigl(\tilde{\mathcal{S}} \cap |Q| \bigr) \leq K \mathcal{H}^{a} \bigl(\mathcal{S} \cap |Q| \bigr), where \mathcal{H}^{a} denotes a-dimensional Hausdorff measure; if x \in \tilde{\mathcal{S}} then x belongs to a simplex in P intersecting \mathcal{S}; if x \in |P| \setminus \mathcal{S}, x \in \sigma \in P, and \sigma does not intersect any simplex in Q whose simplicial interior intersects \mathcal{S}, then \tilde{\Phi}(x) is defined and equals = \Phi(x); if \sigma \in P then \tilde{\Phi}(\sigma \setminus \tilde{\mathcal{S}}) \subset \Phi(\sigma \setminus \mathcal{S}); and if \mathcal{F} is a metric space and \Phi is locally Lipschitz on |P| \setminus \mathcal{S} then \tilde{\Phi} is locally Lipschitz on |P| \setminus \tilde{\mathcal{S}} Moreover, P can be replaced by an arbitrarily fine subdivision without changing K.
