We show that for every nondecreasing concave function w:R+ --> R+ with w(0)=0, either every finite metric space embeds with distortion arbitrarily close to 1 into a metric space of the form (X,w o d) for some metric d on X, or there exists a=a(w)>0 and n_0=n_0(w)\in N such that for all n>n_0, any embedding of {0,...,n} into a metric space of the form (X,w o d) incurs distortion at least n^a.
