We prove that every quasisymmetric self-homeomorphism of the standard 1/3-Sierpi\'nski carpet S_3 is a Euclidean isometry. For carpets in a more general family, the standard 1/p-Sierpi\'nski carpets S_p, p\ge 3 odd, we show that the groups of quasisymmetric self-maps are finite dihedral. We also establish that S_p and S_q are quasisymmetrically equivalent only if p=q. The main tool in the proof for these facts is a new invariant---a certain discrete modulus of a path family---that is preserved under quasisymmetric maps of carpets.
