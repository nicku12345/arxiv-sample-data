Spectrahedra are linear sections of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices that, as convex bodies, generalize the class of polyhedra. In this paper we investigate the problem of recognizing when a spectrahedron is polyhedral. We reprove a result of Ramana (1998) regarding the structure of spectrahedra and we devise a normal form of representations of spectrahedra. This normal form is effectively computable and leads to an algorithm for deciding polyhedrality.
