The paper contains the following results and observations: (1) There exists a sequence of unweighted graphs \{G_n\}_n with maximum degree 3 such that a Banach space X has no nontrivial cotype iff \{G_n\}_n admit uniformly bilipschitz embeddings into X; (2) The same for Banach spaces with no nontrivial type; (3) A sequence \{G_n\} characterizing Banach spaces with no nontrivial cotype in the sense described above can be chosen to be a sequence of bounded degree expanders; (4) The infinite diamond does not admit a bilipschitz embedding into Banach spaces with the Radon-Nikod\'{y}m property; (5) A new proof of the Cheeger-Kleiner result: The Laakso space does not admit a bilipschitz embedding into Banach spaces with the Radon-Nikod\'{y}m property; (6) A new proof of the Johnson-Schechtman result: uniform bilipschitz embeddability of finite diamonds into a Banach space implies its nonsuperreflexivity.
