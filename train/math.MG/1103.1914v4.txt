Symmetry equations are obtained for the rigidity matrices associated with various forms of infinitesimal flexibility for an idealised bond-node crystal framework \C in \bR^d. These equations are used to derive symmetry-adapted Maxwell-Calladine counting formulae for periodic self-stresses and affinely periodic infinitesimal mechanisms. The symmetry equations also lead to general Fowler-Guest formulae connecting the character lists of subrepresentations of the crystallographic space and point groups which are associated with bonds, nodes, stresses, flexes and rigid motions. A new derivation is also given for the Borcea-Streinu rigidity matrix and the correspondence between its nullspace and the space of affinely periodic infinitesimal flexes.
