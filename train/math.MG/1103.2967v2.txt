The simple graphs G=(V,E) that satisfy |E'|\leq 2|V'|-l for any subgraph (and for l=1,2,3) are the (2,l)-sparse graphs. Those that also satisfy |E|=2|V|-l are the (2,l)-tight graphs. These can be characterised by their decompositions into two edge disjoint spanning subgraphs of various types. The Henneberg--Laman theorem characterises (2,3)-tight graphs inductively in terms of two simple moves, known as the Henneberg moves. Recently this has been extended, via the addition of a graph extension move, to the case of (2,2)-tight graphs. Here an alternative characterisation is provided by means of vertex-to-K_4 and edge-to-K_3 moves, and this is extended to the (2,1)-tight graphs by addition of an edge joining move. Similar characterisations of (2,l)-sparse graphs are also provided.
