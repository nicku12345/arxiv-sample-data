L^p-cohomology of rank one symmetric spaces of noncompact type is shown to be Hausdorff for values of p where this does not follow from curvature pinching. Using the multiplicative structure on L^p-cohomology, it is shown that no simply connected Riemannian manifold with strictly -1/4-pinched sectional curvature can be quasiisometric to complex hyperbolic plane. Unfortunately, the method does not extend to other rank one symmetric spaces.
