Let K be a convex body in \R^d, let j\in\{1, ..., d-1\}, and let \varrho be a positive and continuous probability density function with respect to the (d-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure on the boundary \partial K of K. Denote by K_n the convex hull of n points chosen randomly and independently from \partial K according to the probability distribution determined by \varrho. For the case when \partial K is a C^2 submanifold of \R^d with everywhere positive Gauss curvature, M. Reitzner proved an asymptotic formula for the expectation of the difference of the jth intrinsic volumes of K and K_n, as n\to\infty. In this article, we extend this result to the case when the only condition on K is that a ball rolls freely in K.
