We prove that each coarsely homogenous separable metric space X is coarsely equivalent to one of the spaces: the sigleton, the Cantor macro-cube or the Baire macro-space. This classification is derived from coarse characterizations of the Cantor macro-cube and of the Baire macro-space given in this paper. Namely, we prove that a separable metric space X is coarsely equivalent to the Baire macro-space if any only if X has asymptotic dimension zero and has unbounded geometry in the sense that for every \delta there is \epsilon such that no \epsilon-ball in X can be covered by finitely many sets of diameter \le \delta.
