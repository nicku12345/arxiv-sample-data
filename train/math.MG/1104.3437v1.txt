For a compact right-angled polyhedron R in \mathbb H^3 denote by \operatorname{vol} (R) the volume and by \operatorname{vert} (R) the number of vertices. Upper and lower bounds for \operatorname{vol} (R) in terms of \operatorname{vert} (R) were obtained in \cite{A09}. Constructing a 2-parameter family of polyhedra, we show that the asymptotic upper bound 5 v_3 / 8, where v_3 is the volume of the ideal regular tetrahedron in \mathbb H^3, is a double limit point for ratios \operatorname{vol} (R) / \operatorname{vert} (R). Moreover, we improve the lower bound in the case \operatorname{vert} (R) \leqslant 56.
