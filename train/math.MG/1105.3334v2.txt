In this note we prove two ellipsoid characterization theorems. The first one is that if K is a convex body in a normed space with unit ball M, and for any point p \notin K and in any 2-dimensional plane P intersecting \inter K and containing p, there are two tangent segments of the same normed length from p to K, then K and M are homothetic ellipsoids. Furthermore, we show that if M is the unit ball of a strictly convex, smooth norm, and in this norm billiard angular bisectors coincide with Busemann angular bisectors or Glogovskij angular bisectors, then M is an ellipse.
