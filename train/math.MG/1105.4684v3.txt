Suppose that E and E' denote real Banach spaces with dimension at least 2, that D\varsubsetneq E and D'\varsubsetneq E' are domains, that f: D\to D' is an (M,C)-CQH homeomorphism, and that D is uniform. The main aim of this paper is to prove that D' is a uniform domain if and only if f extends to a homeomorphism \bar{f}: \bar{D}\to \bar{D}' and \bar{f} is \eta-QM relative to \partial D. This result shows that the answer to one of the open problems raised by V\"ais\"al\"a from 1991 is affirmative.
