We determine the Hausdorff and box dimension of the fractal graphs for a general class of Weierstrass-type functions of the form f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \, g(b_n x + \theta_n), where g is a periodic Lipschitz real function and a_{n+1}/a_n \to 0, b_{n+1}/b_n \to \infty as n \to \infty. Moreover, for any H, B \in [1, 2], H \leq B we provide examples of such functions with \dim_H(\graph f) = \underline{\dim}_B(\graph f) = H, \bar{\dim}_B(\graph f) = B.
