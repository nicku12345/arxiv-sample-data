A connection between real poles of the growth functions for Coxeter groups acting on hyperbolic space of dimensions three and greater and algebraic integers is investigated. In particular, a geometric convergence of fundamental domains for cocompact hyperbolic Coxeter groups with finite-volume limiting polyhedron provides a relation between Salem numbers and Pisot numbers. Several examples conclude this work.
