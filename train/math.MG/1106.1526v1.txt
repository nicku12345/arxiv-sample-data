For convex sets K and L in {\mathbb{R}}^d we define R_L(K) to be the convex hull of all points belonging to K but not to the interior of L. Cutting-plane methods from integer and mixed-integer optimization can be expressed in geometric terms using functionals R_L with appropriately chosen sets L. We describe the geometric properties of R_L(K) and characterize those L for which R_L maps polyhedra to polyhedra. For certain natural classes {\mathcal{L}} of convex sets in {\mathbb{R}}^d we consider the functional R_{\mathcal{L}} given by R_{\mathcal{L}}(K):= \bigcap_{L \in {\mathcal{L}}}R_L(K). The functional R_{\mathcal{L}} can be used to define various types of closure operations considered in the theory of cutting planes (such as the Chv\'atal closure, the split closure as well as generalized split closures recently introduced by Andersen, Louveaux and Weismantel). We study conditions on {\mathcal{L}} under which R_{\mathcal{L}} maps rational polyhedra to rational polyhedra. We also describe the limit of the sequence of sets obtained by iterative application of R_{\mathcal{L}} to K. A part of the presented material gives generalized formulations and unified proofs of several recent results obtained by various authors.
