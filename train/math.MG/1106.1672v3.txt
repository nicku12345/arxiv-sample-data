Let \mathbf{TB} be the category of totally bounded, locally compact metric spaces with the C_0 coarse structures. We show that if X and Y are in \mathbf{TB} then X and Y are coarsely equivalent if and only if their Higson coronas are homeomorphic. In fact, the Higson corona functor gives an equivalence of categories \mathbf{TB}\to\mathbf{K}, where \mathbf{K} is the category of compact metrizable spaces. We use this fact to show that the continuously controlled coarse structure on a locally compact space X induced by some metrizable compactification \tilde{X} is determined only by the topology of the remainder \tilde{X}\setminus X.
