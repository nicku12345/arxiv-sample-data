Given a compact Alexadrov n-space Z with curvature curv \ge \kappa, and let f: Z\to X be a distance non-increasing onto map to another Alexandrov n-space with curv \ge \kappa. The relative volume rigidity conjecture says that if X achieves the relative maximal volume i.e. vol(Z)=vol(X), then X is isometric to Z/\sim, where z, z'\in\partial Z and z\sim z' if only if f(z)=f(z'). We will partially verify this conjecture, and give a classification for compact Alexandrov n-spaces with relatively maximal volume. We will also give an elementary proof for a pointed version of Bishop-Gromov relative volume comparison with rigidity in Alexandrov geometry.
