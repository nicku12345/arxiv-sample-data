The basic object of the paper is the moduli space M_{2,3}(L) of a closed polygonal linkage either in \mathbb{R}^2 or in \mathbb{R}^3. As was originally suggested by G. Khimshiashvili, the space M_{2}(L) is equipped with the oriented area function A, whereas (as is suggested in the paper) M_{3}(L) is equipped with the vector area function S. The latter are generically Morse functions, whose critical points have a nice description. In the preprint, we define a \textit{swap action} (that is, the action of some group generated by edge transpositions) on the space M_{2,3}(L) which preserves the functions A and S and the Morse points. We prove that the commutant of the group acts trivially, present some computer experiments and formulate a conjecture.
