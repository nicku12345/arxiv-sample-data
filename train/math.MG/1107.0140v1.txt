For any two configurations of ordered points p=(p_{1},...,\p_{N}) and q=(q_{1},...,q_{N}) in Euclidean space E^d such that q is an expansion of p, there exists a continuous expansion from p to q in dimension 2d; Bezdek and Connelly used this to prove the Kneser-Poulsen conjecture for the planar case. In this paper, we show that this construction is optimal in the sense that for any d \ge 2 there exists configurations of (d+1)^2 points p and q in E^d such that q is an expansion of p but there is no continuous expansion from p to q in dimension less than 2d. The techniques used in our proof are completely elementary.
