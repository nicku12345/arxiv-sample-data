We show that for every large enough integer N, there exists an N-point subset of L_1 such that for every D>1, embedding it into \ell_1^d with distortion D requires dimension d at least N^{\Omega(1/D^2)}, and that for every \eps>0 and large enough integer N, there exists an N-point subset of L_1 such that embedding it into \ell_1^d with distortion 1+\eps requires dimension d at least N^{1-O(1/\log(1/\eps))}. These results were previously proven by Brinkman and Charikar [JACM, 2005] and by Andoni, Charikar, Neiman, and Nguyen [FOCS 2011]. We provide an alternative and arguably more intuitive proof based on an entropy argument.
