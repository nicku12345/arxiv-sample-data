We discuss a general formula for the area of the surface that is generated by a graph [t_0, t_1] \to \mathbb R^2 sending t \mapsto \bigl(x(t), y(t) \bigr) revolved around a general line L: A x + B y = C. As a corollary, we obtain a formula for the area of the surface formed by revolving y = f(x) around the line y = m x + k.
