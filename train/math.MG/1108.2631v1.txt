We prove a generalization of the hyperplane inequality for intersection bodies, where volume is replaced by an arbitrary measure \mu with even continuous density and sections are of arbitrary dimension n-k,\ 1\le k <n. If K is a generalized k-intersection body, then \mu(K)\,\leq\,\frac{n}{n-k}c_{n,k}\max_{H} \mu(K\cap H) \vol_n(K)^{k/n}. Here c_{n,k} = |B_2^n|^{(n-k)/n}/|B_2^{n-k}|<1, |B_2^n| is the volume of the unit Euclidean ball, and maximum is taken over all (n-k)-dimensional subspaces of \R^n. The constant is optimal, and for each intersection body the inequality holds for every k. We also prove a stronger "difference" inequality. The proof is based on stability in the lower dimensional Busemann-Petty problem for arbitrary measures in the following sense. Let \e>0,\ 1\le k <n. Suppose that K and L are origin-symmetric star bodies in \R^n, and K is a generalized k-intersection body. If for every (n-k)-dimensional subspace H of \R^n \mu(K\cap H)\leq \mu(L\cap H)+\e, then \mu(K)\leq \mu(L) +\frac{n}{n-k}c_{n,k} \vol_n(K)^{k/n}\e.
