Let p be a real number greater than one and let \Gamma be a graph of bounded degree. We investigate links between the p-harmonic boundary of \Gamma and the D_p-massive subsets of \Gamma. In particular, if there are n pairwise disjoint D_p-massive subsets of \Gamma, then the p-harmonic boundary of \Gamma consists of at least n elements. We also show that the converse of this statement is also true.
