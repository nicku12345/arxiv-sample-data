In this paper we consider an extremal problem in geometry. Let \lambda be a real number and A, B and C be arbitrary points on the unit circle \Gamma. We give full characterization of the extremal behavior of the function f(M,\lambda)=MA^\lambda+MB^\lambda+MC^\lambda, where M is a point on the unit circle as well. We also investigate the extremal behavior of \sum_{i=1}^nXP_i, where P_i, i=1,...,n are the vertices of a regular n-gon and X is a point on \Gamma, concentric to the circle circumscribed around P_1...P_n. We use elementary analytic and purely geometric methods in the proof.
