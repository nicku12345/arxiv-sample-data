We construct p-adic analogs of operator colligations and their characteristic functions. Consider a p-adic group G=GL(\alpha+k\infty, Q_p), its subgroup L=O(k\infty,Z_p), and the subgroup K=O(\infty,Z_p) embedded to L diagonally. We show that double cosets \Gamma= K\setminus G/K admit a structure of a semigroup, \Gamma acts naturally in K-fixed vectors of unitary representations of G. For each double coset we assign a 'characteristic function', which sends a certain Bruhat--Tits building to another building (buildings are finite-dimensional); image of the distinguished boundary is contained in the distinguished boundary. The latter building admits a structure of (Nazarov) semigroup, the product in \Gamma corresponds to a point-wise product of characteristic functions.
