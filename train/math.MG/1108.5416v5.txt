In this paper we explore the idea that Teichm\"uller space is hyperbolic "on average." Our approach focuses on studying the geometry of geodesics which spend a definite proportion of time in some thick part of Teichm\"uller space. We consider several different measures on Teichm\"uller space and find that this behavior for geodesics is indeed typical. With respect to each of these measures, we show that the average distance between points in a ball of radius r is asymptotic to 2r, which is as large as possible. Our techniques also lead to a statement quantifying the expected thinness of random triangles in Teichm\"uller space, showing that "most triangles are mostly thin."
