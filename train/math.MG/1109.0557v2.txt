For a given triangle T and a real number \rho we define Ceva's triangle \CT_\rho(T) to be the triangle formed by three cevians each joining a vertex of T to the point which divides the opposite side in the ratio \rho:(1-\rho). We identify the smallest interval \nM_T \subset \nR such that the family \CT_\rho(T), \rho\in \nM_T, contains all Ceva's triangles up to similarity. We prove that the composition of operators \CT_\rho, \rho \in \nR, acting on triangles is governed by a certain group structure on \nR. We use this structure to prove that two triangles have the same Brocard angle if and only if a congruent copy of one of them can be recovered by sufficiently many iterations of two operators \CT_\rho and \CT_\xi acting on the other triangle.
