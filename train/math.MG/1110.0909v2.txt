We give a lower bound for the \ell^p-distortion c_p(X) of finite graphs X, depending on the first eigenvalue \lambda_1^{(p)}(X) of the p-Laplacian and the maximal displacement of permutations of vertices. For a k-regular vertex-transitive graph it takes the form c_p(X)^{p}\geq diam(X)^{p}\lambda_{1}^{(p)}(X)/2^{p-1}k. This bound is optimal for expander families and, for p=2, it gives the exact value for cycles and hypercubes. As a new application we give a non-trivial lower bound for the \ell^2-distortion of a family of Cayley graphs of SL_n(q) (q fixed, n\geq 2) with respect to a standard two-element generating set.
