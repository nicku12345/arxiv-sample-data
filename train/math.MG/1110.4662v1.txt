Periodic frameworks with crystallographic symmetry are investigated from the perspective of a general deformation theory of periodic bar-and-joint structures in R^d. It is shown that natural parametrizations provide affine section descriptions for families of frameworks with a specified graph and symmetry. A simple geometric setting for diaplacive phase transitions is obtained. Upper bounds are derived for the number of realizations of minimally rigid periodic graphs.
