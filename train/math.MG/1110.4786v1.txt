In this paper we show that embedded and compact C^1 manifolds have finite integral Menger curvature if and only if they are locally graphs of certain Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces. Furthermore, we prove that for some intermediate energies of integral Menger type a similar characterization of objects with finite energy can be given.
