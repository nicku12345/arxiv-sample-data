We prove a Lipschitz-Volume rigidity theorem in Alexandrov geometry, that is, if a 1-Lipschitz map f\colon X=\amalg X_\ell\to Y between Alexandrov spaces preserves volume, then it is a path isometry and an isometry when restricted to the interior of X. We furthermore characterize the metric structure on Y with respect to X when f is also onto. This implies the converse of Petrunin's Gluing Theorem: if a gluing of two Alexandrov spaces via a bijection between their boundaries produces an Alexandrov space, then the bijection must be an isometry.
