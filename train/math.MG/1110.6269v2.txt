Suppose that E and E' denote real Banach spaces with dimension at least 2, that D\subset E and D'\subset E' are domains, and that f: D\to D' is a homeomorphism. In this paper, we prove that if there exists some constant M>1 (resp. some homeomorphism \phi) such that for all x\in D, f: B(x,d_D(x))\to f(B(x,d_D(x))) is M-QH (resp. \phi-FQC), then f is M_1-QH with M_1=M_1(M) (resp. \phi_1-FQC with \phi_1=\phi_1(\phi)). We apply our results to establish, in terms of the j_D metric, a sufficient condition for a homeomorphism to be FQC.
