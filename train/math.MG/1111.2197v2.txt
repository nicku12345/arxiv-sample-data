We consider decomposition spaces \R^3/G that are manifold factors and admit defining sequences consisting of cubes-with-handles. Metrics on \R^3/G constructed via modular embeddings into Euclidean spaces promote the controlled topology to a controlled geometry. The quasisymmetric parametrizability of the metric space \R^3/G\times \R^m imposes quantitative topological constraints, in terms of the circulation and growth, to the defining sequences for \R^3/G. We give a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for the existence of parametrization. The necessary condition answers a question of Heinonen and Semmes on quasisymmetric parametrizability of spaces associated to the Bing double. The sufficient condition gives new examples of quasispheres in \bS^4.
