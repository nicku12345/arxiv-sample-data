We show that every Banach space X containing an isomorphic copy of c_0 has an infinite equilateral set and also that if X has a bounded biorthogonal system of size \alpha then it can be renormed so as to admit an equilateral set of equal size. If K is any compact non metrizable space, then under a certain combinatorial condition on K the Banach space C(K) has an uncountable equilateral set.
