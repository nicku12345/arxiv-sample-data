We generalize the brick polytope of V. Pilaud and F. Santos to spherical subword complexes for finite Coxeter groups. This construction provides polytopal realizations for a certain class of subword complexes containing all cluster complexes of finite types. For the latter, the brick polytopes turn out to coincide with the known realizations of generalized associahedra, thus opening new perspectives on these constructions. This new approach yields in particular the vertex description of generalized associahedra, a Minkowski sum decomposition into Coxeter matroid polytopes, and a combinatorial description of the exchange matrix of any cluster in a finite type cluster algebra.
