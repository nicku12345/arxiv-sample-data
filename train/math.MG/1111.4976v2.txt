The mean width is a measure on n-dimensional convex bodies. An integral formula for the mean width of a regular n-simplex appeared in the electrical engineering literature in 1997. As a consequence, expressions for the expected range of a sample of n+1 normally distributed variables, for n<=6, carry over to widths of regular n-simplices. As another consequence, precise asymptotics for the mean width become available as n->infty.
