In this paper we study N_d(k) the smallest positive integer such that any nice measure \mu in \R^d can be partitioned in N_d(k) parts of equal measure so that every hyperplane avoids at least k of them. A theorem of Yao and Yao \cite{YY1985} states that N_d(1) \le 2^d. Among other results, we obtain the bounds N_d(2) \le 3 \cdot 2^{d-1} and N_d(1) \ge C \cdot 2^{d/2} for some constant C. We then apply these results to a problem on the separation of points and hyperplanes.
