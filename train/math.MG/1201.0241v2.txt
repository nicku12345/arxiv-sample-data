A convex polygon A is related to a convex m-gon K= \bigcap_{i=1}^m k_i^+, where k_1^+,..., k_m^+ are the m halfplanes whose intersection is equal to K, if A is the intersection of halfplanes a_1^+,...,a_l, each of which is a translate of one of the k_i^+-s. The planar family {\cal A} is related to K if each A \in {\cal A} is related to K. We prove that any family of pairwise intersecting convex sets related to a given n-gon has a finite piercing number which depends on n. In the general case we show O(3^{n^3}), while for a certain class of families, we decrease the bound to 4(n-2), and for n=3,4 the bound is 3 and 6 respectively.
