We consider the edge- and vertex-isoperimetric probem on finite and infinite hexagonal grids: For a subset W of the hexagonal grid of given cardinality, we give a lower bound for the number of edges between W and its complement, and lower bounds for the number of vertices in the neighborhood of W and for the number of vertices in the boundary of W. For the infinite hexagonal grid the given bounds are tight.
