Consider a face-to-face parallelohedral tiling of \mathbb R^d and a (d-k)-dimensional face F of the tiling. We prove that the valence of F (i.e. the number of tiles containing F as a face) is not greater than 2^k. If the tiling is affinely equivalent to a Voronoi tiling for some lattice (the so called Voronoi case), this gives a well-known upper bound for the number of vertices of a Delaunay k-cell. Yet we emphasize that such an affine equivalence is not assumed in the proof.
