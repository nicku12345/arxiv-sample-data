Gale transform is a simple but powerful tool in convex geometry. In particular, the use of Gale transform is the main argument in the classification of polytopes with few vertices. Many books and documents cover the definition of Gale transform and its main properties related to convex polytopes. But it seems that there does not exist document studying the Gale transform of more general objects, such that triangulation of spheres. In this paper, we study the properties of the Gale transform of a large class of such spheres called starshaped spheres.
