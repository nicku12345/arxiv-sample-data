There are several theorems named after the Italian mathematician Vitali. In this note we provide a simple proof of an extension of Vitali's Theorem on the existence of non-measurable sets. Specifically, we show, without using any decomposition theorems, that there does not exist a non-trivial, atom-less, \sigma-additive and translation invariant set function \mathcal{L} from the power set of the real line to the extended real numbers with \mathcal{L}([0,1]) = 1. (Note that \mathcal{L} is not assumed to be non-negative.)
