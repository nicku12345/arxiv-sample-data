We consider a functional \mathcal F on the space of convex bodies in \R^n defined as follows: {\mathcal F}(K) is the integral over the unit sphere of a fixed continuous functions f with respect to the area measure of the convex body K. We prove that if \mathcal F satisfies an inequality of Brunn--Minkowski type, then f is the support function of a convex body, i.e., \mathcal F is a mixed volume. As a consequence, we obtain a characterization of translation invariant, continuous valuations which are homogeneous of degree n-1 and satisfy a Brunn--Minkowski type inequality.
