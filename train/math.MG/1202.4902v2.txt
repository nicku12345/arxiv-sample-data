We give an application of a topological dynamics version of multidimensional Brown's lemma to tiling theory: given a tiling of an Euclidean space and a finite geometric pattern of points F, one can find a patch such that, for each scale factor \lambda, there is a vector \vec{t}_\lambda so that copies of this patch appear in the tilling "nearly" centered on \lambda F+\vec{t}_\lambda once we allow "bounded perturbations" in the structure of the homothetic copies of F. Furthermore, we introduce a new unifying setting for the study of tiling spaces which allows rather general group "actions" on patches and we discuss the local isomorphism property of tilings within this setting.
