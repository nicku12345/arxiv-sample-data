We introduce the following notion of compressing an undirected graph G with edge-lengths and terminal vertices R\subseteq V(G). A distance-preserving minor is a minor G' (of G) with possibly different edge-lengths, such that R\subseteq V(G') and the shortest-path distance between every pair of terminals is exactly the same in G and in G'. What is the smallest f*(k) such that every graph G with k=|R| terminals admits a distance-preserving minor G' with at most f*(k) vertices?   Simple analysis shows that f*(k)\leq O(k^4). Our main result proves that f*(k)\geq \Omega(k^2), significantly improving over the trivial f*(k)\geq k. Our lower bound holds even for planar graphs G, in contrast to graphs G of constant treewidth, for which we prove that O(k) vertices suffice.
