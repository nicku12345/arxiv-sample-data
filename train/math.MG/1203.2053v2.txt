We construct Grassmann spaces associated with the incidence geometry of regular and tangential subspaces of a symplectic copolar space, show that the underlying metric projective space can be recovered in terms of the corresponding adjacencies on so distinguished family of k-subspaces (geometrical dimension of the space being not 2k+1), and thus we prove that bijections which preserve the adjacency are determined by automorphisms of the underlying space.
