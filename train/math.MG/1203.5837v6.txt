Suppose 0 < p \leq 2 and that (\Omega, \mu) is a measure space for which L_{p}(\Omega, \mu) is at least two-dimensional. The central results of this paper provide a complete description of the subsets of L_{p}(\Omega, \mu) that have strict p-negative type. In order to do this we study non-trivial p-polygonal equalities in L_{p}(\Omega, \mu). These are equalities that can, after appropriate rearrangement and simplification, be expressed in the form \begin{eqnarray*} \sum\limits_{j, i = 1}^{n} \alpha_{j} \alpha_{i} {\| z_{j} - z_{i} \|}_{p}^{p} & = & 0 \end{eqnarray*} where \{ z_{1}, \ldots, z_{n} \} is a subset of L_{p}(\Omega, \mu) and \alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n} are non-zero real numbers that sum to zero. We provide a complete classification of the non-trivial p-polygonal equalities in L_{p}(\Omega, \mu). The cases p < 2 and p = 2 are substantially different and are treated separately. The case p = 1 generalizes an elegant result of Elsner, Han, Koltracht, Neumann and Zippin.   Another reason for studying non-trivial p-polygonal equalities in L_{p}(\Omega, \mu) is due to the fact that they preclude the existence of certain types of isometry. For example, our techniques show that if (X,d) is a metric space that has strict q-negative type for some q \geq p, then: (1) (X,d) is not isometric to any linear subspace W of L_{p}(\Omega, \mu) that contains a pair of disjointly supported non-zero vectors, and (2) (X,d) is not isometric to any subset of L_{p}(\Omega, \mu) that has non-empty interior. Furthermore, in the case p = 2, it also follows that (X,d) is not isometric to any affinely dependent subset of L_{2}(\Omega, \mu).
