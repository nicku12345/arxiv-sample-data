We present explicit constructions of centrally symmetric 2-neighborly d-dimensional polytopes with about 3^{d/2} = (1.73)^d vertices and of centrally symmetric k-neighborly d-polytopes with about 2^{c_k d} vertices where c_k=3/20 k^2 2^k. Using this result, we construct for a fixed k > 1 and arbitrarily large d and N, a centrally symmetric d-polytope with N vertices that has at least (1-k^2 (gamma_k)^d) binom(N, k) faces of dimension k-1, where gamma_2=1/\sqrt{3} = 0.58 and gamma_k = 2^{-3/{20k^2 2^k}} for k > 2. Another application is a construction of a set of 3^{d/2 -1}-1 points in R^d every two of which are strictly antipodal as well as a construction of an n-point set (for an arbitrarily large n) in R^d with many pairs of strictly antipodal points. The two latter results significantly improve the previous bounds by Talata, and Makai and Martini, respectively.
