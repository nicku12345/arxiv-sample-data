In 1940s Steenrod asked if every homology class z\in H_n(X,\mathbb{Z}) of every topological space X can be realised by an image of the fundamental class of an oriented closed smooth manifold. Thom found a non-realisable 7-dimensional class and proved that for every n, there is a positive integer k(n) such that the class k(n)z is always realisable. The proof was by methods of algebraic topology and gave no information on the topology the manifold which realises the homology class. We give a purely combinatorial construction of a manifold that realises a multiple of a given homology class. For every n, this construction yields a manifold M^n_0 with the following universality property: For any X and z\in H_n(X,\mathbb{Z}), a multiple of z can be realised by an image of a (non-ramified) finite-sheeted covering of M^n_0. Manifolds satisfying this property are called URC-manifolds. The manifold M^n_0 is a so-called small cover of the permutahedron, i.e., a manifold glued in a special way out of 2^n permutahedra. (The permutahedron is a special convex polytope with (n+1)! vertices.) Among small covers over other simple polytopes, we find a broad class of examples of URC-manifolds. In particular, in dimension 4, we find a hyperbolic URC-manifold. Thus we obtain that a multiple of every homology class can be realised by an image of a hyperbolic manifold, which was conjectured by Kotschick and L\"oh. Finally, we investigate the relationship between URC-manifolds and simplicial volume.
