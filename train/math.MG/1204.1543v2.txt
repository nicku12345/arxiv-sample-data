We prove that a region in a two-dimensional affine subspace of a normed space V has the least 2-dimensional Hausdorff measure among all compact surfaces with the same boundary. Furthermore, the 2-dimensional Hausdorff area density admits a convex extension to \Lambda^2 V. The proof is based on a (probably) new inequality for the Euclidean area of a convex centrally-symmetric polygon.
