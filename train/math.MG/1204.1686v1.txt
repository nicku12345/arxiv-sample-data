For a certain class of configurations of points in space, Eves' Theorem gives a ratio of products of distances that is invariant under projective transformations, generalizing the cross-ratio for four points on a line. We give a generalization of Eves' theorem, which applies to a larger class of configurations and gives an invariant with values in a weighted projective space. We also show how the complex version of the invariant can be determined from classically known ratios of products of determinants, while the real version of the invariant can distinguish between configurations that the classical invariants cannot.
