In this article we study the Ahlfors regular conformal gauge of a compact metric space (X,d), and its conformal dimension \mathrm{dim}_{AR}(X,d). Using a sequence of finite coverings of (X,d), we construct distances in its Ahlfors regular conformal gauge of controlled Hausdorff dimension. We obtain in this way a combinatorial description, up to bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms, of all the metrics in the gauge. We show how to compute \mathrm{dim}_{AR}(X,d) using the critical exponent Q_N associated to the combinatorial modulus.
