We prove sharp geometric rigidity estimates for isometries on Heisenberg groups. Our main result asserts that every (1+\varepsilon)-quasi-isometry on a John domain of the Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}^n, n>1, is close to some isometry up to proximity order \sqrt{\varepsilon}+\varepsilon in the uniform norm, and up to proximity order \varepsilon in the L_p^1-norm. We give examples showing the asymptotic sharpness of our results.
