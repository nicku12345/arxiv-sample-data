Realisations of associahedra with linearly non-isomorphic normal fans can be obtained by alteration of the right-hand sides of the facet-defining inequalities from a classical permutahedron. These polytopes can be expressed as Minkowski sums and differences of dilated faces of a standard simplex as described by Ardila, Benedetti & Doker (2010). The coefficients y_I of such a Minkowski decomposition can be computed by M\"obius inversion if tight right-hand sides z_I are known not just for the facet-defining inequalities of the associahedron but also for all inequalities of the permutahedron that are redundant for the associahedron.   We show for certain families of these associahedra: (a) how to compute tight values z_I for the redundant inequalities from the values z_I for the facet-defining inequalities; (b) the computation of the values y_I of Ardila, Benedetti & Doker can be significantly simplified and at most four values z_{a(I)}, z_{b(I)}, z_{c(I)} and z_{d(I)} are needed to compute y_I; (c) the four indices a(I), b(I), c(I) and d(I) are determined by the geometry of the normal fan of the associahedron and are described combinatorially; (d) a combinatorial interpretation of the values y_I using a labeled n-gon. This last result is inspired from similar interpretations for vertex coordinates originally described originally by J.-L. Loday and well-known interpretations for the z_I-values of facet-defining inequalities.
