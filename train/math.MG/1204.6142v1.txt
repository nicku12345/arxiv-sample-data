For A\in\mathbb{Z}^{m\times n} we investigate the behaviour of the number of lattice points in P_A(b)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:Ax\leq b\}, depending on the varying vector b. It is known that this number, restricted to a cone of constant combinatorial type of P_A(b), is a quasi-polynomial function if b is an integral vector. We extend this result to rational vectors b and show that the coefficients themselves are piecewise-defined polynomials. To this end, we use a theorem of McMullen on lattice points in Minkowski-sums of rational dilates of rational polytopes and take a closer look at the coefficients appearing there.
