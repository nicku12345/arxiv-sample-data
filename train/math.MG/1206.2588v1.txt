We construct five types of polyhedra by generalizing the description of Bricard octahedra and applying the generalizations to polyhedral suspensions. The resulting polyhedra are flexible, are of genus 0, exhibit self-intersections, have zero oriented volume, have dihedral angles all of which are non-constant during flexion and are of indefinite size, the smallest of which are dodecahedra with eight vertexes.
