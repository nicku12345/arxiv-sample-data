For a poset P, a subposet A, and an order preserving map F from A into the real numbers, the marked order polytope parametrizes the order preserving extensions of F to P. We show that the function counting integral-valued extensions is a piecewise polynomial in F and we prove a reciprocity statement in terms of order-reversing maps. We apply our results to give a geometric proof of a combinatorial reciprocity for monotone triangles due to Fischer and Riegler (2011) and we consider the enumerative problem of counting extensions of partial graph colorings of Herzberg and Murty (2007).
