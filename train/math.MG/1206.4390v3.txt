Given a lattice \Lambda \subset \mathbb{R}^n, we consider its Minkowski reduced basis and the solid angle \Omega spanned by the basis vectors. Such a basis satisfies strong near-orthogonality conditions, which allow us to bound from above and below the measure of \Omega. Sharp upper and lower bounds are derived for all rank 3 and rank 4 lattices so that \Omega always measures in between. Extreme cases happen when \Lambda is similar to the rectangular (\mathcal{R}) or alternating (\mathcal{A}) lattice. This result settles a question raised earlier by Fukshansky and Robins in connection to sphere packings and kissing numbers. The proof relies on a formula by Hajja and Walker that expresses \Omega as a product of \det(\Lambda) and a quadratic integral on the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^{n-1}. Finally, we show that for rank 5, the alternating lattice \mathcal{A}_{5} no longer possesses the smallest measure for \Omega.
