\SLR geometry is one of the eight 3-dimensional Thurston geometries, it can be derived from the 3-dimensional Lie group of all 2\times 2 real matrices with determinant one.   Our aim is to describe and visualize the {\it regular infinite (torus-like) or bounded} p-gonal prism tilings in \SLR space. For this purpose we introduce the notion of the infinite and bounded prisms, prove that there exist infinite many regular infinite p-gonal face-to-face prism tilings \cT^i_p(q) and infinitely many regular (bounded) p-gonal non-face-to-face \SLR prism tilings \cT_p(q) for parameters p \ge 3 where  \frac{2p}{p-2} < q \in \mathbb{N}. Moreover, we develope a method to determine the data of the space filling regular infinite and bounded prism tilings. We apply the above procedure to \cT^i_3(q) and \cT_3(q) where 6< q \in \mathbb{N} and visualize them and the corresponding tilings.   E. Moln\'ar showed, that the homogeneous 3-spaces have a unified interpretation in the projective 3-space \mathcal{P}^3(\bV^4,\BV_4, \mathbf{R}). In our work we will use this projective model of \SLR geometry and in this manner the prisms and prism tilings can be visualized on the Euclidean screen of computer.
