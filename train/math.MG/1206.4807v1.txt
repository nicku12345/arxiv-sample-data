The distances between flats of a Poisson k-flat process in the d-dimensional Euclidean space with k<d/2 are discussed. Continuing an approach originally due to Rolf Schneider, the number of pairs of flats having distance less than a given threshold and midpoint in a fixed compact and convex set is considered. For a family of increasing convex subsets, the asymptotic variance is computed and a central limit theorem with an explicit rate of convergence is proven. Moreover, the asymptotic distribution of the m-th smallest distance between two flats is investigated and it is shown that the ordered distances form asymptotically after suitable rescaling an inhomogeneous Poisson point process on the positive real axis. A similar result with a homogeneous limiting process is derived for distances around a fixed, strictly positive value. Our proofs rely on recent findings based on the Wiener-It\^o chaos decomposition and the Malliavin-Stein method.
