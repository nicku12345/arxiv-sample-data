The continuity of the inverse Klain map is investigated and the class of centrally symmetric convex bodies at which every valuation depends continuously on its Klain function is characterized. Among several applications, it is shown that McMullen's decomposition is not possible in the class of translation-invariant, continuous, positive valuations. This implies that there exists no McMullen decomposition for translation-invariant, continuous Minkowski valuations, which solves a problem first posed by Schneider and Schuster.
