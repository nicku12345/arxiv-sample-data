Let p\geq 1, \eps >0, r\geq (1+\eps) p, and X be a (-1/r)-concave random vector in \R^n with Euclidean norm |X|. We prove that (\E |X|^{p})^{1/{p}}\leq c (C(\eps) \E|X|+\sigma_{p}(X)), where \sigma_{p}(X)=\sup_{|z|\leq 1}(\E|<z,X>|^{p})^{1/p}, C(\eps) depends only on \eps and c is a universal constant. Moreover, if in addition X is centered then (\E |X|^{-p})^{-1/{p}}\geq c(\eps) (\E|X| - C \sigma_{p}(X)).
