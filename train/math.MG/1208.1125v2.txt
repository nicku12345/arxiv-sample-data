We prove a log-Sobolev inequality for a certain class of log-concave measures in high dimension. These are the probability measures supported on the unit cube in R^n whose density takes the form exp(-H) where the function H is assumed to be convex (but not strictly convex) with bounded pure second derivatives. Our argument relies on a transportation-cost inequality a la Talagrand.
