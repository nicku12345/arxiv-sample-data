We study multiple tilings of 3-dimensional Euclidean space by a convex body. In a multiple tiling, a convex body P is translated with a discrete multiset \Lambda in such a way that each point of the space gets covered exactly k times, except perhaps the translated copies of the boundary of P. It is known that all possible multiple tilers in 3D are zonotopes. In 2D it was known by the work of M. Kolountzakis that, unless P is a parallelogram, the multiset of translation vectors \Lambda must be a finite union of translated lattices (also known as quasi periodic sets). In that work [Kolountzakis, 2002], the author asked whether the same quasi-periodic structure on the translation vectors would be true in 3D. Here we prove that this conclusion is indeed true for 3D.   Namely, we show that if P is a convex multiple tiler in 3D, with a discrete multiset \Lambda of translation vectors, then \Lambda has to be a finite union of translated lattices, unless P belongs to a special class of zonotopes. This exceptional class consists of two-flat zonotopes P, defined by the Minkowski sum of n+m line segments that lie in the union of two different two-dimensional subspaces H_1 and H_2. Equivalently, a two-flat zonotope P may be thought of as the Minkowski sum of two 2-dimensional symmetric polygons one of which may degenerate into a single line segment. It turns out that rational two-flat zonotopes admit a multiple tiling with an aperiodic (non-quasi-periodic) set of translation vectors \Lambda. We note that it may be quite difficult to offer a visualization of these 3-dimensional non-quasi-periodic tilings, and that we discovered them by using Fourier methods.
