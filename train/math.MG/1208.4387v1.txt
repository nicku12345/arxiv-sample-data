We prove that an affine polar space in the meaning of Cohen and Shult can be recovered from one of the three adjacency relations on a Grassmann structure over it. The result directly generalizes the results of our previous work where we use an affine space over a vector space equipped with a nondegenerate reflexive form as a starting point to the Cohen-Shult affine polar spaces.
