The Gauss-Minkowski correspondence in \mathbb{R}^2 states the existence of a homeomorphism between the probability measures \mu on [0,2\pi] such that \int_0^{2\pi} e^{ix}d\mu(x)=0 and the compact convex sets (CCS) of the plane with perimeter~1. In this article, we bring out explicit formulas relating the border of a CCS to its probability measure. As a consequence, we show that some natural operations on CCS -- for example, the Minkowski sum -- have natural translations in terms of probability measure operations, and reciprocally, the convolution of measures translates into a new notion of convolution of CCS. Additionally, we give a proof that a polygonal curve associated with a sample of n random variables (satisfying \int_0^{2\pi} e^{ix}d\mu(x)=0) converges to a CCS associated with \mu at speed \sqrt{n}, a result much similar to the convergence of the empirical process in statistics. Finally, we employ this correspondence to present models of smooth random CCS and simulations.
