We prove generalized lower Ricci curvature bounds for warped products over complete Finsler manifolds. On the one hand our result covers a theorem of Bacher and Sturm concerning euclidean and spherical cones. On the other hand it can be seen in analogy to a result of Bishop and Alexander in the setting of Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded from below. For the proof we combine techniques developed in these papers. Because the Finsler product metric can degenerate we regard a warped product as metric measure space that is in general neither a Finsler manifold nor an Alexandrov space again but a space satisfying a curvature-dimension condition in the sense of Lott-Villani/Sturm.
