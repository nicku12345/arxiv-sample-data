We prove that for compact, non-contractible, one dimensional geodesic spaces, a version of the marked length spectrum conjecture holds. For a compact one dimensional geodesic space X, we define a subspace Conv(X). When X is non-contractible, we show that X deformation retracts to Conv(X). If two such spaces X, Y have the same marked length spectrum, we prove that Conv(X) and Conv(Y) are isometric to each other.
