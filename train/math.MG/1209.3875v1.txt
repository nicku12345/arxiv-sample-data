Triangulations of the cube into a minimal number of simplices without additional vertices have been studied by several authors over the past decades. For 3\leq n\leq 7 this so-called simplexity of the unit cube I^n is now known to be 5,16,67,308,1493, respectively. In this paper, we study triangulations of I^n with simplices that only have nonobtuse dihedral angles. A trivial example is the standard triangulation into n! simplices. In this paper we show that, surprisingly, for each n\geq 3 there is essentially only one other nonobtuse triangulation of I^n, and give its explicit construction. The number of nonobtuse simplices in this triangulation is equal to the smallest integer larger than n!({\rm e}-2).
