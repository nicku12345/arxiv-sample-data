Suppose that E and E' denote real Banach spaces with dimension at least 2, that D\subset E and D'\subset E' are domains, and that f: D\to D' is a homeomorphism. In this paper, we prove the following subinvariance property for the class of uniform domains: Suppose that f is a freely quasiconformal mapping and that D' is uniform. Then the image f(D_1) of every uniform subdomain D_1 in D under f is still uniform. This result answers an open problem of V\"ais\"al\"a in the affirmative.
