Suppose that E and E' denote real Banach spaces with dimension at least 2 and that D\varsubsetneq E and D'\varsubsetneq E' are uniform domains with homogeneously dense boundaries. We consider the class of all \varphi-FQC (freely \varphi-quasiconformal) maps of D onto D' with bilipschitz boundary values. We show that the maps of this class are \eta-quasisymmetric. As an application, we show that if D is bounded, then maps of this class satisfy a two sided H\"older condition. Moreover, replacing the class \varphi-FQC by the smaller class of M-QH maps, we show that M-QH maps with bilipschitz boundary values are bilipschitz. Finally, we show that if f is a \varphi-FQC map which maps D onto itself with identity boundary values, then there is a constant C\,, depending only on the function \varphi\,, such that for all x\in D, the quasihyperbolic distance satisfies k_D(x,f(x))\leq C.
