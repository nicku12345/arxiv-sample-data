This paper is a study of harmonic maps from Riemannian polyhedra to (locally) non-positively curved geodesic spaces in the sense of Alexandrov. We prove Liouville-type theorems for subharmonic functions and harmonic maps under two different assumptions on the source space. First we prove the analogue of the Schoen-Yau Theorem on a complete (smooth) pseudomanifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. Then we study 2-parabolic admissible Riemannian polyhedra and prove some vanishing results on them.
