The theory of p-adic fractal strings and their complex dimensions was developed by the first two authors in [17, 18, 19], particularly in the self-similar case, in parallel with its archimedean (or real) counterpart developed by the first and third author in [28]. Using the fractal tube formula obtained by the authors for p-adic fractal strings in [20], we present here an exact volume formula for the tubular neighborhood of a p-adic self-similar fractal string Lp, expressed in terms of the underlying complex dimensions. The periodic structure of the complex dimensions allows one to obtain a very concrete form for the resulting fractal tube formula. Moreover, we derive and use a truncated version of this fractal tube formula in order to show that Lp is not Minkowski measurable and obtain an explicit expression for its average Minkowski content. The general theory is illustrated by two simple examples, the 3-adic Cantor string and the 2-adic Fibonacci strings, which are nonarchimedean analogs (introduced in [17, 18]) of the real Cantor and Fibonacci strings studied in [28].
