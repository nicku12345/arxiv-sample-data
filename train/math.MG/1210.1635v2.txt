We study the algebraic rank of various classes of \mathrm{CAT}(0) groups. They include right-angled Coxeter groups, right-angled Artin groups, relatively hyperbolic groups and groups acting geometrically on \mathrm{CAT}(0) spaces with isolated flats. As one of our corollaries, we obtain a new proof of a result on commensurability of Coxeter groups
