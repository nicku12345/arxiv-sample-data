Every regular map on a closed surface gives rise to generally six regular maps, its "Petrie relatives", that are obtained through iteration of the duality and Petrie operations (taking duals and Petrie-duals). It is shown that the skeletal polyhedra in Euclidean 3-space which realize a Petrie relative of the classical Gordan regular map and have full icosahedral symmetry, comprise precisely four infinite families of polyhedra, as well as four individual polyhedra.
