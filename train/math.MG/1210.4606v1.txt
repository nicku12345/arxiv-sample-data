We present the Tetrahedral Compactness Theorem which states that sequences of Riemannian manifolds with a uniform upper bound on volume and diameter that satisfy a uniform tetrahedral property have a subsequence which converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a countably \mathcal{H}^m rectifiable metric space of the same dimension. The tetrahedral property depends only on distances between points in spheres, yet we show it provides a lower bound on the volumes of balls. The proof is based upon intrinsic flat convergence and a new notion called the sliced filling volume of a ball.
