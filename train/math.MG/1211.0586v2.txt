In this paper we consider piecewise linear (pl) isometric embeddings of Euclidean polyhedra into Euclidean space. A Euclidean polyhedron is just a metric space \mathcal{P} which admits a triangulation \mathcal{T} such that each n-dimensional simplex of \mathcal{T} is affinely isometric to a simplex in \mathbb{E}^n. We prove that any 1-Lipschitz map from an n-dimensional Euclidean polyhedron \mathcal{P} into \mathbb{E}^{3n} is \epsilon-close to a pl isometric embedding for any \epsilon > 0. If we remove the condition that the map be pl then any 1-Lipschitz map into \mathbb{E}^{2n + 1} can be approximated by a (continuous) isometric embedding. These results are extended to isometric embedding theorems of spherical and hyperbolic polyhedra into Euclidean space by the use of the Nash-Kuiper C^1 isometric embedding theorem. Finally, we discuss how these results extend to various other types of polyhedra.
