It was proved by Gomori and Hu in 1961 that for every finite nonempty ultrametric space (X,d) the following inequality |\Sp(X)|\leqslant |X|-1 holds with \Sp(X)=\{d(x,y):x,y \in X, x\neq y\}. We characterize the spaces X, for which the equality in this inequality is attained by the structural properties of some graphs and show that the set of isometric types of such X is dense in the Gromov-Hausdorff space of the compact ultrametric spaces.
