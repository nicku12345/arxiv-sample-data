We establish a rescaling theorem for isolated essential singularities of quasiregular mappings. As a consequence we show that the class of closed manifolds receiving a quasiregular mapping from a punctured unit ball with an essential singularity at the origin is exactly the class of closed quasiregularly elliptic manifolds, that is, closed manifolds receiving a non-constant quasiregular mapping from a Euclidean space.
