We study the nonexpansivity of reflection mappings in geodesic spaces and apply our findings to the averaged alternating reflection algorithm employed in solving the convex feasibility problem for two sets in a nonlinear context. We show that weak convergence results from Hilbert spaces find natural counterparts in spaces of constant curvature. Moreover, in this particular setting, one obtains strong convergence.
