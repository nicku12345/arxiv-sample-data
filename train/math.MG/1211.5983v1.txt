We solve a randomized version of the following open question: is there a strictly convex, bounded curve \gamma in the plane such that the number of rational points on \gamma, with denominator n, approaches infinity with n? Although this natural problem appears to be out of reach using current methods, we consider a probabilistic analogue using a spatial Poisson-process that simulates the refined rational lattice \frac{1}{d} Z^2, which we call M_d, for each natural number d. The main result here is that with probability 1 there exists a strictly convex, bounded curve \gamma such that the number of spatial Poisson points on \gamma, with intensity d, approaches infinity with d. The methods include the notion of a generalized affine length of a convex curve, defined by Petrov (2007).
