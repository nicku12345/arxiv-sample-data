This note concerns the so-called pyjama problem, whether it is possible to cover the plane by finitely many rotations of vertical strips of half-width \varepsilon. We first prove that there exist no periodic coverings for \varepsilon<1/3. Then we describe an explicit (non-periodic) construction for \varepsilon =1/3-1/48. Finally, we use a compactness argument combined with some ideas from additive combinatorics to show that a finite covering exists for \varepsilon =1/5. The question whether \varepsilon can be arbitrarily small remains open.
