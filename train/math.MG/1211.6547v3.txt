Let (X,d,m) be a geodesic metric measure space. Consider a geodesic \mu_{t} in the L^{2}-Wasserstein space. Then as s goes to t the support of \mu_{s} and the support of \mu_{t} have to overlap, provided an upper bound on the densities holds. We give a more precise formulation of this self-intersection property. We consider for each t the set of times for which a geodesic belongs to the support of \mu_{t} and we prove that t is a point of Lebesgue density 1 for this set, in the integral sense. Our result applies to spaces satisfying \mathsf{CD}(K,\infty). The non branching property is not needed.
