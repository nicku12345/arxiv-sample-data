Given a domain G \subsetneq \Rn we study the quasihyperbolic and the distance ratio metrics of G and their connection to the corresponding metrics of a subdomain D \subset G. In each case, distances in the subdomain are always larger than in the original domain. Our goal is to show that, in several cases, one can prove a stronger domain monotonicity statement. We also show that under special hypotheses we have inequalities in the opposite direction.
