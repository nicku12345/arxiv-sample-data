In this paper, we introduce discrete conics, polygonal analogues of conics. We show that discrete conics satisfy a number of nice properties analogous to those of conics, and arise naturally from several constructions, including the discrete negative pedal construction and an action of a group acting on a focus-sharing pencil of conics.
