We show that the Voronoi conjecture is true for parallelohedra with simply connected \delta-surface. Namely, we show that if the boundary of parallelohedron P remains simply connected after removing closed non-primitive faces of codimension 2, then P is affinely equivalent to a Dirichlet-Voronoi domain of some lattice. Also we construct the \pi-surface associated with a parallelohedron and give another condition in terms of homology group of the constructed surface. Every parallelohedron with simply connected \delta-surface also satisfies the condition on homology group of the \pi-surface.
