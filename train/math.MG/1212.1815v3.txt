We prove that the complement {\mathcal S}:={\mathbb R}^3\setminus{\mathcal K} of a 3-dimensional convex polyhedron {\mathcal K}\subset{\mathbb R}^3 and its closure \overline{{\mathcal S}} are polynomial images of {\mathbb R}^3. The former techniques cannot be extended in general to represent such semialgebraic sets {\mathcal S} and \overline{{\mathcal S}} as polynomial images of {\mathbb R}^n if n\geq4.
