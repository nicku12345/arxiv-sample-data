Mahler's conjecture asks whether the cube is a minimizer for the volume product of a body and its polar in the class of symmetric convex bodies in a fixed dimension. It is known that every Hanner polytope has the same volume product as the cube or the cross-polytope. In this paper we prove that every Hanner polytope is a strict local minimizer for the volume product in the class of symmetric convex bodies endowed with the Banach-Mazur distance.
