Coincidence Site Lattices (CSLs) are a well established tool in the theory of grain boundaries. For several lattices up to dimension d=4, the CSLs are known explicitly as well as their indices and multiplicity functions. Many of them share a particular property: their multiplicity functions are multiplicative. We show how multiplicativity is connected to certain decompositions of CSLs and the corresponding coincidence rotations and present some criteria for multiplicativity. In general, however, multiplicativity is violated, while supermultiplicativity still holds.
