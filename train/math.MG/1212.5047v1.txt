This is a survey paper on various results relates to the following theorem first proved by A.D. Alexandrov: \textit{Let S be an analytic convex sphere-homeomorphic surface in \mathbb R^3 and let k_1(\boldsymbol{x})\leqslant k_2(\boldsymbol{x}) be its principal curvatures at the point \boldsymbol{x}. If the inequalities k_1(\boldsymbol{x})\leqslant k\leqslant k_2(\boldsymbol{x}) hold true with some constant k for all \boldsymbol{x}\in S then S is a sphere.} The imphases is on a result of Y. Martinez-Maure who first proved that the above statement is not valid for convex C^2-surfaces. For convenience of the reader, in addendum we give a Russian translation of that paper by Y. Martinez-Maure originally published in French in \textit{C. R. Acad. Sci., Paris, S\'{e}r. I, Math.} {\bf 332} (2001), 41--44.
