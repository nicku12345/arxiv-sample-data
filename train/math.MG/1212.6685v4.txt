In this paper we study the property of generic global rigidity for frameworks of graphs embedded in d-dimensional complex space and in a d-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space (R^d with a metric of indefinite signature). We show that a graph is generically globally rigid in Euclidean space iff it is generically globally rigid in a complex or pseudo-Euclidean space. We also establish that global rigidity is always a generic property of a graph in complex space, and give a sufficient condition for it to be a generic property in a pseudo-Euclidean space. Extensions to hyperbolic space are also discussed.
