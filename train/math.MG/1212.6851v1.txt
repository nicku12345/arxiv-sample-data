We derive the isoperimetric profile of Gaussian type for an absolutely continuous probability measure on Euclidean spaces with respect to the Lebesgue measure, whose density is a radial function.The key is a generalization of the Poincar\'e limit which asserts that the n-dimensional Gaussian measure is approximated by the projections of the uniform probability measure on the Euclidean sphere of appropriate radius to the first n-coordinates as the dimension diverges to infinity. The generalization is done by replacing the projections with certain maps.
