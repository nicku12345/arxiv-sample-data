In this paper, we study a complete noncompact nonnegatively curved Alexandrov space A with a soul S of codimension two. We establish some structural results under additional regularity assumptions. As an application, we conclude that in this case Sharafutdinov retraction, \pi:\ A\to S, is a submetry.
