We consider sequences of open Riemannian manifolds with boundary that have no regularity conditions on the boundary. To define a reasonable notion of a limit of such a sequence, we examine "\delta inner regions" which avoid the boundary by a distance \delta. We prove Gromov-Hausdorff compactness theorems for sequences of these "\delta inner regions". We then build "glued limit spaces" out of the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of these \delta interior regions and study the properties of these glued limit spaces. Our main applications assume the sequence is noncollapsing and has nonnegative Ricci curvature. We include open questions.
