In this paper we consider the isoptic curves on the 2-dimensional geometries of constant curvature \bE^2,~\bH^2,~\cE^2. The topic is widely investigated in the Euclidean plane \bE^2 see for example \cite{CMM91} and \cite{Wi} and the references given there, but in the hyperbolic and elliptic plane there are few results in this topic (see \cite{CsSz1} and \cite{CsSz2}). In this paper we give a review on the preliminary results of the isoptics of Euclidean and hyperbolic curves and develop a procedure to study the isoptic curves in the hyperbolic and elliptic plane geometries and apply it for some geometric objects e.g. proper conic sections. We use for the computations the classical models which are based on the projectiv interpretation of the hyperbolic and elliptic geometry and in this manner the isoptic curves can be visualized on the Euclidean screen of computer.
