Seeds of sunflowers are often modelled by the map n\longmapsto \varphi_\theta(n)=\sqrt{n}e^{2i\pi n\theta} leading to a roughly uniform repartition with two consecutive seeds separated by the divergence angle 2\pi\theta for \theta the golden ratio. We associate to an arbitrary real divergence angle 2\pi \theta a geodesic path \gamma_\theta: \mathbb R_{>0}\longrightarrow \mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb Z)\backslash \mathbb H of the modular curve and use it for local descriptions of the image \varphi_\theta(\mathbb N) of the phyllotactic map \varphi_\theta.
