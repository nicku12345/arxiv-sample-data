We prove an inequality for the entropy numbers in terms of nonlinear Kolmogorov's widths. This inequality is in a spirit of known inequalities of this type and it is adjusted to the form convenient in applications for m-term approximations with respect to a given system. Also, we obtain upper bounds for the m-term approximation by the Weak Relaxed Greedy Algorithm with respect to a system which is not a dictionary.
