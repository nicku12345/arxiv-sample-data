We give bounds on the successive minima of an o-symmetric convex body under the restriction that the lattice points realizing the successive minima are not contained in a collection of forbidden sublattices. Our investigations extend former results to forbidden full-dimensional lattices, to all successive minima and complement former results in the lower dimensional case.
