In this paper we consider the problem of minimizing the relative perimeter under a volume constraint in the interior of a convex body, i.e., a compact convex set in Euclidean space with interior points. We shall not impose any regularity assumption on the boundary of the convex set. Amongst other results, we shall prove the equivalence between Hausdorff and Lipschitz convergence, the continuity of the isoperimetric profile with respect to the Hausdorff distance,and the convergence in Hausdorff distance of sequences of isoperimetric regions and their free boundaries. We shall also describe the behavior of the isoperimetric profile for small volume, and the behavior of isoperimetric regions for small volume.
