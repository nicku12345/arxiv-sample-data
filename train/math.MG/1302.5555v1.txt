We prove that an infinitesimally Hilbertian CD(0,N) space containing a line splits as the product of R and an infinitesimally Hilbertian CD(0,N-1) space. By `infinitesimally Hilbertian' we mean that the Sobolev space W^{1,2}(X,d,m), which in general is a Banach space, is an Hilbert space. When coupled with a curvature-dimension bound, this condition is known to be stable with respect to measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.
