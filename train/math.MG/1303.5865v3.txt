The set of segments, each of the next is n times bigger than the first one is a simple geometric interpretation of the set \mathbb{N} of natural numbers. In this paper we investigate the opposite situation. We give algebraic structure to the set of similar triangles with parallel sides. We present geometric construction of adding of triangles and use it to dissection of triangles into 15 triangles of different sides.
