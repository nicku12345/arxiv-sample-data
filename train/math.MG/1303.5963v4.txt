We prove the existence of positive lower bounds on the Cheeger constants of manifolds of the form X/\Gamma where X is a contractible Riemannian manifold and \Gamma<\Isom(X) is a discrete subgroup, typically with infinite co-volume. The existence depends on the L^2-Betti numbers of \Gamma, its subgroups and of a uniform lattice of \Isom(X). As an application, we show the existence of a uniform positive lower bound on the Cheeger constant of any manifold of the form \H^4/\Gamma where \H^4 is real hyperbolic 4-space and \Gamma<\Isom(\H^4) is discrete and isomorphic to a subgroup of the fundamental group of a complete finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifold. Via Patterson-Sullivan theory, this implies the existence of a uniform positive upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the conical limit set of such a \Gamma when \Gamma is geometrically finite. Another application shows the existence of a uniform positive lower bound on the zero-th eigenvalue of the Laplacian of \H^n/\Gamma over all discrete free groups \Gamma<\Isom(\H^n) whenever n\ge 4 is even (the bound depends on n). This extends results of Phillips-Sarnak and Doyle who obtained such bounds for n\ge 3 when \Gamma is a finitely generated Schottky group.
