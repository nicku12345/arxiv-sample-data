We revisit the traveling salesman problem with neighborhoods (TSPN) and propose several new approximation algorithms. These constitute either first approximations (for hyperplanes, lines, and balls in \mathbb{R}^d, for d\geq 3) or improvements over previous approximations achievable in comparable times (for unit disks in the plane).   \smallskip (I) Given a set of n hyperplanes in \mathbb{R}^d, a TSP tour whose length is at most O(1) times the optimal can be computed in O(n) time, when d is constant.   \smallskip (II) Given a set of n lines in \mathbb{R}^d, a TSP tour whose length is at most O(\log^3 n) times the optimal can be computed in polynomial time for all d.   \smallskip (III) Given a set of n unit balls in \mathbb{R}^d, a TSP tour whose length is at most O(1) times the optimal can be computed in polynomial time, when d is constant.
