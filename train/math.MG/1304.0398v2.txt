We give a combinatorial characterization of generic frameworks that are minimally rigid under the additional constraint of maintaining symmetry with respect to a finite order rotation or a reflection. To establish these results we develop a new technique for deriving linear representations of sparsity matroids on colored graphs and extend the direction network method of proving rigidity characterizations to handle reflections.
