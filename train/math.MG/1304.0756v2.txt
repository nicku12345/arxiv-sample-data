We give a combinatorial characterization of minimally rigid planar frameworks with orientation-preserving crystallographic symmetry, under the constraint of forced symmetry. The main theorems are proved by extending the methods of the first paper in this sequence from groups generated by a single rotation to groups generated by translations and rotations. The proofs make use of a new family of matroids defined on crystallographic groups and associated submodular functions.
