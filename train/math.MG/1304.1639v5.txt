A cube tiling of R^d is a family of pairwise disjoint cubes [0,1)^d+T=\{[0,1)^d+t:t\in T\} such that \bigcup_{t\in T}([0,1)^d+t)=R^d. Two cubes [0,1)^d+t, [0,1)^d+s are called a twin pair if their closures have a complete facet in common, that is if |t_j-s_j|=1 for some j\in [d]=\{1,..., d\} and t_i=s_i for every i\in [d]\setminus \{j\}. In 1930, Keller conjectured that in every cube tiling of R^d there is a twin pair. Keller's conjecture is true for dimensions d\leq 6 and false for all dimensions d\geq 8. For d=7 the conjecture is still open. Let x\in R^d, i\in [d], and let L(T,x,i) be the set of all ith coordinates t_i of vectors t\in T such that ([0,1)^d+t)\cap ([0,1]^d+x)\neq \emptyset and t_i\leq x_i. Let r^-(T)=\min_{x\in R^d}\; \max_{1\leq i\leq d}|L(T,x,i)| and r^+(T)=\max_{x\in R^d}\; \max_{1\leq i\leq d}|L(T,x,i)|. It is known that Keller's conjecture is true in dimension seven for cube tilings [0,1)^7+T for which r^-(T)\leq 2. In the present paper we show that it is also true for d=7 if r^+(T)\geq 6. Thus, if [0,1)^d+T is a counterexample to Keller's conjecture in dimension seven, then r^-(T),r^+(T)\in \{3,4,5\}.
