Let L be a big invertible sheaf on a complex projective variety, equipped with two continuous metrics. We prove that the distribution of the eigenvalues of the transition matrix between the L^2 norms on H^0(X,nL) with respect to the two metriques converges (in law) as n goes to infinity to a Borel probability measure on \mathbb R. This result can be thought of as a generalization of the existence of the energy at the equilibrium as a limit, or an extension of Berndtsson's results to the more general context of graded linear series and a more general class of line bundles. Our approach also enables us to obtain a p-adic analogue of our main result.
