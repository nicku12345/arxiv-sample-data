We prove the theorem mentioned in the title, for {\mathbb{R}}^n, where n \ge 3. The case of the simplex was known previously. Also, the case n=2 was settled, but there the infimum was some well-defined function of the side lengths. We also consider the cases of spherical and hyperbolic n-spaces. There we give some necessary conditions for the existence of a convex polytope with given facet areas, and some partial results about sufficient conditions for the existence of (convex) tetrahedra.
