A well-known theorem of Sch\"utte (1963) gives a sharp lower bound for the ratio between the maximum distance and minimum distance between n+2 points in n-dimensional Euclidean space. In this brief note we adapt B\'ar\'any's elegant proof of this theorem to the space \ell_4^n. This gives a new proof that the largest cardinality of an equilateral set in \ell_4^n is n+1, and gives a constructive bound for an interval (4-\epsilon_n,4+\epsilon_n) of values of p close to 4 for which it is guaranteed that the largest cardinality of an equilateral set in \ell_p^n is n+1.
