We investigate certain spaces of infinitesimal motions arising naturally in the rigidity theory of bar and joint frameworks. We prove some structure theorems for these spaces and as a consequence are able to deduce some special cases of a long standing conjecture of Graver, Tay and Whiteley concerning Henneberg extensions and generically rigid graphs.
