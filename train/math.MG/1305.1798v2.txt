It is shown that most lattices \Gamma in \mathbb{R}^2 and \mathbb{R}^3 possess a fundamental domain F for the action of \Gamma on \mathbb{R}^2, respectively \mathbb{R}^3, having more symmetries than the point group P(\Gamma), i.e., the group P (\Gamma) \subset O(d) fixing \Gamma. In particular, P (\Gamma) is a subgroup of the symmetry group S(F) of F of index 2 in these cases. Exceptions are cubic lattices in the three-dimensional case, where such an F does not exist. Possible exceptions are rhombic lattices in the plane case, where the constructions presented here do not seem to work.
