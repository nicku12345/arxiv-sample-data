An equilateral dimension of a normed space is a maximal number of pairwise equidistant points of this space. The aim of this paper is to study the equilateral dimension of certain classes of finite dimensional normed spaces. The well-known conjecture states that the equilateral dimension of any n-dimensional normed space is not less than n+1. By using an elementary continuity argument, we establish it in the following classes of spaces: permutation-invariant spaces, Orlicz-Musielak spaces and in one codimensional subspaces of \ell^n_{\infty}. For smooth and symmetric spaces, Orlicz-Musielak spaces satisfying an additional condition and every (n-1)-dimensional subspace of \ell^{n}_{\infty} we also provide some weaker bounds on the equilateral dimension for every space which is sufficiently close to one of these. This generalizes the result of Swanepoel and Villa concerning the \ell_p^n spaces.
