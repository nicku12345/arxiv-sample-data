Consider the interval of integers I_{m,n} = \{m, m+1, m+2,\ldots, m+n-1 \}. For fixed integers h,k,m, and c, let \Phi_{h,k,m}^{(c)}(n) denote the number of solutions of the equation (a_1+\cdots + a_h)- (a_{h+1} + \cdots + a_{h+k})=c with a_i \in I_{m,n} for all i=1,\ldots, h+k. This is a polynomial in n for all sufficiently large n, and the growth polynomial is constructed explicitly.
