We study some geometric properties of the L_q-centroid bodies Z_q(\mu) of an isotropic log-concave measure \mu  on {\mathbb R}^n. For any 2\ls q\ls\sqrt{n} and for \varepsilon \in (\varepsilon_0(q,n),1) we determine the inradius of a random (1-\varepsilon)n-dimensional projection of Z_q(\mu) up to a constant depending polynomially on \varepsilon . Using this fact we obtain estimates for the covering numbers N(\sqrt{\smash[b]{q}}B_2^n,tZ_q(\mu)), t\gr 1, thus showing that Z_q(\mu) is a \beta -regular convex body. As a consequence, we also get an upper bound for M(Z_q(\mu)).
