Metric measure spaces satisfying the reduced curvature-dimension condition CD^*(K,N) and where the heat flow is linear are called RCD^*(K,N)-spaces. This class of non smooth spaces contains Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below by K and dimension bounded above by N. We prove that in RCD^*(K,N)-spaces the following properties of the heat flow hold true: a Li-Yau type inequality, a Bakry-Qian inequality, the Harnack inequality.
