We classify the singular loci of surfaces in the 3-sphere that are the pointwise Euclidean sum or Hamiltonian product of circles. Such surfaces are the union of circles in at least two ways. As an application we classify surfaces that are covered by both great circles and little circles up to homeomorphism.
