The "visibility" of a planar set S from a point a is defined as the normalized size of the radial projection of S from a to the unit circle centered at a. Simon and Solomyak (Real Anal. Exchange 2006/07) proved that unrectifiable self-similar one-sets are invisible from every point in the plane. We quantify this by giving an upper bound on the visibility of \delta-neighbourhoods of such sets. We also prove lower bounds on the visibility of \delta-neighborhoods of more general sets, based in part on Bourgain's discretized sum-product estimates
