Banach spaces without the Radon-Nikod\'ym property are characterized as spaces containing bilipschitz images of thick families of geodesics defined as follows. A family T of geodesics joining points u and v in a metric space is called {\it thick} if there is \alpha>0 such that for every g\in T and for any finite collection of points r_1,...,r_n in the image of g, there is another uv-geodesic \widetilde g\in T satisfying the conditions: \widetilde g also passes through r_1,...,r_n, and, possibly, has some more common points with g. On the other hand, there is a finite collection of common points of g and \widetilde g which contains r_1,...,r_n and is such that the sum of maximal deviations of the geodesics between these common points is at least \alpha.
