We repurpose tools from the theory of quantitative rectifiability to study the qualitative rectifiability of measures in \Bbb{R}^n, n\geq 2. To each locally finite Borel measure \mu, we associate a function \widetilde J_2(\mu, x) which uses a weighted sum to record how closely the mass of \mu is concentrated on a line in the triples of dyadic cubes containing x. We show that \widetilde J_2(\mu, x) < \infty \mu-a.e. is a necessary condition for \mu to give full mass to a countable family of rectifiable curves. This confirms a conjecture of Peter Jones from 2000. A novelty of this result is that no assumption is made on the upper Hausdorff density of the measure. Thus we are able to analyze generic 1-rectifiable measures that are mutually singular with the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure.
