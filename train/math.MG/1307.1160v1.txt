We prove a conjecture of T. Erd\'{e}lyi and E.B. Saff, concerning the form of the dominant term (as N\to \infty) of the N-point Riesz d-polarization constant for an infinite compact subset A of a d-dimensional C^{1}-manifold embedded in \mathbb{R}^{m} (d\leq m). Moreover, if we assume further that the d-dimensional Hausdorff measure of A is positive, we show that any asymptotically optimal sequence of N-point configurations for the N-point d-polarization problem on A is asymptotically uniformly distributed with respect to \mathcal H_d|_A.
