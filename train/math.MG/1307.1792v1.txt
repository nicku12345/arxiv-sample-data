Let G and \tilde G be Kleinian groups whose limit sets S and \tilde S, respectively, are homeomorphic to the standard Sierpi\'nski carpet, and such that every complementary component of each of S and \tilde S is a round disc. We assume that the groups G and \tilde G act cocompactly on triples on their respective limit sets. The main theorem of the paper states that any quasiregular map (in a suitably defined sense) from an open connected subset of S to \tilde S is the restriction of a M\"obius transformation that takes S onto \tilde S, in particular it has no branching. This theorem applies to the fundamental groups of compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds with non-empty totally geodesic boundaries.   One consequence of the main theorem is the following result. Assume that G is a torsion-free hyperbolic group whose boundary at infinity \dee_\infty G is a Sierpi\'nski carpet that embeds quasisymmetrically into the standard 2-sphere. Then there exists a group H that contains G as a finite index subgroup and such that any quasisymmetric map f between open connected subsets of \dee_\infty G is the restriction of the induced boundary map of an element h\in H.
