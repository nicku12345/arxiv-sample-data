We consider the area functional for t-graphs in the sub-Riemannian Heisenberg group and study minimizers of the associated Dirichlet problem. We prove that, under a bounded slope condition on the boundary datum, there exists a unique minimizer and that this minimizer is Lipschitz continuous. We also provide an example showing that, in the first Heisenberg group, Lipschitz regularity is sharp even under the bounded slope condition.
