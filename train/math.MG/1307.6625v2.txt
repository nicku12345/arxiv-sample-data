Hurewicz's dimension-raising theorem states that for every n-to-1 map f : X \to Y, dim Y =< dim X + n holds. In this paper we introduce a new notion of finite-to-one like map in a large scale setting. Using this notion we formulate a dimension-raising type theorem for the asymptotic dimension and the asymptotic Assouad-Nagata dimension. It is also well-known as Hurewicz's finite-to-one mapping theorem that dim X =< n if and only if there exists an (n + 1)-to-1 map from a 0-dimensional space onto X. We formulate a finite-to-one mapping type theorem for the asymptotic dimension and the asymptotic Assouad-Nagata dimension.
