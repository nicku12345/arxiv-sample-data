Let P be a set of n points in the real plane contained in an algebraic curve C of degree d. We prove that the number of distinct distances determined by P is at least c_d n^{4/3}, unless C contains a line or a circle. We also prove the lower bound c_d' \min(m^{2/3}n^{2/3}, m^2, n^2) for the number of distinct distances between m points on one irreducible plane algebraic curve and n points on another, unless the two curves are parallel lines, orthogonal lines, or concentric circles. This generalizes a result on distances between lines of Sharir, Sheffer, and Solymosi in arXiv:1302.3081.
