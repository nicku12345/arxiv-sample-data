In 1933 Karol Borsuk asked whether each bounded set in the n-dimensional Euclidean space can be divided into n+1 parts of smaller diameter. The diameter of a set is defined as the supremum (least upper bound) of the distances of contained points. Implicitly, the whole set is assumed to contain at least two points.   The hypothesis that the answer to that question is positive became famous under the name Borsuk's conjecture. Beginning with Jeff Kahn and Gil Kalai, from 1993 to 2003 several authors have proved that in certain (almost all) high dimensions such a division is not generally possible.   In a paper published in 2013, Andriy V. Bondarenko constructed a 65-dimensional two-distance set of 416 vectors that cannot be divided into less than 84 parts of smaller diameter. That was not just the first known two-distance counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture but also a considerable reduction of the lowest known dimension the conjecture fails in in general.   This article presents a 64-dimensional subset of the vector set mentioned above that cannot be divided into less than 71 (by A. Bondarenko 72) parts of smaller diameter, that way delivering a two-distance counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture in dimension 64.   The contained proof relies on the results of some (combinatorial) calculations. The additionally (in the source package) provided small computer program G24CHK needs about one second for that task on a 1 GHz Intel PIII.   Meanwhile a short paper by this author and Andries E. Brouwer that follows the principal idea of this article but avoids the extensive computational part has been submitted to The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics.
