The lack of an inner product structure in Banach spaces yields the motivation to introduce a semi-inner product with a more general axiom system, one missing the requirement for symmetry, unlike the one determing a Hilbert space. We use it on a finite dimensional real Banach space (\X, \| \cdot\|) to define and investigate three concepts. First, we generalize that of \emph{antinorms}, already defined in Minkowski planes, for even dimensional spaces. Second, we introduce \emph{normality maps}, which in turn leads us to the study of \emph{semi-polarity}, a variant of the notion of polarity, which makes use of the underlying semi-inner product.
