Let A=(a_{ij})\in M_n(\R) be an n by n symmetric stochastic matrix. For p\in [1,\infty) and a metric space (X,d_X), let \gamma(A,d_X^p) be the infimum over those \gamma\in (0,\infty] for which every x_1,...,x_n\in X satisfy  \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n d_X(x_i,x_j)^p\le \frac{\gamma}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} d_X(x_i,x_j)^p.    Thus \gamma(A,d_X^p) measures the magnitude of the {\em nonlinear spectral gap} of the matrix A with respect to the kernel d_X^p:X\times X\to [0,\infty). We study pairs of metric spaces (X,d_X) and (Y,d_Y) for which there exists \Psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty) such that \gamma(A,d_X^p)\le \Psi(\gamma(A,d_Y^p)) for every symmetric stochastic A\in M_n(\R) with \gamma(A,d_Y^p)<\infty. When \Psi is linear a complete geometric characterization is obtained.   Our estimates on nonlinear spectral gaps yield new embeddability results as well as new nonembeddability results. For example, it is shown that if n\in \N and p\in (2,\infty) then for every f_1,...,f_n\in L_p there exist x_1,...,x_n\in L_2 such that {equation}\label{eq:p factor} \forall\, i,j\in \{1,...,n\},\quad \|x_i-x_j\|_2\lesssim p\|f_i-f_j\|_p, {equation} and  \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n \|x_i-x_j\|_2^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n \|f_i-f_j\|_p^2.    This statement is impossible for p\in [1,2), and the asymptotic dependence on p in \eqref{eq:p factor} is sharp. We also obtain the best known lower bound on the L_p distortion of Ramanujan graphs, improving over the work of Matou\v{s}ek. Links to Bourgain--Milman--Wolfson type and a conjectural nonlinear Maurey--Pisier theorem are studied.
