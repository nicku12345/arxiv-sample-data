We discuss the cross-ratio map of planar quadrilateral linkages, also in the case when one of the links is telescopic. Most of our results are valid for a planar quadrilateral linkage with generic lengths of the sides. In particular, we describe the image of cross-ratio map for quadrilateral linkage and planar robot 3-arm.
