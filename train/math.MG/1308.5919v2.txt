We give sharp upper bounds on the maximal injectivity radius of finite-area hyperbolic surfaces and use them, for each g at least 2, to identify a constant r_{g-1,2} with the property that the set of closed genus-g hyperbolic surfaces with maximal injectivity radius at least r is compact if and only if r > r_{g-1,2}. The main tool is a version of the "centered dual complex" that we introduced earlier, a coarsening of the Delaunay complex of a locally finite set. In particular, we bound the area of a compact centered dual two-cell below given lower bounds on its side lengths.
