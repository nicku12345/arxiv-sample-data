We propose new symmetry-adapted rigidity matrices to analyze the infinitesimal rigidity of arbitrary-dimensional bar-joint frameworks with Abelian point group symmetries. These matrices define new symmetry-adapted rigidity matroids on group-labeled quotient graphs. Using these new tools, we establish combinatorial characterizations of infinitesimally rigid two-dimensional bar-joint frameworks whose joints are positioned as generic as possible subject to the symmetry constraints imposed by a reflection, a half-turn or a three-fold rotation in the plane. For bar-joint frameworks which are generic with respect to any other cyclic point group in the plane, we provide a number of necessary conditions for infinitesimal rigidity.
