As a discrete analog to Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies, Wills conjectured that the Ehrhart coefficients of a centrally symmetric lattice polytope with exactly one interior lattice point are maximized by those of the cube of side length two. We discuss several counterexamples to this conjecture and, on the positive side, we identify a family of lattice polytopes that fulfill the claimed inequalities. This family is related to the recently introduced class of l-reflexive polytopes.
