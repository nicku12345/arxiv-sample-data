We consider the geometric join of a family of subsets of the Euclidean space. This is a construction frequently used in the (colorful) Carath\'eodory and Tverberg theorems, and their relatives. We conjecture that when the family has at least d+1 sets, where d is the dimension of the space, then the geometric join is contractible. We are able to prove this when d equals 2 and 3, while for larger d we show that the geometric join is contractible provided the number of sets is quadratic in d. We also consider a matroid generalization of geometric joins and provide similar bounds in this case.
