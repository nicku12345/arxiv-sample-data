Let (X,d) be a compact metric space and \mu a Borel probability on X. For each N\geq 1 let d^N_\infty be the \ell_\infty-product on X^N of copies of d, and consider 1-Lipschitz functions X^N\to\mathbb{R} for d^N_\infty.   If the support of \mu is connected and locally connected, then all such functions are close in probability to juntas: that is, functions that depend on only a few coordinates of X^N. This describes the failure of measure concentration for these product spaces, and can be seen as a Lipschitz-function counterpart of the celebrated result of Friedgut that Boolean functions with small influences are close to juntas.
