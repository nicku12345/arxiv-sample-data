This paper examines dimension of the graph of the famous Weierstrass non-differentiable function \[ W_{\lambda, b} (x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lambda^n\cos(2\pi b^n x) \] for an integer b \ge 2 and 1/b < \lambda < 1. We prove that for every b there exists (explicitly given) \lambda_b \in (1/b, 1) such that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of W_{\lambda, b} is equal to D = 2+\frac{\log\lambda}{\log b} for every \lambda\in(\lambda_b,1). We also show that the dimension is equal to D for almost every \lambda on some larger interval. This partially solves a well-known thirty-year-old conjecture. Furthermore, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the function \[ f (x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lambda^n\phi(b^n x) \] for an integer b \ge 2 and 1/b < \lambda < 1 is equal to D for a typical \mathbb Z-periodic C^3 function \phi.
