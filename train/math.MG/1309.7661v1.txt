We show that every four-dimensional parallelohedron P satisfies a recently found condition of Garber, Gavrilyuk & Magazinov sufficient for the Voronoi conjecture being true for P. Namely we show that for every four-dimensional parallelohedron P the group of rational first homologies of its \pi-surface is generated by half-belt cycles.
