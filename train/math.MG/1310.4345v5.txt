Moser's shadow problem asks to estimate the shadow function \mathfrak{s}_b(n), which is the largest number such that for each bounded convex polyhedron P with n vertices in 3-space there is some direction {\bf v} (depending on P) such that, when illuminated by parallel light rays from infinity in direction {\bf v}, the polyhedron casts a shadow having at least \mathfrak{s}_b(n) vertices. A general version of the problem allows unbounded polyhedra as well, and has associated shadow function \mathfrak{s}_u(n). This paper presents correct order of magnitude asymptotic bounds on these functions. The bounded case has answer \mathfrak{s}_b(n) = \Theta \big( \log (n)/ (\log(\log (n))\big. The unbounded shadow problem is shown to have the different asymptotic growth rate \mathfrak{s}_u(n) = \Theta \big(1\big). Results on the bounded shadow problem follow from 1989 work of Chazelle, Edelsbrunner and Guibas on the (bounded) silhouette span number \mathfrak{s}_b^{\ast}(n), defined analogously but with arbitrary light sources. We complete the picture by showing that the unbounded silhouette span number \mathfrak{s}_u^{\ast}(n) grows as \Theta \big( \log (n)/ (\log(\log (n))\big).
