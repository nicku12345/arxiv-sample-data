A simple, yet unifying method is provided for the construction of tilings by tiles obtained from the attractor of an iterated function system (IFS). Many examples appearing in the literature in ad hoc ways, as well as new examples, can be constructed by this method. These tilings can be used to extend a fractal transformation defined on the attractor of a contractive IFS to a fractal transformation on the entire space upon which the IFS acts.
