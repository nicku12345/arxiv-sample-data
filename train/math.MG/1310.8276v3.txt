In this paper we obtain a bound on the number of isometry classes of finite area hyperbolic surfaces which are length isospectral to a given surface depending only on the topological type of the surface and the length of the shortest closed geodesic on the surface. This will follow from a more general bound applying to any family of hyperbolic surfaces which admits a Bers' constant and with a lower bound on systole length.
