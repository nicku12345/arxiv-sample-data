Let C be a smooth, convex curve on either the sphere \mathbb{S}^{2}, the hyperbolic plane \mathbb{H}^{2} or the Euclidean plane \mathbb{E}^{2}, with the following property: there exists \alpha, and parameterizations x(t), y(t) of C such that for each t, the angle between the chord connecting x(t) to y(t) and C is \alpha at both ends.   Assuming that C is not a circle, E. Gutkin completely characterized the angles \alpha for which such a curve exists in the Euclidean case. We study the infinitesimal version of this problem in the context of the other two constant curvature geometries, and in particular we provide a complete characterization of the angles \alpha for which there exists a non-trivial infinitesimal deformation of a circle through such curves with corresponding angle \alpha. We also consider a discrete version of this property for Euclidean polygons, and in this case we give a complete description of all non-trivial solutions.
