We relate generalized Lebesgue decompositions of measures in terms of curve fragments (Alberti representations) and Weaver derivations. This correspondence leads to a geometric characterization of the local norm on the Weaver cotangent bundle of a metric measure space (X,\mu): the local norm of a form df sees how fast f grows on curve fragments seen by \mu. This implies a new characterization of differentiability spaces in terms of the \mu-a.e.~equality of the local norm of df and the local Lipschitz constant of f. As a consequence, the Lip-lip inequality of Keith must be an equality. We also provide dimensional bounds for the module of derivations in terms of the Assouad dimension of X.
