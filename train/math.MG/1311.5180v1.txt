In this paper, we introduce several mixed L_p geominimal surface areas for multiple convex bodies for all p\neq -n. Our definitions are motivated from an equivalent formula for the mixed p-affine surface area. Some properties, such as the affine invariance, for these mixed L_p geominimal surface areas are proved. Related inequalities, such as, Alexander-Fenchel type inequality, Santal\'{o} style inequality, affine isoperimetric inequalities, and cyclic inequalities are established. Moreover, we also study some properties and inequalities for the i-th mixed L_p geominimal surface areas for two convex bodies.
