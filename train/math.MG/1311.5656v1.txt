In Lie sphere geometry, a cycle in \RR^n is either a point or an oriented sphere or plane of codimension 1, and it is represented by a point on a projective surface \Omega\subset \PP^{n+2}. The Lie product, a bilinear form on the space of homogeneous coordinates \RR^{n+3}, provides an algebraic description of geometric properties of cycles and their mutual position in \RR^n. In this paper we discuss geometric objects which correspond to the intersection of \Omega with projective subspaces of \PP^{n+2}. Examples of such objects are spheres and planes of codimension 2 or more, cones and tori. The algebraic framework which Lie geometry provides gives rise to simple and efficient computation of invariants of these objects, their properties and their mutual position in \RR^n.
