Various results are proved giving lower bounds for the mth intrinsic volume V_m(K), m=1,\dots,n-1, of a compact convex set K in {\mathbb{R}}^n, in terms of the mth intrinsic volumes of its projections on the coordinate hyperplanes (or its intersections with the coordinate hyperplanes). The bounds are sharp when m=1 and m=n-1. These are reverse (or dual, respectively) forms of the Loomis-Whitney inequality and versions of it that apply to intrinsic volumes. For the intrinsic volume V_1(K), which corresponds to mean width, the inequality obtained confirms a conjecture of Betke and McMullen made in 1983.
