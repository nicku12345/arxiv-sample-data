In this paper I present a comparison theorem for the waist of Riemannian manifolds with positive sectional curvature. The main theorem of this paper gives a partial positive answer to a conjecture formulated by M.Gromov in [8]. The content of this paper combines two aspects: classical volume comparison theorems of Riemannian geometry, and geometric measure theoretic ideas stemming from Almgren-Pitts Min-Max theory
