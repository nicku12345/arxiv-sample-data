Analogues of the classical Banach-Stone theorem for spaces of continuous functions are studied in the context of the spaces of absolutely continuous functions introduced by Ashton and Doust. We show that if AC(\sigma_1) is algebra isomorphic to AC(\sigma_2) then \sigma_1 is homeomorphic to \sigma_2. The converse however is false. In a positive direction we show that the converse implication does hold if the sets \sigma_1 and \sigma_2 are confined to a restricted collection of compact sets, such as the set of all simple polygons.
