Let (X,d,\mu) be a space of homogeneous type. In this note we study the relationship between two types of s-sets: relative to a distance and relative to a measure. We find a condition on a closed subset F of X under which we have that F is s-set relative to the measure \mu if and only if F is s-set relative to \delta. Here \delta denotes the quasi-distance defined by Mac\'ias and Segovia such that (X,\delta,\mu) is a normal space. In order to prove this result, we show a covering type lemma and a type of Hausdorff measure based criteria for the s-set condition relative to \mu of a given set.
