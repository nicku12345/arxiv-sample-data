For a self-affine measure on a Bedford-McMullen carpet we prove that its quantization dimension exists and determine its exact value. Further, we give various sufficient conditions for the corresponding upper and lower quantization coefficient to be both positive and finite. Finally, we compare the quantization dimension with corresponding quantities derived from the multifractal temperature function and show that -- different from conformal systems -- they in general do not coincide.
