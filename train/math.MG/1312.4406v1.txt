This paper addresses to the problem of finding the (minimum) Euclidean distance between two linear varieties. This problem is, usually, solved minimising a target function. We propose a novel approach: to use the Moore-Penrose generalised inverse of a matrix in order to find the Euclidean distance and, at the same time, going further by exhibiting the best approximation pair of points.
