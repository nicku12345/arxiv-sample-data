We obtain a new extension of Rogers-Shephard inequality providing an upper bound for the volume of the sum of two convex bodies K and L. We also give lower bounds for the volume of the k-th limiting convolution body of two convex bodies K and L. Special attention is paid to the (n-1)-th limiting convolution body, for which a sharp inequality, which is equality only when K=-L is a simplex, is given. Since the n-th limiting convolution body of K and -K is the polar projection body of K, these inequalities can be viewed as an extension of Zhang's inequality.
