The covariogram g_{K} of a convex body K in \mathbb{R}^n is the function which associates to each x\in\mathbb{R}^n the volume of the intersection of K with K+x. Determining K from the knowledge of g_K is known as the Covariogram Problem. It is equivalent to determining the characteristic function 1_K of K from the modulus of its Fourier transform \hat{1_K} in \mathbb{R}^n, a particular instance of the Phase Retrieval Problem.   We connect the Covariogram Problem to two aspects of the Fourier transform \hat{1_K} seen as a function in \mathbb{C}^n. The first connection is with the problem of determining K from the knowledge of the zero set of \hat{1_K} in \mathbb{C}^n. To attack this problem T. Kobayashi studied the asymptotic behavior at infinity of this zero set. We obtain this asymptotic behavior assuming less regularity on K and we use this result as an essential ingredient for proving that when K is sufficiently smooth and in any dimension n, K is determined by g_K in the class of sufficiently smooth bodies.   The second connection is with the irreducibility of the entire function \hat{1_K}. This connection also shows a link between the Covariogram Problem and the Pompeiu Problem in integral geometry.
