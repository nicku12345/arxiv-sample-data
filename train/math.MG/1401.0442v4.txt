We apply the technique of K\'aroly Bezdek and Daniel Bezdek to study billiard trajectories in convex bodies, when the length is measured with a (possibly asymmetric) norm. We prove a lower bound for the length of the shortest closed billiard trajectory, related to the non-symmetric Mahler problem. With this technique we are able to give short and elementary proofs to some known results.
