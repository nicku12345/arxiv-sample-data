In this paper, we prove that the metric space (Z\setminus M,u_Z) defined by Z.Ibragimov is asymptotically PT_{-1} if the metric space (Z,d) is PT_{0}, where M is a nonempty closed proper subset of Z. Secondly, based on the metric u_Z, we define a new kind of metric k_{z} on the set Z\setminus M and show that the new metric space (Z\setminus M,k_{Z}) is also asymptotically PT_{-1} without the assumption of PT_{0} on the metric space (Z,d).
