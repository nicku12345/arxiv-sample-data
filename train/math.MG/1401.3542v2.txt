In this paper we consider the isoperimetric profile of convex cylinders K\times\mathbb{R}^q, where K is an m-dimensional convex body, and of cylindrically bounded convex sets, i.e, those with a relatively compact orthogonal projection over some hyperplane of \mathbb{R}^{n+1}, asymptotic to a right convex cylinder of the form K\times\mathbb{R}, with K\subset\mathbb{R}^n. Results concerning the concavity of the isoperimetric profile, existence of isoperimetric regions, and geometric descriptions of isoperimetric regions for small and large volumes are obtained.
