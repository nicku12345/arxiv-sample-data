A set {X}_{N}=\{x_1,\ldots,x_N\} of N points on the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^d,\,d\geq 2 is a spherical t-design if the average of any polynomial of degree at most t over the sphere is equal to the average value of the polynomial over {X}_{N}. This paper extends characterizations of spherical t-designs in previous paper from \mathbb{S}^2 to general \mathbb{S}^d. We show that for N\geq\dim(\mathbb{P}_{t+1}), X_N is a stationary point set of a certain non-negative quantity A_{N,\,t} and a fundamental system for polynomial space over \mathbb{S}^d with degree at most t, then X_N is a spherical t-design. In contrast, we present that with N \geq \dim( \mathbb{P}_{t}), a fundamental system X_N is a spherical t-design if and only if non-negative quantity D_{N,\,t} vanishes. In addition, the still unanswered questions about construction of spherical t-designs are discussed.
