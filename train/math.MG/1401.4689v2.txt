A cube tiling of \mathbb{R}^d is a family of pairwise disjoint cubes [0,1)^d+T=\{[0,1)^d+t:t\in T\} such that \bigcup_{t\in T}([0,1)^d+t)=\mathbb{R}^d. Two cubes [0,1)^d+t, [0,1)^d+s are called a twin pair if |t_j-s_j|=1 for some j\in [d]=\{1,\ldots, d\} and t_i=s_i for every i\in [d]\setminus \{j\}. In 1930, Keller conjectured that in every cube tiling of \mathbb{R}^d there is a twin pair. Keller's conjecture is true for dimensions d\leq 6 and false for all dimensions d\geq 8. For d=7 the conjecture is still open. Let x\in \mathbb{R}^d, i\in [d], and let L(T,x,i) be the set of all ith coordinates t_i of vectors t\in T such that ([0,1)^d+t)\cap ([0,1]^d+x)\neq \emptyset and t_i\leq x_i. It is known that if |L(T,x,i)|\leq 2 for some x\in \mathbb{R}^7 and every i\in [7] or |L(T,x,i)|\geq 6 for some x\in \mathbb{R}^7 and i\in [7], then Keller's conjecture is true for d=7. In the present paper we show that it is also true for d=7 if |L(T,x,i)|=5 for some x\in \mathbb{R}^7 and i\in [7]. Thus, if there is a counterexample to Keller's conjecture in dimension seven, then |L(T,x,i)|\in \{3,4\} for some x\in \mathbb{R}^7 and i\in [7].
