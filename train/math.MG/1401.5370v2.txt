We describe the orbit space of the action of the group \mathrm{Sp}(2)\mathrm{Sp}(1) on the real Grassmann manifolds \mathrm{Gr}_k(\mathbb{H}^2) in terms of certain quaternionic matrices of Moore rank not larger than 2. We then give a complete classification of valuations on the quaternionic plane \mathbb{H}^2 which are invariant under the action of the group \mathrm{Sp}(2)\mathrm{Sp}(1).
