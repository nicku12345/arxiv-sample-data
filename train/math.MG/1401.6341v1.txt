We present a framework for analyzing non-linear \mathbb{R}^d-valued subdivision schemes which are geometric in the sense that they commute with similarities in \mathbb{R}^d. It admits to establish C^{1,\alpha}-regularity for arbitrary schemes of this type, and C^{2,\alpha}-regularity for an important subset thereof, which includes all real-valued schemes. Our results are constructive in the sense that they can be verified explicitly for any scheme and any given set of initial data by a universal procedure. This procedure can be executed automatically and rigorously by a computer when using interval arithmetics.
