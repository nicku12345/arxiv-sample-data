A bar framework determined by a finite graph G and configuration \bf p in d space is universally rigid if it is rigid in any {\mathbb R}^D \supset {\mathbb R}^d. We provide a characterization of universally rigidity for any graph G and any configuration {\bf p} in terms of a sequence of affine subsets of the space of configurations. This corresponds to a facial reduction process for closed finite dimensional convex cones.
