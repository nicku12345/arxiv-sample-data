It is known that the k-faces of the permutohedron \Pi_n are labeled by (all possible) linearly ordered partitions of the set [n]=\{1,...,n\} into (n-k) non-empty parts. The incidence relation corresponds to the refinement: a face F contains a face F' whenever the label of F' refines the label of F. In the paper we consider the cell complex {CP} defined in analogous way, replacing linear ordering by cyclic ordering. Namely, k-cells of the complex {CP} are labeled by (all possible) cyclically ordered partitions of the set [n+1]=\{1,...,n, n+1\} into (n+1-k) non-empty parts, where (n+1-k)>2. The incidence relation again corresponds to the refinement: a cell F contains a cell F' whenever the label of F' refines the label of F. In particular, two vertices are joined by an edge whenever their labels differ on a permutation of two neighbor elements. The complex {CP} cannot be represented by a convex polytope, since it is not a combinatorial sphere (not even a combinatorial manifold). However, it can be represented by some \textit{virtual polytope} (Minkowski difference of two convex polytopes) which we call "cyclopermutohedron" \mathcal{CP}_{n+1}. It is defined explicitly, as a weighted Minkowski sum of line segments. Informally, the cyclopermutohedron can be viewed as "permutohedron with diagonals". One of the motivations is that the cyclopermutohedron is a "universal" polytope for moduli spaces of polygonal linkages.
