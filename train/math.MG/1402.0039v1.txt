The mathematical theory of rigidity of body-bar and body-hinge frameworks provides a useful tool for analyzing the rigidity and flexibility of many articulated structures appearing in engineering, robotics and biochemistry. In this paper we develop a symmetric extension of this theory which permits a rigidity analysis of body-bar and body-hinge structures with point group symmetries. The infinitesimal rigidity of body-bar frameworks can naturally be formulated in the language of the exterior (or Grassmann) algebra. Using this algebraic formulation, we derive symmetry-adapted rigidity matrices to analyze the infinitesimal rigidity of body-bar frameworks with Abelian point group symmetries in an arbitrary dimension. In particular, from the patterns of these new matrices, we derive combinatorial characterizations of infinitesimally rigid body-bar frameworks which are generic with respect to a point group of the form \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}. Our characterizations are given in terms of packings of bases of signed-graphic matroids on quotient graphs. Finally, we also extend our methods and results to body-hinge frameworks with Abelian point group symmetries in an arbitrary dimension. As special cases of these results, we obtain combinatorial characterizations of infinitesimally rigid body-hinge frameworks with \mathcal{C}_2 or \mathcal{D}_2 symmetry - the most common symmetry groups found in proteins.
