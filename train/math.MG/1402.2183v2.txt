We consider the problem of distinguishing convex subsets of n-cyclotomic model sets \varLambda by (discrete parallel) X-rays in prescribed \varLambda-directions. In this context, a `magic number' m_{\varLambda} has the property that any two convex subsets of \varLambda can be distinguished by their X-rays in any set of m_{\varLambda} prescribed \varLambda-directions. Recent calculations suggest that (with one exception in the case n=4) the least possible magic number for n-cyclotomic model sets might just be N+1, where N=\operatorname{lcm}(n,2).
