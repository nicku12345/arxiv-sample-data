This paper is an extension of the author's lecture "Unique Determination of Polyhedral Domains and p-Moduli of Path Families" given at the International Conference "Metric Geometry of Surfaces and Polyhedra" dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Prof. Nikolay Vladimirovich Efimov, which was held in Moscow (Russia) in August 2010 (in this connection, see, for example [A. P. Kopylov, Unique determination of polyhedral domains and p-moduli of path families, In: Contemporary problems of Mathematics and Mechanics. VI. Mathematics. Issue 3. Moscow, Publishing House of Moscow university, P. 25-41 (2011)]). We expose new results on the problem of the unique determination of conformal type for domains in \mathbb R^n. It is in particular established that a (generally speaking) nonconvex bounded polyhedral domain in \mathbb R^n (n \ge 4) whose boundary is an (n - 1)-dimensional connected manifold of class C^0 without boundary and can be represented as a finite union of pairwise nonoverlapping (n-1)-dimensional cells is uniquely determined by the relative conformal moduli of its boundary condensers.   Results on the unique determination (of polyhedral domains) of isometric type are also obtained. In contrast to the classical case, these results present a new approach in which the notion of the p-modulus of path families is used.
