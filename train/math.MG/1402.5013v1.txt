We consider connections between similar sublattices and coincidence site lattices (CSLs), and more generally between similar submodules and coincidence site modules of general (free) \mathbb{Z}-modules in \mathbb{R}^d.   In particular, we generalise results obtained by S. Glied and M. Baake [1,2] on similarity and coincidence isometries of lattices and certain lattice-like modules called \mathcal{S}-modules. An important result is that the factor group \mathrm{OS}(M)/\mathrm{OC}(M) is Abelian for arbitrary \mathbb{Z}-modules M, where \mathrm{OS}(M) and \mathrm{OC}(M) are the groups of similar and coincidence isometries, respectively. In addition, we derive various relations between the indices of CSLs and their corresponding similar sublattices.   [1] S. Glied, M. Baake, Similarity versus coincidence rotations of lattices, Z.
