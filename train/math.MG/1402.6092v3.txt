It has been shown that certain 2-vertex directed graph iterated function systems (IFSs), defined on the unit interval and satisfying the convex strong separation condition (CSSC), have attractors whose components are not standard IFS attractors where the standard IFSs may be with or without separation conditions. The proof required the multiplicative rational independence of parameters and the calculation of Hausdorff measure. In this paper we present a proof which does not have either of these requirements and so we identify a whole new class of 2-vertex directed graph IFSs.   We extend this result to n-vertex (n>=2, CSSC) directed graph IFSs, defined on the unit interval, with no effective restriction on the form of the associated directed graph, subject only to a condition regarding level-1 gap lengths.   We also obtain a second result for n-vertex (n>=2, CSSC) directed graph IFSs, defined on the unit interval, which does require the calculation of Hausdorff measure.
