Paul Erdos asked if, among sufficiently many points in general position, there are always k points such that all the circles through 3 of these k points have different radii. He later proved that this is indeed the case. However, he overlooked a non-trivial case in his proof. In this note we deal with this case using B\'ezout's Theorem on the number of intersection points of two curves and obtain a polynomial bound for the needed number of points.
