In this paper we extend a previous result of the author [Lis07] of characterization of absolutely continuous curves in Wasserstein spaces to a more general class of spaces: the spaces of probability measures endowed with the Wasserstein-Orlicz distance constructed on extended Polish spaces (in general non separable), recently considered in [AGS14]. An application to the geodesics of this Wasserstein-Orlicz space is also given.
