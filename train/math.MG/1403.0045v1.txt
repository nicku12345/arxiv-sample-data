Skeletal polyhedra and polygonal complexes in ordinary Euclidean 3-space are finite or infinite 3-periodic structures with interesting geometric, combinatorial, and algebraic properties. They can be viewed as finite or infinite 3-periodic graphs (nets) equipped with additional structure imposed by the faces, allowed to be skew, zig-zag, or helical. A polyhedron or complex is "regular" if its geometric symmetry group is transitive on the flags (incident vertex-edge-face triples). There are 48 regular polyhedra (18 finite polyhedra and 30 infinite apeirohedra), as well as 25 regular polygonal complexes, all infinite, which are not polyhedra. Their edge graphs are nets well-known to crystallographers, and we identify them explicitly. There also are 6 infinite families of "chiral" apeirohedra, which have two orbits on the flags such that adjacent flags lie in different orbits.
