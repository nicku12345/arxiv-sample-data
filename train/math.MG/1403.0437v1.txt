We show by a direct construction that there are at least \exp\{cV^{(d-1)/(d+1)}\} convex lattice polytopes in \mathbb{R}^d of volume V that are different in the sense that none of them can be carried to an other one by a lattice preserving affine transformation. This is achieved by considering the family \mathcal{P}^d(r) (to be defined in the text) of convex lattice polytopes whose volumes are between 0 and r^d/d!. Namely we prove that for P \in \mathcal{P}^d(r), d!\mathrm{vol\;} P takes all possible integer values between cr^{d-1} and r^d where c>0 is a constant depending only on d.
