We provide a companion to the recent Benyi-Curgus generalization of the well-known theorems of Ceva and Menelaus, so as to characterize both the collinearity of points and the concurrence of lines determined by six points on the edges of a triangle. A companion for the generalized area formula of Routh appears, as well.
