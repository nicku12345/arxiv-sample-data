We show that a sufficient condition for a subset E in the Heisenberg group (endowed with the Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory metric) to be contained in a rectifiable curve is that it satisfies a modified analogue of Peter Jones's geometric lemma. Our estimates improve on those of \cite{FFP}, by replacing the power 2 of the Jones-\beta-number with any power r<4. This complements (in an open ended way) our work \cite{Li-Schul-beta-leq-length}, where we showed that such an estimate was necessary, but with r=4.
