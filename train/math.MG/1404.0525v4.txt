We derive several results in classical Euclidean elementary geometry using the steering ellipsoid formalism from quantum mechanics. This gives a physically motivated derivation of very non-trivial geometric results, some of which are entirely new. We consider a sphere of radius r contained inside another sphere of radius R, with the sphere centres separated by distance d. When does there exist a nested tetrahedron circumscribed about the smaller sphere and inscribed in the larger? We derive the Grace-Danielsson inequality d^2 \leq (R+r)(R-3r) as the sole necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a nested tetrahedron. Our method also gives the condition d^2 \leq R(R-2r) for the existence of a nested triangle in the analogous 2-dimensional scenario. These results imply the Euler inequality in 2 and 3 dimensions. Furthermore, we formulate a new inequality that applies to the more general case of ellipses and ellipsoids.
