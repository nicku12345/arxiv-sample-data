We prove a laplacian comparison theorem in the barrier sense for the function distance to the boundary of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, area and mean curvature of the boundary bounded above. As an application we get volume estimates, different to the ones obtained by Heintz-Karcher, and area estimates. With those estimates we prove Sormani-Wenger Intrinsic Flat (SWIF) compactness theorems for sequences of such manifolds with uniform bounds.
