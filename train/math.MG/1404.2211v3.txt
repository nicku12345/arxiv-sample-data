It is well known that a purely inseparable field extension L/F with some extra property and degree [L:F]=4 determines a Clifford parallelism on the set of lines of the three-dimensional projective space over F. By extending the ground field of this space from F to L, we establish the following geometric description of such a parallelism in terms of a distinguished `absolute pencil of lines' of the extended space: Two lines are Clifford parallel if, and only if, there exists a line of the absolute pencil that meets both of them.
