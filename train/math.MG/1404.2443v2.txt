We show that every heptagon is a section of a 3-polytope with 6 vertices. This implies that every n-gon with n\geq 7 can be obtained as a section of a (2+\lfloor\frac{n}{7}\rfloor)-dimensional polytope with at most \lceil\frac{6n}{7}\rceil vertices; and provides a geometric proof of the fact that every nonnegative n\times m matrix of rank 3 has nonnegative rank not larger than \lceil\frac{6\min(n,m)}{7}\rceil. This result has been independently proved, algebraically, by Shitov (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 122, 2014).
