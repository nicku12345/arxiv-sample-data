In \cite{LaLuRa13}, the authors completely classified the topological structure of so called {\it fractal square} F defined by F=(F+{\mathcal D})/n, where {\mathcal{D}}\subsetneq\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}^2, n\ge 2. In this paper, we further provide simple criteria for the F to be totally disconnected, then we discuss the Lipschitz classification of F in the case n=3, which is an attempt to consider non-totally disconnected sets.
