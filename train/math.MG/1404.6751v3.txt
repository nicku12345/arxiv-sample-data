We compute the Markov convexity invariant of the continuous infinite dimensional Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}_\infty to show that it is Markov 4-convex and cannot be Markov p-convex for any p < 4. As Markov convexity is a biLipschitz invariant and Hilbert space is Markov 2-convex, this gives a different proof of the classical theorem of Pansu and Semmes that the Heisenberg group does not admit a biLipschitz embedding into any Euclidean space.   The Markov convexity lower bound will follow from exhibiting an explicit embedding of Laakso graphs G_n into \mathbb{H}_\infty that has distortion at most C n^{1/4} \sqrt{\log n}. We use this to show that if X is a Markov p-convex metric space, then balls of the discrete Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}(\mathbb{Z}) of radius n embed into X with distortion at least some constant multiple of   \frac{(\log n)^{\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{4}}}{\sqrt{\log \log n}}.   Finally, we show that Markov 4-convexity does not give the optimal distortion for embeddings of binary trees B_m into \mathbb{H}_\infty by showing that the distortion is on the order of \sqrt{\log m}.
