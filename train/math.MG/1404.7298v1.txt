Code minimization provides a speed-up of the processing time of fringe projection based stereo sensors and possibly makes them real-time applicable. This paper reports a methodology which enables such sensors to completely omit Gray code or other additional code. Only a sequence of sinusoidal images is necessary. The code reduction is achieved by involvement of the projection unit into the measurement, double triangulation, and a precise projector calibration or significant projector calibration improvement, respectively.
