We prove the following theorem. Let \mu be a measure on R^n with even continuous density, and let K,L be origin-symmetric convex bodies in R^n so that \mu(K\cap H)\le \mu(L\cap H) for any central hyperplane H. Then \mu(K)\le \sqrt{n} \mu(L). We also prove this result with better constants for some special classes of measures and bodies. Finally, we prove a version of the hyperplane inequality for convex measures.
