We are interested in the convergence and the local regularity of the lacunary Fourier series F_s(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} \frac{e^{2i\pi n^2 x}}{n^s}. In the 1850's, Riemann introduced the series F_2 as a possible example of nowhere differentiable function, and the study of this function has drawn the interest of many mathematicians since then. We focus on the case when 1/2<s\leq 1, and we prove that F_s(x) converges when x satisfies a Diophantine condition. We also study the L^2- local regularity of F_s, proving that the local L^2-norm of F_s around a point x behave differently around different x, according again to Diophantine conditions on x.
