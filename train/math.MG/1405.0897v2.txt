In this paper, we generalize the finite generation result of Sormani to non-branching RCD(0,N) geodesic spaces (and in particular, Alexandrov spaces) with full support measures. This is a special case of the Milnor's Conjecture for complete non-compact RCD(0,N) spaces. One of the key tools we use is the Abresch-Gromoll type excess estimates for non-smooth spaces obtained by Gigli-Mosconii.
