Let U be an open relatively compact subanalytic subset of a real analytic manifold. We show that there exists a finite linear covering (in the sense of Guillermou and Schapira) of U by subanalytic open subsets of U homeomorphic to a unit ball.   We also show that the algebra of open relatively compact subanalytic subsets of a real analytic manifold is generated by subsets subanalytically and bi-lipschitz homeomorphic to a unit ball.
