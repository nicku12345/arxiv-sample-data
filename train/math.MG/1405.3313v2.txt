In this paper we address the relationship between Gromov-Hausdorff limits and intrinsic flat limits of complete Riemannian manifolds. In \cite{SormaniWenger2010, SormaniWenger2011}, Sormani-Wenger show that for a sequence of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, a uniform upper bound on diameter, and non-collapsed volume, the intrinsic flat limit exists and agrees with the Gromov-Hausdorff limit. This can be viewed as a non-cancellation theorem showing that for such sequences, points don't cancel each other out in the limit.   Here we prove a similar no-cancellation theorem, replacing the assumption of nonnegative Ricci curvature with a two-sided bound on Ricci curvature. This version corrects a mistake in the previous version of this paper (where we assume only an arbitrary lower Ricci bound) which was due to a crucial error in one of our supporting theorems for that argument.
