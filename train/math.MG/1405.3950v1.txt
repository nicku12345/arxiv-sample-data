For two planar convex bodies, C and D, consider a packing S of n positive homothets of C contained in D. We estimate the total perimeter of the bodies in S, denoted {\rm per}(S), in terms of {\rm per}(D) and n. When all homothets of C touch the boundary of the container D, we show that either {\rm per}(S)=O(\log n) or {\rm per}(S)=O(1), depending on how C and D "fit together," and these bounds are the best possible apart from the constant factors. Specifically, we establish an optimal bound {\rm per}(S)=O(\log n) unless D is a convex polygon and every side of D is parallel to a corresponding segment on the boundary of C (for short, D is \emph{parallel to} C). When D is parallel to C but the homothets of C may lie anywhere in D, we show that {\rm per}(S)=O((1+{\rm esc}(S)) \log n/\log \log n), where {\rm esc}(S) denotes the total distance of the bodies in S from the boundary of D. Apart from the constant factor, this bound is also the best possible.
