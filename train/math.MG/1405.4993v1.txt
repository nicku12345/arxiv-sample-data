Minkowski's 2nd theorem in the Geometry of Numbers provides optimal upper and lower bounds for the volume of a o-symmetric convex body in terms of its successive minima. In this paper we study extensions of this theorem from two different points of view: either relaxing the symmetry condition, assuming that the centroid of the set lies at the origin, or replacing the volume functional by the surface area.
