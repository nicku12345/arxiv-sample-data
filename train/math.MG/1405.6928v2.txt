The k-tiling problem for a convex polytope P is the problem of covering \mathbb R^d with translates of P using a discrete multiset \Lambda of translation vectors, such that every point in \mathbb R^d is covered exactly k times, except possibly for the boundary of P and its translates. A classical result in the study of tiling problems is a theorem of McMullen that a convex polytope P that 1-tiles \mathbb R^d with a discrete multiset \Lambda can, in fact, 1-tile \mathbb R^d with a lattice \mathcal L. A generalization of McMullen's theorem for k-tiling was conjectured by Gravin, Robins, and Shiryaev, which states that if P k-tiles \mathbb R^d with a discrete multiset \Lambda, then P m-tiles \mathbb R^d with a lattice \mathcal L for some m. In this paper, we consider the case when P k-tiles \mathbb R^d with a discrete multiset \Lambda such that every element of \Lambda is contained in a quasi-periodic set \mathcal Q (i.e. a finite union of translated lattices). This is motivated by the result of Gravin, Kolountzakis, Robins, and Shiryaev, showing that for d \in \{2,3\}, if a polytope P k-tiles \mathbb R^d with a discrete multiset \Lambda, then P m-tiles \mathbb R^d with a quasi-periodic set \mathcal Q for some m. Here we show for all values of d that if a polytope P k-tiles \mathbb R^d with a discrete multiset \Lambda that is contained in a quasi-periodic set \mathcal Q that satisfies a mild hypothesis, then P m-tiles \mathbb R^d with a lattice \mathcal L for some m. This strengthens the results of Gravin, Kolountzakis, Robins, and Shiryaev, and is a step in the direction of proving the conjecture of Gravin et al.
