A perfect prismatoid is a convex polytope P such that for every its facet F the set vert(P) \setminus vert(F) belongs to a supporting hyperplane \alpha \parallel F. We prove that every perfect prismatoid is affinely equivalent to some 0/1-polytope of the same dimension. (And therefore every perfect prismatoid is a lattice polytope.) Moreover, we prove that every perfect prismatoid is a lattice Delaunay polytope.
