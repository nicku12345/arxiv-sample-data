Let F be an n-point set in \mathbb{K}^d with \mathbb{K}\in\{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{Z}\} and d\geq 2. A (discrete) X-ray of F in direction s gives the number of points of F on each line parallel to s. We define \psi_{\mathbb{K}^d}(m) as the minimum number n for which there exist m directions s_1,...,s_m (pairwise linearly independent and spanning \mathbb{R}^d) such that two n-point sets in \mathbb{K}^d exist that have the same X-rays in these directions. The bound \psi_{\mathbb{Z}^d}(m)\leq 2^{m-1} has been observed many times in the literature. In this note we show \psi_{\mathbb{K}^d}(m)=O(m^{d+1+\varepsilon}) for \varepsilon>0. For the cases \mathbb{K}^d=\mathbb{Z}^d and \mathbb{K}^d=\mathbb{R}^d, d>2, this represents the first upper bound on \psi_{\mathbb{K}^d}(m) that is polynomial in m. As a corollary we derive bounds on the sizes of solutions to both the classical and two-dimensional Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem. Additionally, we establish lower bounds on \psi_{\mathbb{K}^d} that enable us to prove a strengthened version of R\'enyi's theorem for points in \mathbb{Z}^2.
