In this paper the theory of uniformly convex metric spaces is developed. These spaces exhibit a generalized convexity of the metric from a fixed point. Using a (nearly) uniform convexity property a simple proof of reflexivity is presented and a weak topology of such spaces is analyzed. This topology called co-convex topology agrees with the usualy weak topology in Banach spaces. An example of a CAT(0)-spaces with weak topology which is not Hausdorff is given. This answers questions raised by Monod 2006, Kirk and Panyanak 2008 and Esp\'inola and Fern\'andez-Le\'on 2009.   In the end existence and uniqueness of generalized barycenters is shown and a Banach-Saks property is proved.
