Weakly stationary random processes of k-dimensional affine subspaces (flats) in \mathbb{R}^n are considered. If 2k\geq n, then intersection processes are investigated, while in the complementary case 2k<n a proximity process is introduced. The intensity measures of these processes are described in terms of parameters of the underlying k-flat process. By a translation into geometric parameters of associated zonoids and by means of integral transformations, several new uniqueness and stability results for these processes of flats are derived. They rely on a combination of known and novel estimates for area measures of zonoids, which are also developed in the paper. Finally, an asymptotic second-order analysis as well as central and non-central limit theorems for length-power direction functionals of proximity processes derived from stationary Poisson k-flat process complement earlier works for intersection processes.
