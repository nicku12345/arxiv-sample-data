Let K and K_0 be convex bodies in \mathbb{R}^d, such that K contains the origin, and define the process (K_n, p_n), n \geq 0, as follows: let p_{n+1} be a uniform random point in K_n, and set K_{n+1} = K_n \cap (p_{n+1} + K). Clearly, (K_n) is a nested sequence of convex bodies which converge to a non-empty limit object, again a convex body in \mathbb{R}^d. We study this process for K being a regular simplex, a cube, or a regular convex polygon with an odd number of vertices. We also derive some new results in one dimension for non-uniform distributions.
