Let \partial{\bf H}^n_{\mathbb K} denote the boundary of a symmetric space of rank-one and of non-compact type and let d_{\mathfrak{H}} be the Kor\'anyi metric defined in \partial{\bf H}^n_{\mathbb K}. We prove that if d is a metric on \partial{\bf H}^n_{\mathbb K} such that all Heisenberg similarities are d-M\"obius maps, then under a topological condition d is a constant multiple of a power of d_{\mathfrak{H}}.
