In this paper we investigate the combinatorial structure of 3-dimensional Minkowski-Voronoi continued fractions. Our main goal is to prove the asymptotic stability of Minkowski-Voronoi complexes in special two-parametric families of rank-1 lattices. In addition we construct explicitly the complexes for the case of White's rank-1 lattices and provide with a hypothetic description in a more complicated settings.
