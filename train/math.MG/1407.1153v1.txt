Characterizations of binary operations between convex bodies on the Euclidean unit sphere are established. The main result shows that the convex hull is essentially the only non-trivial projection covariant operation between pairs of convex bodies contained in open hemispheres. Moreover, it is proved that any continuous and projection covariant binary operation between all proper spherical convex bodies must be trivial.
