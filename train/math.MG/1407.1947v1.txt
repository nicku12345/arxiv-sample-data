We prove that for a topological space X with the property that H_p(U)=0 for p\geq d and every open subset U of X, a finite family of open sets in X has nonempty intersection if for any subfamily of size j, 1\leq j \leq d+1, the (d-j)-dimensional homology group of its intersection is zero. We use this theorem to prove new results concerning transversal affine planes to families of convex sets.
