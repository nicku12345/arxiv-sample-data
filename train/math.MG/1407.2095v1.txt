We demonstrate the existence of four types of flexible prismatic polyhedra that can be derived or inferred from a consideration of Bricard octahedra and generalizations of Bricard octahedra. These flexible polyhedra are of genus 0 and 1, have dihedral angles all of which are non-constant under flexion, have faces that exhibit self-intersections, have an indefinite number of faces and have vertex motion that can treated as a function of a single variable.
