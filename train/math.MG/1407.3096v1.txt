We study the quantization for a class of in-homogeneous self-similar measures \mu supported on self-similar sets. Assuming the open set condition for the corresponding iterated function system, we prove the existence of the quantization dimension for \mu of order r\in(0,\infty) and determine its exact value \xi_r. Furthermore, we show that, the \xi_r-dimensional lower quantization coefficient for \mu is always positive and the upper one can be infinite. We also give a sufficient condition to ensure the finiteness of the upper quantization coefficient.
