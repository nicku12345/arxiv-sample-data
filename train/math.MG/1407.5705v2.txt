A bipartite graph G is semi-algebraic in \mathbb{R}^d if its vertices are represented by point sets P,Q \subset \mathbb{R}^d and its edges are defined as pairs of points (p,q) \in P\times Q that satisfy a Boolean combination of a fixed number of polynomial equations and inequalities in 2d coordinates. We show that for fixed k, the maximum number of edges in a K_{k,k}-free semi-algebraic bipartite graph G = (P,Q,E) in \mathbb{R}^2 with |P| = m and |Q| = n is at most O((mn)^{2/3} + m + n), and this bound is tight. In dimensions d \geq 3, we show that all such semi-algebraic graphs have at most C\left((mn)^{ \frac{d}{d+1} + \varepsilon} + m + n\right) edges, where here \varepsilon is an arbitrarily small constant and C = C(d,k,t,\varepsilon). This result is a far-reaching generalization of the classical Szemer\'edi-Trotter incidence theorem. The proof combines tools from several fields: VC-dimension and shatter functions, polynomial partitioning, and Hilbert polynomials.   We also present various applications of our theorem. For example, a general point-variety incidence bound in \mathbb{R}^d, an improved bound for a d-dimensional variant of the Erd\H{o}s unit distances problem, and more.
