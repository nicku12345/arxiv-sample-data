An orthant polyhedron is a polyhedron with m hyperfaces, that could be realized as a section of the m-dimensional non-negative orthant. We classify all 2-dimensional orthant polyhedra and provide some partial results towards the classification of higher dimensional orthant polyhedra. As a consequence of our results we show that every polytope could be realized as a section of the n-dimensional non-negative orthant with n being big enough.
