{We show in this paper that two normal elliptic sections through every point of the boundary of a smooth convex body essentially characterize an ellipsoid and furthermore, that four different pairwise non-tangent elliptic sections through every point of the C^2-differentiable boundary of a convex body also essentially characterize an ellipsoid.
