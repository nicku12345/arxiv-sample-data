The Orlicz-Legendre ellipsoids, which are in the framework of emerging dual Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski theory, are introduced for the first time. They are in some sense dual to the recently found Orlicz-John ellipsoids, and have largely generalized the classical Legendre ellipsoid of inertia. Several new affine isoperimetric inequalities are established. The connection between the characterization of Orlicz-Legendre ellipsoids and isotropy of measures is demonstrated.
