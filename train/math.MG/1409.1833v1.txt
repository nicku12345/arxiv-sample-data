In this note, we completely describe the shape of the bisector of two given points in a two-dimensional normed vector space. More precisely, we show that, depending on the position of two given points with respect to the shape of the unit circle, the following holds: the bisector of a non-strict pair of points consists of two cones and a curve, which has properties similar to those of bisectors of strict pairs of points.
