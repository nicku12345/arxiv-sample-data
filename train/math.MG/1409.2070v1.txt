The uniform disconnectedness is an important invariant property under bi-Lipschitz mapping, and the Assouad dimension \dim _{A}X<1 implies the uniform disconnectedness of X. According to quasi-Lipschitz mapping, we introduce the quasi-Assouad dimension \dim _{qA} such that \dim _{qA}X<1 implies its quasi uniform disconnectedness. We obtain \overline{\dim } _{B}X\leq \dim _{qA}X\leq \dim _{A}X and compute the quasi-Assouad dimension of Moran set.
