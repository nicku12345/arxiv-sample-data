We show that random walk on a stationary random graph with positive anchored expansion and exponential volume growth has positive speed. We also show that two families of random triangulations of the hyperbolic plane, the hyperbolic Poisson Voronoi tessellation and the hyperbolic Poisson Delaunay triangulation, have 1-skeletons with positive anchored expansion. As a consequence, we show that the simple random walks on these graphs have positive speed. We include a section of open problems and conjectures on the topics of stationary geometric random graphs and the hyperbolic Poisson Voronoi tessellation.
