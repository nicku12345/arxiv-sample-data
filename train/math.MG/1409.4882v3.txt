The goal of this paper is to describe the \alpha-cosine transform on functions on a Grassmannian of i-planes in an n-dimensional real vector space. in analytic terms as explicitly as possible. We show that for all but finitely many complex \alpha the \alpha-cosine transform is a composition of the (\alpha+2)-cosine transform with an explicitly written (though complicated) O(n)-invariant differential operator. For all exceptional values of \alpha except one we interpret the \alpha-cosine transform explicitly as either the Radon transform or composition of two Radon transforms. Explicit interpretation of the transform corresponding to the last remaining value \alpha, which is -(min\{i,n-i\}+1), is still an open problem.
