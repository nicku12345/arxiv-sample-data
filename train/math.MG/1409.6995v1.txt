We give a new upper bound of the cardinality of a set of equiangular lines in \R^n with a fixed angle \theta for each (n,\theta) satisfying certain conditions. Our techniques are based on semi-definite programming methods for spherical codes introduced by Bachoc--Vallentin [J.Amer.Math.Soc.2008]. As a corollary to our bound, we show the nonexistence of spherical tight designs of harmonic index 4 on S^{n-1} with n \geq 3.
