Let K be a convex body in \mathbb{R}^d which slides freely in a ball. Let K^{(n)} denote the intersection of n closed half-spaces containing K whose bounding hyperplanes are independent and identically distributed according to a certain prescribed probability distribution. We prove an asymptotic formula for the expectation of the difference of the volumes of K^{(n)} and K, and an asymptotic upper bound on the variance of the volume of K^{(n)}. We achieve these results by first proving similar statements for weighted mean width approximations of convex bodies that admit a rolling ball by inscribed random polytopes and then by polarizing these results.
