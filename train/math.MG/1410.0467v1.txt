Let \mathcal{F} be a family of n axis-parallel boxes in \mathbb{R}^d and \alpha\in (1-1/d,1] a real number. There exists a real number \beta(\alpha )>0 such that if there are \alpha {n\choose 2} intersecting pairs in \mathcal{F}, then \mathcal{F} contains an intersecting subfamily of size \beta n. A simple example shows that the above statement is best possible in the sense that if \alpha \leq 1-1/d, then there may be no point in \mathbb{R}^d that belongs to more than d elements of \mathcal{F}.
