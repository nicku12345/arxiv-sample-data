We introduce a formalism for the geometry of eukaryotic cells and organisms.Cells are taken to be star-convex with good biological reason. This allows for a convenient description of their extent in space as well as all manner of cell surface gradients. We assume that a spectrum of such cell surface markers determines an epigenetic code for organism shape. The union of cells in space at a moment in time is by definition the organism taken as a metric subspace of Euclidean space, which can be further equipped with an arbitrary measure. Each cell determines a point in space thus assigning a finite configuration of distinct points in space to an organism, and a bundle over this configuration space is introduced with fiber a Hilbert space recording specific epigenetic data. On this bundle, a Lagrangian formulation of morphogenetic dynamics is proposed based on Gromov-Hausdorff distance which at once describes both embryo development and regenerative growth.
