We consider sequential random packing of integral translate of cubes [0,N]^n into the torus Z^n / 2NZ^n. Two special cases are of special interest:   (i) The case N=2 which corresponds to a discrete case of tilings (considered in \cite{cubetiling,book})   (ii) The case N=\infty corresponds to a case of continuous tilings (considered in \cite{combincubepack,book})   Both cases correspond to some special combinatorial structure and we describe here new developments.
