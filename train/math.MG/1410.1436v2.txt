We study L^p(\mu) \to L^q(\nu) mapping properties of the convolution operator  T_{\lambda}f(x)=\lambda*(f\mu)(x) and of the corresponding maximal operator  {\mathcal T}_{\lambda}f(x)=\sup_{t>0} |\lambda_t*(f\mu)(x)|, where \lambda is a tempered distribution, and \mu and \nu are compactly supported measures satisfying the polynomial growth bounds \mu(B(x,r)) \leq Cr^{s_{\mu}} and \nu(B(x,r)) \leq Cr^{s_{\nu}}. As a result, we prove variants of the classical L^p-improving (Littman; Strichartz) and maximal (Stein) inequalities in a setting where the Plancherel formula is not available. Connections with the David-Semmes conjecture are also discussed.
