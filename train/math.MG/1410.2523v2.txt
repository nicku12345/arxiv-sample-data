We explore a generalisation of the L\'evy fractional Brownian field on the Euclidean space based on replacing the Euclidean norm with another norm. A characterisation result for admissible norms yields a complete description of all self-similar Gaussian random fields with stationary increments. Several integral representations of the introduced random fields are derived. In a similar vein, several non-Euclidean variants of the fractional Poisson field are introduced and it is shown that they share the covariance structure with the fractional Brownian field and converge to it. The shape parameters of the Poisson and Brownian variants are related by convex geometry transforms, namely the radial pth mean body and the polar projection transforms.
