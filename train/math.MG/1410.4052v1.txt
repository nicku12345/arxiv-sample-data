We describe a hyperbolic version of the Ambartzumian-Pleijel identity. We use this identity to prove the hyperbolic Crofton formula and the hyperbolic isoperimetric inequality. This identity also provides a way to compute the chord length distribution for an ideal polygon in the hyperbolic plane. The analogous results for a maximally symmetric, simply connected, 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature are given at the end.
