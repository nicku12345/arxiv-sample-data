Using the method of C. V\"or\"os, we establish results on hyperbolic plane geometry, related to triangles. In this note we investigate the orthocenter, the concept of isogonal conjugate and some further center as of the symmedian of a triangle. We also investigate the role of the "Euler line" and the pseudo-centers of a triangle.
