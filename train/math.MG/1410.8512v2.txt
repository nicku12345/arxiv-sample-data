Let G and G' be two right-angled Artin groups (RAAG). We show they are quasi-isometric iff they are isomorphic, under the assumption that Out(G) and Out(G') are finite. If only Out(G) is finite, then G' is quasi-isometric G iff G' is isomorphic to a finite index subgroup of G. In this case, we give an algorithm to determine whether G and G' are quasi-isometric by looking at their defining graphs.
