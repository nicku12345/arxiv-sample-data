We discuss the spectrum phenomenon for Lipschitz functions on the infinite-dimensional torus. Suppose that f is a measurable, real-valued, Lipschitz function on the torus \mathbb{T}^{\infty}. We prove that there exists a number a \in \mathbb R with the following property: For any \epsilon > 0 there exists a parallel, infinite-dimensional subtorus M \subseteq \mathbb T^{\infty} such that the restriction of the function f-a to the subtorus M has an L^{\infty}(M)-norm of at most \epsilon.
