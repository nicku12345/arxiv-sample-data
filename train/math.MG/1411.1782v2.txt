Any convex polytope whose combinatorial automorphism group has two orbits on the flags is isomorphic to one whose group of Euclidean symmetries has two orbits on the flags (equivalently, to one whose automorphism group and symmetry group coincide.) Hence, a combinatorially two-orbit convex polytope is isomorphic to one of a known finite list, all of which are 3-dimensional: the cuboctahedron, icosidodecahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, or rhombic triacontahedron. The same is true of combinatorially two-orbit normal face-to-face tilings by convex polytopes.
