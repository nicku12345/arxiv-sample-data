A new integral representation of smooth translation invariant and rotation equivariant even Minkowski valuations is established. Explicit formulas relating previously obtained descriptions of such valuations with the new more accessible one are also derived. Moreover, the action of Alesker's Hard Lefschetz operators on these Minkowski valuations is explored in detail.
