In this paper, we study the following problem: Let D\geq 2 and let E\subset \mathbb R^D be finite satisfying certain conditions. Suppose that we are given a map \phi:E\to \mathbb R^D with \phi a small distortion on E. How can one decide whether \phi extends to a smooth small distortion \Phi:\mathbb R^D\to \mathbb R^D which agrees with \phi on E. We also ask how to decide if in addition \Phi can be approximated well by certain rigid and non-rigid motions from \mathbb R^D\to \mathbb R^D. Since E is a finite set, this question is basic to interpolation and alignment of data in \mathbb R^D.
