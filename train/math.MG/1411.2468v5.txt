Let D\geq 2, S\subset \mathbb R^D be finite and let \phi:S\to \mathbb R^D with \phi a small distortion on S. We solve the Whitney extension-interpolation-alignment problem of how to understand when \phi can be extended to a function \Phi:\mathbb R^D\to \mathbb R^D which is a smooth small distortion on \mathbb R^D. Our main results are in addition to Whitney extensions, results on interpolation and alignment of data in \mathbb R^D and complement those of [14,15,20].
