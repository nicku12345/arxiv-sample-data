We consider a different L^p-Minkowski combination of compact sets in \mathbb{R}^n than the one introduced by Firey and we prove an L^p-Brunn-Minkowski inequality, p \in [0,1], for a general class of measures called convex measures that includes log-concave measures, under unconditional assumptions. As a consequence, we derive concavity properties of the function t \mapsto \mu(t^{\frac{1}{p}} A), p \in (0,1], for unconditional convex measures \mu and unconditional convex body A in \mathbb{R}^n. We also prove that the (B)-conjecture for all uniform measures is equivalent to the (B)-conjecture for all log-concave measures, completing recent works by Saroglou.
