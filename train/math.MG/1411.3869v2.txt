We describe a simple geometric transformation of triangles which leads to an efficient and effective algorithm to smooth triangle and tetrahedral meshes. Our focus lies on the convergence properties of this algorithm: we prove the effectivity for some planar triangle meshes and further introduce dynamical methods to study the dynamics of the algorithm which may be used for any kind of algorithm based on a geometric transformation.
