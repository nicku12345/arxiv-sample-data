We show a distortion lower bound of \Omega(\log(h)^{1/p}) when embedding the countably branching hyperbolic tree of height h into a Banach space with an equivalent norm satisfying Rolewicz property (\beta) with modulus of power type p>1. Similarly we show that a distortion lower bound of \Omega(l^{1/p}) is incurred when embedding the parasol graphs with l levels into a Banach space with the above property. We discuss the optimality of our results as well as several applications.
