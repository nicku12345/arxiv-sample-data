We introduce a smoothing algorithm for triangle, quadrilateral, tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes whose centerpiece is a simple geometric triangle transformation. The first part focuses on the mathematical properties of the element transformation. In particular, the transformation gives rise directly to a continuous model given by a system of coupled damped oscillations. Derived from this physical model, adaptive parameters are introduced and their benefits presented. The second part discusses the mesh smoothing algorithm based on the element transformation and its numerical performance on example meshes.
