It is conjectured that for every convex disks K, the translative covering density of K and the lattice covering density of K are identical. It is well known that this conjecture is true for every centrally symmetric convex disks. For the non-symmetric case, we only know that the conjecture is true for triangles. In this paper, we prove the conjecture for a class of convex disks (quarter-convex disks), which includes all triangles and convex quadrilaterals.
