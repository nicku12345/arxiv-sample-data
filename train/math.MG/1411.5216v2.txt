The equality constraint a+b+c=1 for random triangle sides corresponds to breaking a stick in two places. An analog a^2+b^2+c^2=1 has a remarkable feature: the bivariate density for angles coincides with that for 3D Gaussian triangles. Interesting complications also arise for a+b=1 and for a^2+b^2=1, with the understanding that the angle gamma opposite side c is Uniform[0,pi]. Closed-form expressions for several side moments remain open.
