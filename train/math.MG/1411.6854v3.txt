We study sequences of integral current spaces (X_j,d_j,T_j) such that the integral current structure T_j has weight 1 and no boundary and, all (X_j,d_j) are closed Alexandrov spaces with curvature uniformly bounded from below and diameter uniformly bounded from above. We prove that for such sequences either their limits collapse or the Gromov-Hausdorff and Sormani-Wenger Intrinsic Flat limits agree. The latter is done showing that the lower n dimensional density of the mass measure at any regular point of the Gromov-Hausdorff limit space is positive by passing to a filling volume estimate.   In an appendix we show that the filling volume of the standard n dimensional integral current space coming from an n dimensional sphere of radius r>0 in Euclidean space equals r^n times the filling volume of the n dimensional integral current space coming from the n dimensional sphere of radius 1.
