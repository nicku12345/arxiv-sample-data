Extending results of Hershberger and Suri for the Euclidean plane, we show that ball hulls and ball intersections of sets of n points in strictly convex normed planes can be constructed in O(n \log n) time. In addition, we confirm that, like in the Euclidean subcase, the 2-center problem with constrained circles can be solved also for strictly convex normed planes in O(n^2) time. Some ideas for extending these results to more general types of normed planes are also presented.
