The article studies power complexes and generalized power complexes, and investigates the algebraic structure of their automorphism groups. The combinatorial incidence structures involved are cube-like, in the sense that they have many structural properties in common with higher-dimensional cubes and cubical tessellations on manifolds. Power complexes have repeatedly appeared in applications.
