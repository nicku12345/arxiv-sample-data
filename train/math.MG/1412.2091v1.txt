We examine the measurable chromatic number of distance colorings on the surface of 2-dimensional spheres of varying radii, showing in particular that similar arguments to those used to raise lower bounds in the plane work for all but a countable set of radii. Furthermore, we show that measurable chromatic number as a function of the radius, or more generally the curvature, is not monotonic.
