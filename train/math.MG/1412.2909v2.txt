We discuss a unified approach to a class of geometric combinatorics incidence problems in 2D, of the Erd\"os distance type. The goal is obtaining the second moment estimate, that is given a finite point set S and a function f on S\times S, an upper bound on the number of solutions of    f(p,p') = f(q,q')\neq 0,\qquad (p,p',q,q')\in S\times S\times S\times S. \qquad(*)  E.g., f is the Euclidean distance in the plane, sphere, or a sheet of the two-sheeted hyperboloid.   Our tool is the Guth-Katz incidence theorem for lines in \mathbb{RP}^3, but we focus on how the original 2D problem is made amenable to it. This procedure was initiated by Elekes and Sharir, based on symmetry considerations. However, symmetry considerations can be bypassed or made implicit. The classical Pl\"ucker-Klein formalism for line geometry enables one to directly interpret a solution of (*) as intersection of two lines in \mathbb{RP}^3. This allows for a very brief argument extending the Euclidean plane distance argument to the spherical and hyperbolic distances. We also find instances of the question (*) without underlying symmetry group.   The space of lines in the three-space, the Klein quadric \mathcal K, is four-dimensional. We start out with an injective map \mathfrak F:\,S\times S\to\mathcal K, from a pair of points in 2D to a line in 3D and seek a combinatorial problem in the form (*), which can be solved by applying the Guth-Katz theorem to the set of lines in question. We identify a few new such problems and generalise the existing ones.
