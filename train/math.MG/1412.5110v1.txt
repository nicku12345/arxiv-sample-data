Let \Omega be a planar Jordan domain and \alpha>0. We consider double-dome-like surfaces \Sigma(\Omega,t^{\alpha}) over \overline{\Omega} where the height of the surface over any point x\in\overline{\Omega} equals \text{dist}(x,\partial\Omega)^{\alpha}. We identify the necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of \Omega and \alpha so that these surfaces are quasisymmetric to \mathbb{S}^2 and we show that \Sigma(\Omega,t^{\alpha}) is quasisymmetric to the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^2 if and only if it is linearly locally connected and Ahlfors 2-regular.
