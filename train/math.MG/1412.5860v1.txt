To generate a triangle of unit perimeter, break a stick of length 1 in two places at random, with the condition that triangle inequalities are satisfied. Is there a similarly natural method for generating triangles of unit area? Study of a product (rather than a sum) of random lengths is facilitated by closure of multiplication within the lognormal family of distributions. Our (necessarily incomplete) answers to the question each draw upon this property.
