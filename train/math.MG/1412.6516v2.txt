We consider the stable norm associated to a discrete, torsionless abelian group of isometries \Gamma \cong \mathbb{Z}^n of a geodesic space (X,d). We show that the difference between the stable norm \| \;\, \|_{st} and the distance d is bounded by a constant only depending on the rank n and on upper bounds for the diameter of \bar X=\Gamma \backslash X and the asymptotic volume \omega(\Gamma, d). We also prove that the upper bound on the asymptotic volume is equivalent to a lower bound for the stable systole of the action of \Gamma on (X,d); for this, we establish a Lemma \`a la Margulis for \mathbb{Z}^n-actions, which gives optimal estimates of \omega(\Gamma,d) in terms of \mathrm{stsys}(\Gamma,d), and vice versa, and characterize the cases of equality. Moreover, we show that all the parameters n, \mathrm{diam}(\bar X) and \omega (\Gamma, d) (or \mathrm{stsys} (\Gamma,d)) are necessary to bound the difference d -\| \;\, \|_{st}, by providing explicit counterexamples for each case. As an application, we prove that the number of connected components of any optimal, integral 1-cycle in a closed Riemannian manifold \bar X either is bounded by an explicit function of the first Betti number,  \mathrm{diam}(\bar X) and \omega(H_1(\bar X, \mathbb{Z}), d), or is a sublinear function of the mass.
