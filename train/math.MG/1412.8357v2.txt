We identify two sufficient conditions for locally finite Borel measures on \mathbb{R}^n to give full mass to a countable family of Lipschitz images of \mathbb{R}^m. The first condition, extending a prior result of Pajot, is a sufficient test in terms of L^p affine approximability for a locally finite Borel measure \mu on \mathbb{R}^n satisfying the global regularity hypothesis \limsup_{r\downarrow 0} \mu(B(x,r))/r^m <\infty\quad \text{at \mu-a.e. x\in\mathbb{R}^n} to be m-rectifiable in the sense above. The second condition is an assumption on the growth rate of the 1-density that ensures a locally finite Borel measure \mu on \mathbb{R}^n with \lim_{r\downarrow 0} \mu(B(x,r))/r=\infty\quad\text{at \mu-a.e. x\in\mathbb{R}^n} is 1-rectifiable.
