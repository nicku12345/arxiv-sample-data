We consider a generalization of the hyperplane problem to arbitrary measures in place of volume and to sections of lower dimensions. We prove this generalization for unconditional convex bodies and for duals of bodies with bounded volume ratio. We also prove it for arbitrary symmetric convex bodies under the condition that the dimension of sections is less than \lambda n for some \lambda\in (0,1). The constant depends only on \lambda. Finally, we show that the behavior of the minimal sections for some measures may be different from the case of volume.
