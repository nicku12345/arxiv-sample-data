Following and developing ideas of R. Karasev (Covering dimension using toric varieties, arXiv:1307.3437), we extend the Lebesgue theorem (on covers of cubes) and the Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz theorem (on covers of simplices) to different classes of convex polytopes (colored in the sense of M. Joswig). We also show that the n-dimensional Hex theorem admits a generalization where the n-dimensional cube is replaced by a n-colorable simple polytope. The use of quasitoric manifolds offers great flexibility and versatility in applying the general method.
