Analytical expressions for the distribution of the length of chords corresponding to the affine invariant measure on the set of chords are given for convex polygons. These analytical expressions are a computational improvement over other expressions published in 2011. The correlation function of convex polygons can be computed from the results obtained in this work, because it is determined by the distribution of chords.   An analytical expression for the multi-chord distribution of the length of chords corresponding to the affine invariant measure on the set of chords is found for non convex polygons. In addition we give an algorithm to find this multi-chord distribution which, for many concave polygons, is computationally more efficient than the said analytical expression. The results also apply to non simply connected polygons.
