Since the recent dissertation by Steffen Winter, for certain self-similar sets F the growth behaviour of the Minkowski functionals of the parallel sets F_\varepsilon := \{x\in \mathbb R^d : d(x,F)\leq \varepsilon\} as \varepsilon \downarrow 0 is known, leading to the notion of fractal curvatures C_k^f(F), k\in \{0,\ldots,d\}. The dependence of the growth behaviour on the fractal dimension s = \dim F is exploited, and estimators for s and C_k^f(F) are derived. The performance of these estimators is tested on binary images of self-similar sets.
