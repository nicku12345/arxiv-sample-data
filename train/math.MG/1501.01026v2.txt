In this paper, we present a new characterization of the mappings of bounded length distortion (BLD for short). In the original geometric definition it is assumed that a BLD mapping is open, discrete and sense preserving. We prove that the first two of the three conditions are redundant and the sense-preserving condition can be replaced by a weaker assumption that the Jacobian is non-negative.
