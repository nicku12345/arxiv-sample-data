By a {\em Voronoi parallelotope} P(a) we mean a parallelotope determined by a non-negative quadratic form a. It was studied by Voronoi in his famous memoir. For a set of vectors \mathcal P, we call its {\em dual} a set of vectors {\mathcal P}^* such that \langle p,q\rangle\in\{0,\pm 1\} for all p\in{\mathcal P} and q\in{\mathcal P}^*. We prove that Minkowski sum of a Voronoi parallelotope P(a) and a segment is a Voronoi parallelotope P(a+a_e) if and only if this segment is parallel to a vector e of the dual of the set of normal vectors of all facets of P(a), where a_e(p)=b\langle e,p\rangle^2 is a quadratic form of rank 1 related to the segment.
