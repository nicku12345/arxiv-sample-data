A rigidity theory is developed for bar-joint frameworks in \mathbb{R}^{d+1} whose vertices are constrained to lie on concentric d-spheres with independently variable radii. In particular, combinatorial characterisations are established for the rigidity of generic frameworks for d=1 with an arbitrary number of independently variable radii, and for d=2 with at most two variable radii. This includes a characterisation of the rigidity or flexibility of uniformly expanding spherical frameworks in \mathbb{R}^{3}. Due to the equivalence of the generic rigidity between Euclidean space and spherical space, these results interpolate between rigidity in 1D and 2D and to some extent between rigidity in 2D and 3D. Symmetry-adapted counts for the detection of symmetry-induced continuous flexibility in frameworks on spheres with variable radii are also provided.
