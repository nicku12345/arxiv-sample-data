We formulate a mathematical theory of auxetic behavior based on one-parameter deformations of periodic frameworks. Our approach is purely geometric, relies on the evolution of the periodicity lattice and works in any dimension. We demonstrate its usefulness by predicting or recognizing, without experiment, computer simulations or numerical approximations, the auxetic capabilities of several well-known structures available in the literature. We propose new principles of auxetic design and rely on the stronger notion of expansive behavior to provide an infinite supply of planar auxetic mechanisms and several new three-dimensional structures.
