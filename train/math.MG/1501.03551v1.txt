For materials science, diamond crystals are almost unrivaled for hardness and a range of other properties. Yet, when simply abstracting the carbon bonding structure as a geometric bar-and-joint periodic framework, it is far from rigid. We study the geometric deformations of this type of framework in arbitrary dimension d, with particular regard to the volume variation of a unit cell.
