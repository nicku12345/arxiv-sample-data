For subsets of \mathbb{R}^+ we consider the local right upper porosity and the local right lower porosity as elements of a cluster set of all porosity numbers. The use of a scaling function \mu:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}^+ provides an extension of the concept of porosity numbers on subsets of \mathbb{N}. The main results describe interconnections between porosity numbers of a set, features of the scaling functions and the geometry of so-called pretangent spaces to this set.
