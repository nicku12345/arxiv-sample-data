A long-standing conjecture of Lapidus claims that under certain conditions, self-similar fractal sets fail to be Minkowski measurable if and only if they are of lattice type. The theorem was established for fractal subsets of \mathbb{R} by Falconer, Lapidus and v.~Frankenhuijsen, and the forward direction was shown for fractal subsets of \mathbb{R}^d, d \geq 2, by Gatzouras. Since then, much effort has been made to prove the converse. In this paper, we prove a partial converse by means of renewal theory. Our proof allows us to recover several previous results in this regard, but is much shorter and extends to a more general setting; several technical conditions appearing in previous versions of this result have now been removed.
