We report here a computation giving the complete list of facets for the cut polytopes over several very symmetric graphs with 15-30 edges, including K_8, K_{3,3,3}, K_{1,4,4}, K_{5,5}, some other K_{l,m}, K_{1,l,m}, Prism_7, APrism_6, M\"{o}bius ladder M_{14}, Dodecahedron, Heawood and Petersen graphs.   For K_8, it shows that the huge lists of facets of the cut polytope CUTP_8 and cut cone CUT_8, given in [CR] is complete. We also confirm the conjecture that any facet of CUTP_8 is adjacent to a triangle facet.   The lists of facets for K_{1,l,m} with (l,m)=(4,4),(3,5),(3,4) solve problems (see, for example, [Werner]) in quantum information theory.
