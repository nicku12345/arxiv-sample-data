We settle the first unsolved case of a problem of P. M. Gruber, asked by him in 1991, namely, to investigate the homomorphisms from the lattice of convex bodies of {\mathbb{E}}^c to the lattice of convex bodies of {\mathbb{E}}^d for c<d. We completely describe these homomorphisms for the case d=c+1, for c \ge 3. The obtained result is then applied to characterize anti-homomorphisms and homomorphisms from lattices of convex bodies to lattices of convex functions.
