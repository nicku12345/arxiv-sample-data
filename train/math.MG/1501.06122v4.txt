Laczkovich proved that if bounded subsets A and B of R^k have the same non-zero Lebesgue measure and the box dimension of the boundary of each set is less than k, then there is a partition of A into finitely many parts that can be translated to form a partition of B. Here we show that it can be additionally required that each part is both Baire and Lebesgue measurable. As special cases, this gives measurable and translation-only versions of Tarski's circle squaring and Hilbert's third problem.
