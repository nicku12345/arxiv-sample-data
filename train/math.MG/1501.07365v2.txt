In this paper, we construct two types of 7R closed single loop linkages by combining different factorizations of a general (non-vertical) Darboux motion. These factorizations are obtained by extensions of a factorization algorithm for a generic rational motion. The first type of 7R linkages has several one-dimensional configuration components and one of them corresponds to the Darboux motion. The other type is a 7R linkage with two degrees of freedom and without one-dimensional component. The Darboux motion is a curve in an irreducible two dimensional configuration component.
