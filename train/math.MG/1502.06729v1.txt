We consider the space of convex functions defined in the Euclidean n-dimensional space, which are lower semi-continuous and tend to infinity at infinity. We study real-valued valuations defined on this space of functions, which are invariant under the composition with rigid motions, monotone and verify a certain type of continuity. Among these valuations we prove integral representation formulas for those which are, additionally, simple or homogeneous.
