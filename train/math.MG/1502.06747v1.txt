The kth projection function v_k(K,\cdot) of a convex body K\subset {\mathbb R}^d, d\ge 3, is a function on the Grassmannian G(d,k) which measures the k-dimensional volume of the projection of K onto members of G(d,k). For k=1 and k=d-1, simple formulas for the projection functions exist. In particular, v_{d-1}(K,\cdot) can be written as a spherical integral with respect to the surface area measure of K. Here, we generalize this result and prove two integral representations for v_k(K,\cdot), k=1,\dots,d-1, over flag manifolds. Whereas the first representation generalizes a result of Ambartzumian (1987), but uses a flag measure which is not continuous in K, the second representation is related to a recent flag formula for mixed volumes by Hug, Rataj and Weil (2013) and depends continuously on K.
