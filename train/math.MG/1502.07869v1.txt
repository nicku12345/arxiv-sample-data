We consider the following question. Suppose that d\ge2 and n are fixed, and that \theta_1,\theta_2,\dots,\theta_n are n specified angles. How many points do we need to place in \mathbb{R}^d to realise all of these angles?   A simple degrees of freedom argument shows that m points in \mathbb{R}^2 cannot realise more than 2m-4 general angles. We give a construction to show that this bound is sharp when m\ge 5.   In d dimensions the degrees of freedom argument gives an upper bound of dm-\binom{d+1}{2}-1 general angles. However, the above result does not generalise to this case; surprisingly, the bound of 2m-4 from two dimensions cannot be improved at all. Indeed, our main result is that there are sets of 2m-3 of angles that cannot be realised by m points in any dimension.
