If X is a geodesic metric space and x_{1},x_{2},x_{3} \in X, a geodesic triangle T=\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\} is the union of the three geodesics [x_{1}x_{2}], [x_{2}x_{3}] and [x_{3}x_{1}] in X. The space X is \delta-hyperbolic in the Gromov sense if any side of T is contained in a \delta-neighborhood of the union of the two other sides, for every geodesic triangle T in X.   If X is hyperbolic, we denote by \delta(X) the sharp hyperbolicity constant of X, i.e. \delta(X) =\inf \{ \delta\geq 0:{0.3cm} X {0.2cm} \text{is} {0.2cm} \delta \text{-hyperbolic} \}. To compute the hyperbolicity constant is a very hard problem. Then it is natural to try to bound the hyperbolycity constant in terms of some parameters of the graph. Denote by \mathcal{G}(n,m) the set of graphs G with n vertices and m edges, and such that every edge has length 1. In this work we estimate A(n,m):=\min\{\delta(G)\mid G \in \mathcal{G}(n,m) \} and B(n,m):=\max\{\delta(G)\mid G \in \mathcal{G}(n,m) \}. In particular, we obtain good bounds for B(n,m), and we compute the precise value of A(n,m) for all values of n and m. Besides, we apply these results to random graphs.
