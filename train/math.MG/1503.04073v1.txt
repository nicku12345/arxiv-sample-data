It is known that there exists a function interpolating a given data set such that the graph of the function is the attractor of an iterated function system which is called fractal interpolation function. We generalize the notion of fractal interpolation function to the graph-directed case and prove that for a finite number of data sets there exist interpolation functions each of which interpolates corresponding data set in \mathbb{R}^2 such that the graphs of the interpolation functions are attractors of a graph-directed iterated function system.
