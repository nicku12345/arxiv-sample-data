The lists of facets -- 298,592 in 86 orbits -- and of extreme rays -- 242,695,427 in 9,003 orbits -- of the hypermetric cone HYP_8 are computed. The first generalization considered is the hypermetric polytope HYPP_n for which we give general algorithms and a description for n\le 8. Then we shortly consider generalizations to simplices of volume higher than 1, hypermetric on graphs and infinite dimensional hypermetrics.
