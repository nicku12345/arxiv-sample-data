We characterize the positive radial continuous and rotation invariant valuations V defined on the star bodies of \mathbb R^n as the applications on star bodies which admit an integral representation with respect to the Lebesgue measure. That is, V(K)=\int_{S^{n-1}}\theta(\rho_K)dm, where \theta is a positive continuous function, \rho_K is the radial function associated to K and m is the Lebesgue measure on S^{n-1}. As a corollary, we obtain that every such valuation can be uniformly approximated on bounded sets by a linear combination of dual quermassintegrals.
