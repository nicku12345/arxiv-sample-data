A topological space X is called a topological fractal if X=\bigcup_{f\in\mathcal F}f(X) for a finite system \mathcal F of continuous self-maps of X, which is topologically contracting in the sense that for every open cover \mathcal U of X there is a number n\in\mathbb N such that for any functions f_1,\dots,f_n\in \mathcal F, the set f_1\circ\dots\circ f_n(X) is contained in some set U\in\mathcal U. If, in addition, all functions f\in\mathcal F have Lipschitz constant <1 with respect to some metric generating the topology of X, then the space X is called a Banach fractal. It is known that each topological fractal is compact and metrizable. We prove that a zero-dimensional compact metrizable space X is a topological fractal if and only if X is a Banach fractal if and only if X is either uncountable or X is countable and its scattered height \hbar(X) is a successor ordinal. For countable compact spaces this classification was recently proved by M.Nowak.
