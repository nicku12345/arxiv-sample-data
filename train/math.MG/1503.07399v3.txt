The oloid is the convex hull of two circles with equal radius in perpendicular planes so that the center of each circle lies on the other circle. It is part of a developable surface which we call extended oloid. We determine the tangential system of all inscribed quadrics \mathcal{Q}_\lambda of the extended oloid \mathcal{O} where \lambda is the system parameter.   From this result we conclude parameter equations of the touching curve \mathcal{C}_\lambda between \mathcal{O} and \mathcal{Q}_\lambda, the edge of regression \mathcal{R} of \mathcal{O}, and the asymptotes of \mathcal{R}. Properties of the touching curves \mathcal{C}_\lambda are investigated, including the case that \lambda\rightarrow\pm\infty. The self-polar tetrahedron of the tangential system \mathcal{Q}_\lambda is obtained. The common generating lines of \mathcal{O} and any ruled surface \mathcal{Q}_\lambda are determined. Furthermore, we derive the curves which are the images of \mathcal{C}_\lambda and \mathcal{R} when \mathcal{O} is developed onto the plane.
