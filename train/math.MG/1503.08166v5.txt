Let X be a Banach space. We study the circumstances under which there exists an uncountable set \mathcal A\subset X of unit vectors such that \|x-y\|>1 for distinct x,y\in \mathcal A. We prove that such a set exists if X is quasi-reflexive and non-separable; if X is additionally super-reflexive then one can have \|x-y\|\geqslant 1+\varepsilon for some \varepsilon>0 that depends only on X. If K is a non-metrisable compact, Hausdorff space, then the unit sphere of X=C(K) also contains such a subset; if moreover K is perfectly normal, then one can find such a set with cardinality equal to the density of X; this solves a problem left open by S. K. Mercourakis and G. Vassiliadis.
