We propose a definition for the length of closed geodesics in a globally hyperbolic maximal compact (GHMC) Anti-De Sitter manifold. We then prove that the number of closed geodesics of length less than R grows exponentially fast with R and the exponential growth rate is related to the critical exponent associated to the two hyperbolic surfaces coming from Mess parametrization. We get an equivalent of three results for quasi-Fuchsian manifolds in the GHMC setting : R. Bowen's rigidity theorem of critical exponent, A. Sanders' isolation theorem and C. McMullen's examples lightening the behaviour of this exponent when the surfaces range over Teichm\"uller space.
