We investigate the geometry in a real Euclidean building X of type A2 of some simple configurations in the associated projective plane at infinity P, seen as ideal configurations in X, and relate it with the projective invariants (from the cross ratio on P). In particular we establish a geometric classification of generic triples of ideal chambers of X and relate it with the triple ratio of triples of flags.
