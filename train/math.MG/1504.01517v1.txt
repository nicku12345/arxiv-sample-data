For a class of polyhedrons denoted \mathbb K_n(r,\varepsilon), we construct a bijective continuous area preserving map from \mathbb K_n(r,\varepsilon) to the sphere \mathbb S^{2}(r), together with its inverse. Then we investigate for which polyhedrons \mathbb K_n(r',\varepsilon) the area preserving map can be used for constructing a bijective continuous volume preserving map from \bar{\mathbb K}_n(r',\varepsilon) to the ball \bar{\mathbb S^{2}}(r). These maps can be further used in constructing uniform and refinable grids on the sphere and on the ball, starting from uniform and refinable grids of the polyhedrons \mathbb K_n(r,\varepsilon) and \bar{\mathbb K}_{n}(r',\varepsilon), respectively. In particular, we show that HEALPix grids can be obtained by mappings polyhedrons \mathbb K_n(r,\varepsilon) onto the sphere.
