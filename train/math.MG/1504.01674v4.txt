In their article "The shape of hyperbolic Dehn surgery space," Hodgson and Kerckhoff proved a powerful theorem, half of which they used to make Thurston's Dehn surgery theorem effective. The calculations derived here use both halves of Hodgson and Kerckhoff's theorem to give bounds leading towards a practical algorithm to tell, given two orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds M, N of finite volume, whether or not M is a Dehn filling of N.
