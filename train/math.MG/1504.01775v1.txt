We obtain tilings with a singular point by applying conformal maps on regular tilings of the Euclidean plane, and determine its symmetries. The resulting tilings are then symmetrically colored by applying the same conformal maps on colorings of regular tilings arising from sublattice colorings of the centers of its tiles. In addition, we determine conditions so that the coloring of a tiling with singularity that is obtained in this manner is perfect.
