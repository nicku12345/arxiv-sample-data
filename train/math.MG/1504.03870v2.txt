The van der Waerden's theorem reads that an equilateral pentagon in Euclidean 3-space \Bbb E^3 with all diagonals of the same length is necessarily planar and its vertex set coincides with the vertex set of some convex regular pentagon. We prove the following many-dimensional analogue of this theorem: for n\geqslant 2, every n-dimensional cross-polytope in \Bbb E^{2n-2} with all diagonals of the same length and all edges of the same length necessarily lies in \Bbb E^n and hence is a convex regular cross-polytope. We also apply our theorem to the study of two-distance preserving mappings of Euclidean spaces.
