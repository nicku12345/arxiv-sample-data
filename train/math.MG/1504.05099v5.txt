Let \mathcal{S} be a surface of revolution embedded in the Heisenberg group \mathcal{H}. A revolution ring R_{a,b}(\mathcal{S}), 0<a<b, is a domain in \mathcal{H} bounded by two dilated images of \mathcal{S}, with dilation factors a and b, respectively. We prove that if \mathcal{S} is subject to certain geometric conditions, then the modulus of the family \Gamma of horizontal boundary connecting curves inside R_{a,b}(\mathcal{S}) is  {\rm Mod}(\Gamma)=\pi^2(\log(b/a))^{-3}.  Our result applies for many interesting surfaces, e.g., the Kor\'anyi metric sphere, the Carnot-Carath\'eodory metric sphere and the bubble set.
