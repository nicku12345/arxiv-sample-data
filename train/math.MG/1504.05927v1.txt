We prove that 1) There exist infinitely many non-trivial codimension one "thick" knots in \mathbb{R}^5; 2) For each closed four-dimensional smooth manifold M and for each sufficiently small positive \epsilon the set of isometry classes of Riemannian metrics with volume equal to 1 and injectivity radius greater than \epsilon is disconnected; 3) For each closed four-dimensional PL-manifold M and any m there exist arbitrarily large values of N such that some two triangulations of M with <N simplices cannot be connected by any sequence of <M_m(N) bistellar transformations, where M_m(N)=\exp(\exp(\ldots \exp (N))) (m times).
