Let P be a set of n points in \mathrm{R}^2, and let \mathrm{DT}(P) denote its Euclidean Delaunay triangulation. We introduce the notion of an edge of \mathrm{DT}(P) being {\it stable}. Defined in terms of a parameter \alpha>0, a Delaunay edge pq is called \alpha-stable, if the (equal) angles at which p and q see the corresponding Voronoi edge e_{pq} are at least \alpha. A subgraph G of \mathrm{DT}(P) is called {\it (c\alpha, \alpha)-stable Delaunay graph} (\mathrm{SDG} in short), for some constant c \ge 1, if every edge in G is \alpha-stable and every c\alpha-stable of \mathrm{DT}(P) is in G.   We show that if an edge is stable in the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation of P, then it is also a stable edge, though for a different value of \alpha, in the Delaunay triangulation of P under any convex distance function that is sufficiently close to the Euclidean norm, and vice-versa. In particular, a 6\alpha-stable edge in \mathrm{DT}(P) is \alpha-stable in the Delaunay triangulation under the distance function induced by a regular k-gon for k \ge 2\pi/\alpha, and vice-versa. Exploiting this relationship and the analysis in~\cite{polydel}, we present a linear-size kinetic data structure (KDS) for maintaining an (8\alpha,\alpha)-\mathrm{SDG} as the points of P move. If the points move along algebraic trajectories of bounded degree, the KDS processes nearly quadratic events during the motion, each of which can processed in O(\log n) time. Finally, we show that a number of useful properties of \mathrm{DT}(P) are retained by \mathrm{SDG} of P.
