The face lattice of the permutohedron realizes the combinatorics of linearly ordered partitions of the set [n]=\{1,...,n\}. Similarly, the cyclopermutohedron is a virtual polytope that realizes the combinatorics of cyclically ordered partitions of [n].   It is known that the volume of the standard permutohedron equals the number of trees with n labeled vertices multiplied by \sqrt{n}. The number of integer points of the standard permutohedron equals the number of forests on n labeled vertices.   In the paper we prove that the volume of the cyclopermutohedron also equals some weighted number of forests, which eventually reduces to zero. We also derive a combinatorial formula for the number of integer points in the cyclopermutohedron.   Another object of the paper is the configuration space of a polygonal linkage L. It has a cell decomposition \mathcal{K}(L) related to the face lattice of cyclopermutohedron. Using this relationship, we introduce and compute the volume Vol(\mathcal{K}(L)).
