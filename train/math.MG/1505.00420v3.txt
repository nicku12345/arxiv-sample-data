In this paper, we give the characterization of metric measure spaces that satisfy synthetic lower Riemannian Ricci curvature bounds (so called RCD^*(K,N) spaces) with \emph{non-empty} one dimensional regular sets. In particular, we prove that the class of Ricci limit spaces with Ric \ge K and Hausdorff dimension N and the class of RCD^*(K,N) spaces coincide for N < 2 (They can be either complete intervals or circles). We will also prove a Bishop-Gromov type inequality ( that is ,roughly speaking, a converse to the L\'{e}vy-Gromov's isoperimetric inequality and was previously only known for Ricci limit spaces) which might be also of independent interest.
