Let E be a two-dimensional real normed space. In this paper we show that if the unit circle of E does not contain any line segment such that the distance between its endpoints is greater than 1, then every transformation \phi\colon E\to E which preserves the unit distance is automatically an affine isometry. In particular, this condition is satisfied when the norm is strictly convex.
