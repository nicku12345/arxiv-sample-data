For a lattice L of R^n, a sphere S(c,r) of center c and radius r is called {\em empty} if for any v\in L we have \Vert v - c\Vert \geq r. Then the set S(c,r)\cap L is the vertex set of a {\em Delaunay polytope} P=conv(S(c,r)\cap L). A Delaunay polytope is called {\em perfect} if any affine transformation \phi such that \phi(P) is a Delaunay polytope is necessarily an isometry of the space composed with an homothety.   Perfect Delaunay polytopes are remarkable structure that exist only if n=1 or n\geq 6 and they have shown up recently in covering maxima studies. Here we give a general algorithm for their enumeration that relies on the Erdahl cone. We apply this algorithm in dimension 7 which allow us to find that there are only two perfect Delaunay polytopes: 3_{21} which is a Delaunay polytope in the root lattice \mathsf{E}_7 and the Erdahl Rybnikov polytope.   We then use this classification in order to get the list of all types Delaunay simplices in dimension 7 and found 11 types.
