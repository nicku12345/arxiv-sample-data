In this article we study the following question: What can be the measure of the minimal solid angle of a simplex in \mathbb{R}^d? We show that in dimensions three it is not greater than the solid angle of the regular simplex. And in dimension four the same holds for simplices sufficiently close to the regular simplex. We also study a similar question for trihedral and dihedral angles of polyhedra compared to those of regular solids.
