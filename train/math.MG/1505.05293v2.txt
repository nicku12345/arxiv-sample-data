We show that, for each n\ge 3, there exists a smooth Riemannian metric g on a punctured sphere \mathbb{S}^n\setminus \{x_0\} for which the associated length metric extends to a length metric d of \mathbb{S}^n with the following properties: the metric sphere (\mathbb{S}^n,d) is Ahlfors n-regular and linearly locally contractible but there is no quasiconformal homeomorphism between (\mathbb{S}^n,d) and the standard Euclidean sphere \mathbb{S}^n.
