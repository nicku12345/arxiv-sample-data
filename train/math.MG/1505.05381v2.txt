This paper continues the investigation of Part I, by studying the conic \mathcal{C}_P on the five points ABCPQ, where ABC is a given ordinary triangle and Q is the isotomcomplement of P, defined as the complement of the isotomic conjugate P' of P with respect to triangle ABC. We show that \mathcal{C}_P also lies on the points P' and Q', where Q' is the isotomcomplement of P'. The conic \mathcal{C}_P lies on six other points which are the images of the vertices of ABC under the affine mapping \lambda=T_{P'} \circ T_P^{-1} and its inverse, where T_P and T_{P'} are the unique affine maps taking ABC to the cevian triangles of P and P', respectively. In the paper we characterize the center Z of \mathcal{C}_P as the unique fixed point of \lambda in the extended plane, when \mathcal{C}_P is a parabola or an ellipse, and the unique ordinary fixed point of \lambda, when \mathcal{C}_P is a hyperbola. We also show that Z=GV \cdot T_P(GV), where G is the centroid of ABC and V=PQ \cdot P'Q'. When P is the Gergonne point of ABC, this gives a new characterization of the Feuerbach point Z. All of our arguments are purely synthetic.
