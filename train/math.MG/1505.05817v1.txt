We construct examples of two convex bodies K,L in \mathbb{R}^n, such that every projection of K onto a (n-1)-dimensional subspace can be rotated to be contained in the corresponding projection of L, but K itself cannot be rotated to be contained in L. We also find necessary conditions on K and L to ensure that K can be rotated to be contained in L if all the (n-1)-dimensional projections have this property.
