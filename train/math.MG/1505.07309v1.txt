Two subset germs of Euclidean spaces are called blow-spherically equivalent, if their spherical modifications are homeomorphic and the homeomorphism induces homeomorphic tangent links. Blow-spherical equivalence is stronger than the topological equivalence but weaker than the Lipschitz equivalence. We introduce the thin-thick decomposition of an isolated singularity germ - which happens to be a natural blow-spherical invariant. This decomposition is a generalization of the thin-thick decomposition of normal complex surface singularity germs introduced in [7]
