We show that the \Lp Busemann-Petty centroid inequality provides an elementary and powerful tool to the study of some sharp affine functional inequalities with a geometric content, like log-Sobolev, Sobolev and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities. Our approach allows also to characterize directly the corresponding equality cases.
