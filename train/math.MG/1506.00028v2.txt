Even though a lattice and its sublattices have the same group of coincidence isometries, the coincidence index of a coincidence isometry with respect to a lattice \Lambda_1 and to a sublattice \Lambda_2 may differ. Here, we examine the coloring of \Lambda_1 induced by \Lambda_2 to identify how the coincidence indices with respect to \Lambda_1 and to \Lambda_2 are related. This leads to a generalization of the notion of color symmetries of lattices to what we call color coincidences of lattices. Examples involving the cubic and hypercubic lattices are given to illustrate these ideas.
