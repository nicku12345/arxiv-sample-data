In their earlier work (Ergodic Th. Dynam. Sys., 34: 1699 -1723, 10 2014), the authors introduced the so called F-aperiodic orbits of a dynamical system on a compact metric space X, which satisfy a quantitative condition measuring its recurrence and aperiodicity. Using this condition we introduce two new quantities \cal{F}, \cal{G}, called the `aperiodic complexities', of the system and establish relations between \cal{F}, \cal{G} with the topology and geometry of X. We compare them to well-know complexities such as the box-dimension and the topological entropy. Moreover, we connect our condition to the distribution of periodic orbits and we can classify an F-aperiodic orbit of a point x in X in terms of the collection of the introduced approximation constants of x. Finally, we discuss our results for several examples, in particular for the geodesic flow on hyperbolic manifolds. For each of our examples there is a suitable model of Diophantine approximation and we classify F-aperiodic orbits in terms of Diophantine properties of the point x. As a byproduct, we prove a `metric version' of the closing lemma in the context of CAT(-1) spaces.
