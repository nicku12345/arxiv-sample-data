We prove a decomposition result for a group G acting strongly transitively on the Tits boundary of a Euclidean building. As an application we provide a local to global result for discrete Euclidean buildings, which generalizes results in the locally compact case by Caprace--Ciobotaru and Burger--Mozes. Let X be a Euclidean building without cone factors. If a group G of automorphisms of X acts strongly transitively on the spherical building at infinity \partial X, then the G-stabilizer of every affine apartment in X contains all reflections along thick walls. In particular G acts strongly transitively on X if X is simplicial and thick.
