We prove that for every n\in \mathbb{N} there exists a metric space (X,d_X), an n-point subset S\subseteq X, a Banach space (Z,\|\cdot\|_Z) and a 1-Lipschitz function f:S\to Z such that the Lipschitz constant of every function F:X\to Z that extends f is at least a constant multiple of \sqrt{\log n}. This improves a bound of Johnson and Lindenstrauss. We also obtain the following quantitative counterpart to a classical extension theorem of Minty. For every \alpha\in (1/2,1] and n\in \mathbb{N} there exists a metric space (X,d_X), an n-point subset S\subseteq X and a function f:S\to \ell_2 that is \alpha-H\"older with constant 1, yet the \alpha-H\"older constant of any F:X\to \ell_2 that extends f satisfies  \|F\|_{\mathrm{Lip}(\alpha)}\gtrsim (\log n)^{\frac{2\alpha-1}{4\alpha}}+\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)^{\alpha^2-\frac12}.  We formulate a conjecture whose positive solution would strengthen Ball's nonlinear Maurey extension theorem, serving as a far-reaching nonlinear version of a theorem of K\"onig, Retherford and Tomczak-Jaegermann. We explain how this conjecture would imply as special cases answers to longstanding open questions of Johnson and Lindenstrauss and Kalton.
