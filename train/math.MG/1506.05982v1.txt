We prove that a nonempty closed and geodesically convex subset of the l_{\infty} plane \mathbb{R}^2_{\infty} is hyperconvex and we characterize the tight spans of arbitrary subsets of \mathbb{R}^2_{\infty} via this property: Given any nonempty X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2_{\infty}, a closed, geodesically convex and minimal subset Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2_{\infty} containing X is isometric to the tight span T(X) of X.
