If X is a geodesic metric space and x_1,x_2,x_3\in X, a {\it geodesic triangle} T=\{x_1,x_2,x_3\} is the union of the three geodesics [x_1x_2], [x_2x_3] and [x_3x_1] in X. The space X is \delta-\emph{hyperbolic} (in the Gromov sense) if any side of T is contained in a \delta-neighborhood of the union of the two other sides, for every geodesic triangle T in X. If X is hyperbolic, we denote by \delta(X) the sharp hyperbolicity constant of X, i.e. \delta(X)=\inf\{\delta\ge 0: \, X \, \text{ is \delta-hyperbolic}\}. In this paper we characterize the lexicographic product of two graphs G_1\circ G_2 which are hyperbolic, in terms of G_1 and G_2: the lexicographic product graph G_1\circ G_2 is hyperbolic if and only if G_1 is hyperbolic, unless if G_1 is a trivial graph (the graph with a single vertex); if G_1 is trivial, then G_1\circ G_2 is hyperbolic if and only if G_2 is hyperbolic. In particular, we obtain the sharp inequalities \delta(G_1)\le \delta(G_1\circ G_2) \le \delta(G_1) + 3/2 if G_1 is not a trivial graph, and we characterize the graphs for which the second inequality is attained.
