If X is a geodesic metric space and x_1,x_2,x_3\in X, a geodesic triangle T=\{x_1,x_2,x_3\} is the union of the three geodesics [x_1x_2], [x_2x_3] and [x_3x_1] in X. The space X is \delta-hyperbolic (in the Gromov sense) if any side of T is contained in a \delta-neighborhood of the union of the two other sides, for every geodesic triangle T in X. The study of hyperbolic graphs is an interesting topic since the hyperbolicity of a geodesic metric space is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of a graph related to it. In the context of graphs, to remove and to contract an edge of a graph are natural transformations. The main aim in this work is to obtain quantitative information about the distortion of the hyperbolicity constant of the graph G \setminus e (respectively, \,G/e\,) obtained from the graph G by deleting (respectively, contracting) an arbitrary edge e from it. This work provides information about the hyperbolicity constant of minor graphs.
