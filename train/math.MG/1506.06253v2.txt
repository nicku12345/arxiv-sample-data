In this paper, the third in the series, we define the generalized orthocenter H corresponding to a point P, with respect to triangle ABC, as the unique point for which the lines HA, HB, HC are parallel, respectively, to QD, QE, QF, where DEF is the cevian triangle of P and Q=K \circ \iota(P) is the isotomcomplement of P, both with respect to ABC. We prove a generalized Feuerbach Theorem, and characterize the center Z of the cevian conic \mathcal{C}_P, defined in Part II, as the center of the affine map \Phi_P = T_P \circ K^{-1} \circ T_{P'} \circ K^{-1}, where T_P is the unique affine map for which T_P(ABC)=DEF; T_{P'} is defined similarly for the isotomic conjugate P'=\iota(P) of P; and K is the complement map. The affine map \Phi_P fixes Z and takes the nine-point conic \mathcal{N}_H for the quadrangle ABCH (with respect to the line at infinity) to the inconic \mathcal{I}, defined to be the unique conic which is tangent to the sides of ABC at the points D, E, F. The point Z is therefore the point where the nine-point conic \mathcal{N}_H and the inconic \mathcal{I} touch. This theorem generalizes the usual Feuerbach theorem and holds in all cases where the point P is not on a median, whether the conics involved are ellipses, parabolas, or hyperbolas, and also holds when Z is an infinite point. We also determine the locus of points P for which the generalized orthocenter H coincides with a vertex of ABC; this locus turns out to be the union of three conics minus six points. All our proofs are synthetic, and combine affine and projective arguments.
