We present a first example of a flag vector of a polyhedral sphere that is not the flag vector of any polytope. Namely, there is a unique 3-sphere with the parameters (f_0,f_1,f_2,f_3;f_{02})=(12,40,40,12;120), but this sphere is not realizable by a convex 4-polytope.   The 3-sphere, which is 2-simple and 2-simplicial, was found by Werner (2009); we present results of a computer enumeration which imply that the sphere with these parameters is unique. We prove that it is non-polytopal in two ways: First, we show that it has no oriented matroid, and thus it is not realizable; this proof was found by computer, but can be verified by hand. The second proof is again a computer-based oriented matroid proof and shows that for exactly one of the facets this sphere does not even have a diagram based on this facet. Using the non-polytopality, we finally prove that the sphere is not even embeddable as a polytopal complex.
