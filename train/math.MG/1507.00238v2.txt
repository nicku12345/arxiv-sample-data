In this paper we report on the full classification of Dirichlet-Voronoi polyhedra and Delaunay subdivisions of five-dimensional translational lattices. We obtain a complete list of 110244 affine types (L-types) of Delaunay subdivisions and it turns out that they are all combinatorially inequivalent, giving the same number of combinatorial types of Dirichlet-Voronoi polyhedra. Using a refinement of corresponding secondary cones, we obtain 181394 contraction types. We report on details of our computer assisted enumeration, which we verified by three independent implementations and a topological mass formula check.
