Let K \subset {\mathbb R}^2 be an o-symmetric convex body, and K^* its polar body. Then we have |K|\cdot |K^*| \ge 8, with equality if and only if K is a parallelogram. (| \cdot | denotes volume). If K \subset {\mathbb R}^2 is a convex body, with o \in {\text{int}}\,K, then |K|\cdot |K^*| \ge 27/4, with equality if and only if K is a triangle and o is its centroid. If K \subset {\mathbb R}^2 is a convex body, then we have |K| \cdot |[(K-K)/2)]^* | \ge 6, with equality if and only if K is a triangle. These theorems are due to Mahler and Reisner, Mahler and Meyer, and to Eggleston, respectively. We show an analogous theorem: if K has n-fold rotational symmetry about o, then |K|\cdot |K^*| \ge n^2 \sin ^2 ( \pi /n), with equality if and only if K is a regular n-gon of centre o. We will also give stability variants of these four inequalities, both for the body, and for the centre of polarity. For this we use the Banach-Mazur distance (from parallelograms, or triangles), or its analogue with similar copies rather than affine transforms (from regular n-gons), respectively. The stability variants are sharp, up to constant factors. We extend the inequality |K|\cdot |K^*| \ge n^2 \sin ^2 ( \pi /n) to bodies with o \in {\text{int}}\,K, which contain, and are contained in, two regular n-gons, the vertices of the contained n-gon being incident to the sides of the containing n-gon. Our key lemma is a stability estimate for the area product of two sectors of convex bodies polar to each other. To several of our statements we give several proofs; in particular, we give a new proof for the theorem of Mahler-Reisner.
