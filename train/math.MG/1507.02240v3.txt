For a real valued function defined on a compact set K \subset \mathbb{R}^m, the classical Whitney Extension Theorem from 1934 gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a C^k extension to \mathbb{R}^m. In this paper, we prove a version of the Whitney Extension Theorem in the case of C^1, horizontal extensions for mappings defined on compact subsets of \mathbb{R} taking values in the Heisenberg Group \mathbb{H}^n.
