A one-parameter deformation of a periodic bar-and-joint framework is expansive when all distances between joints increase or stay the same. In dimension two, expansive behavior can be fully explained through our theory of periodic pseudo-triangulations. However, higher dimensions present new challenges. In this paper we study a number of periodic frameworks with expansive capabilities in dimension d\geq 3 and register both similarities and contrasts with the two-dimensional case.
