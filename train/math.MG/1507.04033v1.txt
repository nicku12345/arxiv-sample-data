For a triangle in the hyperbolic plane, let \alpha,\beta,\gamma denote the angles opposite the sides a,b,c, respectively. Also, let h be the height of the altitude to side c. Under the assumption that \alpha,\beta, \gamma can be chosen uniformly in the interval (0,\pi) and it is given that \alpha+\beta+\gamma<\pi, we show that the strong triangle inequality a + b > c + h holds approximately 79\% of the time. To accomplish this, we prove a number of theoretical results to make sure that the probability can be computed to an arbitrary precision, and the error can be bounded.
