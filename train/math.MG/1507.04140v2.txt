We apply the theory of Peres and Schlag to obtain estimates for generic Hausdorff dimension distortion under orthogonal projections on simply connected two dimensional Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature. As a conclusion we obtain appropriate versions of Marstrand theorem, Kaufman's theorem and Falconer's theorem in the above geometrical settings.
