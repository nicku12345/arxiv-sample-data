We provide a complete characterization of pairs of full-rank lattices in \mathbb{R}^{d} which admit common connected fundamental domains of the type N\left[ 0,1\right) ^{d} where N is an invertible matrix of order d. Using our characterization, we construct several pairs of lattices of the type \left( M\mathbb{Z}^{d},\mathbb{Z}^{d}\right)  which admit a common fundamental domain of the type N\left[ 0,1\right) ^{d}. Moreover, we show that for d=2, there exists an uncountable family of pairs of lattices of the same volume which do not admit a common connected fundamental domain of the type N\left[ 0,1\right) ^{2}.
