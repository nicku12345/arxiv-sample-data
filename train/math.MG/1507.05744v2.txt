Let G be a group acting properly and essentially on an irreducible, non-Euclidean finite dimensional CAT(0) cube complex X without fixed points at infinity. We show that for any finite collection of simultaneously inessential subgroups \{H_1, \ldots, H_k\} in G, there exists an element g of infinite order such that \forall i, \langle H_i, g\rangle \cong H_i * \langle g\rangle. We apply this to show that any group, acting faithfully and geometrically on a non-Euclidean possibly reducible CAT(0) cube complex, has property P_{naive} i.e. given any finite list \{g_1, \ldots, g_k\} of elements from G, there exists g of infinite order such that \forall i, \langle g_i, g\rangle \cong \langle g_i \rangle *\langle g\rangle. This applies in particular to the Burger-Moses simple groups that arise as lattices in products of trees. The arguments utilize the action of the group on its Poisson boundary and moreover, allow us to summarise equivalent conditions for the reduced C^*-algebra of the group to be simple.
