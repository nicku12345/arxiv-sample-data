We consider a hyperbolic polygon in the unit disk \{z:\, |z|<1\} with all its vertices on the unit circle \{z:\, |z|=1\} and a growth process of such polygons when each n-gon generates an n(n-1)-gon by inverting itself across all of its sides. In this paper, we prove some general monotonicity results of inversion for convex hyperbolic n-gons and solve an extremal problem that, among all convex hyperbolic 4-gons containing the origin, the inverted side length of the longest side of the given hyperbolic 4-gon is minimal for the regular hyperbolic 4-gon.
