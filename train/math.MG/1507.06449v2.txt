Consider discrete conformal maps defined on the basis of two conformally equivalent triangle meshes, that is edge lengths are related by scale factors associated to the vertices. Given a smooth conformal map f, we show that it can be approximated by such discrete conformal maps f^\epsilon. In particular, let T be an infinite regular triangulation of the plane with congruent triangles and only acute angles (i.e.\ <\pi/2). We scale this tiling by \epsilon>0 and approximate a compact subset of the domain of f with a portion of it. For \epsilon small enough we prove that there exists a conformally equivalent triangle mesh whose scale factors are given by \log|f'| on the boundary. Furthermore we show that the corresponding discrete conformal maps f^\epsilon converge to f uniformly in C^1 with error of order \epsilon.
