The notion of sprays introduced by Lapidus and his co-workers has proved useful in the context of fractal tube formulas. In the present note, we propose a more general concept of sprays, where we allow several generators to make them more convenient for applications to graph-directed fractals. Using a simple functional equation satisfied by the volume of the inner \varepsilon-neighborhood of such a generalized spray, we establish a tube formula for them.
