In this paper we study the quantitative isoperimetric inequality in the plane. We prove the existence of a set \Omega, different from a ball, which minimizes the ratio \delta(\Omega)/\lambda^2(\Omega), where \delta is the isoperimetric deficit and \lambda the Fraenkel asymmetry, giving a new proof ofthe quantitative isoperimetric inequality. Some new properties of the optimal set are also shown.
