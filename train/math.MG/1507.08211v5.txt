We construct bi-Lipschitz embeddings into Euclidean space for manifolds and orbifolds of bounded diameter and curvature. The distortion and dimension of such embeddings is bounded by diameter, curvature and dimension alone. Our results also apply for bounded subsets of complete Riemannian manifolds, and complete flat and elliptic orbifolds. Our approach is based on analysing the structure of a bounded curvature manifold at various scales by specializing methods from collapsing theory to a certain class of model spaces.
