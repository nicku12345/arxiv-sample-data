In this note we prove that for any compact subset S of a Busemann surface ({\mathcal S},d) (in particular, for any simple polygon with geodesic metric) and any positive number \delta, the minimum number of closed balls of radius \delta with centers at \mathcal S and covering the set S is at most 19 times the maximum number of disjoint closed balls of radius \delta centered at points of S: \nu(S) \le \rho(S) \le 19\nu(S), where \rho(S) and \nu(S) are the covering and the packing numbers of S by {\delta}-balls.
