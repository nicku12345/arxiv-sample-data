In continuation of Part I, we study translative integral formulas for certain translation invariant functionals, which are defined on general convex bodies. Again, we consider local extensions and use these to show that the translative formulas extend to arbitrary continuous and translation invariant valuations. Then, we discuss applications to Poisson particle processes and Boolean models which contain, as a special case, some new results for flag measures.
