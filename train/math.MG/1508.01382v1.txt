Let two distinct N-simplexes be given in an Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean N+1 dimensional space as each is defined by the coordinates of its N+1 vertexes. We consider the two families of N-spheres passing through the vertexes of the given N-simplexes and the set of couples of N-spheres (one belonging to first family and the other to the second one). The elements of this set have at least one common point; moreover, it is such that for the angle \alpha between the segments connecting that point and the centers of the corresponding N-spheres, there holds \cos^{2}\alpha=const for each of the elements of the defined set of N-spheres. In the present work we find the geometric place of all these common points, including the special cases when \cos^{2}\alpha is equal to 0 or 1.
