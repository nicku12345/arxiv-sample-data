It is well-known that a paracompact space X is of covering dimension at most n if and only if any map f\colon X\to K from X to a simplicial complex K can be pushed into its n-skeleton K^{(n)}. We use the same idea to characterize asymptotic dimension in the coarse category of arbitrary coarse spaces. Continuity of the map f is replaced by variation of f on elements of a uniformly bounded cover. The same way one can generalize Property A of G.Yu to arbitrary coarse spaces.
