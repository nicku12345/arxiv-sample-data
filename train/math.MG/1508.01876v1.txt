We define certain natural finite sums of n'th roots of unity, called G_P(n), that are associated to each convex integer polytope P, and which generalize the classical 1-dimensional Gauss sum G(n) defined over \mathbb Z/ {n \mathbb Z}, to higher dimensional abelian groups and integer polytopes. We consider the finite Weyl group \mathcal{W}, generated by the reflections with respect to the coordinate hyperplanes, as well as all permutations of the coordinates; further, we let \mathcal G be the group generated by \mathcal{W} as well as all integer translations in \mathbb Z^d. We prove that if P multi-tiles \mathbb R^d under the action of \mathcal G, then we have the closed form G_P(n) = \text{vol}(P) G(n)^d. Conversely, we also prove that if P is a lattice tetrahedron in \mathbb R^3, of volume 1/6, such that G_P(n) = \text{vol}(P) G(n)^d, for n \in \{ 1,2,3,4 \}, then there is an element g in \mathcal G such that g(P) is the fundamental tetrahedron with vertices (0,0,0), (1, 0, 0), (1,1,0), (1,1,1).
