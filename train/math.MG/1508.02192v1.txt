Let X be a product of r locally compact Hadamard spaces. In this note we prove that the horospheres in X centered at regular boundary points of X are Lipschitz-(r-2)-connected. Using the filling construction by R.~Young in \cite{MR3268779} this gives sharp bounds on higher order Dehn functions for such horospheres. Moreover, if \Gamma\subset\Is(X) is a lattice acting cocompactly on X minus a union of disjoint horoballs, we get a sharp bound on higher order Dehn functions for \Gamma. We therefore deduce that apart from the Hilbert modular groups already considered by R.~Young every irreducible \QQ-rank one lattice acting on a product of r symmetric spaces of the noncompact type is undistorted up to dimension r-1 and has k-th order Dehn function asymptotic to V^{(k+1)/k} for all k\le r-2.
