We study S-convex sets, which are the geometric objects obtained as the intersection of the usual convex sets in \mathbb R^d with a proper subset S\subset \mathbb R^d. We contribute new results about their S-Helly numbers. We extend prior work for S=\mathbb R^d, \mathbb Z^d, and \mathbb Z^{d-k}\times\mathbb R^k; we give sharp bounds on the S-Helly numbers in several new cases. We considered the situation for low-dimensional S and for sets S that have some algebraic structure, in particular when S is an arbitrary subgroup of \mathbb R^d or when S is the difference between a lattice and some of its sublattices. By abstracting the ingredients of Lov\'asz method we obtain colorful versions of many monochromatic Helly-type results, including several colorful versions of our own results.
