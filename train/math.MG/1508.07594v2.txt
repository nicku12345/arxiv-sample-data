In this article we define an algebraic vertex of a generalized polyhedron and show that it is the smallest set of points needed to define the polyhedron. We prove that the indicator function of a generalized polytope P is a linear combination of indicator functions of simplices whose vertices are algebraic vertices of P. We also show that the indicator function of any generalized polyhedron is a linear combination, with integer coefficients, of indicator functions of cones with apices at algebraic vertices and line-cones. The concept of an algebraic vertex is closely related to the Fourier--Laplace transform. We show that a point \mathbf{v} is an algebraic vertex of a generalized polyhedron P if and only if the tangent cone of P, at \mathbf{v}, has non-zero Fourier--Laplace transform.
