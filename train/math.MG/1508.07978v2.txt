Suppose C is a compact, n-edged two-cell of the centered dual decomposition of a locally finite set in the hyperbolic plane, a coarsening of the Delaunay tessellation which was introduced in the author's prior work. We describe an effectively computable lower bound on the area of C, given an n-tuple of positive real numbers bounding the lengths of the edges of C below. The ancillary materials contain Python code implementing (for n<10) an algorithm to compute this bound. For geometrically reasonable edge length bounds, we expect the given area bound to be sharp or near-sharp.
