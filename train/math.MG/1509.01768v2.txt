Let C_{i} (\,i=1,\ldots ,N\,) be the i-th open spherical cap of angular radius r and let M_{i} be its center under the condition that none of the spherical caps contains the center of another one in its interior. We consider the upper bound, r_{N} , (not the lower bound !) of r of the case in which the whole spherical surface of a unit sphere is completely covered with N congruent open spherical caps under the condition, sequentially for i=2,\ldots ,N-1\,, that M_{i} is set on the perimeter of C_{i-1}, and that each area of the set (\cup _{\nu =1}^{i-1}C_{\nu })\cap C_{i} becomes maximum. In this paper, for N = 10, we found out that the solutions of our sequential covering and the solutions of the Tammes problem were strictly correspondent. Especially, we succeeded to obtain the exact value r_{10} for N = 10.
