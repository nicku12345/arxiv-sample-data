For lattice polytopes P_1,\ldots, P_k \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d, Bihan (2014) introduced the discrete mixed volume \mathrm{DMV}(P_1,\dots,P_k) in analogy to the classical mixed volume. In this note we initiate the study of the associated mixed Ehrhart polynomial \mathrm{ME}_{P_1,\dots,P_k}(n) = \mathrm{DMV}(nP_1,\dots,nP_k). We study properties of this polynomial and we give interpretations for some of its coefficients in terms of (discrete) mixed volumes. Bihan (2014) showed that the discrete mixed volume is always non-negative. Our investigations yield simpler proofs for certain special cases. We also introduce and study the associated mixed h^*-vector. We show that for large enough dilates r P_1, \ldots, rP_k the corresponding mixed h^*-polynomial has only real roots and as a consequence the mixed h^*-vector becomes non-negative.
