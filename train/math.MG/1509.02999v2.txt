Let X be a finite set in a complex sphere of d dimension. Let D(X) be the set of usual inner products of two distinct vectors in X. A set X is called a complex spherical s-code if the cardinality of D(X) is s and D(X) contains an imaginary number. We would like to classify the largest possible s-codes for given dimension d. In this paper, we consider the problem for the case s=3. Roy and Suda (2014) gave a certain upper bound for the cardinalities of 3-codes. A 3-code X is said to be tight if X attains the bound. We show that there exists no tight 3-code except for dimensions 1, 2. Moreover we make an algorithm to classify the largest 3-codes by considering representations of oriented graphs. By this algorithm, the largest 3-codes are classified for dimensions 1, 2, 3 with a current computer.
