We completely classify all measurable \operatorname{SL}(n)-covariant symmetric tensor valuations on convex polytopes containing the origin in their interiors. It is shown that essentially the only examples of such valuations are the moment tensor and a tensor derived from L_p surface area measures. This generalizes and unifies earlier results for the scalar, vector and matrix valued case.
