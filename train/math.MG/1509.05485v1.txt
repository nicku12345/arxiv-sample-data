The relationship between L_p affine surface area and curvature measures is investigated. As a result, a new representation of the existing notion of L_p affine surface area depending only on curvature measures is derived. Direct proofs of the equivalence between this new representation and those previously known are provided. The proofs show that the new representation is, in a sense, "polar" to that of Lutwak's and "dual" to that of Sch\"utt & Werner's.
