We prove a conjecture of B. Gr\"unbaum stating that the set of affine invariant points of a convex body equals to the set of points invariant under all affine linear symmetries of the convex body. As a consequence we give a short proof on the fact that the affine space of affine linear points is infinite dimensional. In particular, we show that the set of affine invariant points with no dual is of second category. We investigate extremal cases for a class of symmetry measures. We show that the center of the John and L\"owner ellipsoid can be far apart and we give the optimal order for the extremal distance of the two centers.
