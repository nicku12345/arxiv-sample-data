In contrast to many known results concerning periodic tilings of the Euclidean plane with pentagons, here tilings with rotational symmetry are investigated. A certain class of convex pentagons is introduced. It can be shown that for any given symmetry type \mathbf{C}_{n} or \mathbf{D}_{n} there exists a monohedral tiling generated by a pentagon from this class. For n>1 each of these tilings is also a spiral tiling with n arms. As a byproduct it follows that the same holds for convex hexagons.
