Denoting by C_n(X) the configuration space of n distinct points in X, with X being either Euclidean 3-space \mathbb{E}^3 or hyperbolic 3-space \mathbb{H}^3 or \mathbb{C}P^1 , by \mathscr{P}_{k,d} the vector space of homogeneous complex polynomials in the variables z_0, \ldots, z_k of degree d, and by \mathrm{Obs}^n_d the set of all d-subsets of \{1,\ldots,n\}, the symmetric group \Sigma_n acts on C_n(\mathbb{R}^3) by permuting the n points and also acts in a natural way on \mathrm{Obs}^n_d. With n = k+d, the space \mathscr{P}_{k,d} has dimension \binom{n}{d}, which is also the number of elements in \mathrm{Obs}^n_d. It is thus natural to ask the following question. Is there a family of continuous maps f_I: C_n(X) \to \mathbb{P}\mathscr{P}_{k,d}, for I \in \mathrm{Obs}^n_d (here \mathbb{P} is complex projectivization), which satisfies f_I(\sigma.\mathbf{x}) = f_{\sigma.I}(\mathbf{x}), for all \sigma \in \Sigma_n and all \mathbf{x} \in C_n(X), and such that, for each \mathbf{x} \in C_n(X), the polynomials f_I(\mathbf{x}), for I\in \mathrm{Obs}^n_d, each defined up to a scalar factor, are linearly independent over \mathbb{C}? We provide two closely related smooth candidates for such maps for each of the two cases, Euclidean and hyperbolic, which would be solutions to the above problem provided a linear independence conjecture holds. Our maps are natural extensions of the Atiyah-Sutcliffe maps. Moreover, we get two constructions of actual solutions of the above problem for X = \mathbb{C}P^1, as we prove linear independence for these last two constructions. These last two constructions are classical in character, and can be viewed as higher dimensional versions of Lagrange polynomial interpolation. They appear to be new.
