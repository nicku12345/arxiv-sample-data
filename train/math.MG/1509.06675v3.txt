I prove that if \emptyset \neq K \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} is a compact s-Ahlfors-David regular set with s \geq 1, then \dim_{\mathrm{p}} D(K) = 1, where D(K) := \{|x - y| : x,y \in K\} is the distance set of K, and \dim_{\mathrm{p}} stands for packing dimension.   The same proof strategy applies to other problems of similar nature. For instance, one can show that if \emptyset \neq K \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} is a compact s-Ahlfors-David regular set with s \geq 1, then there exists a point x_{0} \in K such that \dim_{\mathrm{p}} K \cdot (K - x_{0}) = 1. Specialising to product sets, one derives the following sum-product corollary: if A \subset \mathbb{R} is a non-empty compact s-Ahlfors-David regular set with s \geq 1/2, then \dim_{\mathrm{p}} [A(A - a_{1}) + A(A - a_{1})] = 1 for some a_{1},a_{2} \in A. In particular, \dim_{\mathrm{p}} [AA + AA - AA - AA] = 1. In all of the results mentioned above, compactness can be relaxed to boundedness and \mathcal{H}^{s}-measurability, if packing dimension is replaced by upper box dimension.
