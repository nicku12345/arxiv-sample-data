We study the following open problem, suggested by Barker and Larman. Let K and L be convex bodies in \mathbb R^n (n\ge 2) that contain a Euclidean ball B in their interiors. If \mathrm{vol}_{n-1}(K\cap H) = \mathrm{vol}_{n-1}(L\cap H) for every hyperplane H that supports B, does it follow that K=L? We discuss various modifications of this problem. In particular, we show that in \mathbb R^2 the answer is positive if the above condition is true for two disks, none of which is contained in the other. We also study some higher dimensional analogues.
