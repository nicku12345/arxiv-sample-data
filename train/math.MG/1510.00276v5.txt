It is shown here that if (Y,\|\cdot\|_Y) is a Banach space in which martingale differences are unconditional (a UMD Banach space) then there exists c=c(Y)\in (0,\infty) with the following property. For every n\in \mathbb{N} and \varepsilon\in (0,1/2], if (X,\|\cdot\|_X) is an n-dimensional normed space with unit ball B_X and f:B_X\to Y is a 1-Lipschitz function then there exists an affine mapping \Lambda:X\to Y and a sub-ball B^*=y+\rho B_X\subseteq B_X of radius \rho\ge \exp(-(1/\varepsilon)^{cn}) such that \|f(x)-\Lambda(x)\|_Y\le \varepsilon \rho for all x\in B^*. This estimate on the macroscopic scale of affine approximability of vector-valued Lipschitz functions is an asymptotic improvement (as n\to \infty) over the best previously known bound even when X is \mathbb{R}^n equipped with the Euclidean norm and Y is a Hilbert space.
