The main goal of the paper is to solve some problems about shadow for the sphere generalized on the case of the ellipsoid. Here, the essence of the problem is to find the the minimal number of non-overlapping balls with centers on the sphere which are not holding the center of the sphere and such that every line passing through the center of the sphere would intersect at least one of the balls. Another method of solving the shadow problem for the sphere is also proposed.
