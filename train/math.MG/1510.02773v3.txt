We construct families of trivial 2-knots K_i in \mathbb{R}^4 such that the maximal complexity of 2-knots in any isotopy connecting K_i with the standard unknot grows faster than a tower of exponentials of any fixed height of the complexity of K_i. Here we can either construct K_i as smooth embeddings and measure their complexity as the ropelength (a.k.a the crumpledness) or construct PL-knots K_i, consider isotopies through PL knots, and measure the complexity of a PL-knot as the minimal number of flat 2-simplices in its triangulation. These results contrast with the situation of classical knots in \mathbb{R}^3, where every unknot can be untied through knots of complexity that is only polynomially higher than the complexity of the initial knot.
