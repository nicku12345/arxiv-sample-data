Let L be a finite-dimensional real normed space, and let B be the unit ball in L. The sign sequence constant of L is the least t>0 such that, for each sequence v_1, \ldots, v_n \in B, there are signs \varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_n \in \{-1, +1\} such that \varepsilon_1 v_1 + \ldots + \varepsilon_k v_k \in t B, for each 1 \leq k \leq n.   We show that the sign sequence constant of a plane is at most 2, and the sign sequence constant of the plane with the Euclidean norm is equal to \sqrt{3}.
