The question, under what geometric assumptions on a space X an n-quasiflat in X implies the existence of an n-flat therein, has been investigated for a long time. It was settled in the affirmative for Busemann spaces by Kleiner, and for manifolds of non-positive curvature it dates back to Anderson and Schroeder. We generalize the theorem of Kleiner to spaces with bicombings. This structure is a weak notion of non-positive curvature, not requiring the space to be uniquely geodesic. Beside a metric differentiation argument, we employ an elegant barycenter construction due to Es-Sahib and Heinich by means of which we define a Riemannian integral serving us in a sort of convolution operation.
