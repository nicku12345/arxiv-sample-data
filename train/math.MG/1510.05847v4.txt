We consider proper subdomains G of \mathbb{R}^n and their images G'=f(G) under quasiconformal mappings f of \mathbb{R}^n. We compare the distance ratio metrics of G and G'; as an application we show that \varphi-uniform domains are preserved under quasiconformal mappings of \mathbb{R}^n. A sufficient condition for \varphi-uniformity is obtained in terms of the quasi-symmetry condition. We give a geometric condition for uniformity: If G\subset\mathbb{R}^n is \phi-uniform and satisfies the twisted cone condition, then it is uniform. We also construct a planar \phi-uniform domain whose complement is not \psi-uniform for any \psi.
