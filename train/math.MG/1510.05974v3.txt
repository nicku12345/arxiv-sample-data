Given a Banach space X and a real number \alpha\ge 1, we write: (1) D(X)\le\alpha if, for any locally finite metric space A, all finite subsets of which admit bilipschitz embeddings into X with distortions \le C, the space A itself admits a bilipschitz embedding into X with distortion \le \alpha\cdot C; (2) D(X)=\alpha^+ if, for every \varepsilon>0, the condition D(X)\le\alpha+\varepsilon holds, while D(X)\le\alpha does not; (3) D(X)\le \alpha^+ if D(X)=\alpha^+ or D(X)\le \alpha. It is known that D(X) is bounded by a universal constant, but the available estimates for this constant are rather large.   The following results have been proved in this work: (1) D((\oplus_{n=1}^\infty X_n)_p)\le 1^+ for every nested family of finite-dimensional Banach spaces \{X_n\}_{n=1}^\infty and every 1\le p\le \infty. (2) D((\oplus_{n=1}^\infty \ell^\infty_n)_p)=1^+ for 1<p<\infty. (3) D(X)\le 4^+ for every Banach space X with no nontrivial cotype. Statement (3) is a strengthening of the Baudier-Lancien result (2008).
