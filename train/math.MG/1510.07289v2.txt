We prove that for any 2<p<\infty and for every n-dimensional subspace X of L_p, represented on \mathbb R^n, whose unit ball B_X is in Lewis' position one has the following two-level Gaussian concentration inequality: \[ \mathbb P\left( \big| \|Z\| - \mathbb E\|Z\| \big| > \varepsilon \mathbb E\|Z\| \right) \leq C \exp \left (- c \min \left\{ \alpha_p \varepsilon^2 n, (\varepsilon n)^{2/p} \right\} \right), \quad 0<\varepsilon<1 , \] where Z is a standard n-dimensional Gaussian vectors, \alpha_p>0 is a constant depending only on p and C,c>0 are absolute constants. As a consequence we show optimal lower bound for the dimension of almost spherical sections for these spaces. In particular, for any 2<p<\infty and every n-dimensional subspace X of L_p, the Euclidean space \ell_2^k can be (1+\varepsilon)-embedded into X with k\geq c_p \min\{ \varepsilon^2 n , (\varepsilon n)^{2/p}\}, where c_p>0 is a constant depending only on p. This improves upon the previously known estimate due to Figiel, Lindenstrauss and V. Milman.
