The theory of the isoptic curves is widely studied in the Euclidean plane \bE^2 (see \cite{CMM91} and \cite{Wi} and the references given there). The analogous question was investigated by the authors in the hyperbolic \bH^2 and elliptic \cE^2 planes (see \cite{CsSz1}, \cite{CsSz2}, \cite{CsSz5}), but in the higher dimensional spaces there are only a few result in this topic.   In \cite{CsSz4} we gave a natural extension of the notion of the isoptic curves to the n-dimensional Euclidean space \bE^n (n\ge 3) which are called isoptic hypersurfaces. Now we develope an algorithm to determine the isoptic surface \mathcal{H}_{\cP} of a 3-dimensional polytop \mathcal{P}.   We will determine the isoptic surfaces for Platonic solids and for some semi-regular Archimedean polytopes and visualize them with Wolfram Mathematica.
