In this paper we prove a sharp distortion property of the Cassinian metric under M\"obius transformations of a punctured ball onto another punctured ball. The paper also deals with discussion on local convexity properties of the Cassinian metric balls in some specific subdomains of \mathbb{R}^n. Inclusion properties of the Cassinian metric balls with other hyperbolic-type metric balls are also investigated. In particular, several conjectures are also stated in response to sharpness of the inclusion relations.
