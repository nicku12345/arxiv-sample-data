I show that L^{p}-L^{q} estimates for the Kakeya maximal function yield lower bounds for the conformal dimension of Kakeya sets, and upper bounds for how much quasisymmetries can increase the Hausdorff dimension of line segments inside Kakeya sets.   Combining the known L^{p}-L^{q} estimates of Wolff and Katz-Tao with the main result of the paper, the conformal dimension of Kakeya sets in \mathbb{R}^{n} is at least \max\{(n + 2)/2,(4n + 3)/7\}. Moreover, if f is a quasisymmetry from a Kakeya set K \subset \mathbb{R}^{n} onto any at most n-dimensional metric space, the f-image of a.e. line segment inside K has dimension at most \min\{2n/(n + 2),7n/(4n + 3)\}. The Kakeya maximal function conjecture implies that the bounds can be improved to n and 1, respectively.
