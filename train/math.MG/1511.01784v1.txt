We received a solution of the shadow problem in n-dimensional Euclidean space for a family of sets, constructing from any convex domain having nonempty interior with the help of parallel translations and homotheties. We find a number of balls with centers on the sphere, sufficient for giving a shadow in n-dimensional complex (hypercomplex) space.
