Intrinsic volumes and Minkowski tensors have been used to describe the geometry of real world objects. This paper presents an estimator that allows to approximate these quantities from digital images. It is based on a generalized Steiner formula for Minkowski tensors of sets of positive reach. When the resolution goes to infinity, the estimator converges to the true value if the underlying object is a set of positive reach. The underlying algorithm is based on a simple expression in terms of the cells of a Voronoi decomposition associated with the image.
