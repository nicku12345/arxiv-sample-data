Let \# K be a number of integer lattice points contained in a set K. In this paper we prove that for each d\in {\mathbb N} there exists a constant C(d) depending on d only, such that for any origin-symmetric convex body K \subset {\mathbb R}^d containing d linearly independent lattice points    \# K \leq C(d)\max(\# (K\cap H))\, {\rm vol}_d(K)^{\frac{d-m}{d}},  where the maximum is taken over all m-dimensional subspaces of {\mathbb R}^d. We also prove that C(d) can be chosen asymptotically of order O(1)^{d}d^{d-m}. In addition, we show that if K is an unconditional convex body then C(d) can be chosen asymptotically of order O(d)^{d-m}.
