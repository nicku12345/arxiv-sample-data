We prove that if a convex body has absolutely continuous surface area measure, whose density is sufficiently close to the constant, then the sequence \{\Pi^mK\} of convex bodies converges to the ball with respect to the Banach-Mazur distance, as m\rightarrow\infty. Here, \Pi denotes the projection body operator. Our result allows us to show that the ellipsoid is a local solution to the conjectured inequality of Petty and to improve a related inequality of Lutwak.
