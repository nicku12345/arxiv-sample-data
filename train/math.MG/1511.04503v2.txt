In this paper we show that every L^1-integrable function on \partial\Omega can be obtained as the trace of a function of bounded variation in \Omega whenever \Omega is a domain with regular boundary \partial\Omega in a doubling metric measure space. In particular, the trace class of BV(\Omega) is L^1(\partial\Omega) provided that \Omega supports a 1-Poincar\'e inequality. We also construct a bounded linear extension from a Besov class of functions on \partial\Omega to BV(\Omega).
