We give an explicit characterization of all injective subsets of the model space l_{\infty}(I) for a general set I, in terms of inequalities involving 1-Lipschitz functions. Since the class of all injective metric spaces coincides with the one of all absolute 1-Lipschitz retracts, the present work yields a characterization of all the subsets of l_{\infty}(I) that are absolute 1-Lipschitz retracts.
