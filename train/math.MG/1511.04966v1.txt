We study a family C_{s,l} of Capelli-type invariant differential operators on the space of rectangular matrices over a real division algebra. The C_{s,l} descend to invariant differential operators on the corresponding Grassmannian, which is a compact symmetric space, and we determine the image of the C_{s,l} under the Harish-Chandra homomorphism. We also obtain analogous results for corresponding operators on the non-compact duals of the Grassmannians, and for line bundles. As an application we obtain a Radon inversion formula, which generalizes a recent result of B. Rubin for real Grassmannians.
