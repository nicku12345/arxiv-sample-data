We study a properly convex real projective manifold with (possibly empty) compact, strictly convex boundary, and which consists of a compact part plus finitely many convex ends. We extend a theorem of Koszul which asserts that for a compact manifold without boundary the holonomies of properly convex structures form an open subset of the representation variety. We also give a relative version for non-compact (G,X)-manifolds of the openess of their holonomies.
