We provide a new quantitative version of Helly's theorem: there exists an absolute constant \alpha >1 with the following property: if \{P_i: i\in I\} is a finite family of convex bodies in {\mathbb R}^n with {\rm int}\left (\bigcap_{i\in I}P_i\right )\neq\emptyset , then there exist z\in {\mathbb R}^n, s\leq \alpha n and i_1,\ldots i_s\in I such that \begin{equation*} z+P_{i_1}\cap\cdots\cap P_{i_s}\subseteq cn^{3/2}\left(z+\bigcap_{i\in I}P_i\right), \end{equation*} where c>0 is an absolute constant. This directly gives a version of the "quantitative" diameter theorem of B\'{a}r\'{a}ny, Katchalski and Pach, with a polynomial dependence on the dimension. In the symmetric case the bound O(n^{3/2}) can be improved to O(\sqrt{n}).
