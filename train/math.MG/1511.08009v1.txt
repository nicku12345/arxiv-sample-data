In this work we study the maximum relative diameter functional d_M in the class of multi-rotationally symmetric planar convex bodies. A given set C of this class is k-rotationally symmetric for k\in\{k_1,\ldots,k_n\}\subset\nn, and so it is natural to consider the standard k_i-partition P_{k_i} associated to C (which is a minimizing k_i-partition for d_M when k_i\geq3) and the corresponding value d_M(P_{k_i}). We establish the relation among these values, characterizing the particular sets for which all these values coincide.
