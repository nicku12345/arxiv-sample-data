Maximum size of equiangular lines in \mathbb{R}^{19} has been known in the range between 72 to 76 since 1973. Acoording to the nonexistence of strongly regular graph (75,32,10,16) \cite{aza15}, Larmen-Rogers-Seidel Theorem \cite{lar77} and Lemmen-Seidel bounds on equiangular lines with common angle \frac 1 3 \cite{lem73}, we can prove that there are no 76 equiangular lines in \mathbb{R}^{19}. As a corollary, there is no strongly regular graph (76,35,18,14). Similar discussion can prove that there are no 96 equiangular lines in \mathbb{R}^{20}.
