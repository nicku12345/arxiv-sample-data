An elementary proof is given to show that a parametrised algebraic curve in the plane may be traced out, in the sense of A. B. Kempe, by a finite pinned linkage. Additionally it is shown that any parametrised continuous curve \gamma: [0,1] to R^2 may be traced out by an infinite linkage where the valencies of the joints is uniformly bounded. We also discuss related Kempe universality theorems and give a novel correction of Kempe's original argument.
