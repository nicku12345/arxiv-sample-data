Recently Gigli developed a Sobolev calculus on non-smooth spaces using module theory. In this paper it is shown that his theory fits nicely into the theory of differentiability spaces initiated by Cheeger, Keith and others. A relaxation procedure for L^p-valued subadditive functionals is presented and a relationship between the module generated by a functional and the one generated by its relaxation is given. In the framework of differentiability spaces, which includes so called PI- and RCD(K,N)-spaces, the Lipschitz module is pointwise finite dimensional. A general renorming theorem together with the characterization above shows that the Sobolev spaces of such spaces are reflexive.
