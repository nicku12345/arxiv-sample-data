In this note, we extend the main results of our paper on quasilinearization and curvature of Aleksandrov spaces of curvature \leq0 to curvature bounds other than 0. For non-zero K, we employ the previously introduced notion of the K-quadrilateral cosine, which is the cosine under parallel transport in model K-space, and which is denoted by \operatorname{cosq}_{K}. Our principal result states that a geodesically connected metric space (of diameter not greater than \pi/\left(2\sqrt{K}\right)  if K>0) is an \Re_{K} domain (otherwise known as a \operatorname{CAT}\left(K\right)  space) if and only if always \operatorname{cosq}_{K}\leq1 or always \operatorname{cosq}_{K} \geq-1. (We prove that in such spaces always \operatorname{cosq}_{K}\leq1 is equivalent to always \operatorname{cosq}% _{K} \geq-1). As a corollary, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a Cauchy complete semimetric space to be a complete \Re_{K} domain. We show that in our theorem the diameter hypothesis for positive K is sharp and we prove an extremal theorem when |\operatorname{cosq}_{K}| attains an upper bound of 1. We derive from our main theorem and our previous result for K=0 a complete solution of Gromov's curvature problem in the context of Aleksandrov spaces of curvature bounded above. Then we establish the K-Euler's inequality and the extremal theorem for equality in the K-Euler's inequality in an \Re_{K} domain.
