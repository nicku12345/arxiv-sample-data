We prove that there exists an absolute constant \alpha >1 with the following property: if K is a convex body in {\mathbb R}^n whose center of mass is at the origin, then a random subset X\subset K of cardinality {\rm card}(X)=\lceil\alpha n\rceil  satisfies with probability greater than 1-e^{-n} {K\subseteq c_1n\,{\mathrm conv}(X),} where c_1>0 is an absolute constant. As an application we show that the vertex index of any convex body K in {\mathbb R}^n is bounded by c_2n^2, where c_2>0 is an absolute constant, thus extending an estimate of Bezdek and Litvak for the symmetric case.
