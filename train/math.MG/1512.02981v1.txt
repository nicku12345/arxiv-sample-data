A Euclidean t-design, as introduced by Neumaier and Seidel (1988), is a finite set {\cal X} \subset \mathbb{R}^n with a weight function w: {\cal X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+ for which \sum_{r \in R} W_r \overline{f}_{S_{r}} = \sum_{{\bf x} \in {\cal X}} w({\bf x}) f({\bf x}) holds for every polynomial f of total degree at most t; here R is the set of norms of the points in {\cal X}, W_r is the total weight of all elements of {\cal X} with norm r, S_r is the n-dimensional sphere of radius r centered at the origin, and \overline{f}_{S_{r}} is the average of f over S_{r}. Neumaier and Seidel (1988), as well as Delsarte and Seidel (1989), also proved a Fisher-type inequality |{\cal X}| \geq N(n,|R|,t) (assuming that the design is antipodal if t is odd). For fixed n and |R| we have N(n,|R|,t)=O(t^{n-1}). In Part I of this paper we provide a recursive construction for Euclidean t-designs in \mathbb{R}^n. Namely, we show how to use certain Gauss--Jacobi quadrature formulae to "lift" a Euclidean t-design in \mathbb{R}^{n-1} to a Euclidean t-design in \mathbb{R}^{n}, preserving both the norm spectrum R and the weight sum W_r for each r \in R. A Euclidean design with exactly N(n,|R|,t) points is called tight. In Part II of this paper we construct tight Euclidean designs for n=2 and every t and |R| with |R| \leq \frac{t+5}{4}. We also provide examples for tight Euclidean designs with (n,|R|,t) \in \{(3,2,5),(3,3,7),(4,2,7)\}.
