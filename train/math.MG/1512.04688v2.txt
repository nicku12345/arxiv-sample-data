We consider a class of iterated function systems (IFSs) of contracting similarities of R^n, introduced by Hutchinson, for which the invariant set possesses a natural H\"older continuous parameterization by the unit interval. When such an invariant set is homeomorphic to an interval, we give necessary conditions in terms of the similarities alone for it to possess a quasisymmetric (and as a corollary, bi-H\"older) parameterization. We also give a related necessary condition for the invariant set of such an IFS to be homeomorphic to an interval.
