We consider the following Bezout inequality for mixed volumes: V(K_1,\dots,K_r,\Delta[{n-r}])V_n(\Delta)^{r-1}\leq \prod_{i=1}^r V(K_i,\Delta[{n-1}])\ \text{ for }2\leq r\leq n. It was shown previously that the inequality is true for any n-dimensional simplex \Delta and any convex bodies K_1, \dots, K_r in \mathbb{R}^n. It was conjectured that simplices are the only convex bodies for which the inequality holds for arbitrary bodies K_1, \dots, K_r in \mathbb{R}^n. In this paper we prove that this is indeed the case if we assume that \Delta is a convex polytope. Thus the Bezout inequality characterizes simplices in the class of convex n-polytopes. In addition, we show that if a body \Delta satisfies the Bezout inequality for all bodies K_1, \dots, K_r then the boundary of \Delta cannot have strict points. In particular, it cannot have points with positive Gaussian curvature.
