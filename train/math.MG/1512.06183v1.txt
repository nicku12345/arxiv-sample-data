This paper presents a general method for obtaining radius of the corresponding circumference to a cyclical polygon n sides given the lengths of said sides, using the notion of complex number. As of radius r, obtained, can then be calculated polygon area in question applying known expressions which requires, after n=4, a powerful calculation tool. Are also given like elements regarding non convex polygons cyclic, although in this respect it deepens less and is not considered, course, the calculation of areas.
