We obtain upper and lower bounds for the nonlinear variational capacity of thin annuli in weighted \mathbf{R}^n and in metric spaces, primarily under the assumptions of an annular decay property and a Poincar\'e inequality. In particular, if the measure has the 1-annular decay property at x_0 and the metric space supports a pointwise 1-Poincar\'e inequality at x_0, then the upper and lower bounds are comparable and we get a two-sided estimate for thin annuli centred at x_0, which generalizes the known estimate for the usual variational capacity in unweighted \mathbf{R}^n. Most of our estimates are sharp, which we show by supplying several key counterexamples. We also characterize the 1-annular decay property.
