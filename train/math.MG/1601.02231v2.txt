We provide an affirmative answer to a variant of the Busemann-Petty problem, proposed by V.~Milman: Let K be a convex body in {\mathbb R}^n and let D be a compact subset of {\mathbb R}^n such that, for some 1\ls k\ls n-1, |P_F(K)|\ls |D\cap F| for all F\in G_{n,k}, where P_F(K) is the orthogonal projection of K onto F and D\cap F is the intersection of D with F. Then, |K|\ls |D|. We also provide estimates for the lower dimensional Busemann-Petty and Shephard problems, and we prove separation in the original Busemann-Petty problem.
