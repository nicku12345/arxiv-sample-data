Let x_1,\ldots ,x_N be independent random points distributed according to an isotropic log-concave measure \mu  on {\mathbb R}^n, and consider the random polytope K_N:={\rm conv}\{ \pm x_1,\ldots ,\pm x_N\}. We provide sharp estimates for the querma\ss{}integrals and other geometric parameters of K_N in the range cn\ls N\ls\exp (n); these complement previous results from \cite{DGT1} and \cite{DGT} that were given for the range cn\ls N\ls\exp (\sqrt{n}). One of the basic new ingredients in our work is a recent result of E.~Milman that determines the mean width of the centroid body Z_q(\mu ) of \mu  for all 1\ls q\ls n.
