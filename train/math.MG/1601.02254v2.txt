Let K be an isotropic symmetric convex body in {\mathbb R}^n. We show that a subspace F\in G_{n,n-k} of codimension k=\gamma n, where \gamma\in (1/\sqrt{n},1), satisfies K\cap F\subseteq \frac{c}{\gamma }\sqrt{n}L_K (B_2^n\cap F) with probability greater than 1-\exp (-\sqrt{n}). Using a different method we study the same question for the L_q-centroid bodies Z_q(\mu ) of an isotropic log-concave probability measure \mu  on {\mathbb R}^n. For every 1\leq q\leq n and \gamma\in (0,1) we show that a random subspace F\in G_{n,(1-\gamma )n} satisfies Z_q(\mu )\cap F\subseteq c_2(\gamma )\sqrt{q}\,B_2^n\cap F. We also give bounds on the diameter of random projections of Z_q(\mu ) and using them we deduce that if K is an isotropic convex body in {\mathbb R}^n then for a random subspace F of dimension (\log n)^4 one has that all directions in F are sub-Gaussian with constant O(\log^2n).
