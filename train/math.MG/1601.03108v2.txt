We provide a new representation of an \mathbb R-tree by using a special set of metric rays. We have captured the four-point condition from these metric rays and shown an equivalence between the \mathbb R-trees with radial and river metrics, and these sets of metric rays. In stochastic analysis, these graphical representation theorems are of particular interest in identifying Brownian motions indexed by \mathbb R-trees.
