 \renewcommand{\subset}{\subseteq} \newcommand{\N}{\mathbb N} For p\in [2,\infty) the metric X_p inequality with sharp scaling parameter is proven here to hold true in L_p. The geometric consequences of this result include the following sharp statements about embeddings of L_q into L_p when 2< q<p<\infty: the maximal \theta\in (0,1] for which L_q admits a bi-\theta-H\"older embedding into L_p equals q/p, and for m,n\in \N the smallest possible bi-Lipschitz distortion of any embedding into L_p of the grid \{1,\ldots,m\}^n\subset \ell_q^n is bounded above and below by constant multiples (depending only on p,q) of the quantity \min\{n^{(p-q)(q-2)/(q^2(p-2))}, m^{(q-2)/q}\}.
