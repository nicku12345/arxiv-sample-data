Four packings of hyperbolic 3-space are known to yield the optimal packing density of 0.85328\dots. They are realized in the regular tetrahedral and cubic Coxeter honeycombs with Schl\"afli symbols \{3,3,6 \} and \{4,3,6\}. These honeycombs are totally asymptotic, and the packings consist of horoballs (of different types) centered at the ideal vertices. We describe a method to visualize regular horoball packings of extended hyperbolic 3-space \bar{\mathbb{H}}^3 using the Beltrami-Klein model and the Coxeter group of the packing. We produce the first known images of these four optimal horoball packings.
