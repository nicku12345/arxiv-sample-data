The Fermat-Steiner problem consists in finding all points in a metric space Y such that the sum of distances from each of them to the points from some fixed finite subset of Y is minimal. This problem is investigated for the metric space Y=H(X) of compact subsets of a metric space X, endowed with the Hausdorff distance. For the case of a proper metric space X a description of all compacts K\in H(X) which the minimum is attained at is obtained. In particular, the Steiner minimal trees for three-element boundaries are described. We also construct an example of a regular triangle in H(R^2), such that all its shortest trees have no "natural" symmetry.
