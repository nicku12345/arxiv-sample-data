In this paper we give lower and upper bounds for the volume growth of a regular hyperbolic simplex, namely for the ratio of the n-dimensional volume of a regular simplex and the (n-1)-dimensional volume of its facets. In addition to the methods of U. Haagerup and M. Munkholm we use a third volume form is based on the hyperbolic orthogonal coordinates of a body. In the case of the ideal, regular simplex our upper bound gives the best known upper bound. On the other hand, also in the ideal case our general lower bound, improved the best known one for n=3.
