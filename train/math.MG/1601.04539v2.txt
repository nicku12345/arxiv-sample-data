New classes of distance-constrained structures are introduced, namely string-node nets and meshes, a mesh being a string-node net for which the nodes are dense in the strings. Various construction schemes are given including the minimal extension of a (countable) line segment net by an arbitrary countable scaling group. A linear mesh has strings that are straight lines and nodes given by the intersection points of these lines. Classes of linear meshes, such as the regular linear meshes in R^2 and R^3, are defined and classified. Contrasting flexing and rigidity properties are obtained for some fundamental meshes in the plane with respect to noncrossing motions in the space of smooth meshes.
