Fibonacci word fractals are a class of fractals that have been studied recently, though the word they are generated from is more widely studied in combinatorics. The Fibonacci word can be used to draw a curve which possesses self-similarities determined by the recursive structure of the word. The Hausdorff dimension of the scaling limit of the finite Fibonacci word curves is computed for i-Fibonacci curves and any drawing angle between 0 and \pi/2.
