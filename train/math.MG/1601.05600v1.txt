We provide general inequalities that compare the surface area S(K) of a convex body K in {\mathbb R}^n to the minimal, average or maximal surface area of its hyperplane or lower dimensional projections. We discuss the same questions for all the quermassintegrals of K. We examine separately the dependence of the constants on the dimension in the case where K is in some of the classical positions or K is a projection body. Our results are in the spirit of the hyperplane problem, with sections replaced by projections and volume by surface area.
