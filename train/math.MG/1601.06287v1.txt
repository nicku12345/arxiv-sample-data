In this paper we study a metric generalization of the sine function which can be extended to arbitrary normed planes. We derive its main properties and give also some characterizations of Radon planes. Furthermore, we prove that the existence of an angular measure which is "well-behaving" with respect to the sine is only possible in the Euclidean plane, and we also define some new constants that estimate how non-Radon or non-Euclidean a normed plane can be. Sine preserving self-mappings are studied, and a complete description of the linear ones is given. In the last section we exhibit a version of the Law of Sines for Radon planes.
