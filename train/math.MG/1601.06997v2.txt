In this work we study upper bounds for the ratio of successive inner and outer radii of a convex body K. This problem was studied by Perel'man and Pukhov and it is a natural generalization of the classical results of Jung and Steinhagen. We also introduce a technique which relates sections and projections of a convex body in an optimal way.
