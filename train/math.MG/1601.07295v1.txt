In a d-dimensional convex body K random points X_0, \dots, X_d are chosen. Their convex hull is a random simplex. The expected volume of a random simplex is monotone under set inclusion, if K \subset L implies that the expected volume of a random simplex in K is smaller than the expected volume of a random simplex in L. Continuing work of Rademacher, it is shown that moments of the volume of random simplices are in general not monotone under set inclusion.
