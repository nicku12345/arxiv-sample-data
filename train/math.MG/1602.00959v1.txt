Barker and Larman asked the following. Let K' \subset {\Bbb{R}}^d be a convex body, whose interior contains a given convex body K \subset {\Bbb{R}}^d, and let, for all supporting hyperplanes H of K, the (d-1)-volumes of the intersections K' \cap H be given. Is K' then uniquely determined? Yaskin and Zhang asked the analogous question when, for all supporting hyperplanes H of K, the d-volumes of the "caps" cut off from K' by H are given. We give local positive answers to both of these questions, for small C^2-perturbations of K, provided the boundary of K is C^2_+. In both cases, (d-1)-volumes or d-volumes can be replaced by k-dimensional quermassintegrals for 1 \le k \le d-1 or for 1 \le k \le d, respectively. Moreover, in the first case we can admit, rather than hyperplane sections, sections by l-dimensional affine planes, where 1 \le k \le l \le d-1. In fact, here not all l-dimensional affine subspaces are needed, but only a small subset of them (actually, a (d-1)-manifold), for unique local determination of K'.
