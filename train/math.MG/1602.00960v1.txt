We investigate geometrical properties and inequalities satisfied by the complex difference body, in the sense of studying which of the classical ones for the difference body have an analog in the complex framework. Among others we give an equivalent expression for the support function of the complex difference body and prove that, unlike the classical case, the dimension of the complex difference body depends on the position of the body with respect to the complex structure of the vector space. We use spherical harmonics to characterize the bodies for which the complex difference body is a ball, we prove that it is a polytope if and only if the two bodies involved in the construction are polytopes and provide several inequalities for classical magnitudes of the complex difference body, as volume, quermassintegrals and diameter, in terms of the corresponding ones for the involved bodies.
