The difference body operator enjoys different characterization results relying on its basic properties such as continuity, SL(n)-covariance, Minkowski valuation or symmetric image. The Rogers-Shephard and the Brunn-Minkowski inequalities provide upper and lower bounds for the volume of the difference body in terms of the volume of the body itself. In this paper we aim to understand the role of the Rogers-Shephard inequality in characterization results of the difference body and, at the same time, to study the interplay among the different properties. Among others, we prove that the difference body operator is the only continuous and GL(n)-covariant operator from the space of convex bodies to the origin-symmetric ones which satisfies a Rogers-Shephard type inequality while every continuous and GL(n)-covariant operator satisfies a Brunn-Minkowski type inequality.
