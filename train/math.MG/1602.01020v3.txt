A finite family {\mathcal B} of balls with respect to an arbitrary norm in {\mathbb R}^d (d\geq 2) is called a non-separable family if there is no hyperplane disjoint from \bigcup {\mathcal B} that strictly separates some elements of {\mathcal B} from all the other elements of {\mathcal B} in {\mathbb R}^d. In this paper we prove that if {\mathcal B} is a non-separable family of balls of radii r_1, r_2,\ldots , r_n (n\geq 2) with respect to an arbitrary norm in {\mathbb R}^d (d\geq 2), then \bigcup {\mathcal B} can be covered by a ball of radius \sum_{i=1}^n r_i. This was conjectured by Erdos for the Euclidean norm and was proved for that case by A. W. Goodman and R. E. Goodman [Amer. Math. Monthly 52 (1945), 494-498]. On the other hand, in the same paper A. W. Goodman and R. E. Goodman conjectured that their theorem extends to arbitrary non-separable finite families of positive homothetic convex bodies in {\mathbb R}^d, d\ge2. Besides giving a counterexample to their conjecture, we prove that conjecture under various additional conditions.
