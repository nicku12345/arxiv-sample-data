This paper is devoted to introduce new geometric constants that quantify the difference between Roberts orthogonality and Birkhoff orthogonality in normed planes. We start by characterizing Roberts orthogonality in two different ways: via bisectors of two points and using certain linear transformations. Each of these characterizations yields one of those geometric constants that we will study.
