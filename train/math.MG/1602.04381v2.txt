Let \delta_0(P,k) denote the degree k dilation of a point set P in the domain of plane geometric spanners. If \Lambda is the infinite square lattice, it is shown that 1+\sqrt{2} \leq \delta_0(\Lambda,3) \leq (3+2\sqrt2) \, 5^{-1/2} = 2.6065\ldots and \delta_0(\Lambda,4) = \sqrt{2}. If \Lambda is the infinite hexagonal lattice, it is shown that \delta_0(\Lambda,3) = 1+\sqrt{3} and \delta_0(\Lambda,4) = 2. All our constructions are planar lattice tilings constrained to degree 3 or 4.
