A d-dimensional simplex S is called a k-reptile (or a k-reptile simplex) if it can be tiled by k simplices with disjoint interiors that are all mutually congruent and similar to S. For d=2, triangular k-reptiles exist for all k of the form a^2, 3a^2 or a^2 + b^2 and they have been completely characterized by Snover, Waiveris, and Williams. On the other hand, the only k-reptile simplices that are known for d \ge 3, have k = m^d, where m is a positive integer. We substantially simplify the proof by Matou\v{s}ek and the second author that for d=3, k-reptile tetrahedra can exist only for k=m^3. We then prove a weaker analogue of this result for d=4 by showing that four-dimensional k-reptile simplices can exist only for k=m^2.
