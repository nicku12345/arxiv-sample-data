We consider a large class of geodesic metric spaces, including Banach spaces, hyperbolic spaces and geodesic \mathrm{CAT}(\kappa)-spaces, and investigate the space of nonexpansive mappings on either a convex or a star-shaped subset in these settings. We prove that the strict contractions form a negligible subset of this space in the sense that they form a \sigma-porous subset. For separable metric spaces we show that a generic nonexpansive mapping has Lipschitz constant one at typical points of its domain. These results contain the case of nonexpansive self-mappings and the case of nonexpansive set-valued mappings as particular cases.
