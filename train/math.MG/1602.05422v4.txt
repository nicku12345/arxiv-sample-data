This paper consists of two parts. In the first one we study the behaviour of medial axes (skeletons) of closed, definable (in some o-minimal structure) sets in {\Rz}^n under deformations. The second one is devoted to a similar study of conflict sets in definable families. We apply a new approach to the deformation process. Instead of seeing it as a `jump' from the initial to the final state, we perceive it as a continuous process, expressed using the Kuratowski convergence of sets (hence, unlike other authors, we do not require any regularity of the deformation). Our main `medial axis inner semi-continuity' result has already proved useful, as it was used to compute the tangent cone of the medial axis with application in singularity theory.
