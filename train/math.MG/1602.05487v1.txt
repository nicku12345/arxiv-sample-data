We consider the problem \min\int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{1}{2}|\dot{\gamma}|^2+W(\gamma)\mathop{}\mathopen{}\mathrm{d} t  among curves connecting two given wells of W\geq 0 and we reduce it, following a standard method, to a geodesic problem of the form \min\int_0^1 K(\gamma)|\dot{\gamma}|\mathop{}\mathopen{}\mathrm{d} t with K=\sqrt{2W}. We then prove existence of curves minimizing this new action just by proving that the distance induced by K is proper (i.e. its closed balls are compact). The assumptions on W are minimal, and the method seems robust enough to be applied in the future to some PDE problems.
