We show that self-conformal subsets of \mathbb{R} that do not satisfy the weak separation condition have full Assouad dimension. Combining this with a recent results by K\"aenm\"aki and Rossi we conclude that an interesting dichotomy applies to self-conformal and not just self-similar sets: if F\subset\mathbb{R} is self-conformal with Hausdorff dimension strictly less than 1, either the Hausdorff dimension and Assouad dimension agree or the Assouad dimension is 1. We conclude that the weak separation property is in this case equivalent to Assouad and Hausdorff dimension coinciding. (This manuscript contains errors, see comment below.)
