We present a new construction of Radon curves which only uses convexity methods. In other words, it does not rely on an auxiliary Euclidean background metric (as in the classical works of J. Radon, W. Blaschke, G. Birkhoff, and M. M. Day), and also it does not use typical methods from plane Minkowski Geometry (as proposed by H. Martini and K. J. Swanepoel). We also discuss some properties of normed planes whose unit circle is a Radon curve and give characterizations of Radon curves only in terms of Convex Geometry.
