We characterize all possible relative positions between a hyperboloid of one sheet and a sphere through the roots of a characteristic polynomial associated to these quadrics. The classification is also suitable for a hyperboloid and a ellipsoid in some situations.   As an application, this provides a method to detect contact between the two surfaces by a simple calculation in many real world applications.
