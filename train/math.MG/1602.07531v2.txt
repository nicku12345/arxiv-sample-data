Is it true that a convex body K being complete and reduced with respect to some gauge body C is necessarily of constant width, that is, satisfies K-K=\rho(C-C) for some \rho>0?   We prove this implication for several cases including the following: if K is a simplex and or if K possesses a smooth extreme point, then the implication holds. Moreover, we derive several new results on perfect norms.
