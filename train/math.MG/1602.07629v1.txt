A Borel set B \subset \mathbb{R}^{n} is visible from x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, if the radial projection of B with base point x has positive \mathcal{H}^{n - 1} measure. I prove that if \dim B > n - 1, then B is visible from every point x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \setminus E, where E is an exceptional set with dimension \dim E \leq 2(n - 1) - \dim B. This is the sharp bound for all n \geq 2.   Many parts of the proof were already contained in a recent previous paper by P. Mattila and the author, where a weaker bound for \dim E was derived as a corollary from a certain slicing theorem. Here, no improvement to the slicing result is obtained; in brief, the main observation of the present paper is that the proof method gives the optimal result, when applied directly to the visibility problem.
