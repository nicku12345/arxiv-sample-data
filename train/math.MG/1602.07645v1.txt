A set C of unit vectors in \mathbb{R}^d is called an L-spherical code if x \cdot y \in L for any distinct x,y in C. Spherical codes have been extensively studied since their introduction in the 1970's by Delsarte, Goethals and Seidel. In this note we prove a conjecture of Bukh on the maximum size of spherical codes. In particular, we show that for any set of k fixed angles, one can choose at most O(d^k) lines in \mathbb{R}^d such that any pair of them forms one of these angles.
