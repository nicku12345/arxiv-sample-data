We study closed three-dimensional Alexandrov spaces with a lower Ricci curvature bound in the \mathsf{CD}^*(K,N) sense, focusing our attention on those with positive or nonnegative Ricci curvature. First, we show that a closed three-dimensional \mathsf{CD}^*(2,3)-Alexandrov space must be homeomorphic to a spherical space form or to the suspension of \mathbb{R}P^2. We then classify closed three-dimensional \mathsf{CD}^*(0,3)-Alexandrov spaces.
