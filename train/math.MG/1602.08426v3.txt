Suppose that a metric space X is the union of two metric subspaces A and B that embed into Euclidean space with distortions D_A and D_B, respectively. We prove that then X embeds into Euclidean space with a bounded distortion (namely, with distortion at most 7D_A D_B + 2(D_A+D_B)). Our result settles an open problem posed by Naor. Additionally, we present some corollaries and extensions of this result. In particular, we introduce and study a new concept of an "external bi-Lipschitz extension".   In the end of the paper, we list a few related open problems.
