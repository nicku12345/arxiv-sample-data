Given a real closed polytope P, we first describe the Fourier transform of its indicator function by using iterations of Stokes' theorem. We then use the ensuing Fourier transform formulations, together with the Poisson summation formula, to give a new algorithm to count fractionally-weighted lattice points inside the one-parameter family of all real dilates of P. The combinatorics of the face poset of P plays a central role in the description of the Fourier transform of P. We also obtain a closed form for the codimension-1 coefficient that appears in an expansion of this sum in powers of the real dilation parameter t. This closed form generalizes some known results about the Macdonald solid-angle polynomial, which is the analogous expression traditionally obtained by requiring that t assumes only integer values. Although most of the present methodology applies to all real polytopes, a particularly nice application is to the study of all real dilates of integer (and rational) polytopes.
