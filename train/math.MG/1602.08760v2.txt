Let \mathrm{SO}^+(p,q) denote the identity connected component of the real orthogonal group with signature (p,q). We give a complete description of the spaces of continuous and generalized translation- and \mathrm{SO}^+(p,q)-invariant valuations, generalizing Hadwiger's classification of Euclidean isometry-invariant valuations. As a result of independent interest, we identify within the space of translation-invariant valuations the class of Klain-Schneider continuous valuations, which strictly contains all continuous translation-invariant valuations. The operations of pull-back and push-forward by a linear map extend naturally to this class.
