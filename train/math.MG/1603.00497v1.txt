We prove that a closed surface with a CAT(\kappa) metric has Hausdorff dimension = 2, and that there are uniform upper and lower bounds on the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure of small metric balls. We also discuss a connection between this uniformity condition and some results on the dynamics of the geodesic flow for such surfaces. Finally, we give a short proof of topological entropy rigidity for geodesic flow on certain CAT(-1) manifolds.
