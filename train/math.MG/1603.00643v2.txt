The concept of an i-symmetrization is introduced, which provides a convenient framework for most of the familiar symmetrization processes on convex sets. Various properties of i-symmetrizations are introduced and the relations between them investigated. New expressions are provided for the Steiner and Minkowski symmetrals of a compact convex set which exhibit a dual relationship between them. Characterizations of Steiner, Minkowski and central symmetrization, in terms of natural properties that they enjoy, are given and examples are provided to show that none of the assumptions made can be dropped or significantly weakened. Other familiar symmetrizations, such as Schwarz symmetrization, are discussed and several new ones introduced.
