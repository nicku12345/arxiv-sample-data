Let \Delta be the optimal packing density of \mathbb R^n by unit balls. We show the optimal packing density using two sizes of balls approaches \Delta + (1 - \Delta) \Delta as the ratio of the radii tends to infinity. More generally, if B is a body and D is a finite set of bodies, then the optimal density \Delta_{\{rB\} \cup D} of packings consisting of congruent copies of the bodies from \{rB\} \cup D converges to \Delta_D + (1 - \Delta_D) \Delta_{\{B\}} as r tends to zero.
