Consider n points X_1,\ldots,X_n in \mathbb R^d and denote their convex hull by \Pi. We prove a number of inclusion-exclusion identities for the system of convex hulls \Pi_I:=conv(X_i\colon i\in I), where I ranges over all subsets of \{1,\ldots,n\}. For instance, denoting by c_k(X) the number of k-element subcollections of (X_1,\ldots,X_n) whose convex hull contains a point X\in\mathbb R^d, we prove that  c_1(X)-c_2(X)+c_3(X)-\ldots + (-1)^{n-1} c_n(X) = (-1)^{\dim \Pi}  for all X in the relative interior of \Pi. This confirms a conjecture of R. Cowan [Adv. Appl. Probab., 39(3):630--644, 2007] who proved the above formula for almost all X. We establish similar results for the number of polytopes \Pi_J containing a given polytope \Pi_I as an r-dimensional face, thus proving another conjecture of R. Cowan [Discrete Comput. Geom., 43(2):209--220, 2010]. As a consequence, we derive inclusion-exclusion identities for the intrinsic volumes and the face numbers of the polytopes \Pi_I. The main tool in our proofs is a formula for the alternating sum of the face numbers of a convex polytope intersected by an affine subspace. This formula generalizes the classical Euler--Schl\"afli--Poincar\'e relation and is of independent interest.
