Let \mu be a Borel probability measure in \mathbb R^d. For a k-flat \alpha consider the value \inf \mu(H), where H runs through all half-spaces containing \alpha. This infimum is called the half-space depth of \alpha.   Bukh, Matou\v{s}ek and Nivasch conjectured that for every \mu and every 0 \leq k < d there exists a k-flat with the depth at least \tfrac{k + 1}{k + d + 1}. The Rado Centerpoint Theorem implies a lower bound of \tfrac{1}{d + 1 - k} (the Rado bound), which is, in general, much weaker. Whenever the Rado bound coincides with the bound conjectured by Bukh, Matou\v{s}ek and Nivasch, i.e., for k = 0 and k = d - 1, it is known to be optimal.   In this paper we show that for all other pairs (d, k) one can improve on the Rado bound. If k = 1 and d \geq 3 we show that there is a 1-dimensional line with the depth at least \tfrac{1}{d} + \tfrac{1}{3d^3}. As a corollary, for all (d, k) satisfying 0 < k < d - 1 there exists a k-flat with depth at least \tfrac{1}{d + 1 - k} + \tfrac{1}{3(d + 1 - k)^3}.
