Let X(n), for n\in\mathbb{N}, be the set of all subsets of a metric space (X,d) of cardinality at most n. The set X(n) equipped with the Hausdorff metric is called a finite subset space. In this paper we are concerned with the existence of Lipschitz retractions r: X(n)\to X(n-1) for n\ge2. It is known that such retractions do not exist if X is the one-dimensional sphere. On the other hand L. Kovalev has recently established their existence in case X is a Hilbert space and he also posed a question as to whether or not such Lipschitz retractions exist for X being a Hadamard space. In the present paper we answer this question in the positive.
