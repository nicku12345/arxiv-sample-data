We provide an alternative, constructive proof that the collection \mathcal{M} of isometry classes of compact metric spaces endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is a geodesic space. The core of our proof is a construction of explicit geodesics on \mathcal{M}. We also provide several interesting examples of geodesics on \mathcal{M}, including a geodesic between \mathbb{S}^0 and \mathbb{S}^n for any n\geq 1.
