This paper presents a new variation of Tverberg's theorem. Given a discrete set S of R^d, we study the number of points of S needed to guarantee the existence of an m-partition of the points such that the intersection of the m convex hulls of the parts contains at least k points of S. The proofs of the main results require new quantitative versions of Helly's and Carath\'eodory's theorems.
