Let M and N be smooth (real or complex) manifolds, and let M be equipped with some Riemannian metric. A continuous map f\colon M\longrightarrow N admits a local k-multiplicity if, for every real number \omega >0, there exist k pairwise distinct points x_1,\ldots,x_k in M such that f(x_1)=\cdots=f(x_k) and \diam\{x_1,\ldots,x_k\}<\omega. In this paper we systematically study the existence of local k-mutiplicities and derive criteria for the existence of local k-multiplicity in terms of Stiefel--Whitney classes and Chern classes of the vector bundle f^*\tau N\oplus(-\tau M). For example, as a corollary of one criterion we deduce that for k\geq 2 a power of 2, M a compact smooth manifold with the integer s:=\max\{\ell : \bar{w}_{\ell}(M)\neq 0\}, and N a parallelizable smooth manifold, if s\geq \dim N-\dim M+1 and \bar{w}_{s}(M)^{k-1}\neq 0, any continuous map M\longrightarrow N admits a local k-multiplicity. Furthermore, as a special case of this corollary we recover, when k=2, the classical criterion for the non-existence of an immersion M\looparrowright N between manifolds M and N.
