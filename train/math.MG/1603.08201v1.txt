Let C(n) be the solution to the contact number problem, i.e., the maximum number of touching pairs among any packing of n congruent spheres in \mathbb{R}^3. We prove the long conjectured values of C(6)=12, C(7)=15, and C(8)=18. The proof strategy generalizes under an extensive case analysis to C(9)=21, C(10) = 25, C(11) = 29, C(12) = 33, and C(13) = 36. These results have great importance for condensed matter physics, materials science, crystallography, organic and physical chemistry of interfaces.
