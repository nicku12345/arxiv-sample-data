A subset of a convex body B containing the origin in a Euclidean space is {\it parkable in B} if it can be translated inside B in such a manner that the translate the origin. We provide characterizations of ellipsoids and of centrally symmetric convex bodies in Euclidean spaces of dimension \ge 3 based on the notion of parkability, answering several questions posed by G. Bergman.   The techniques used, which are based on characterizations of Hilbert spaces among finite-dimensional Banach spaces in terms of their lattices of subspaces and algebras of endomorphisms, also apply to improve a result of W. Blaschke characterizing ellipsoids in terms of boundaries of illumination.
