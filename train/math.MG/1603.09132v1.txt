Nandakumar asked whether there is a tiling of the plane by pairwise non-congruent triangles of equal area and equal perimeter. Here a weaker result is obtained: there is a tiling of the plane by pairwise non-congruent triangles of equal area such that their perimeter is bounded by some common constant. Several variants of the problem are stated, some of them are answered.
