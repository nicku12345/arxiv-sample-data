Suppose that C is a bounded convex subset of \mathbb{R}^n, and that P_1, \dots, P_k are planks which cover C in respective directions v_1, \dots, v_k and with widths w_1, \dots, w_k. In 1951, Bang conjectured that \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{w_i}{w_{v_i}(C)} \geq 1,  generalizing a previous conjecture of Tarski. Here, w_{v_i}(C) is the width of C in the direction v_i. In this note we give a short proof of this conjecture under the assumption that, for every m with 1 \leq m \leq k,  C \setminus \bigcup_{i = 1}^m P_i  is a convex set.
