To each \alpha\in(1/3,1/2) we associate the Cantor set \Gamma_{\alpha}:=\Big\{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\epsilon_{i}\alpha^i: \epsilon_i\in\{0,1\},\,i\geq 1\Big\}.   In this paper we consider the intersection \Gamma_\alpha \cap (\Gamma_\alpha + t) for any translation t\in\mathbb{R}. We pay special attention to those t with a unique   \{-1,0,1\} \alpha-expansion, and study the set   D_\alpha:=\{\dim_H(\Gamma_\alpha \cap (\Gamma_\alpha + t)):t \textrm{ has a unique }\{-1,0,1\}\,\alpha\textrm{-expansion}\}. We prove that there exists a transcendental number \alpha_{KL}\approx 0.39433\ldots such that: D_\alpha is finite for \alpha\in(\alpha_{KL},1/2), D_{\alpha_{KL}} is infinitely countable, and D_{\alpha} contains an interval for \alpha\in(1/3,\alpha_{KL}). We also prove that D_\alpha equals [0,\frac{\log 2}{-\log \alpha}] if and only if \alpha\in (1/3,\frac {3-\sqrt{5}}{2}].   As a consequence of our investigation we prove some results on the possible values of \dim_{H}(\Gamma_\alpha \cap (\Gamma_\alpha + t)) when \Gamma_\alpha \cap (\Gamma_\alpha + t) is a self-similar set. We also give examples of t with a continuum of \{-1,0,1\} \alpha-expansions for which we can explicitly calculate \dim_{H}(\Gamma_\alpha\cap(\Gamma_\alpha+t)), and for which \Gamma_\alpha\cap (\Gamma_\alpha+t) is a self-similar set. We also construct \alpha and t for which \Gamma_\alpha \cap (\Gamma_\alpha + t) contains only transcendental numbers.   Our approach makes use of digit frequency arguments and a lexicographic characterisation of those t with a unique \{-1,0,1\} \alpha-expansion.
