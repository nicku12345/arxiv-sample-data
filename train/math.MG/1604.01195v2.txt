Roughly speaking, let us say that a map between metric spaces is large scale conformal if it maps packings by large balls to large quasi-balls with limited overlaps. This quasi-isometry invariant notion makes sense for finitely generated groups. Inspired by work by Benjamini and Schramm, we show that under such maps, some kind of dimension increases: exponent of volume growth for nilpotent groups, conformal dimension of the ideal boundary for hyperbolic groups. A purely metric space notion of {\ell} p-cohomology plays a key role.
