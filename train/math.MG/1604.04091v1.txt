Recently, M. Badger and R. Schul proved that for a 1-rectifiable Radon measure \mu, the density weighted Jones' square function  J_{1}(x) = \mathop{\sum_{Q \in \mathcal{D}}}_{\ell(Q) \leq 1} \beta_{2,\mu}^{2}(3Q)\frac{\ell(Q)}{\mu(Q)} 1_{Q}(x)  is finite for \mu-a.e. x. Answering a question of Badger-Schul, we show that the converse is not true. Given \epsilon > 0, we construct a Radon probability measure on [0,1]^{2} \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} with the properties that J_{1}(x) \leq \epsilon for all x \in \operatorname{spt} \mu, but nevertheless the 1-dimensional lower density of \mu vanishes almost everywhere. In particular, \mu is purely 1-unrectifiable.
