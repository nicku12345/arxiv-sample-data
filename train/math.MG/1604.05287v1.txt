We prove the following three statements: 1) Let (A, \bar A) be a partition of the spherical surface S^n into two measurable sets. Let st_A and st_{\bar A} be their measure density functions of distance. Then |st_A - st_{\bar A}| depends only on the difference of their n-areas. 2) If the spherical surface S^n is divided in two measurable subsets A and \bar A of equal n-surface, then these two subsets have the same distribution of distance. 3) Let there be a pair (S, S') of subsets of a sphere S^{n} such that st_S = st_{S'}. Then their complementary subsets satisfy st_{\bar S} = st_{\bar S'} and st_{S, \bar S} = st_{S', \bar S'}, where st_{A, B} is the measure density function of distance between a point in A and a point in B. Furthermore, it is shown that the statements remain true when S^n is substituted by the Cartesian product S^{n_1} \times ... \times S^{n_r} endowed with the metric which is naturally inherited from its factors.
