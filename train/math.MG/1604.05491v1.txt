Let E be a Bedford-McMullen carpet determined by a set of affine mappings (f_{ij})_{(i,j)\in G} and \mu a self-affine measure on E associated with a probability vector (p_{ij})_{(i,j)\in G}. We prove that, for every r\in(0,\infty), the upper and lower quantization coefficient are always positive and finite in its exact quantization dimension s_r. As a consequence, the kth quantization error for \mu of order r is of the same order as k^{-\frac{1}{s_r}}. In sharp contrast to the Hausdorff measure for Bedford-McMullen carpets, our result is independent of the horizontal fibres of the carpets.
