A Steinhaus set S \subseteq \RR^d for a set A \subseteq \RR^d is a set such that S has exactly one point in common with \tau A, for every rigid motion \tau of \RR^d. We show here that if A is a finite set of at least two points then there is no such set S which is Lebesgue measurable.   An old result of Komj\'ath says that there exists a Steinhaus set for A = \ZZ\times\Set{0} in \RR^2. We also show here that such a set cannot be Lebesgue measurable.
