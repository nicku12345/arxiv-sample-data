Let G be a group, (M,d) be a metric space, X be a compact subspace of M and \varphi:G\times M \rightarrow M be a left action by homeomorphisms of G on M. Denote gp=f(g,p). The isotropy subgroup of G with respect to X is defined by H_X=\{g\in G; gX=X\}. In this work we define the induced Hausdorff metric on G/H_X by d_X(gH_X,hH_X)=d_H(gX,hX), where d_H is the Hausdorff distance on M. Let \hat d_X be the intrinsic metric induced by d_X. In this work we study the geometry of (G/H_X,d_X) and (G/H_X,\hat d_X). In particular, we prove that if G is a Lie group, M is a differentiable manifold endowed with a metric d which is locally Lipschitz equivalent to a Finsler metric, X is a compact subset of M and \varphi:G \times M \rightarrow M is a smooth left action by isometries of G on M, then (G/H_X,\hat d_X) is C^0-Finsler.
