We show that any graph that is generically globally rigid in \mathbb{R}^d has a realization in \mathbb{R}^d that is both generic and universally rigid. This also implies that the graph also must have a realization in \mathbb{R}^d that is both infinitesimally rigid and universally rigid; such a realization serves as a certificate of generic global rigidity.   Our approach involves an algorithm by Lov\'asz, Saks and Schrijver that, for a sufficiently connected graph, constructs a general position orthogonal representation of the vertices, and a result of Alfakih that shows how this representation leads to a stress matrix and a universally rigid framework of the graph.
