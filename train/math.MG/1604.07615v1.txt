We investigate the geometry of the family \cal M of isometry classes of compact metric spaces, endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff metric. We show that sufficiently small neighborhoods of generic finite spaces in the subspace of all finite metric spaces with the same number of points are isometric to some neighborhoods in the space {\mathbb R}^N_{\infty}, i.e., in the space {\mathbb R}^N with the norm \|(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\|=\max_i|x_i|. As a corollary, we get that each finite metric space can be isometrically embedded into \cal M in such a way that its image belongs to a subspace consisting of all finite metric spaces with the same number k of points. If the initial space has n points, then one can take k as the least possible integer with n\le k(k-1)/2.
