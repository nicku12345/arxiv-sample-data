We give a complete characterization of compact sets with positive reach (=proximally C^1 sets) in the plane and of one-dimensional sets with positive reach in {\mathbb R}^d. Further, we prove that if \emptyset \neq A\subset{\mathbb R}^d is a set of positive reach of topological dimension 0< k \leq d, then A has its "k-dimensional regular part" \emptyset \neq R \subset A which is a k-dimensional "uniform" C^{1,1} manifold open in A and A\setminus R can be locally covered by finitely many (k-1)-dimensional DC surfaces. We also show that if A \subset {\mathbb R}^d has positive reach, then \partial A can be locally covered by finitely many semiconcave hypersurfaces.
