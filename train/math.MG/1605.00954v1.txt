The Minkowski tensors are valuations on the space of convex bodies in {\mathbb R}^n with values in a space of symmetric tensors, having additional covariance and continuity properties. They are extensions of the intrinsic volumes, and as these, they are the subject of classification theorems, and they admit localizations in the form of measure-valued valuations. For these local tensor valuations, restricted to convex polytopes, a classification theorem has been proved recently, under the assumption of isometry covariance, but without any continuity assumption. This characterization result is extended here, replacing the covariance under orthogonal transformations by invariance under proper rotations only. This yields additional local tensor valuations on polytopes in dimensions two and three, but not in higher dimensions. They are completely classified in this paper.
