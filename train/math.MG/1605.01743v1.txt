A a Heintze group is a Lie group of the form N\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{R}, where N is a simply connected nilpotent Lie group and \alpha is a derivation of \mathrm{Lie}(N) whose eigenvalues all have positive real parts. We show that if two purely real Heintze groups equipped with left-invariant metrics are quasi-isometric, then up to a positive scalar multiple, their respective derivations have the same characteristic polynomial. Using the same thecniques, we prove that if we restrict to the class of Heintze groups for which N is the Heisenberg group, then the Jordan form of \alpha, up to positive scalar multiples, is a quasi-isometry invariant.
