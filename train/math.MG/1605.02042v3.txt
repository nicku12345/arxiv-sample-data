We show that every radial continuous valuation V:\mathcal S_0^n\rightarrow \mathbb R defined on the n-dimensional star bodies \mathcal S_0^n, and verifying V(\{0\})=0, can be decomposed as a sum V=V^+-V^-, where both V^+ and V^- are positive radial continuous valuations on \mathcal S_0^n with V^+(\{0\})=V^-(\{0\})=0.   As an application, we show that radial continuous rotationally invariant valuations V on \mathcal S_0^n can be characterized as the applications on star bodies which can be written as V(K)=\int_{S^{n-1}}\theta(\rho_K)dm, where \theta:[0,\infty)\rightarrow \mathbb R is a continuous function, \rho_K is the radial function associated to K and m is the Lebesgue measure on S^{n-1}.   This completes recent work of the second named author, where an analogous result is proved for the case of {\em positive} radial continuous rotationally invariant valuations.
