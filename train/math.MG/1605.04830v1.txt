The notions of a box family and fibred cofinitely-coarse embedding are introduced. The countable, residually amenable groups satisfying the Haagerup property are then characterized as those possessing a box family that admits a fibred cofinitely-coarse embedding into a Hilbert space. This is a generalization of a result of X. Chen, Q. Wang and X. Wang on residually finite groups.
