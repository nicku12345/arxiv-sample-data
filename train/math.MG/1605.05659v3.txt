We characterize cutting sequences of infinite geodesics on square-tiled surfaces by considering interval exchanges on specially chosen intervals on the surface. These interval exchanges can be thought of as skew products over a rotation, and we convert cutting sequences to symbolic trajectories of these interval exchanges to show that special types of combinatorial lifts of Sturmian sequences completely describe all cutting sequences on a square-tiled surface. Our results extend the list of families of surfaces where cutting sequences are understood to a dense subset of the moduli space of all translation surfaces.
