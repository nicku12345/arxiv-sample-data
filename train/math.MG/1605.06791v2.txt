A convex body R in \mathbb R^d is called reduced if the minimal width \Delta(R') of each convex body R'\subset R different from R is strictly smaller than the minimal width \Delta(R) of R. In this article we construct a reduced polytope in \mathbb R^3, i.e. we answer the following question posed by Lassak: do there exist reduced polytopes in \mathbb R^d, d\geqslant3? Also, we prove some properties of reduced polytopes in \mathbb R^3.
