It is natural to ask whether the center of mass of a convex body K\subset \mathbb{R}^n lies in its John ellipsoid B_K, i.e., in the maximal volume ellipsoid contained in K. This question is relevant to the efficiency of many algorithms for convex bodies. In this paper, we obtain an unexpected negative result. There exists a convex body K\subset \mathbb{R}^n such that its center of mass does not lie in the John ellipsoid B_K inflated (1-C\sqrt{\frac{\log(n)} {n}})n times about the center of B_K. Moreover, there exists a polytope P \subset \mathbb{R}^n with O(n^2) facets whose center of mass is not contained in the John ellipsoid B_P inflated O(\frac{n}{\log(n)}) times about the center of B_P.
