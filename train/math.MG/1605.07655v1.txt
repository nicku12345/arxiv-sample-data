A very important question in geometric measure theory is how geometric features of a set translate into analytic information about it. In 1960, E. R. Reifenberg proved that if a set is well approximated by planes at every point and at every scale, then the set is a bi-H\"older image of a plane. It is known today that Carleson-type conditions on these approximating planes guarantee a bi-Lipschitz parameterization of the set. In this paper, we consider an n-Ahlfors regular rectifiable set M \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+d} that satisfies a Poincar\'{e}-type inequality involving the tangential derivative. Then, we show that a Carleson-type condition on the oscillations of the tangent planes of M guarantees that M is contained in a bi-Lipschitz image of an n-plane. We also explore the Poincar\'e-type inequality considered here and show that it is in fact equivalent to other Poincar\'e-type inequalities considered on general metric measure spaces.
