In this paper a special group of bijective maps of a normed plane, called the group of general rotations, is introduced; it contains the isometry group as a subgroup. The concept of general rotations leads to the notion of flexible motions of the plane, and to the concept of Minkowskian roulettes. As a nice consequence of this new approach to motions the validity of a strong analogue to the Euler-Savary equations for Minkowskian roulettes is proved.
