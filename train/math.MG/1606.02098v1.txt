A high-level description of an algorithm which computes the minimum perimeter triangle enclosing a convex polygon in linear time exists in the literature. Besides that an implementation of the algorithm is given in the subsequent work. However, that implementation is incomplete and omits certain common cases. This note's contribution consist of a modern treatment of the algorithm and its consequent simple and robust implementation.
