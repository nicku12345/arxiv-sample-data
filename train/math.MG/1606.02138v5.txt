Let S be a set of n points in real three-dimensional space, no three collinear and not all co-planar. We prove that if the number of planes incident with exactly three points of S is less than Kn^2 for some K=o(n^{\frac{1}{7}}) then, for n sufficiently large, all but at most O(K) points of S are contained in the intersection of two quadrics. Furthermore, we prove that there is a constant c such that if the number of planes incident with exactly three points of S is less than \frac{1}{2}n^2-cn then, for n sufficiently large, S is either a prism, an anti-prism, a prism with a point removed or an anti-prism with a point removed. As a corollary to the main result, we deduce the following theorem. Let S be a set of n points in the real plane. If the number of circles incident with exactly three points of S is less than Kn^2 for some K=o(n^{\frac{1}{7}}) then, for n sufficiently large, all but at most O(K) points of S are contained in a curve of degree at most four.
