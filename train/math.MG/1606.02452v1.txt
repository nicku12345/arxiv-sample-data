A set \Omega in a locally compact abelian group is called spectral if L^2(\Omega) has an orthogonal basis of group characters. An important problem, connected with the so-called Spectral Set Conjecture (saying that \Omega is spectral if and only if a collection of translates of \Omega can partition the group), is the question of whether the spectrality of a product set \Omega = A \times B, in a product group, implies the spectrality of the factors A and B. Recently Greenfeld and Lev proved that if I is an interval and \Omega \subseteq {\mathbb R}^d then the spectrality of I \times \Omega implies the spectrality of \Omega. We give a different proof of this fact by first proving a result about packings of high density implying the existence of tilings by translates of a function. This allows us to improve the result to a wider collection of product sets than those dealt with by Greenfeld and Lev. For instance when A is a union of two intervals in {\mathbb R} then we show that the spectrality of A \times \Omega implies the spectrality of both A and \Omega.
