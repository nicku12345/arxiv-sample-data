In this article we prove some previously announced results about metric ultraproducts of finite simple groups. We show that any non-discrete metric ultraproduct of alternating or special linear groups is a geodesic metric space. For more general non-discrete metric ultraproducts of finite simple groups, we are able to establish path-connectedness. As expected, these global properties reflect asymptotic properties of various families of finite simple groups.
