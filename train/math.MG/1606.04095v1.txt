Given a compact Riemannian manifold (M, g) and two positive functions \rho and \sigma, we are interested in the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet energy functional weighted by \sigma, with respect to the L 2 inner product weighted by \rho. Under some regularity conditions on \rho and \sigma, these eigenvalues are those of the operator \rho^{-1} div(\sigma\nablau) with Neumann conditions on the boundary if \partialM = \emptyset. We investigate the effect of the weights on eigenvalues and discuss the existence of lower and upper bounds under the condition that the total mass is preserved.
