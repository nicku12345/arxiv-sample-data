Log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality was conjectured by Bor\"oczky, Lutwak, Yang and Zhang \cite{BLYZ}, and it states that a certain strengthening of the classical Brunn-Minkowski inequality is admissible in the case of symmetric convex sets. It was recently shown by Nayar, Zvavitch, the second and the third authors \cite{LMNZ}, that Log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality implies a certain dimensional Brunn-Minkowski inequality for log-concave measures, which in the case of Gaussian measure was conjectured by Gardner and Zvavitch \cite{GZ}.   In this note, we obtain stability results for both Log-Brunn-Minkowski and dimensional Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for rotation invariant log-conave measures near a ball. Remarkably, the assumption of symmetry is only necessary for Log-Brunn-Minkowski stability, which emphasizes an important difference between the two conjectured inequalities.   Also, we determine the infinitesimal version of the log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality. As a consequence, we obtain a strong Poincar\'{e}-type inequality in the case of unconditional convex sets, as well as for symmetric convex sets on the plane.   Additionally, we derive an infinitesimal equivalent version of the B-conjecture for an arbitrary measure.
