The purpose of this paper is to introduce and study some basic concepts of quantitative rectifiability in the first Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}. In particular, we aim to demonstrate that new phenomena arise compared to the Euclidean theory, founded by G. David and S. Semmes in the 90's. The theory in \mathbb{H} has an apparent connection to certain nonlinear PDEs, which do not play a role with similar questions in \mathbb{R}^{3}.   Our main object of study are the intrinsic Lipschitz graphs in \mathbb{H}, introduced by B. Franchi, R. Serapioni and F. Serra Cassano in 2006. We claim that these 3-dimensional sets in \mathbb{H}, if any, deserve to be called quantitatively 3-rectifiable. Our main result is that the intrinsic Lipschitz graphs satisfy a weak geometric lemma with respect to vertical \beta-numbers. Conversely, extending a result of David and Semmes from \mathbb{R}^{n}, we prove that a 3-Ahlfors-David regular subset in \mathbb{H}, which satisfies the weak geometric lemma and has big vertical projections, necessarily has big pieces of intrinsic Lipschitz graphs.
