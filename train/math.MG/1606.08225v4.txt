A celebrated result of Dol'nikov, and of \v{Z}ivaljevi\'c and Vre\'cica, asserts that for every collection of m measures \mu_1,\dots,\mu_m on the Euclidean space \mathbb R^{n + m - 1} there exists a projection onto an n-dimensional vector subspace \Gamma with a point in it at depth at least \tfrac{1}{n + 1} with respect to each associated n-dimensional marginal measure \Gamma_*\mu_1,\dots,\Gamma_*\mu_m.   In this paper we consider a natural extension of this result and ask for a minimal dimension of a Euclidean space in which one can require that for any collection of m measures there exists a vector subspace \Gamma with a point in it at depth slightly greater than \tfrac{1}{n + 1} with respect to each n-dimensional marginal measure. In particular, we prove that if the required depth is \tfrac{1}{n + 1} + \tfrac{1}{3(n + 1)^3} then the increase in the dimension of the ambient space is a linear function in both m and n.
