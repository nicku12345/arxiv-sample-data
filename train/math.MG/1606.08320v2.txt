Given a metrically complete Riemannian manifold (M,g) with smooth nonempty boundary and assuming that one of its curvatures is subject to a certain bound, we address the problem of whether it is possibile to realize (M,g) as a domain inside a geodesically complete Riemannian manifold (M',g') without boundary, by preserving the same curvature bounds. In this direction we provide three kind of results: (1) a general existence theorem showing that it is always possible to obtain a geodesically complete Riemannian extension without curvature constraints; (2) various topological obstructions to the existence of a complete Riemannian extension with prescribed sectional and Ricci curvature bounds; (3) some existence results of complete Riemannian extensions with sectional and Ricci curvature bounds, mostly in the presence of a convexity condition on the boundary.
