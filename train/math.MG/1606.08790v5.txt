We use the probabilistic method to obtain versions of the colorful Carath\'eodory theorem and Tverberg's theorem with tolerance.   In particular, we give bounds for the smallest integer N=N(t,d,r) such that for any N points in R^d, there is a partition of them into r parts for which the following condition holds: after removing any t points from the set, the convex hulls of what is left in each part intersect.   We prove the bound N=rt+O(\sqrt{t}) for fixed r,d which is polynomial in each parameters. Our bounds extend to colorful versions of Tverberg's theorem, as well as Reay-type variations of this theorem.
