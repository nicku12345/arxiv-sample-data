Let n\geq C for a large universal constant C>0, and let B be a convex body in R^n such that for any (x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)\in B, any choice of signs \varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2,\dots,\varepsilon_n\in\{-1,1\} and for any permutation \sigma on n elements we have (\varepsilon_1x_{\sigma(1)},\varepsilon_2x_{\sigma(2)},\dots,\varepsilon_nx_{\sigma(n)})\in B. We show that if B is not a cube then B can be illuminated by strictly less than 2^n sources of light. This confirms the Hadwiger--Gohberg--Markus illumination conjecture for unit balls of 1-symmetric norms in R^n for all sufficiently large n.
