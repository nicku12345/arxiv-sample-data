We provide a constructive proof of a face-to-face simplical partition of a d-dimensional space for arbitrary d by generalizing the idea of Sommerville, used to create space-filling tetrahedra out of triangular base, to any dimension. Each step of construction that increases the dimension is determined up to a positive parameter, d-dimensional simplical partition is therefore parametrized by d parameters. We show the shape optimal value of those parameters.
