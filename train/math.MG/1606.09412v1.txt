We verify the Rota-Heron-Welsh conjecture for matroids realizable as c-arrangements: the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the associated matroid are log-concave. This family of matroids strictly contains that of complex hyperplane arrangements. Our proof combines the study of intrinsic volumes of certain extensions of arrangements and the Levy--Milman measure concentration phenomenon on realization spaces of arrangements.
