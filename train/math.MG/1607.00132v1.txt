The aim of this paper is to present some properties of reduced spherical convex bodies on the two-dimensional sphere S^2. The intersection of two different non-opposite hemispheres is called a lune. By its thickness we mean the distance of the centers of the two semicircles bounding it. The thickness \Delta (C) of C is the minimum thickness of a lune containing C. We say that a spherical convex body R is reduced if \Delta (Z) < \Delta (R) for every spherical convex body Z \subset R different from R. Our main theorem permits to describe the shape of reduced bodies of thickness below \frac{\pi}{2}. It implies a number of corollaries. In particular, we estimate the diameter of reduced spherical bodies in terms of their thickness. Reduced bodies of thickness at least \frac{\pi}{2} have constant width. Spherical convex bodies of constant width below \frac{\pi}{2} are strictly convex.
