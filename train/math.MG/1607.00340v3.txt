An elastic graph is a graph with an elasticity associated to each edge. It may be viewed as a network made out of ideal rubber bands. If the rubber bands are stretched on a target space there is an elastic energy. We characterize when a homotopy class of maps from one elastic graph to another is loosening, i.e., decreases this elastic energy for all possible targets. This fits into a more general framework of energies for maps between graphs.
