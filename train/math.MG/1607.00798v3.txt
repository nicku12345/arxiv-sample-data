We prove that in each dimension d there is a constant w^\infty(d)\in \mathbb{N} such that for every n\in \mathbb{N} all but finitely many d-polytopes with n lattice points have width at most w^\infty(d). We call w^\infty(d) the finiteness threshold width and show that d-2 \le w^\infty(d)\le O^*\left( d^{4/3}\right).   Blanco and Santos determined the value w^\infty(3)=1. Here, we establish w^\infty(4)=2. This implies, in particular, that there are only finitely many empty 4-simplices of width larger than two.   The main tool in our proofs is the study of d-dimensional lifts of hollow (d-1)-polytopes.
