This note details how a recent structure theorem for normal 1-currents proved by the first and third author allows to prove a conjecture of Cheeger concerning the structure of Lipschitz differentiability spaces. More precisely, we show that the push-forward of the measure from a Lipschitz differentiability space under a chart is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure.
