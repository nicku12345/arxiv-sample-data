For any given Wulff shape \mathcal{W}, we can define the unique continuous function S^{n}\to \mathbb{R}_{+} called convex integrand, denoted by \gamma_{{}_{\mathcal{W}}}. In this paper, we show that, for any Wulff shapes \mathcal{W}_{1} and \mathcal{W}_{2}, the equality d(\gamma_{{}_{\mathcal{W}_{1}}}, \gamma_{{}_{\mathcal{W}_{2}}})= h(\mathcal{W}_{1}, \mathcal{W}_{2}) holds, where d is the maximum distance of the function space consisting of convex integrands and h is the Pompeiu-Hausdorff distance of the space consisting of Wulff shapes. Moreover, applications of this result are given.
