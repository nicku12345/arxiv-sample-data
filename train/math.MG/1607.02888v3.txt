We consider four problems. Rogers proved that for any convex body K, we can cover {\mathbb R}^d by translates of K of density very roughly d\ln d. First, we extend this result by showing that, if we are given a family of positive homothets of K of infinite total volume, then we can find appropriate translation vectors for each given homothet to cover {\mathbb R}^d with the same (or, in certain cases, smaller) density.   Second, we extend Rogers' result to multiple coverings of space by translates of a convex body: we give a non-trivial upper bound on the density of the most economical covering where each point is covered by at least a certain number of translates.   Third, we show that for any sufficiently large n, the sphere {\mathbb S}^2 can be covered by n strips of width 20n/\ln n, where no point is covered too many times.   Finally, we give another proof of the previous result based on a combinatorial observation: an extension of the Epsilon-net Theorem of Haussler and Welzl. We show that for a hypergraph of bounded Vapnik--Chervonenkis dimension, in which each edge is of a certain measure, there is a not-too large transversal set which does not intersect any edge too many times.
