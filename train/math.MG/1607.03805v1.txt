Let C_1, \dots, C_n denote the 1/n-neighborhood of n great circles on \mathbb{S}^2. We are interested in how much these areas have to overlap and prove the sharp bounds  \sum_{i, j = 1 \atop i \neq j}^{n}{|C_i \cap C_j|^s} \gtrsim_s \begin{cases} n^{2 - 2s} \qquad &\mbox{if}~0 \leq s < 2 \\ n^{-2} \log{n} \qquad &\mbox{if}~s = 2\\ n^{1- 3s/2} \qquad &\mbox{if}~s > 2. \end{cases} . For s=1 there are arrangements for which the sum of mutual overlap is uniformly bounded (for the analogous problem in \mathbb{R}^2 the lower bound is \gtrsim \log{n}) and there are strong connections to minimal energy configurations of n charged electrons on \mathbb{S}^2 (the J. J. Thomson problem).
