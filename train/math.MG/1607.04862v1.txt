The average section functional {\rm as}(K) of a centered convex body in {\mathbb R}^n is the average volume of central hyperplane sections of K: \begin{equation*}{\rm as}(K)=\int_{S^{n-1}}|K\cap \xi^{\perp }|\,d\sigma (\xi ).\end{equation*} We study the question if there exists an absolute constant C>0 such that for every n, for every centered convex body K in {\mathbb R}^n and for every 0<k<n, {\rm as}(K)\ls C^k|K|^{\frac{k}{n}}\,\max_{E\in {\rm Gr}_{n-k}}{\rm as}(K\cap E). We observe that the case k=1 is equivalent to the hyperplane conjecture. We show that this inequality holds true in full generality if one replaces C by CL_K or Cd_{\rm ovr}(K,{\cal{BP}}_k^n), where L_K is the isotropic constant of K and d_{\rm ovr}(K,{\cal{BP}}_k^n) is the outer volume ratio distance from K to the class {\cal{BP}}_k^n of generalized k-intersection bodies. We also compare {\rm as}(K) to the average of {\rm as}(K\cap E) over all k-codimensional sections of K. We examine separately the dependence of the constants on the dimension in the case where K is in some of the classical positions as well as the natural lower dimensional analogue of the average section functional.
