Mondino and Naber recently proved that finite dimensional \sf RCD spaces are rectifiable. Here we show that the push-forward of the reference measure under the charts built by them is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. This result, read in conjunction with another recent work of us, has relevant implications on the structure of tangent spaces to \sf RCD spaces. A key tool that we use is a recent paper by De Philippis-Rindler about the structure of measures on the Euclidean space.
