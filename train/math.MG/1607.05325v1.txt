A non-degenerate two-dimensional linear operator \varphi transforms the unit circle into ellipse. Let p be the length of its bigger axis and q -- the length of smaller. We can define the deformation coefficient k(\varphi) as q/p. Analogously, if \varphi is a non-degenerate three-dimensional operator, then it transforms the unit sphere into ellipsoid. If p>q>r are lengths of its axes, then deformation coefficient k(\varphi) will be defined as r/p. In this work we compute the mean value of deformation coefficient in two-dimensional case and give an estimation of mean value in three-dimensional case.
