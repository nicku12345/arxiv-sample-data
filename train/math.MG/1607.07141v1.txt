A unified approach used to generalize classical Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities to Lp Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities, called the Lp transference principle, is refined in this paper. As illustrations of the effectiveness and practicability of this method, several new Lp Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities concerning the mixed volume, moment of inertia, quermassintegral, projection body and capacity are established.
