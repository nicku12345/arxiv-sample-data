We study the first mixed volume for nonconvex sets and apply the results to limits of discrete isoperimetric problems. Let  M,N \subset \mathbb{R}^d. Define D_N (M)=\lim_{\epsilon \downarrow 0} \frac{|M+\epsilon N|-|M|}{\epsilon} whenever the limit exists. Our main result states that for a compact domain M \subset \mathbb{R}^d with piecewise C^1 boundary and bounded N \subset \mathbb{R}^d, D_N(M)=D_{\text{conv}(N)}(M) and D_N(M)=\int_{\text{bd }M} h_N(u_M(x)) \, d \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(x).
