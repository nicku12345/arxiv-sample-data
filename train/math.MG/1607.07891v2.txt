The present paper deals with the problem of computing (or at least estimating) the LW-number \lambda(n), i.e., the supremum of all \gamma such that for each convex body K in \mathbb{R}^n there exists an orthonormal basis \{u_1,\ldots,u_n\} such that  vol_n(K)^{n-1} \geq \gamma \prod_{i=1}^n vol_{n-1} (K|u_i^{\perp}) ,  where K|u_i^{\perp} denotes the orthogonal projection of K onto the hyperplane u_i^{\perp} perpendicular to u_i. Any such inequality can be regarded as a reverse to the well-known classical Loomis--Whitney inequality. We present various results on such reverse Loomis--Whitney inequalities. In particular, we prove some structural results, give bounds on \lambda(n) and deal with the problem of actually computing the LW-constant of a rational polytope.
