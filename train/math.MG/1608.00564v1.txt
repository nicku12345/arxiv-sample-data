Let L_f be a link of an isolated hypersurface singularity defined by a weighted homogenous polynomial f. In this article, we give ten examples of 2-connected seven dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifolds L_f for which H_{3}(L_f, \mathbb{Z}) is completely determined. Using the Boyer-Galicki construction of links L_f over particular K\"ahler-Einstein orbifolds, we apply a valid case of Orlik's conjecture to the links L_f  so that one is able to explicitly determine H_{3}(L_f,\mathbb{Z}). We give ten such new examples, all of which have the third Betti number satisfy 10\leq b_{3}(L_{f})\leq 20.
