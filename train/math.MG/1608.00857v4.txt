Wenger and Young proved that the pair (\mathbb{R}^m,\mathbb{H}^n) has the Lipschitz extension property for m \leq n where \mathbb{H}^n is the sub-Riemannian Heisenberg group. That is, for some C>0, any L-Lipschitz map from a subset of \mathbb{R}^m into \mathbb{H}^n can be extended to a CL-Lipschitz mapping on \mathbb{R}^m. In this paper, we construct Sobolev extensions of such Lipschitz mappings with no restriction on the dimension m. We prove that any Lipschitz mapping from a compact subset of \mathbb{R}^m into \mathbb{H}^n may be extended to a Sobolev mapping on any bounded domain containing the set. More generally, we prove this result in the case of mappings into any Lipschitz (n-1)-connected metric space.
