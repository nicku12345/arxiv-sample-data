We construct in \mathbb{R}^{k+2} a k-dimensional simple normal current whose support is purely 2-unrectifiable. The result is sharp because the support of a normal current cannot be purely 1-unrectifiable and a (k+1)-dimensional normal current can be represented as an integral of (k+1)-rectifiable currents. This gives a negative answer to the (revised version) of a question of Frank Morgan (1984).
