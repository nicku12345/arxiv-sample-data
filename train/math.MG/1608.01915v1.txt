For every Banach space (Y,\|\cdot\|_Y) that admits an equivalent uniformly convex norm we prove that there exists c=c(Y)\in (0,\infty) with the following property. Suppose that n\in \mathbb{N} and that X is an n-dimensional normed space with unit ball B_X. Then for every 1-Lipschitz function f:B_X\to Y and for every \varepsilon\in (0,1/2] there exists a radius r\ge\exp(-1/\varepsilon^{cn}), a point x\in B_X with x+rB_X\subset B_X, and an affine mapping \Lambda:X\to Y such that \|f(y)-\Lambda(y)\|_Y\le \varepsilon r for every y\in x+rB_X.
