This paper is concerned with the study of diffraction intensities of a relevant class of binary Pisot substitutions via exponential sums. Arithmetic properties of algebraic integers are used to give a new and constructive proof of the fact that there are no diffraction intensities outside the Fourier module of the underlying cut and project schemes. The results are then applied in the context of random substitutions.
