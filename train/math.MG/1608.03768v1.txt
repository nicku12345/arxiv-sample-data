Dual to Koldobsky's notion of j-intersection bodies, the class of j-projection bodies is introduced, generalizing Minkowski's classical notion of projection bodies of convex bodies. A Fourier analytic characterization of j-projection bodies in terms of their area measures of order j is obtained. In turn, this yields an equivalent characterization of j-projection bodies involving Alesker's Fourier type transform on translation invariant smooth spherical valuations. As applications of these results, several basic properties of j-projection bodies are established and new non-trivial examples are constructed.
