This paper presents connections between Gromov's work on isoperimetry of waists and Milman's work on the M-ellipsoid of a convex body. It is proven that any convex body K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n has a linear image \tilde{K} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n of volume one satisfying the following waist inequality: Any continuous map f:\tilde{K} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\ell} has a fiber f^{-1}(t) whose (n-\ell)-dimensional volume is at least c^{n-\ell}, where c > 0 is a universal constant. In the specific case where K = [0,1]^n it is shown that one may take \tilde{K} = K and c = 1, confirming a conjecture by Guth. We furthermore exhibit relations between waist inequalities and various geometric characteristics of the convex body K.
