We study triangles ABC and points P for which the generalized orthocenter H corresponding to P coincides with a vertex A,B, or C. The set of all such points P is a union of three ellipses minus 6 points. In addition, if T_P is the affine map taking ABC to the cevian triangle DEF of P with respect to ABC, P' is the isotomic conjugate of P, and T_{P'} is the affine map taking ABC to the cevian triangle of P', then we study the locus of points P for which the map \textsf{M}_P=T_p \circ K^{-1} \circ T_{P'} is a translation. Here, K is the complement map for ABC, and \textsf{M}_P is an affine map taking the circumconic of ABC for P to the inconic of ABC for P. The locus in question turns out to be an elliptic curve minus 6 points, which can be synthetically constructed using the geometry of the triangle.
