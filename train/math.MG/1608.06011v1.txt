Given n+1 unit vectors in \mathbf{R}^n or \mathbf{C}^n, consider the absolute values of the determinants of the vectors taken n at a time. By taking a geometric perspective, we show that the minimum of these determinants is maximized when the vectors point from the origin to the vertices of a regular simplex inscribed in the unit sphere in \mathbf{R}^n, even in the complex case. We also discuss variations on this problem and a few connections to other problems.
