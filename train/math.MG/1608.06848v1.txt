Let \rho be a metric on the set X=\{1,2,\dots,n+1\}. Consider the n-dimensional polytope of functions f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}, which satisfy the conditions f(n+1)=0, |f(x)-f(y)|\leq \rho(x,y). The question on classifying metrics depending on the combinatorics of this polytope have been recently posed by A. M. Vershik \cite{V}. We prove that for any "generic" metric the number of (n-m)-dimensional faces, 0\leq m\leq n, equals \binom{n+m}{m,m,n-m}=(n+m)!/m!m!(n-m)!. This fact is intimately related to regular triangulations of the root polytope (the convex hull of the roots of A_n root system). Also we get two-sided estimates for the logarithm of the number of Vershik classes of metrics: n^3\log n from above and n^2 from below.
