The best previous lower bounds for kissing numbers in dimensions 25 through 31 were constructed using a set S with |S| = 480 of minimal vectors of the Leech Lattice, \Lambda_{24}, such that \langle x, y \rangle \leq 1 for any distinct x, y \in S. Then, a probabilistic argument based on applying automorphisms of \Lambda_{24} gives more disjoint sets S_i of minimal vectors of \Lambda_{24} with the same property. Cohn, Jiao, Kumar, and Torquato proved that these subsets give kissing configurations in dimensions 25 through 31 of given size linear in the sizes of the subsets. We achieve |S| = 488 by applying simulated annealing. We also improve the aforementioned probabilistic argument in the general case. Finally, we greedily construct even larger S_i's given our S of size 488, giving increased lower bounds on kissing numbers in \mathbb{R}^{25} through \mathbb{R}^{31}.
