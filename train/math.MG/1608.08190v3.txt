Non-Euclidean triangle centers can be described using homogeneous coordinates that are proportional to the generalized sines of the directed distances of a given center from the edges of the reference triangle. Identical homogeneous coordinates of a specific triangle center may be used for all spaces of uniform Gaussian curvature. We also define the median point for a set of points in non-Euclidean space and a planar center of rotation for a set of points in a non-Euclidean plane.
