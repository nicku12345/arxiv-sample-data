In this paper we generalize several results on separated nets in Euclidean space to separated nets in connected simply connected nilpotent Lie groups. We show that every such group G contains separated nets that are not biLipschitz equivalent. We define a class of separated nets in these groups arising from a generalization of the cut-and-project quasi-crystal construction and show that generically any such separated net is bounded displacement equivalent to a separated net of constant covolume. In addition, we use a generalization of the Laczkovich criterion to provide `exotic' perturbations of such separated nets.
