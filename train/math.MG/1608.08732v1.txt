We further study the asymptotics of quantization errors for two classes of in-homogeneous self-similar measures \mu. We give a new sufficient condition for the upper quantization coefficient for \mu to be finite. This, together with our previous work, leads to a necessary and sufficient condition for the upper and lower quantization coefficient of \mu to be both positive and finite. Furthermore, we determine (estimate) the convergence order of the quantization error in case that the quantization coefficient is infinite.
