A submodule of a \mathbb{Z}-module determines a coloring of the module where each coset of the submodule is associated to a unique color. Given a submodule coloring of a \mathbb{Z}-module, the group formed by the symmetries of the module that induces a permutation of colors is referred to as the color group of the coloring. In this contribution, a method to solve for the color groups of colorings of N-planar modules where N=4 and N=6 are given. Examples of colorings of rectangular lattices and of the vertices of the Ammann-Beenker tiling are given to exhibit how these methods may be extended to the general case.
