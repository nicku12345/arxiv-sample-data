We consider a general notion of snowflake of a metric space by composing the distance by a nontrivial concave function.   We prove that a snowflake of a metric space X isometrically embeds into some finite-dimensional normed space if and only if X is finite. In the case of power functions we give a uniform bound on the cardinality of X depending only on the power exponent and the dimension of the vector space.
