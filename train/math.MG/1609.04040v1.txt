Let (G,\rho) be a stationary random graph, and use B^G_{\rho}(r) to denote the ball of radius r about \rho in G. Suppose that (G,\rho) has annealed polynomial growth, in the sense that \mathbb{E}[|B^G_{\rho}(r)|] \leq O(r^k) for some k > 0 and every r \geq 1.   Then there is an infinite sequence of times \{t_n\} at which the random walk \{X_t\} on (G,\rho) is at most diffusive: Almost surely (over the choice of (G,\rho)), there is a number C > 0 such that \[ \mathbb{E} \left[\mathrm{dist}_G(X_0, X_{t_n})^2 \mid X_0 = \rho, (G,\rho)\right]\leq C t_n\qquad \forall n \geq 1\,. \] This result is new even in the case when G is a stationary random subgraph of \mathbb{Z}^d. Combined with the work of Benjamini, Duminil-Copin, Kozma, and Yadin (2015), it implies that G almost surely does not admit a non-constant harmonic function of sublinear growth.   To complement this, we argue that passing to a subsequence of times \{t_n\} is necessary, as there are stationary random graphs of (almost sure) polynomial growth where the random walk is almost surely superdiffusive at an infinite subset of times.
