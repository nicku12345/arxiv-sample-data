Let X be the mosaic generated by a stationary Poisson hyperplane process \hat X in {\mathbb R}^d. Under some mild conditions on the spherical directional distribution of \hat X (which are satisfied, for example, if the process is isotropic), we show that with probability one the set of cells (d-polytopes) of X has the following properties. The translates of the cells are dense in the space of convex bodies. Every combinatorial type of simple d-polytopes is realized infinitely often by the cells of X. A further result concerns the distribution of the typical cell.
