In this paper we give a completely synthetic proof of the TCC-perspector theorem, that the isogonal conjugate \gamma(H) of the generalized orthocenter H (defined in Part III of this series of papers), with respect to a triangle ABC and a point P, is the perspector of the tangential triangle of ABC and the circumcevian triangle (both with respect to the circumcircle) of the isogonal conjugate \gamma(Q), where Q is the complement of the isotomic conjugate P' of the point P.
