If S is a given regular d-simplex of edge length a in the d-dimensional Euclidean space \mathcal{E}, then the distances t_1, \cdots, t_{d+1} of an arbitrary point in \mathcal{E} to the vertices of S are related by the elegant relation (d+1)\left( a^4+t_1^4+\cdots+t_{d+1}^4\right)=\left( a^2+t_1^2+\cdots+t_{d+1}^2\right)^2. The purpose of this paper is to prove that this is essentially the only relation that exists among t_1,\cdots,t_{d+1}. The proof uses tools from analysis, algebra, and geometry.
