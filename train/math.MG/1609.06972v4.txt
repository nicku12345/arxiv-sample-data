A matchstick graph is a graph drawn with straight edges in the plane such that the edges have unit length, and non-adjacent edges do not intersect. We call a matchstick graph (m;n)-regular if every vertex has only degree m or n. In this article we present the latest known (4;n)-regular matchstick graphs for 4\leq n\leq11 with a minimum number of vertices and a completely asymmetric structure. We call a matchstick graph completely asymmetric, if the following conditions are complied. 1) The graph is rigid. 2) The graph has no point, rotational or mirror symmetry. 3) The graph has an asymmetric outer shape. 4) The graph can not be decomposed into rigid subgraphs and rearrange to a similar graph which contradicts to any of the other conditions.
