An n \times n matrix D is a Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) if there exist p^1, \ldots, p^n in some Euclidean space such that d_{ij} = || p^i - p^j||^2 for all i,j=1,\ldots,n. Let D be an EDM and let E^{ij} be the n \times n symmetric matrix with 1's in the ijth and jith entries and 0's elsewhere. We say that [l_{ij},u_{ij}] is the yielding interval of entry d_{ij} if it holds that D+t E^{ij} is an EDM iff l_{ij} \leq t \leq u_{ij}. If the yielding interval of entry d_{ij} has length 0, i.e., if l_{ij}=u_{ij}, then d_{ij} is said to be unyielding. Otherwise, if l_{ij} \neq u_{ij}, then d_{ij} is said to be yielding. Let d_{ij} and d_{ik} be two unyielding entries of D. We say that d_{ij} and d_{ik} are jointly yielding if D+t_1 E^{ij} + t_2 E^{ik} is an EDM for some nonzero scalars t_1 and t_2. In this paper, we characterize the yielding and the jointly yielding entries of an EDM D in terms of Gale transform of p^1,\ldots,p^n. Moreover, for each yielding entry, we present explicit formulae of its yielding interval. Finally, we specialize our results to the case where p^1,\ldots,p^n are in general position.
