Given two n_i-dimensional Alexandrov spaces X_i of curvature \ge 1, the join of X_1 and X_2 is an (n_1+n_2+1)-dimensional Alexandrov space X of curvature \ge 1, which contains X_i as convex subsets such that their points are \frac \pi2 apart. If a group acts isometrically on a join that preserves X_i, then the orbit space is called quotient of join. We show that an n-dimensional Alexandrov space X with curvature \ge 1 is isometric to a finite quotient of join, if X contains two compact convex subsets X_i without boundary such that X_1 and X_2 are at least \frac \pi2 apart and \dim(X_1)+\dim(X_2)=n-1.
