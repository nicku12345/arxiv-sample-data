The computation of the distance between any two points of the Sierpinski Gasket with respect to the intrinsic metric has already been investigated by several authors. In the literature there is not an explicit formula using the code space of the Sierpinski Gasket. In this paper, we give an explicit formula for the intrinsic metric on the Sierpinski Gasket via code representations of its points.
