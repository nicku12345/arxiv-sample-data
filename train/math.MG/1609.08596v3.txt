The Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice polytope P encodes information about the number of integer lattice points in positive integral dilates of P. The h^\ast-polynomial of P is the numerator polynomial of the generating function of its Ehrhart polynomial. A zonotope is any projection of a higher dimensional cube. We give a combinatorial description of the h^\ast-polynomial of a lattice zonotope in terms of refined descent statistics of permutations and prove that the h^\ast-polynomial of every lattice zonotope has only real roots and therefore unimodal coefficients. Furthermore, we present a closed formula for the h^\ast-polynomial of a zonotope in matroidal terms which is analogous to a result by Stanley (1991) on the Ehrhart polynomial. Our results hold not only for h^\ast-polynomials but carry over to general combinatorial positive valuations. Moreover, we give a complete description of the convex hull of all h^\ast-polynomials of zonotopes in a given dimension: it is a simplicial cone spanned by refined Eulerian polynomials.
