We study finite subsets of \ell_2, and more generally any metric space, and consider whether these isometrically embed into a Banach space. Our results partially answer a question of Ostrovskii, on whether every infinite-dimensional Banach space contains every finite subset of \ell_2 isometrically.   The updated version contains acknowledgement that Theorem 3.1 has been proven previously in a paper of Shkarin.
