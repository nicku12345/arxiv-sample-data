We introduce Lipschitz continuous and C^{1,1} geometric approximation and interpolation methods for sampled bounded uniformly continuous functions over compact sets and over complements of bounded open sets in \mathbb{R}^n by using compensated convex transforms. Error estimates are provided for the approximations of bounded uniformly continuous functions, of Lipschitz functions, and of C^{1,1} functions. We also prove that our approximation methods, which are differentiation and integration free and not sensitive to sample type, are stable with respect to the Hausdorff distance between samples.
