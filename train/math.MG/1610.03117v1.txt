It was shown recently that the Minkowski content of a bounded set A in \mathbb{R}^d with volume zero can be characterized in terms of the asymptotic behaviour of the boundary surface area of its parallel sets A_r as the parallel radius r tends to 0. Here we discuss localizations of such results. The asymptotic behaviour of the local parallel volume of A relative to a suitable second set \Omega can be understood in terms of the suitably defined local surface area relative to \Omega. Also a measure version of this relation is shown: Viewing the Minkowski content as a locally determined measure, this measure can be obtained as a weak limit of suitably rescaled surface measures of close parallel sets. Such measure relations had been observed before for self-similar sets and some self-conformal sets in \mathbb{R}^d. They are now established for arbitrary closed sets, including even the case of unbounded sets.   The results are based on a localization of Stach\'o's famous formula relating the boundary surface area of A_r to the derivative of the volume function at r.
