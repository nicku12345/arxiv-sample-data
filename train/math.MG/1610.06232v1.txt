A polytope P is circumscribed about a convex body \Phi\subset \mathbb{R}^n if \Phi\subset P and each facet of P is contained in a support hyperplane of \Phi. We say that a convex body \Phi\subset \mathbb{R}^n is a rotor of a polytope P if for each rotation \rho of \mathbb{R}^n there exist a translation \tau so that P is circumscribed about \tau\rho\Phi.   In this paper we shall prove that if P is a triangle, then there is a baricentric formula that describes the curvature of bd\Phi at the contact points, \{A_1, A_2,A_3\}. We prove also that if \Phi\subset \mathbb{R}^3 is a convex body which is a rotor in a tetrahedron T and if \Phi intersects the faces of T at the points \{x_1, \dots, x_4\}, then the normal lines of \Phi at the contact points with T, \{x_1, \dots, x_4\} generically belong to one ruling of a quadric surface.
