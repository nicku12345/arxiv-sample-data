The isoperimetric problem with a density or weighting seeks to enclose prescribed weighted area with minimum weighted perimeter. According to Chambers' recent proof of the Log Convex Density Conjecture, for many densities on \mathbb{R}^n the answer is a sphere about the origin. We generalize his results from \mathbb{R}^n to \mathbb{H}^n with related but different volume and perimeter densities.
