In his beautiful paper on the central set from 1981, Y. Yomdin makes use of a Lipschitz Inverse Function Theorem that unfortunately up to this day remains unproved. Herein we show that this Theorem in Yomdin's version holds true for a scalar function and we give a possible correct version of it in the general case. From this we obtain a weaker, but complete Generic Structure Theorem concerning the medial axis (central set) of a subset of {\Rz}^3.
