In the present paper, we consider several valid notions of orientability of Alexandov spaces and prove that all such conditions are equivalent. Further, we give topological and geometric applications of the orientability. In particular, a Poincar\'e-type duality theorem is proved. As a corollary to the duality theorem, we also prove that if a closed Alexandrov space admits a positive curvature bound in a synthetic sense, then its codimension one homology vanishes. Further, we obtain a filling radius inequality for closed orientable Alexandrov spaces.
