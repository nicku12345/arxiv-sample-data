We study extremal properties of finite ultrametric spaces X and related properties of representing trees T_X. The notion of weak similarity for such spaces is introduced and related morphisms of labeled rooted trees are found. It is shown that the finite rooted trees are isomorphic to the rooted trees of nonsingular balls of special finite ultrametric spaces. We also found conditions under which the isomorphism of representing trees T_X and T_Y implies the isometricity of ultrametric spaces X and Y.
