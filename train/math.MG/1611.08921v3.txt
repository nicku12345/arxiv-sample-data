The main goal of this paper is to present a series of inequalities connecting the surface area measure of a convex body and surface area measure of its projections and sections. We present a solution of a question from S. Campi, P. Gritzmann and P. Gronchi regarding the asymptotic behavior of the best constant in a recently proposed reverse Loomis-Whitney inequality. Next we give a new sufficient condition for the slicing problem to have an affirmative answer, in terms of the least "outer volume ratio distance" from the class of intersection bodies of projections of at least proportional dimension of convex bodies. Finally, we show that certain geometric quantities such as the volume ratio and minimal surface area (after a suitable normalization) are not necessarily close to each other.
