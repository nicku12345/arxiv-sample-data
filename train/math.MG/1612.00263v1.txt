We prove two new approximation results of H-perimeter minimizing boundaries by means of intrinsic Lipschitz functions in the setting of the Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}^n with n\ge2. The first one is an improvement of a result of Monti and is the natural reformulation in \mathbb{H}^n of the classical Lipschitz approximation in \mathbb{R}^n. The second one is an adaptation of the approximation via maximal function developed by De Lellis and Spadaro.
