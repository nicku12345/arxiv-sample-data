This text has three parts.   The first one is largely autobiographical, hence my use of the first person. There I recall how Gerard Cohen influenced important parts of my research.   The second is of a more classic mathematical nature. I present a discrete analogue of the Hahn-Banach theorem, which serves as a basis for generalizing the notion of separating systems in the context of metric convexity.   The third one aims at building a bridge between two communities of researchers, those interested in separating systems, and those interested in a certain question in combinatorial geometry --- sets of points forming only acute angles --- who seem not to be aware of each other, while they are working on precisely the same problem!   Of course, these three themes are closely intertwined.
