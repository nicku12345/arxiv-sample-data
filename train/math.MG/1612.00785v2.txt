A first-order expansion of the \mathbb{R}-vector space structure on \mathbb{R} does not define every compact subset of every \mathbb{R}^n if and only if topological and Hausdorff dimension coincide on all closed definable sets. Equivalently, if A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k is closed and the Hausdorff dimension of A exceeds the topological dimension of A, then every compact subset of every \mathbb{R}^n can be constructed from A using finitely many boolean operations, cartesian products, and linear operations. The same statement fails when Hausdorff dimension is replaced by packing dimension.
