We define a one parameter family of positions of a convex body which interpolates between the John position and the Loewner position: for r>0, we say that K is in maximal intersection position of radius r if \textrm{Vol}_{n}(K\cap rB_{2}^{n})\geq \textrm{Vol}_{n}(K\cap rTB_{2}^{n}) for all T\in SL_{n}. We show that under mild conditions on K, each such position induces a corresponding isotropic measure on the sphere, which is simply a normalized Lebesgue measure on r^{-1}K\cap S^{n-1}. In particular, for r_{M} satisfying r_{M}^{n}\kappa_{n}=\textrm{Vol}_{n}(K), the maximal intersection position of radius r_{M} is an M-position, so we get an M-position with an associated isotropic measure. Lastly, we give an interpretation of John's theorem on contact points as a limit case of the measures induced from the maximal intersection positions.
