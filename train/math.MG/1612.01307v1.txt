G. Fejes T\'oth posed the following problem: Determine the infimum of the densities of the lattices of closed balls in \bR^n such that each affine k-subspace (0 \le k \le n-1) of \bR^n intersects some ball of the lattice. We give a lower estimate for any n,k like above. If, in the problem posed by G. Fejes T\'oth, we replace the ball B^n by a (centrally symmetric) convex body K\subset \bR^n, we may ask for the infimum of all above infima of densities of lattices of translates of K with the above property, when K ranges over all (centrally symmetric) convex bodies in \bR^n. For these quantities we give lower estimates as well, which are sharp, or almost sharp, for certain classes of convex bodies K. For k=n-1 we give an upper estimate for the supremum of all above infima of densities, K also ranging as above (i.e., a "minimax" problem). For n=2 our estimate is rather close to the conjecturable maximum. We point out the connection of the above questions to the following problem: Find the largest radius of a cylinder, with base an (n-1)-ball, that can be fitted into any lattice packing of balls (actually, here balls can be replaced by some convex bodies K \subset \bR^n, the axis of the cylinder may be k-dimensional and its basis has to be chosen suitably). Among others we complete the proof of a theorem of I. Hortob\'agyi from 1971. Our proofs for the lower estimates of densities for balls, and for the cylinder problem, follow quite closely a paper of J. Horv\'ath from 1970. This paper is also an addendum to a paper of the first named author from 1978 in the sense that to some arguments given there not in a detailed manner, we give here for all of these complete proofs.
