In 1992, Hendrickson proved that (d+1)-connectivity and redundant rigidity are necessary conditions for a generic (non-complete) bar-joint framework to be globally rigid in \mathbb{R}^d. Jackson and Jordan confirmed in 2005 that these conditions are also sufficient in \mathbb{R}^2, giving a combinatorial characterization of graphs whose generic realizations in \mathbb{R}^2 are globally rigid. In this paper, we establish analogues of these results for infinite periodic frameworks under fixed lattice representations. Our combinatorial characterization of globally rigid generic periodic frameworks in \mathbb{R}^2 in particular implies toroidal and cylindrical counterparts of the theorem by Jackson and Jordan.
