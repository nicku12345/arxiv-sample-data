Let M be a separable metric space. We say that f=(f_n):M\to c_0 is a good-\lambda-embedding if, whenever x,y\in M, x\ne y implies d(x,y)\le\Vert f(x)-f(y)\Vert and, for each n, Lip(f_n)<\lambda, where Lip(f_n) denotes the Lipschitz constant of f_n. We prove that there exists a good-\lambda-embedding from M into c_0 if and only if M satisfies an internal property called \pi(\lambda). As a consequence, we obtain that for any separable metric space M, there exists a good-2-embedding from M into c_0. These statements slightly extend former results obtained by N. Kalton and G. Lancien, with simplified proofs.
