Let C be the unit circle in \mathbb{R}^2. We can view C as a plane graph whose vertices are all the points on C, and the distance between any two points on C is the length of the smaller arc between them. We consider a graph augmentation problem on C, where we want to place k\geq 1 \emph{shortcuts} on C such that the diameter of the resulting graph is minimized.   We analyze for each k with 1\leq k\leq 7 what the optimal set of shortcuts is. Interestingly, the minimum diameter one can obtain is not a strictly decreasing function of~k. For example, with seven shortcuts one cannot obtain a smaller diameter than with six shortcuts. Finally, we prove that the optimal diameter is 2 + \Theta(1/k^{\frac{2}{3}}) for any~k.
