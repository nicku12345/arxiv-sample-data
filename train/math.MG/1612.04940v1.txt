We consider the number of distinct distances between two finite sets of points in {\bf R}^k, for any constant dimension k\ge 2, where one set P_1 consists of n points on a line l, and the other set P_2 consists of m arbitrary points, such that no hyperplane orthogonal to l and no hypercylinder having l as its axis contains more than O(1) points of P_2. The number of distinct distances between P_1 and P_2 is then  \Omega\left(\min\left\{ n^{2/3}m^{2/3},\; \frac{n^{10/11}m^{4/11}}{\log^{2/11}m},\; n^2,\; m^2\right\}\right) .  Without the assumption on P_2, there exist sets P_1, P_2 as above, with only O(m+n) distinct distances between them.
