Every set of points \mathcal{P} determines \Omega(|\mathcal{P}| / \log |\mathcal{P}|) distances. A close version of this was initially conjectured by Erd\H{o}s in 1946 and rather recently proved by Guth and Katz. We show that when near this lower bound, a point set \mathcal{P} of the form A \times A must satisfy |A - A| \ll |A|^{2-\frac{2}{7}} \log^{\frac{1}{7}} |A|. This improves recent results of Hanson and Roche-Newton.
