For a finite set X of n points from \mathbb{R}^M, the degree of an M-element subset \{x_1,\dots,x_M\} of X is defined as the number of M-simplices that can be constructed from this M-element subset using an additional point z\in X, such that no further point of X lies in the interior of this M-simplex. Furthermore, the degree of X, denoted by \textrm{deg} (X), is the maximal degree of any of its M-element subsets.   The purpose of this paper is to show that the moments of the degree of X satisfy \mathbb{E}\left[\textrm{deg} (X)^k\right] \geq c n^k / \log n, for some constant c>0, if the elements of the set X are chosen uniformly and independently from a convex body W \subset \mathbb{R}^M. Additionally, it will be shown that these moments converge in probability to infinity as the number of points of the set X goes to infinity.
