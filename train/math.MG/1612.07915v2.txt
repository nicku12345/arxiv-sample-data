For a nonempty polyhedral set P\subset \mathbb R^d, let \mathcal F(P) denote the set of faces of P, and let N(P,F) be the normal cone of P at the nonempty face F\in\mathcal F(P). We prove that the function \sum_{F\in\mathcal F(P)}(-1)^{\text{dim} F} 1_{F-N(P,F)} equals 1 if P is bounded, or 0 if P is unbounded and line-free. Previously, this formula was known to hold everywhere outside some exceptional set of Lebesgue measure 0 or for polyhedral cones. The case of a not necessarily line-free polyhedral set is also covered by our general theorem.
