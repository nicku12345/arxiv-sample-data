Tensorial curvature measures are tensor-valued generalizations of the curvature measures of convex bodies. We prove a complete set of kinematic formulae for such tensorial curvature measures on convex bodies and for their (nonsmooth) generalizations on convex polytopes. These formulae express the integral mean of the tensorial curvature measure of the intersection of two given convex bodies (resp.~polytopes), one of which is uniformly moved by a proper rigid motion, in terms of linear combinations of tensorial curvature measures of the given convex bodies (resp.~polytopes). We prove these results in a more direct way than in the classical proof of the principal kinematic formula for curvature measures, which uses the connection to Crofton formulae to determine the involved constants explicitly.
