Comparison of 1-dimensional distance functions is a basic tool in Alexandrov geometry and it is used to characterize spaces with curvature bounded above or below. For the zero curvature bound there is a differential inequality which enables one to check this comparison directly on a given smooth 1-dimensional distance function. In this note we give a generalization of this property to arbitrary curvature bounds.
