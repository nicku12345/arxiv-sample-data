The Kneser--Poulsen Conjecture states that if the centers of a family of N unit balls in {\mathbb E}^d is contracted, then the volume of the union (resp., intersection) does not increase (resp., decrease). We consider two types of special contractions.   First, a \emph{uniform contraction} is a contraction where all the pairwise distances in the first set of centers are larger than all the pairwise distances in the second set of centers. We obtain that a uniform contraction of the centers does not decrease the volume of the intersection of the balls, provided that N\geq(1+\sqrt{2})^d. Our result extends to intrinsic volumes. We prove a similar result concerning the volume of the union.   Second, a \emph{strong contraction} is a contraction in each coordinate. We show that the conjecture holds for strong contractions. In fact, the result extends to arbitrary unconditional bodies in the place of balls.
