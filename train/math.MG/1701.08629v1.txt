We show that there exist reduced polytopes in three-dimensional Euclidean space. This partially answers the question posed by Lassak on the existence of reduced polytopes in d-dimensional Euclidean space for d\geq 3. Moreover, we prove a novel necessary condition on reduced polytopes in three-dimensional Euclidean space.
