The investigation of the relation among the distances of an arbitrary point in the Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^n to the vertices of a regular n-simplex in that space has led us to the study of simplices having a regular facet. Calling an n-simplex with a regular facet an n-pre-kite, we investigate, in the spirit of [4], [10], [9], and [15], and using tools from linear algebra, the degree of regularity implied by the coincidence of any two of the classical centers of such simplices. We also prove that if n \ge 3, then the intersection of the family of n-pre-kites with any of the four known special families is the family of n-kites, thus extending the result in [18]. A basic tool is a closed form of a determinant that arises in the context of a certain Cayley-Menger determinant, and that generalizes several determinants that appear in [9], [15], and [16]. Thus the paper is a further testimony to the special role that linear algebra plays in higher dimensional geometry.
