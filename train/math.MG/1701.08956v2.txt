For given continuous functions \gamma_{{}_{i}}: S^{n}\to \mathbb{R}_{+} (where i=1, 2), the functions \gamma_{{}_{max}} and \gamma_{{}_{min}} can be defined as natural way. In this paper, we show that the Wulff shape associated to \gamma_{{}_{max}} is the convex hull of the union of Wulff shapes associated to \gamma_{{}_1} and \gamma_{{}_2} , if \gamma_{{}_1} and \gamma_{{}_2} are convex integrands. And, the Wulff shape associated to \gamma_{{}_{min}} is the intersection of Wulff shapes associated to \gamma_{{}_1} and \gamma_{{}_2}. Moreover, relationships between their dual Wulff shapes are given.
