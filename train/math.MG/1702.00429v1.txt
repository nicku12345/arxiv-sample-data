An infinitely smooth convex body in \mathbb R^n is called polynomially integrable of degree N if its parallel section functions are polynomials of degree N. We prove that the only smooth convex bodies with this property in odd dimensions are ellipsoids, if N\ge n-1. This is in contrast with the case of even dimensions and the case of odd dimensions with N<n-1, where such bodies do not exist, as it was recently shown by Agranovsky.
