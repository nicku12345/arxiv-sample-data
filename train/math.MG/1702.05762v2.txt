Alexandrov's inequalities imply that for any convex body A, the sequence of intrinsic volumes V_1(A),\ldots,V_n(A) is non-increasing (when suitably normalized). Milman's random version of Dvoretzky's theorem shows that a large initial segment of this sequence is essentially constant, up to a critical parameter called the Dvoretzky number. We show that this near-constant behavior actually extends further, up to a different parameter associated with A. This yields a new quantitative reverse inequality that sits between the approximate reverse Urysohn inequality, due to Figiel--Tomczak-Jaegermann and Pisier, and the sharp reverse Urysohn inequality for zonoids, due to Hug--Schneider. In fact, we study concentration properties of the volume radius and mean width of random projections of A and show how these lead naturally to such reversals.
