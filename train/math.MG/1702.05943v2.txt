In a d-dimensional convex body K, for n \leq d+1, random points X_0, \dots, X_{n-1} are chosen according to the uniform distribution in K. Their convex hull is a random (n-1)-simplex with probability 1. We denote its (n-1)-dimensional volume by V_{K[n]}. The k-th moment of the (n-1)-dimensional volume of a random (n-1)-simplex is monotone under set inclusion, if K \subseteq L implies that the k-th moment of V_{K[n]} is not larger than that of V_{L[n]}. Extending work of Rademacher [On the monotonicity of the expected volume of a random simplex. Mathematika 58 (2012), 77--91] and Reichenwallner and Reitzner [On the monotonicity of the moments of volumes of random simplices. Mathematika 62 (2016), 949--958], it is shown that for n \leq d, the moments of V_{K[n]} are not monotone under set inclusion.
