In this paper, we are going to discuss the following problem: Let T be a fixed set in \mathbb{R}^n. And let S and B he two subsets in \mathbb{R}^n such that for any x in S, there exists an r such that x+ r T is a subset of B. How small can be B be if we know the size of S? Stein proved that for n is greater than or equal to 3 and T is a sphere centered at origin, then S has positive measure implies B has positive measure using spherical maximal operator. Later, Bourgain and Marstrand proved the similar result for n =2. And we found an example for why the result fails for n=1.
