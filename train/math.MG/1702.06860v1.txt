This is a survey of metric properties of non-Euclidean conics, mainly based on works of Chasles and Story. A spherical conic is the intersection of the sphere with a quadratic cone; similarly, a hyperbolic conic is the intersection of the Beltrami-Cayley-Klein disk with an affine conic. Non-Euclidean conics have metric properties similar to those of Euclidean conics, and even more due to the polarity that works here better than in the Euclidean plane.
