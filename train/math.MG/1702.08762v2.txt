We combine conditions found in [Wh] with results from [MPR] to show that quasi-isometries between uniformly discrete bounded geometry spaces that satisfy linear isoperimetric inequalities are within bounded distance to bilipschitz equivalences. We apply this result to regularly branching trees and hyperbolic fillings of metric spaces.
