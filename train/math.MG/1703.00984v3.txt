We explore to what extent one may hope to preserve geometric properties of three dimensional manifolds with lower scalar curvature bounds under Gromov-Hausdorff and Intrinsic Flat limits. We introduce a new construction, called sewing, of three dimensional manifolds that preserves positive scalar curvature. We then use sewing to produce sequences of such manifolds which converge to spaces that fail to have nonnegative scalar curvature in a standard generalized sense. Since the notion of nonnegative scalar curvature is not strong enough to persist alone, we propose that one pair a lower scalar curvature bound with a lower bound on the area of a closed minimal surface when taking sequences as this will exclude the possibility of sewing of manifolds.
