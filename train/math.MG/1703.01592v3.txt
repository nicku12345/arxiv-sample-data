We consider the Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance \delta_E to a closed set E in the sub-Riemannian Heisenberg groups \mathbb{H}^n, n\ge 1. The \mathbb{H}-regularity of \delta_E is proved under mild conditions involving a general notion of singular points. In case E is a Euclidean C^k submanifold, k\ge 2, we prove that \delta_E is C^k out of the singular set. Explicit expressions for the volume of the tubular neighborhood when the boundary of E is of class C^2 are obtained, out of the singular set, in terms of the horizontal principal curvatures of \partial E and of the function \langle N,T\rangle/|N_h| and its tangent derivatives.
