Recall that a convex body K is in John's position if the unit Euclidean ball is the maximal volume ellipsoid contained in K. Approximating convex body in John's position by polytopes we obtain the following results. 1. Let n>R_n\ge 1 be a sequence such that \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{R_n}{n}=0. For a sufficiently large n, we can construct a convex body K\subset \mathbb{R}^n in John's position such that there is no P, polytope with a polynomial number of facets in n such that K\subset P\subset R_nK; 2. For a sufficiently large n, there is a convex body K\subset \mathbb{R}^n in John's position such that there is no P, polytope that has less than \exp(cn) facets satisfies K\subset P \subset \sqrt{n}K.
