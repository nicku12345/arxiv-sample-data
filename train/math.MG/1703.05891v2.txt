We verify a conjecture of Rajala: if (X,d) is a metric surface of locally finite Hausdorff 2-measure admitting some (geometrically) quasiconformal parametrization by a simply connected domain \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2, then there exists a quasiconformal mapping f: X \rightarrow \Omega satisfying the modulus inequality 2\pi^{-1}\text{Mod }\Gamma \leq \text{Mod }f\Gamma \leq 4\pi^{-1}\text{Mod }\Gamma for all curve families \Gamma in X. This inequality is the best possible. Our proof is based on an inequality for the area of a planar convex body under a linear transformation which attains its Banach-Mazur distance to the Euclidean unit ball.
