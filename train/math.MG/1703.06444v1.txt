We prove that if \Phi:X\to Y a mapping of weak bounded length distortion from a quasiconvex and complete metric space X to any metric space Y, then for any Lipschitz mapping f:\mathbb{R}^k\supset E\to X we have that {\mathcal H}^k(f(E))=0 in X if and only if {\mathcal H}^k(\Phi(f(E)))=0 in Y. This generalizes an earlier result of Haj\l{}asz and Malekzadeh where the target space Y was a Euclidean space Y=\mathbb{R}^N.
