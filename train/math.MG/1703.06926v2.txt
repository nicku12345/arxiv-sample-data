We give a rigorous definition of the T-fractal translation surface, and describe some its basic geometric and dynamical properties. In particular, we study the singularities attached to the surface by its metric completion and show there exists a Cantor set of "elusive singularities." We show these elusive singularities can be thought of as a generalization of the wild singularities introduced by Bowman and Valdez. In particular, we show that every elusive singularities has an infinite discrete set of rotational components.
