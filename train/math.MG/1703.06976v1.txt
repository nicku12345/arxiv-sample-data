In this paper, the dual Orlicz curvature measure is proposed and its basic properties are provided. A variational formula for the dual Orlicz-quermassintegral is established in order to give a geometric interpretation of the dual Orlicz curvature measure. Based on the established variational formula, a solution to the dual Orlicz-Minkowski problem regarding the dual Orlicz curvature measure is provided.
