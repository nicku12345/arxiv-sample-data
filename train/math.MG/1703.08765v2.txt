A lattice in the Euclidean space is standard if it has a basis consisting vectors whose norms equal to the length in its successive minima. In this paper, it is shown that with the L^2 norm all lattices of dimension n are standard if and only if n\leqslant 4. It is also proved that with an arbitrary norm, every lattice of dimensions 1 and 2 is standard. An example of non-standard lattice of dimension n\geqslant 3 is given when the lattice is with the L^1 norm.
