We generalize Cauchy's celebrated theorem on the global rigidity of convex polyhedra in Euclidean 3-space \mathbb{E}^{3} to the context of circle polyhedra in the 2-sphere \mathbb{S}^{2}. We prove that any two convex and proper non-unitary c-polyhedra with M\"obius-congruent faces that are consistently oriented are M\"obius-congruent. Our result implies the global rigidity of convex inversive distance circle packings in the Riemann sphere as well as that of certain hyperideal hyperbolic polyhedra in \mathbb{H}^{3}.
