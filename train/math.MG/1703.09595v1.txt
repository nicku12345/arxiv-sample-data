The present article addresses to everyone who starts working with (pointed) Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. In the major part, both Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of compact and of pointed metric spaces are introduced and investigated. Moreover, the relation of sublimits occurring with pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and ultralimits is discussed.
