Denote by {\mathcal K}^d the family of convex bodies in E^d and by w(C) the minimal width of C \in {\mathcal K}^d. We ask for the greatest number \Lambda_n ({\mathcal K}^d) such that every C \in {\mathcal K}^d contains a polytope P with at most n vertices for which \Lambda_n ({\mathcal K}^d) \leq \frac{w(P)}{w(C)}. We give a lower estimate of \Lambda_n ({\mathcal K}^d) for n \geq 2d based on estimates of the smallest radius of \big\lfloor {\frac{n}{2}} \big\rfloor antipodal pairs of spherical caps that cover the unit sphere of E^d. We show that \Lambda_3 ({\mathcal K}^2) \geq {\frac 1 2}(3- \sqrt 3), and \Lambda_n ({\mathcal K}^2) \geq \cos {\frac \pi {2 \lfloor {n/2} \rfloor}} for every n \geq 4. We also consider the dual question of estimating the smallest number \Delta_n ({\mathcal K}^d) such that every C \in {\mathcal K}^d there exists a polytope P \supset C with at most n facets for which \frac{{\rm diam}(P)}{{\rm diam}(C)} \leq \Delta_n ({\mathcal K}^d). We give an upper bound of \Delta_n ({\mathcal K}^d) for n \geq 2d. In particular, \Delta_n ({\mathcal K}^2) \leq 1/ \cos {\frac \pi {2 \lfloor {n/2} \rfloor}} for n \geq 4.
