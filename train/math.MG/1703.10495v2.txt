Let \Delta be a locally finite thick building of type \tilde{A}_2. We show that, if the type-preserving automorphism group \mathrm{Aut}(\Delta)^+ of \Delta is transitive on panels of each type, then either \Delta is Bruhat--Tits or \mathrm{Aut}(\Delta) is discrete. For \tilde{A}_2-buildings which are not panel-transitive but only vertex-transitive, we give additional conditions under which the same conclusion holds. We also find a local condition under which an \tilde{A}_2-building is ensured to be exotic (i.e.\ not Bruhat--Tits). It can be used to show that the number of exotic \tilde{A}_2-buildings with thickness q+1 and admitting a panel-regular lattice grows super-exponentially with q (ranging over prime powers). All those exotic \tilde{A}_2-buildings have a discrete automorphism group.
