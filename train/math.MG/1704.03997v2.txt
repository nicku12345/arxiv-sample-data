In 1995, Marjorie Rice discovered an interesting tiling by using convex pentagons. The authors discovered novel properties of the tilings of convex pentagon which Rice used in the discovery. As a result, many new convex pentagon tilings (tessellations) were found. The convex pentagon tilings are related to tilings by heptiamonds.
