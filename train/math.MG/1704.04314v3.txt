In the previous manuscript, new tilings (tessellations) were presented using convex pentagonal tiles belonging to Type 1 and Type 5. The convex pentagon tilings are related to heptiamond tilings. Later, the authors found Johannes Hindriks' site that summarized the research results of heptiamond tilings (tessellations). In this manuscript, the results of converting the heptiamond tilings of Hindriks to convex pentagon tilings are introduced. As a result, many new convex pentagon tilings are presented.
