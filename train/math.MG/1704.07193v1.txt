This is a tale describing the large scale geometry of Euclidean plane domains with their hyperbolic or quasihyperbolic distances. We prove that in any hyperbolic plane domain, hyperbolic and quasihyperbolic quasi-geodesics are the same curves. We also demonstrate the simultaneous Gromov hyperbolicity of such domains with their hyperbolic or quasihyperbolic distances.
