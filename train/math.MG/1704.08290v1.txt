Let M^d denote the d-dimensional Euclidean, hyperbolic, or spherical space. The r-dual set of given set in M^d is the intersection of balls of radii r centered at the points of the given set. In this paper we prove that for any set of given volume in M^d the volume of the r-dual set becomes maximal if the set is a ball. As an application we prove the following. The Kneser-Poulsen Conjecture states that if the centers of a family of N congruent balls in Euclidean d-space is contracted, then the volume of the intersection does not decrease. A uniform contraction is a contraction where all the pairwise distances in the first set of centers are larger than all the pairwise distances in the second set of centers. We prove the Kneser-Poulsen conjecture for uniform contractions (with N sufficiently large) in M^d.
