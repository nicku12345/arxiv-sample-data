Recently, a new geometric approach which is called the fixed-circle problem has been gained to fixed-point theory. The problem is introduced and studied using different techniques on metric spaces. In this paper, we consider the fixed-circle problem on S-metric spaces. We investigate existence and uniqueness conditions for fixed circles of self-mappings on an S-metric space. Some examples of self-mappings having fixed circles are also given.
