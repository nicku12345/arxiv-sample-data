In this note we study the Banach-Mazur distance between the n-dimensional cube and the crosspolytope. Previous work shows that the distance has order \sqrt{n}, and here we will prove some explicit bounds improving on former results. Even in dimension 3 the exact distance is not known, and based on computational results it is conjectured to be \frac{9}{5}. Here we will also present computerbased potential optimal results in dimension 4 to 8.
