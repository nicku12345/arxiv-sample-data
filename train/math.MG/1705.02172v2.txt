Consider an arrangement of n congruent zones on the d-dimensional unit sphere S^{d-1}, where a zone is the intersection of an origin symmetric Euclidean plank with S^{d-1}. We prove that, for sufficiently large n, it is possible to arrange n congruent zones of suitable width on S^{d-1} such that no point belongs to more than a constant number of zones, where the constant depends only on the dimension and the width of the zones. Furthermore, we also show that it is possible to cover S^{d-1} by n congruent zones such that each point of S^{d-1} belongs to at most A_d\ln n zones, where the A_d is a constant that depends only on d. This extends the corresponding 3-dimensional result of Frankl, Nagy and Nasz\'odi (2016). Moreover, we also examine coverings of S^{d-1} with congruent zones under the condition that each point of the sphere belongs to the interior of at most d-1 zones.
