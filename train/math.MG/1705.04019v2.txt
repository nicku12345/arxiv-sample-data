Recently we gave arguments that only two unique topologically different configurations of 7 equal all mutually touching round cylinders (the configurations being mirror reflections of each other) are possible in 3D, although a whole world of configurations is possible already for round cylinders of arbitrary radii. It was found that as many as 9 round cylinders (all mutually touching) are possible in 3D while the upper bound for arbitrary cylinders was estimated to be not more than 14 under plausible arguments. Now by using the chirality and Ring matrices that we introduced earlier for the topological classification of line configurations, we have given arguments that the maximal number of mutually touching straight infinite cylinders of arbitrary cross-section (provided that its boundary is a smooth curve) in 3D cannot exceed 10. We generated numerically several configurations of 10 cylinders, restricting ourselves with elliptic cylinders. Configurations of 8 and 9 equal elliptic cylinders (all in mutually touching) are generated numerically as well. A possibility and restriction of continuous transformations from elliptic into round cylinder configurations are discussed. Some curious results concerning the properties of the chirality matrix (which coincides with Seidel's adjacency matrix important for the Graph theory) are presented.
