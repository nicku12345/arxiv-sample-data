In the present paper we study the \SOL geometry that is one of the eight homogeneous Thurston 3-geomet\-ri\-es.   We determine the equation of the translation-like bisector surface of any two points. We prove, that the isosceles property of a translation triangle is not equivalent to two angles of the triangle being equal and that the triangle inequalities do not remain valid for translation triangles in general.   Moreover, we develop a method to determine the centre and the radius of the circumscribed translation sphere of a given {\it translation tetrahedron}.   In our work we will use for computations and visualizations the projective model of \SOL described by E. Moln\'ar in \cite{M97}.
