Mixed volumes V(K_1,\dots, K_d) of convex bodies K_1,\dots ,K_d in Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^d are of central importance in the Brunn-Minkowski theory. Representations for mixed volumes are available in special cases, for example as integrals over the unit sphere with respect to mixed area measures. More generally, in Hug-Rataj-Weil (2013) a formula for V(K [n], M[d-n]), n\in \{1,\dots ,d-1\}, as a double integral over flag manifolds was established which involved certain flag measures of the convex bodies K and M (and required a general position of the bodies). In the following, we discuss the general case V(K_1[n_1],\dots , K_k[n_k]), n_1+\cdots +n_k=d, and show a corresponding result involving the flag measures \Omega_{n_1}(K_1;\cdot),\dots, \Omega_{n_k}(K_k;\cdot). For this purpose, we first establish a curvature representation of mixed volumes over the normal bundles of the bodies involved.   We also obtain a corresponding flag representation for the mixed functionals from translative integral geometry and a local version, for mixed (translative) curvature measures.
