Let D be a bounded domain D in \mathbb R^n  with infinitely smooth boundary and n is odd. We prove that if the volume cut off from the domain by a hyperplane is an algebraic function of the hyperplane, free of real singular points, then the domain is an ellipsoid. This partially answers a question of V.I. Arnold: whether odd-dimensional ellipsoids are the only algebraically integrable domains?
