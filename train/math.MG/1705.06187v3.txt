We determine barycentric coordinates of triangle centers in the elliptic plane. The main focus is put on centers that lie on lines whose euclidean limit (triangle excess --> 0) is the Euler line or the Brocard line. We also investigate curves which can serve in elliptic geometry as substitutes for the euclidean nine-point-circle, the first Lemoine circle or the apollonian circles.
