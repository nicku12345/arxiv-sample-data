Giving a joint generalization of a result of Brazitikos, Chasapis and Hioni and results of Giannopoulos and Milman, we prove that roughly \left\lceil \frac{d}{(1-\vartheta)^d}\ln\frac{1}{(1-\vartheta)^d} \right\rceil points chosen uniformly and independently from a centered convex body K in {\mathbb R}^d yield a polytope P for which \vartheta K\subseteq P\subseteq K holds with large probability. The proof is simple, and relies on a combinatorial tool, the \varepsilon-net theorem.
