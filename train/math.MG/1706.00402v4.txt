Let X be a proper Hadamard space and \Gamma< Isom(X) a non-elementary discrete group of isometries with a rank one isometry. We discuss and prove Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy for the geodesic flow on the set of parametrized geodesics of the quotient of X by \Gamma and with respect to Ricks' measure introduced in [MR3628926]. This generalizes previous work of the author and J. C. Picaud on Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy in the analogous manifold setting and with respect to Knieper's measure.
