For n\in \mathbb{N} let S_n be the smallest number S>0 satisfying the inequality  \int_K f \le S \cdot |K|^{\frac 1n} \cdot \max_{\xi\in S^{n-1}} \int_{K\cap \xi^\bot} f  for all centrally-symmetric convex bodies K in \mathbb{R}^n and all even, continuous probability densities f on K. Here |K| is the volume of K. It was proved by the second-named author that S_n\le 2\sqrt{n}, and in analogy with Bourgain's slicing problem, it was asked whether S_n is bounded from above by a universal constant. In this note we construct an example showing that S_n\ge c\sqrt{n}/\sqrt{\log \log n}, where c > 0 is an absolute constant. Additionally, for any 0 < \alpha < 2 we describe a related example that satisfies the so-called \psi_{\alpha}-condition.
