We provide functional analogues of the classical geometric inequality of Rogers and Shephard on products of volumes of sections and projections. As a consequence we recover (and obtain some new) functional versions of Rogers-Shephard type inequalities as well as some generalizations of the geometric Rogers-Shephard inequality in the case where the subspaces intersect. These generalizations can be regarded as sharp local reverse Loomis-Whitney inequalities. We also obtain a sharp local Loomis-Whitney inequality.
