We study functions of least gradient as well as related superminimizers and solutions of obstacle problems in metric spaces that are equipped with a doubling measure and support a Poincar\'e inequality. We show a standard weak Harnack inequality and use it to prove semicontinuity properties of such functions. We also study some properties of the fine topology in the case p=1. Then we combine these theories to prove a weak Cartan property of superminimizers in the case p=1, as well as a strong version at points of nonzero capacity. Finally we employ the weak Cartan property to show that any topology that makes the upper representative u^{\vee} of every 1-superminimizer u upper semicontinuous in open sets is stronger (in some cases, strictly) than the 1-fine topology.
