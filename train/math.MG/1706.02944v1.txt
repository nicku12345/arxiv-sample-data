The random polytope K_n, defined as the convex hull of n points chosen uniformly at random on the boundary of a smooth convex body, is considered. Proofs for lower and upper variance bounds, strong laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for the intrinsic volumes of K_n are presented. A normal approximation bound from Stein's method and estimates for surface bodies are among the involved tools.
