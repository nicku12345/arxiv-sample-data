For polyhedral convex cones in {\mathbb R}^d, we give a proof for the conic kinematic formula for conic curvature measures, which avoids the use of characterization theorems. For the random cones defined as typical cones of an isotropic random central hyperplane arrangement, we find probabilities for non-trivial intersection, either with a fixed cone, or for two independent random cones of this type.
