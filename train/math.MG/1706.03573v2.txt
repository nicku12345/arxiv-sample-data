Let C be a closed convex cone in {\mathbb R}^n, pointed and with interior points. We consider sets of the form A=C\setminus A^\bullet, where A^\bullet\subset C is a closed convex set. If A has finite volume (Lebesgue measure), then A is called a C-coconvex set. The family of C-coconvex sets is closed under the addition \oplus defined by C\setminus(A_1\oplus A_2)= (C\setminus A_1)+(C\setminus A_2). We develop first steps of a Brunn--Minkowski theory for C-coconvex sets, which relates this addition to the notion of volume. In particular, we establish the equality conditions for a Brunn--Minkowski type inequality (with reversed inequality sign), introduce mixed volumes and their integral representations, and prove a Minkowski-type uniqueness theorem for C-coconvex sets with equal surface area measures.
