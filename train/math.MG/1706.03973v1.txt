In this paper, we study general (\alpha,\beta)-metrics which \alpha is a Riemannian metric and \beta is an one-form. We have proven that every weak Landsberg general (\alpha,\beta)-metric is a Berwald metric, where \beta is a closed and conformal one-form. This show that there exist no generalized unicorn metric in this class of general (\alpha,\beta)-metric. Further, We show that F is a Landsberg general (\alpha,\beta)-metric if and only if it is weak Landsberg general (\alpha,\beta)-metric, where \beta is a closed and conformal one-form.
