We investigate the large scale structure of certain sojourn sets of one dimensional Brownian motion within two-sided moving boundaries. The macroscopic Hausdorff dimension, upper mass dimension and logarithmic density of these sets are computed. We also give a uniform macroscopic dimension result for the Brownian level sets.
