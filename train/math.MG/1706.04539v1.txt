We present two methods to interpolate between two given rigid body displacements. Both are based on linear interpolation in the ambient space of well-known curved point models for the group of rigid body displacements. The resulting motions are either vertical Darboux motions or cubic circular motions. Both are rational of low degree and lie in the cylinder group defined by the two input poses. We unveil the essential parameters in the construction of these motions and discuss some of their properties.
