Let L \subset {\Bbb R}^3 be the union of unit balls, whose centres lie on the z-axis, and are equidistant with distance 2d \in [2, 2\sqrt{2}]. Then a packing of unit balls in {\Bbb R}^3 consisting of translates of L has a density at most \pi /(3d\sqrt{3-d^2}), with equality for a certain lattice packing of unit balls. Let L \subset {\Bbb R}^4 be the union of unit balls, whose centres lie on the x_3x_4 coordinate plane, and form either a square lattice or a regular triangular lattice, of edge length 2. Then a packing of unit balls in {\Bbb R}^4 consisting of translates of L has a density at most \pi ^2/16, with equality for the densest lattice packing of unit balls in {\Bbb R}^4. This is the first class of non-lattice packings of unit balls in {\Bbb R}^4, for which this conjectured upper bound for the packing density of balls is proved. Our main tool for the proof is a theorem on (r,R)-systems in {\Bbb R}^2. If R/r \le 2 \sqrt{2}, then the Delone triangulation associated to this (r,R)-system has the following property. The average area of a Delone triangle is at least \min \{ V_0, 2r^2 \} , where V_0 is the infimum of the areas of the non-obtuse Delone triangles. This general theorem has applications also in other problems about packings: namely for 2r^2 \ge V_0 it is sufficient to deal only with the non-obtuse Delone triangles, which is in general a much easier task. Still we give a proof of an unpublished theorem of L. Fejes T\'oth and E (=J.) Sz\'ekely: for the 2-dimensional analogue of our question about equidistant strings of unit balls, we determine the densest packing of translates of an equidistant string of unit circles with distance 2d, for the first non-trivial interval 2d \in (2{\sqrt{3}},4).
