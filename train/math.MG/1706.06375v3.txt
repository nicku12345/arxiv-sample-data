For a positive integer d, a set of points in d-dimensional Euclidean space is called almost-equidistant if for any three points from the set, some two are at unit distance. Let f(d) denote the largest size of an almost-equidistant set in d-space. It is known that f(2)=7, f(3)=10, and that the extremal almost-equidistant sets are unique. We give independent, computer-assisted proofs of these statements. It is also known that f(5) \ge 16. We further show that 12\leq f(4)\leq 13, f(5)\leq 20, 18\leq f(6)\leq 26, 20\leq f(7)\leq 34, and f(9)\geq f(8)\geq 24. Up to dimension 7, our work is based on various computer searches, and in dimensions 6 to 9, we give constructions based on the known construction for d=5. For every dimension d \ge 3, we give an example of an almost-equidistant set of 2d+4 points in the d-space and we prove the asymptotic upper bound f(d) \le O(d^{3/2}).
