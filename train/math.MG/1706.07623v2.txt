Let K be a convex body in \mathbb{R}^n and f : \partial K \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+ a continuous, strictly positive function with \int\limits_{\partial K} f(x) d \mu_{\partial K}(x) = 1. We give an upper bound for the approximation of K in the symmetric difference metric by an arbitrarily positioned polytope P_f in \mathbb{R}^n having a fixed number of vertices. This generalizes a result by Ludwig, Sch\"utt and Werner [36]. The polytope P_f is obtained by a random construction via a probability measure with density f. In our result, the dependence on the number of vertices is optimal. With the optimal density f, the dependence on K in our result is also optimal.
