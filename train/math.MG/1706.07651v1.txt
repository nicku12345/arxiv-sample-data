Flag measures are descriptors of convex bodies K in d-dimensional Euclidean space generalizing the classical area measures. They have been used to provide general integral formulas for mixed volumes (see Hug, Rataj and Weil (2017)). Here, we consider an image measure \gamma_j(K,\cdot) of flag measures, defined on the Grassmannian G(d,j) of affine j-spaces, 1\le j\le d-1, and show that it determines centrally symmetric bodies K of dimension \geq j+1 uniquely. We then explain that Grassmann measures appear in the representation of smooth, translation invariant, continuous and even valuations due to Alesker (2003). Using this connection, we prove a uniqueness result for projection averages of area measures and we finally discuss a Grassmann version of the natural touching measure of convex bodies.
