In this paper, we consider a scale invariant Cassinian metric and a Gromov hyperbolic metric. We discuss a distortion property of the scale invariant Cassinian metric under M\"obius maps of a punctured ball onto another punctured ball. We obtain a modulus of continuity of the identity map from a domain equipped with the scale invariant Cassinian metric (or the Gromov hyperbolic metric) onto the same domain equipped with the Euclidean metric. The quasi-invariance properties of both the metrics under quasiconformal maps are also established.
