A curve \theta: I\to E in a metric space E equipped with the distance d, where I\subset \R is a (possibly unbounded) interval, is called self-contracted, if for any triple of instances of time \{t_i\}_{i=1}^3\subset I with t_1\leq t_2\leq t_3 one has d(\theta(t_3),\theta(t_2))\leq d(\theta(t_3),\theta(t_1)). We prove that if E is a finite-dimensional normed space with an arbitrary norm, the trace of \theta is bounded, then \theta has finite length, i.e. is rectifiable, thus answering positively the question raised in~\cite{Lemenant16sc-rectif}.
