We consider Lipschitz maps with values in quasi-metric spaces and extend such maps to finitely many points. We prove that in this context every 1-Lipschitz map admits an extension such that its Lipschitz constant is bounded from above by the number of added points plus one. Moreover, we prove that if the source space is a Hilbert space and the target space is a Banach space, then there exists an extension such that its Lipschitz constant is bounded from above by the square root of the total of added points plus one. We discuss applications to metric transforms.
