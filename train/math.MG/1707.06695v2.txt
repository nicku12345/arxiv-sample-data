We consider the X-ray transform in a projective space over a finite field. It is well known (after E. Bolker) that this transform is injective. We formulate an analog of I.M. Gelfand's admissibility problem for the Radon transform, which asks for a classification of all minimal sets of lines for which the restricted Radon transform is injective. The solution involves doubly ruled quadric surfaces.
