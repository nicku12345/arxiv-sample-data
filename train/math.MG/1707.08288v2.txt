We choose some special unit vectors \boldsymbol{n}_1,\dots,\boldsymbol{n}_5 in \mathbb{R}^3 and denote by \mathscr{L}\subset\mathbb{R}^5 the set of all points (L_1,\dots,L_5)\in\mathbb{R}^5 with the following property: there exists a compact convex polytope P\subset\mathbb{R}^3 such that the vectors \boldsymbol{n}_1,\dots,\boldsymbol{n}_5 (and no other vector) are unit outward normals to the faces of P and the perimeter of the face with the outward normal \boldsymbol{n}_k is equal to L_k for all k=1,\dots,5. Our main result reads that \mathscr{L} is not a locally-analytic set, i.\,e., we prove that, for some point (L_1,\dots,L_5)\in\mathscr{L}, it is not possible to find a neighborhood U\subset\mathbb{R}^5 and an analytic set A\subset\mathbb{R}^5 such that \mathscr{L}\cap U=A\cap U. We interpret this result as an obstacle for finding an existence theorem for a compact convex polytope with prescribed directions and perimeters of the faces.
