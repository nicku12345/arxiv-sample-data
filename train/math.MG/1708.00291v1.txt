The maximal density of a measurable subset of R^n avoiding Euclidean distance1 is unknown except in the trivial case of dimension 1. In this paper, we consider thecase of a distance associated to a polytope that tiles space, where it is likely that the setsavoiding distance 1 are of maximal density 2^-n, as conjectured by Bachoc and Robins. We prove that this is true for n = 2, and for the Vorono\"i regions of the lattices An, n >= 2.
