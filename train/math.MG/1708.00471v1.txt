Let r=r(n) be a sequence of integers such that r\leq n and let X_1,\ldots,X_{r+1} be independent random points distributed according to the Gaussian, the Beta or the spherical distribution on \mathbb{R}^n. Limit theorems for the log-volume and the volume of the random convex hull of X_1,\ldots,X_{r+1} are established in high dimensions, that is, as r and n tend to infinity simultaneously. This includes, Berry-Esseen-type central limit theorems, log-normal limit theorems, moderate and large deviations. Also different types of mod-\phi convergence are derived. The results heavily depend on the asymptotic growth of r relative to n. For example, we prove that the fluctuations of the volume of the simplex are normal (respectively, log-normal) if r=o(n) (respectively, r\sim \alpha n for some 0 < \alpha < 1).
