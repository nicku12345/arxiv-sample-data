Consider the graph \mathbb{H}(d) whose vertex set is the hyperbolic plane, where two points are connected with an edge when their distance is equal to some d>0. Asking for the chromatic number of this graph is the hyperbolic analogue to the famous Hadwiger-Nelson problem about colouring the points of the Euclidean plane so that points at distance 1 receive different colours.   As in the Euclidean case, one can lower bound the chromatic number of \mathbb{H}(d) by 4 for all d. Using spectral methods, we prove that if the colour classes are measurable, then at least 6 colours are are needed to properly colour \mathbb{H}(d) when d is sufficiently large.
