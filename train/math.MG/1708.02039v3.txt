A set in \mathbb R^d is called almost-equidistant if for any three distinct points in the set, some two are at unit distance apart. First, we give a short proof of the result of Bezdek and L\'angi claiming that an almost-equidistant set lying on a (d-1)-dimensional sphere of radius r, where r<1/\sqrt{2}, has at most 2d+2 points. Second, we prove that an almost-equidistant set V in \mathbb R^d has O(d) points in two cases: if the diameter of V is at most 1 or if V is a subset of a d-dimensional ball of radius at most 1/\sqrt{2}+cd^{-2/3}, where c<1/2. Also, we present a new proof of the result of Kupavskii, Mustafa and Swanepoel arXiv:1708.01590 that an almost-equidistant set in \mathbb R^d has O(d^{4/3}) elements.
