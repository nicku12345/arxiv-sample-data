The spectral radius of a graph is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Let \mathcal{F}(\lambda) be the family of connected graphs of spectral radius \le \lambda. We show that \mathcal{F}(\lambda) can be defined by a finite set of forbidden subgraphs if and only if \lambda < \lambda^* := \sqrt{2+\sqrt{5}} \approx 2.058 and \lambda \not\in \{\alpha_2, \alpha_3, \dots\}, where \alpha_m = \beta_m^{1/2} + \beta_m^{-1/2} and \beta_m is the largest root of x^{m+1}=1+x+\dots+x^{m-1}. The study of forbidden subgraphs characterization for \mathcal{F}(\lambda) is motivated by the problem of estimating the maximum cardinality of equiangular lines in the n-dimensional Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^n --- a family of lines through the origin such that the angle between any pair of them is the same. Denote by N_\alpha(n) the maximum number of equiangular lines in \mathbb{R}^n with angle \arccos\alpha. We establish the asymptotic formula N_\alpha(n) = c_\alpha n + O_\alpha(1) for every \alpha \ge \frac{1}{1+2\lambda^*}. In particular, N_{1/3}(n) = 2n+O(1) and N_{1/5}(n), N_{1/(1+2\sqrt{2})}(n) = \frac{3}{2}n+O(1). Besides we show that N_\alpha(n) \le 1.49n + O_\alpha(1) for every \alpha \neq \tfrac{1}{3}, \tfrac{1}{5}, \tfrac{1}{1+2\sqrt{2}}, which improves a recent result of Balla, Dr\"axler, Keevash and Sudakov.
