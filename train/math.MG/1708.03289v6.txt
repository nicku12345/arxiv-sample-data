The classic double bubble theorem says that the least-perimeter way to enclose and separate two prescribed volumes in \mathbb{R}^N is the standard double bubble. We seek the optimal double bubble in \mathbb{R}^N with density, which we assume to be strictly log-convex. For N=1 we show that the solution is sometimes two contiguous intervals and sometimes three contiguous intervals. In higher dimensions, we think that the solution is sometimes a standard double bubble and sometimes concentric spheres (e.g. for one volume small and the other large).
