This article considers proximal planar shapes in terms of the proximity of shape nerves and shape nerve complexes. A shape nerve is collection of 2-simplexes with nonempty intersection on a triangulated shape space. A planar shape is a shape nerve complex, which is a collection of shape nerves that have nonempty intersection. A main result in this paper is the homotopy equivalence of a planar shape nerve complex and the union of its nerve sub-complexes.
