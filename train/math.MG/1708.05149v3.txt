We use probabilistic, topological and combinatorial methods to establish the following deviation inequality: For any normed space X=(\mathbb R^n ,\|\cdot\| ) there exists an invertible linear map T:\mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^n with \[ \mathbb P\left( \big| \|TG\| -\mathbb E\|TG\| \big| > \varepsilon \mathbb E\|TG\| \right) \leq C\exp \left( -c\max\{ \varepsilon^2, \varepsilon \} \log n \right),\quad \varepsilon>0, \] where G is the standard n-dimensional Gaussian vector and C,c>0 are universal constants. It follows that for every \varepsilon\in (0,1) and for every normed space X=(\mathbb R^n,\|\cdot\|) there exists a k-dimensional subspace of X which is (1+\varepsilon)-Euclidean and k\geq c\varepsilon \log n/\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}. This improves by a logarithmic on \varepsilon term the best previously known result due to G. Schechtman.
