The Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a polyhedron (a union of finitely many compact convex polytopes) in n-dimensional Euclidean space expresses the Euler characteristic of the polyhedron as a sum of certain curvatures, which are different from zero only at the vertices of the polyhedron. This note suggests a generalization of these polyhedral vertex curvatures, based on valuations, and thus obtains a variety of polyhedral Gauss-Bonnet theorems.
