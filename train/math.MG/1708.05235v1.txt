Let (X,d) be an unbounded metric space and \tilde r=(r_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} be a scaling sequence of positive real numbers tending to infinity. We define the pretangent space \Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X} to (X, d) at infinity as a metric space whose points are equivalence classes of sequences (x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\subset X which tend to infinity with the speed of \tilde r. It is proved that the pretangent spaces \Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X} are complete for every unbounded metric space (X, d) and every scaling sequence \tilde r. The finiteness conditions of \Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X} are found.
