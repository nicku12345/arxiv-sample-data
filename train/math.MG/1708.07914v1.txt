For a convex body K \subset {\mathbb R}^n, let K^z = \{y\in{\mathbb R}^n : \langle y-z, x-z\rangle\le 1, \mbox{\ for all\ } x\in K\} be the polar body of K with respect to the center of polarity z \in {\mathbb R}^n. The goal of this paper is to study the maximum of the volume product \mathcal{P}(K)=\min_{z\in {\rm int}(K)}|K||K^z|, among convex polytopes K\subset {\mathbb R}^n with a number of vertices bounded by some fixed integer m \ge n+1. In particular, we prove that the supremum is reached at a simplicial polytope with exactly m vertices and we provide a new proof of a result of Meyer and Reisner showing that, in the plane, the regular polygon has maximal volume product among all polygons with at most m vertices. Finally, we treat the case of polytopes with n+2 vertices in {\mathbb R}^n.
