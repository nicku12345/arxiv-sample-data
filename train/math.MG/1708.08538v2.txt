Given an infinite set \Gamma, we prove that the space of complex null sequences c_0(\Gamma) satisfies the Mazur-Ulam property, that is, for each Banach space X, every surjective isometry from the unit sphere of c_0(\Gamma) onto the unit sphere of X admits a (unique) extension to a surjective real linear isometry from c_0(\Gamma) to X. We also prove that the same conclusion holds for the finite dimensional space \ell_{\infty}^m.
