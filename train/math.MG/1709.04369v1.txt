In this paper we study the problem of hyperball (hypersphere) packings in 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. We introduce a new definition of the non-compact saturated ball packings and describe to each saturated hyperball packing, a new procedure to get a decomposition of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space \HYP into truncated tetrahedra. Therefore, in order to get a density upper bound for hyperball packings, it is sufficient to determine the density upper bound of hyperball packings in truncated simplices.
