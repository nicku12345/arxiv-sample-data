The isoperimetric problem with a density or weighting seeks to enclose prescribed weighted volume with minimum weighted perimeter. According to Chambers' recent proof of the log-convex density conjecture, for many densities on \mathbb{R}^n the answer is a sphere about the origin. We seek to generalize his results to some other spaces of revolution or to two different densities for volume and perimeter. We provide general results on existence and boundedness and a new approach to proving circles about the origin isoperimetric.
