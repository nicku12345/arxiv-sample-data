Let Q_n=[0,1]^n be the unit cube in {\mathbb R}^n, n \in {\mathbb N}. For a nondegenerate simplex S\subset{\mathbb R}^n, consider the value \xi(S)=\min \{\sigma>0: Q_n\subset \sigma S\}. Here \sigma S is a homothetic image of S with homothety center at the center of gravity of S and coefficient of homothety \sigma. Let us introduce the value \xi_n=\min \{\xi(S): S\subset Q_n\}. We call S a perfect simplex if S\subset Q_n and Q_n is inscribed into the simplex \xi_n S. It is known that such simplices exist for n=1 and n=3. The exact values of \xi_n are known for n=2 and in the case when there exist an Hadamard matrix of order n+1, in the latter situation \xi_n=n. In this paper we show that \xi_5=5 and \xi_9=9. We also describe infinite families of simplices S\subset Q_n such that \xi(S)=\xi_n for n=5,7,9. The main result of the paper is the existence of perfect simplices in {\mathbb R}^5.
