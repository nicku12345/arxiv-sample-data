We suggest several mathematical counterparts to the idea of "effective degrees of freedom" and formulate specific questions, much of which are inspired by Larry Guth's results and ideas on the Hermann Weyl kind of asymptotics of the Morse (co)homology spectra of the volume energy function on the spaces of cycles in balls.
