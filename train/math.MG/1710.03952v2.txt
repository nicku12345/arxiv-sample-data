In this paper, we generalize the spherical Gromov-Milman's isoperimetric inequality to general (closed) Riemannian manifolds. Our isoperimetric inequality also results from needle decomposition and localization methods. This is possible due to Klartag's recent needle decomposition method which works on every closed Riemannian manifold. As a result of our main theorem, we obtain sharp isoperimetric inequalities for compact rank one symmetric spaces (CROSS). Namely, for the complex projective space \mathbb{C}P^n and the quaternionic projective space \mathbb{H}P^n, we demonstrate that the isoperimetric regions are geodesic balls. For the real projective space \mathbb{R}P^n, the isoperimetric regions are given by either the geodesic balls or tubes around some \mathbb{R}P^k\subset\mathbb{R}P^n.
