It was conjectured by Levi, Hadwiger, Gohberg and Markus that the boundary of any convex body in {\mathbb R}^n can be illuminated by at most 2^n light sources, and, moreover, 2^n-1 light sources suffice unless the body is a parallelotope. We show that if a convex body is close to the cube in the Banach-Mazur metric, and it is not a parallelotope, then indeed 2^n-1 light sources suffice to illuminate its boundary. Equivalently, any convex body sufficiently close to the cube, but not isometric to it, can be covered by 2^n-1 smaller homothetic copies of itself.
