A real valued function \varphi of one variable is called a metric transform if for every metric space (X,d) the composition d_\varphi = \varphi\circ d is also a metric on X. We give a complete characterization of the class of approximately nondecreasing, unbounded metric transforms \varphi such that the transformed Euclidean half line ([0,\infty),|\cdot|_\varphi) is Gromov hyperbolic. As a consequence, we obtain metric transform rigidity for roughly geodesic Gromov hyperbolic spaces, that is, if (X,d) is any metric space containing a rough geodesic ray and \varphi is an approximately nondecreasing, unbounded metric transform such that the transformed space (X,d_\varphi) is Gromov hyperbolic and roughly geodesic then \varphi is an approximate dilation and the original space (X,d) is Gromov hyperbolic and roughly geodesic.
