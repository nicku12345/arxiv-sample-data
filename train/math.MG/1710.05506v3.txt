This paper proves the following results: Besides parallelograms and centrally symmetric hexagons, there is no other convex domain which can form a two-, three- or four-fold lattice tiling in the Euclidean plane. If a centrally symmetric octagon can form a lattice multiple tiling, then the multiplicity is at least seven. However, there are decagons which can form five-fold (or six-fold) lattice tilings. Consequently, whenever n\ge 3, there are non-parallelohedral polytopes which can form five-fold lattice tilings in the n-dimensional Euclidean space.
