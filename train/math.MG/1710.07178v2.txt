We give a metric characterization of the scalar curvature of a smooth Riemannian manifold, analyzing the maximal distance between (n+1) points in infinitesimally small neighborhoods of a point. Since this characterization is purely in terms of the distance function, it could be used to approach the problem of defining the scalar curvature on a non-smooth metric space. In the second part we will discuss this issue, focusing in particular on Alexandrov spaces and surfaces with bounded integral curvature.
