In this note we investigate some properties of equilibrium states of affine iterated function systems, sometimes known as K\"aenm\"aki measures. We give a simple sufficient condition for K\"aenm\"aki measures to have a gap between certain specific pairs of Lyapunov exponents, partially answering a question of B. B\'ar\'any, A. K\"aenm\"aki and H. Koivusalo. We also give sharp bounds for the number of ergodic K\"aenm\"aki measures in dimensions up to 4, answering a question of J. Bochi and the author within this range of dimensions. Finally, we pose an open problem on the Hausdorff dimension of self-affine measures which may be reduced to a statement concerning semigroups of matrices in which a particular weighted product of absolute eigenvalues is constant.
