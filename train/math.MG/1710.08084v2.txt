This paper contains a number of results related to volumes of projective perturbations of convex bodies and the Laplace transform on convex cones. First, it is shown that a sharp version of Bourgain's slicing conjecture implies the Mahler conjecture for convex bodies that are not necessarily centrally-symmetric. Second, we find that by slightly translating the polar of a centered convex body, we may obtain another body with a bounded isotropic constant. Third, we provide a counter-example to a conjecture by Kuperberg on the distribution of volume in a body and in its polar.
