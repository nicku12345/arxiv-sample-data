This paper presents the first polynomial time algorithm to compute geodesics in a CAT(0) cubical complex in general dimension. The algorithm is a simple iterative method to update breakpoints of a path joining two points using Miller, Owen and Provan's algorithm (2015) as a subroutine. Our algorithm is applicable to any CAT(0) space in which geodesics between two close points can be computed, not limited to CAT(0) cubical complexes.
