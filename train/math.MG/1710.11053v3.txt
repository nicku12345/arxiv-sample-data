This paper contains two results on the dimension and smoothness of radial projections of sets and measures in Euclidean spaces.   To introduce the first one, assume that E,K \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} are non-empty Borel sets with \dim_{\mathrm{H}} K > 0. Does the radial projection of K to some point in E have positive dimension? Not necessarily: E can be zero-dimensional, or E and K can lie on a common line. I prove that these are the only obstructions: if \dim_{\mathrm{H}} E > 0, and E does not lie on a line, then there exists a point in x \in E such that the radial projection \pi_{x}(K) has Hausdorff dimension at least (\dim_{\mathrm{H}} K)/2. Applying the result with E = K gives the following corollary: if K \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} is Borel set, which does not lie on a line, then the set of directions spanned by K has Hausdorff dimension at least (\dim_{\mathrm{H}} K)/2.   For the second result, let d \geq 2 and d - 1 < s < d. Let \mu be a compactly supported Radon measure in \mathbb{R}^{d} with finite s-energy. I prove that the radial projections of \mu are absolutely continuous with respect to \mathcal{H}^{d - 1} for every centre in \mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus \operatorname{spt} \mu, outside an exceptional set of dimension at most 2(d - 1) - s. In fact, for x outside an exceptional set as above, the proof shows that \pi_{x\sharp}\mu \in L^{p}(S^{d - 1}) for some p > 1. The dimension bound on the exceptional set is sharp.
