Let K be a convex body in the Euclidean plane \mathbb R^2. We say that a point set X \subseteq \mathbb R^2 satsfies the property T(K) if the family of translates \{ K + x : x \in X \} has a line transversal. A weaker property, T(K, s), of the set X is that every subset Y \subseteq X consisting of at most s elements satisfies the property T(K).   The following question goes back to Gr\"unbaum: given K and s, what is the minimal positive number \lambda = \lambda(K, s) such that every finite point set in \mathbb R^2 with the property T(K, s) also satisfies the property T(\lambda K)? The constant \lambda_{disj}(K, s) is defined similarly, with the only additional assumption that the translates x + K and y + K are disjoint for every x, y \in X, x \neq y.   One case of particular interest is s = 3 and K = B, where B is a unit Euclidean ball. Namely, it was conjectured by Eckhoff and, independently, Dolnikov that \lambda (B, 3) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.   In this paper we propose a stronger conjecture, which, on the other hand, admits an algebraic formulation in a finite alphabet. We verify our conjecture numerically on a sufficiently dense grid in the space of parameters and thereby obtain an estimate \lambda_{disj}(B, 3) \leq \lambda(B, 3) \leq 1.645. This is an improvement on the previously known upper bounds \lambda(B, 3) \leq \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{2}}}{2} \approx 1.79 (Jer\'onimo Castro and Rold\'an-Pensado, 2011) and \lambda_{disj}(B, 3) \leq 1.65 (Heppes, 2005).
