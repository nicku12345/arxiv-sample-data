The notion of a spectral geometry on a compact metric space X is introduced. This notion serves as a discrete approximation of X motivated by the notion of a spectral triple from non-commutative geometry. A set of axioms charaterising spectral geometries is given. Bounded deformations of spectral geometries are studied and the relationship between the dimension of a spectral geometry and more traditional dimensions of metric spaces is investigated.
