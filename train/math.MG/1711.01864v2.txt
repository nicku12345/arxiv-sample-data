Polytope theory has produced a great number of remarkably simple and complete characterization results for face-number sets or f-vector sets of classes of polytopes. We observe that in most cases these sets can be described as the intersection of a semi-algebraic set with an integer lattice. Such "semi-algebraic sets of lattice points" have not received much attention, which is surprising in view of a close connection to Hilbert's Tenth problem, which deals with their projections.   We develop proof techniques in order to show that, despite the observations above, some f-vector sets are NOT semi-algebraic sets of lattice points. This is then proved for the set of all pairs (f_1,f_2) of 4-dimensional polytopes, the set of all f-vectors of simplicial d-polytopes for d\ge6, and the set of all f-vectors of general d-polytopes for d\ge6. For the f-vector set of all 4-polytopes this remains open.
