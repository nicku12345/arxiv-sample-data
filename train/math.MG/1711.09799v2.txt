Previous discoveries of the first author (1984-88) on so-called hyperbolic football manifolds and our recent works (2016-17) on locally extremal ball packing and covering hyperbolic space \HYP with congruent balls had led us to the idea that our "experience space in small size" could be of hyperbolic structure. In this paper we construct an infinite series of oriented hyperbolic space forms so-called cobweb (or tube) manifolds Cw(2z, 2z, 2z)=Cw(2z), 3\le z odd, which can describe nanotubes, very probably.
