We describe the configuration space \mathbf{S} of polygons with prescribed edge slopes, and study the perimeter \mathcal{P} as a Morse function on \mathbf{S}. We characterize critical points of \mathcal{P} (these are \textit{tangential} polygons) and compute their Morse indices. This setup is motivated by a number of results about critical points and Morse indices of the oriented area function defined on the configuration space of polygons with prescribed edge lengths (flexible polygons). As a by-product, we present an independent computation of the Morse index of the area function (obtained earlier by G. Panina and A. Zhukova).
