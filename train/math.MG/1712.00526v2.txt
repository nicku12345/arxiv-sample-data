A metric space X is quasisymmetrically co-Hopfian if every quasisymmetric embedding of X into itself is onto. We construct the first examples of metric spaces homeomorphic to the universal Menger curve and higher dimensional Sierpi\'nski spaces, which are quasisymmetrically co-Hopfian. We also show that the collection of quasisymmetric equivalence classes of spaces homeomorphic to the Menger curve is uncountable. These results answer a problem and generalize results of Merenkov from \cite{Mer:coHopf}.
