Problems, related to the determination of the minimal number of balls that generate a shadow at a fixed point in the multi-dimensional Euclidean space  \mathbb{R}^n , are considered in present work. Here, the statement "a system of balls generate shadow at a point" means that any line passing through the point intersects at least one ball of the system. New properties of pairwise-disjoint balls that do not contain a fixed point inside of a sphere in space \mathbb{R}^3, centered on the sphere, and generate shadow at the point are established. And a system of n+1 pairwise-disjoint balls with equal radii in \mathbb{R}^n,  n\ge 3, that do not contain a fixed point of the space and generate shadow at the point is constructed in the work.
