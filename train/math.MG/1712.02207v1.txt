For an arbitrary convex quadrilateral ABCD with area {\cal A} and perimeter p, we define two points I_1, I_2 on its Newton line that serve as incenters. These points are the centers of two circles with radii r_1, r_2 that are tangent to opposite sides of ABCD. We then prove that {\cal A}=pr/2, where r is the harmonic mean of r_1 and r_2. We also investigate the special cases with I_1\equiv I_2 and/or r_1=r_2.
