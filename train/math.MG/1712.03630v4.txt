Stable topological invariants are a cornerstone of persistence theory and applied topology, but their discriminative properties are often poorly-understood. In this paper we study a rich homology-based invariant first defined by Dey, Shi, and Wang, which we think of as embedding a metric graph in the barcode space. We prove that this invariant is locally injective on the space of metric graphs and globally injective on a GH-dense subset. Moreover, we show that is globally injective on a full measure subset of metric graphs, in the appropriate sense.
