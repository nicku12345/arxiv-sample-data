A packing of translates of a convex body in the d-dimensional Euclidean space \mathbb{E}^d is said to be totally separable if any two packing elements can be separated by a hyperplane of \mathbb{E}^{d} disjoint from the interior of every packing element. We call the packing \mathcal P of translates of a centrally symmetric convex body \mathbf{C} in \mathbb{E}^d a \rho-separable packing for given \rho\geq 1 if in every ball concentric to a packing element of \mathcal P having radius \rho (measured in the norm generated by \mathbf{C}) the corresponding sub-packing of \mathcal P is totally separable. The main result of this paper is the following theorem. Consider the convex hull \mathbf{Q} of n non-overlapping translates of an arbitrary centrally symmetric convex body \mathbf{C} forming a \rho-separable packing in \mathbb{E}^d with n being sufficiently large for given \rho\geq 1. If \mathbf{Q} has minimal mean i-dimensional projection for given i with 1\leq i<d, then \mathbf{Q} is approximately a d-dimensional ball. This extends a theorem of K. B\"or\"oczky Jr. [Monatsh. Math. 118 (1994), 41-54] from translative packings to \rho-separable translative packings for \rho\geq 1.
