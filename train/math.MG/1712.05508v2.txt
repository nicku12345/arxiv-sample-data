For all k,n\ge 1, we construct a biLipschitz embedding of \mathbb{S}^n into the jet space Carnot group J^k(\mathbb{R}^n) that does not admit a Lipschitz extension to \mathbb{B}^{n+1}. Let f:\mathbb{B}^n\to \mathbb{R} be a smooth, positive function with k^{th}-order derivatives that are approximately linear near \partial \mathbb{B}^n. The embedding is given by taking the jet of f on the upper hemisphere and the jet of -f on the lower hemisphere, where we view \mathbb{S}^n as two copies of \mathbb{B}^n. To prove the lack of a Lipschitz extension, we apply a factorization result of Wenger and Young for n=1 and modify an argument of Rigot and Wenger for n\ge 2.
