We characterise purely n-unrectifiable subsets S of a complete metric space X with finite Hausdorff n-measure by studying arbitrarily small perturbations of elements of the set of all bounded 1-Lipschitz functions f\colon X \to \mathbb R^m with respect to the supremum norm. In one such characterisation it is shown that, if S has positive lower density almost everywhere, then the set of all f with \mathcal H^n(f(S))=0 is residual. Conversely, if E\subset X is n-rectifiable with \mathcal H^n(E)>0, the set of all f with \mathcal H^n(f(E))>0 is residual.   These results provide a replacement for the Besicovitch-Federer projection theorem in arbitrary metric spaces, which is known to be false outside of Euclidean spaces.
