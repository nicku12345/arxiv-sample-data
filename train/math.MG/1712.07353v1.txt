Let X=\bigcup\varphi_{i}X be a strongly separated self-affine set in \mathbb{R}^2 (or one satisfying the strong open set condition). Under mild non-compactness and irreducibility assumptions on the matrix parts of the \varphi_{i}, we prove that \dim X is equal to the affinity dimension, and similarly for self-affine measures and the Lyapunov dimension. The proof is via analysis of the dimension of the orthogonal projections of the measures, and relies on additive combinatorics methods.
