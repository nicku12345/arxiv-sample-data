We extend vector configurations to more general objects that have nicer combinatorial and topological properties, called weighted pseudosphere arrangements. These are defined as a weighted variant of arrangements of pseudospheres, as in the Topological Representation Theorem for oriented matroids. We show that in rank 3, the real Stiefel manifold, Grassmannian, and oriented Grassmannian are homotopy equivalent to the analogously defined spaces of weighted pseudosphere arrangements. As a consequence, this gives a new classifying space for rank 3 vector bundles and for rank 3 oriented vector bundles where the difficulties of real algebraic geometry that arrise in the Grassmannian can be avoided. In particular, we show for all rank 3 oriented matroids, that the subspace of weighted pseudosphere arrangements realizing that oriented matroid is contractible. This is a sharp contrast with vector configurations where the space of realizations can have the homotopy type of any primary real semialgebraic set.
