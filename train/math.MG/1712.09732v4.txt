In 1885, Fedorov discovered that a convex domain can form a lattice tiling of the Euclidean plane if and only if it is a parallelogram or a centrally symmetric hexagon. It is known that there is no other convex domain which can form two-, three- or four-fold translative tiling in the Euclidean plane, but there are centrally symmetric convex octagons and decagons which can form five-fold translative tilings. This paper characterizes all the convex domains which can form five-fold translative tilings of the Euclidean plane.
