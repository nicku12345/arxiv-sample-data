Our main contribution is a concentration inequality for the symmetric volume difference of a  C^2  convex body with positive Gaussian curvature and a circumscribed random polytope with a restricted number of facets, for any probability measure on the boundary with a positive density function. We also show that the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling numbers satisfy  \text{div}_{n-1} = (2\pi e)^{-1}(n+\ln n) + O(1), which improves a classical result of Zador by a factor of o(n). In addition, we provide a remarkable open problem which is the natural geometric generalization of the famous and fundamental "balls and bins" problem from probability. This problem is tightly connected to the optimality of random polytopes in high dimensions.
