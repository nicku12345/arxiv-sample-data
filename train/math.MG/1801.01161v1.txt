The intersection L of two different non-opposite hemispheres G and H of a d-dimensional sphere S^d is called a lune. By the thickness of L we mean the distance of the centers of the (d-1)-dimensional hemispheres bounding L. For a hemisphere G supporting a %spherical convex body C \subset S^d we define {\rm width}_G(C) as the thickness of the narrowest lune or lunes of the form G \cap H containing C. If {\rm width}_G(C) =w for every hemisphere G supporting C, we say that C is a body of constant width w. We present properties of these bodies. In particular, we prove that the diameter of any spherical body C of constant width w on S^d is w, and that if w < \frac{\pi}{2}, then C is strictly convex. Moreover, we are checking when spherical bodies of constant width and constant diameter coincide.
