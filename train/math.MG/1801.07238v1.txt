We study a certain Helly-type question by Konrad Swanepoel. Assume that X is a set of points such that every k-subset of X is in centrally symmetric convex position, is it true that X must also be in centrally symmetric convex position? It is easy to see that this is false if k\le 5, but it may be true for sufficiently large k. We investigate this question and give some partial results.
