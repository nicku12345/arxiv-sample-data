We prove that any metric space X homeomorphic to \mathbb{R}^2 with locally finite Hausdorff 2-measure satisfies a reciprocal lower bound on modulus of curve families associated to a quadrilateral. More precisely, let Q \subset X be a topological quadrilateral with boundary edges (in cyclic order) denoted by \zeta_1, \zeta_2, \zeta_3, \zeta_4 and let \Gamma(\zeta_i, \zeta_j; Q) denote the family of curves in Q connecting \zeta_i and \zeta_j; then \text{mod} \Gamma(\zeta_1, \zeta_3; Q) \text{mod} \Gamma(\zeta_2, \zeta_4; Q) \geq 1/\kappa for \kappa = 2000^2\cdot (4/\pi)^2. This answers a question concerning minimal hypotheses under which a metric space admits a quasiconformal parametrization by a domain in \mathbb{R}^2.
