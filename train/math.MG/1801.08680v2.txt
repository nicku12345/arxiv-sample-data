The space of continuous, {\rm SL}(m,C)-equivariant, m\geq 2, and translation covariant valuations taking values in the space of real symmetric tensors on C^m\cong R^{2m} of rank r\geq 0 is completely described. The classification involves the moment tensor valuation for r\geq 1 and is analogous to the classification of the corresponding tensor valuations that are {\rm SL}(2m,R)-equivariant, although the method of proof cannot be adapted.
