We study \infty-modulus on general metric spaces and establish its relation to shortest lengths of paths. This connection was already known for modulus on graphs, but the formulation in metric measure spaces requires more attention to exceptional families. We use this to define a metric that we call the essential metric, and show how this recovers a metric that had already been advanced in the literature by De Cecco and Palmieri.
