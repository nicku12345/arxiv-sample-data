A classification of SL(n) contravariant, continuous function valued valuations on convex bodies is established. Such valuations are natural extensions of SL(n) contravariant L_p Minkowski valuations, the classification of which characterized L_p projection bodies, which are fundamental in the L_p Brunn-Minkowski theory, for p \geq 1. Hence our result will help to better understand extensions of the L_p Brunn-Minkowski theory. In fact, our results characterize general projection functions which extend L_p projection functions (p-th powers of the support functions of L_p projection bodies) to projection functions in the L_p Brunn-Minkowski theory for 0< p < 1 and in the Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski theory.
