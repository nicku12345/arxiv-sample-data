In this article, a classification of continuous, linearly intertwining, symmetric L_p-Blaschke (p>1) valuations is established as an extension of Haberl's work on Blaschke valuations. More precisely, we show that for dimensions n\geq 3, the only continuous, linearly intertwining, normalized symmetric L_p-Blaschke valuation is the normalized L_p-curvature image operator, while for dimension n = 2 , a rotated normalized L_p-curvature image operator is an only additional one. One of the advantages of our approach is that we deal with normalized symmetric L_p-Blaschke valuations, which makes it possible to handle the case p=n. The cases where p \not =n are also discussed by studying the relations between symmetric L_p-Blaschke valuations and normalized ones.
