For 1 \leq p < \infty, Ludwig, Haberl and Parapatits classified L_p Minkowski valuations intertwining the special linear group with additional conditions such as homogeneity and continuity. In this paper,a complete classification of L_p Minkowski valuations intertwining the special linear group on polytopes without any additional conditions is established for p \geq 1 including p = \infty. For n=3 and p=1, there exist valuations not mentioned before.
