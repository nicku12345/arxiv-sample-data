In this paper, we propose and study the polar Orlicz-Minkowski problems: under what conditions on a nonzero finite measure \mu and a continuous function \varphi:(0,\infty)\rightarrow(0,\infty), there exists a convex body K\in\mathcal{K}_0 such that K is an optimizer of the following optimization problems: \begin{equation*} \inf/\sup \bigg\{\int_{S^{n-1}}\varphi\big( h_L \big) \,d \mu: L \in \mathcal{K}_{0} \ \text{and}\ |L^\circ|=\omega_{n}\bigg\}. \end{equation*} The solvability of the polar Orlicz-Minkowski problems is discussed under different conditions. In particular, under certain conditions on \varphi, the existence of a solution is proved for a nonzero finite measure \mu on S^{n-1} which is not concentrated on any hemisphere of S^{n-1}. Another part of this paper deals with the p-capacitary Orlicz-Petty bodies. In particular, the existence of the p-capacitary Orlicz-Petty bodies is established and the continuity of the p-capacitary Orlicz-Petty bodies is proved.
