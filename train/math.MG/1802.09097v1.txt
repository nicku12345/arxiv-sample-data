A query, about the orbit P{\cal W} in real 3-space of a point P under an isometry group {\cal W} generated by edge rotations of a tetrahedron, leads to contrasting notions, {\cal W} versus {\cal S}, of "rotation group". The set R =\{r_{{\sf A}_1},r_{{\sf A}_2}\} of rotations r_{{\sf A} _i} about axes {\sf A}_i generates two manifestations of an isometry group on \Re^3:   (1). In the {\em stationary} group {\cal S:=S}(R), all axes {\sf B} are fixed under a rotation r_{\sf A} about {\sf A}.   (2). In the {\em peripatetic} group {\cal W:=W}(R), each r_{\sf A} transforms every rotational axis {\sf B\not=A}.   {\bf Theorem.} \ If the line {\sf A}_1 is skew to {\sf A}_2, if each r_{{\sf A}_i} is of infinite order, and if P\in\Re^3, then both of the orbits P{\cal S} and P{\cal W} are dense in \Re^3.
