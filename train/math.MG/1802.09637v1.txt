Self-contractedness (or self-expandedness, depending on the orientation) is hereby extended in two natural ways giving rise, for any \lambda\in\lbrack-1,1), to the metric notion of \lambda -curve and the (weaker) geometric notion of \lambda-cone property (\lambda-eel). In the Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{d} it is established that for \lambda\in\lbrack-1,1/d) bounded \lambda-curves have finite length. For \lambda\geq 1/\sqrt{5} it is always possible to construct bounded curves of infinite length in {\mathbb{R}}^{3} which do satisfy the \lambda -cone property. This can never happen in {\mathbb{R}}^{2} though: it is shown that all bounded planar curves with the \lambda-cone property have finite length.
