The Besicovitch covering property (BCP) is known to be one of the fundamental tools in measure theory, and more generally, a usefull property for numerous purposes in analysis and geometry. We prove both sufficient and necessary criteria for the validity of BCP in the first Heisenberg group equipped with a homogeneous distance. Beyond recovering all previously known results about the validity or non validity of BCP in this setting, we get simple descriptions of new large classes of homogeneous distances satisfying BCP. We also obtain a full characterization of rotationally invariant distances for which BCP holds in the first Heisenberg group under mild regularity assumptions about their unit sphere.
