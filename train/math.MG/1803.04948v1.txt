In this paper we study congruent and non-congruent hyperball (hypersphere) packings of the truncated regular octahedron and cube tilings. These are derived from the Coxeter simplex tilings \{p,3,4\} (7\le p \in \mathbb{N}) and \{p,4,3\} (5\le p \in \mathbb{N}) in 3-dimensional hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^3. We determine the densest hyperball packing arrangement and its density with congruent and non-congruent hyperballs related to the above tilings in \mathbb{H}^3.   We prove that the locally densest congruent or non-congruent hyperball configuration belongs to the regular truncated cube with density \approx 0.86145. This is larger than the B\"or\"oczky-Florian density upper bound for balls and horoballs. Our locally optimal non-congruent hyperball packing configuration cannot be extended to the entire hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^3, but we determine the extendable densest non-congruent hyperball packing arrangement related to a regular cube tiling with density \approx 0.84931.
