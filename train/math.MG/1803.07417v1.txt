We use Batson's lower bound on the nonorientable slice genus of (2n,2n-1)-torus knots to prove that for any n \geq 2, every smooth Jordan curve has an inscribed rectangle of of aspect ratio \tan(\frac{\pi k}{2n}) for some k\in \{1,...,n-1\}. Setting n = 3, we have that every smooth Jordan curve has an inscribed rectangle of aspect ratio \sqrt{3}.
