We study a new construction of bodies from a given convex body in \mathbb{R}^{n} which are isomorphic to (weighted) floating bodies. We establish several properties of this new construction, including its relation to p-affine surface areas. We show that these bodies are related to Ulam's long-standing floating body problem which asks whether Euclidean balls are the only bodies that can float, without turning, in any orientation.
