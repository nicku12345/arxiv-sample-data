We consider the problem of characterising the generic rigidity of bar-joint frameworks in \mathbb{R}^d in which each vertex is constrained to lie in a given affine subspace. The special case when d=2 was previously solved by I. Streinu and L. Theran in 2010. We will extend their characterisation to the case when d\geq 3 and each vertex is constrained to lie in an affine subspace of dimension t, when t=1,2 and also when t\geq 3 and d\geq t(t-1). We then point out that results on body-bar frameworks obtained by N. Katoh and S. Tanigawa in 2013 can be used to characterise when a graph has a rigid realisation as a d-dimensional body-bar framework with a given set of linear constraints.
