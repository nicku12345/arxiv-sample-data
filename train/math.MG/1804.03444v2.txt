The classical Dvoretzky--Rogers lemma provides a deterministic algorithm by which, from any set of isotropic vectors in Euclidean d-space, one can select a subset of d vectors whose determinant is not too small. Subsequently, Pelczy\'nski and Szarek improved this lower bound by a factor depending on the dimension and the number of vectors.   Pivovarov, on the other hand, determined the expectation of the square of the volume of parallelotopes spanned by d independent random vectors in \mathbb{R}^d, each one chosen according to an isotropic measure. We extend Pivovarov's result to a class of more general probability measures, which yields that the volume bound in the Dvoretzky--Rogers lemma is, in fact, equal to the expectation of the squared volume of random parallelotopes spanned by isotropic vectors. This allows us to give a probabilistic proof of the improvement of Pelczy\'nski and Szarek, and provide a lower bound for the probability that the volume of such a random parallelotope is large.
