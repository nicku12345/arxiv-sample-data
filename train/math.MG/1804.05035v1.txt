The local theory of regular or multi-regular systems aims at finding sufficient local conditions for a Delone set X to be a regular or multi-regular system. One of the main goals is to estimate the regularity radius \hat{\rho}_d for Delone sets X in terms of the radius R of the largest "empty ball" for X.   The present paper establishes the lower bound \hat{\rho_d}\geq 2dR for all d, which is linear in d. The best previously known lower bound had been \hat{\rho}_d\geq 4R for d\geq 2. The proof of the new lower bound is accomplished through explicit constructions of Delone sets with mutually equivalent (2dR-\varepsilon)-clusters, which are not regular systems.
