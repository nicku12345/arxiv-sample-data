Let \mathbb{G} be any Carnot group. We prove that, if a subset of \mathbb{G} is contained in a rectifiable curve, then it satisfies Peter Jones' geometric lemma with some natural modifications. We thus prove one direction of the Traveling Salesman Theorem in \mathbb{G}. Our proof depends on new Alexandrov-type curvature inequalities for the Hebisch-Sikora metrics. We also apply the geometric lemma to prove that, in every Carnot group, there exist -1-homogeneous Calder\'on-Zygmund kernels such that, if a set E \subset \mathbb{G} is contained in a 1-regular curve, then the corresponding singular integral operators are bounded in L^2(E). In contrast to the Euclidean setting, these kernels are nonnegative and symmetric.
