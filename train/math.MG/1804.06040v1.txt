A finite set of distinct vectors \mathcal{X} in the d-dimensional Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^d is called an s-distance set if the set of mutual distances between distinct elements of \mathcal{X} has cardinality s. In this paper we present a combined approach of isomorph-free exhaustive generation of graphs and Gr\"obner basis computation to classify the largest 3-distance sets in \mathbb{R}^4, the largest 4-distance sets in \mathbb{R}^3, and the largest 6-distance sets in \mathbb{R}^2. We also construct new examples of large s-distance sets for d\leq 8 and s\leq 6, and independently verify several earlier results from the literature.
