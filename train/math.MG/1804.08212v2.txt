Let n\geq 3, and let B_1^n be the standard n-dimensional cross-polytope (i.e. the convex hull of standard coordinate vectors and their negatives). We show that there exists a symmetric convex body \mathcal G_m in {\mathbb R}^n such that the Banach--Mazur distance d(B_1^n,\mathcal G_m) satisfies d(B_1^n,\mathcal G_m)\geq n^{5/9}\log^{-C}n, where C>0 is a universal constant. The body \mathcal G_m is obtained as a typical realization of a random polytope in {\mathbb R}^n with 2m:=2n^C vertices (for a large constant C). The result improves upon an earlier estimate of S.Szarek which gives d(B_1^n,\mathcal G_m)\geq c n^{1/2}\log n (with a different choice of m). This shows in a strong sense that the cross-polytope (or the cube [-1,1]^n) cannot be an "approximate" center of the Minkowski compactum.
