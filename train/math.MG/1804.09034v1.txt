The multifractal formalism for measures hold whenever the existence of corresponding Gibbs-like measures supported on the singularities sets holds. In the present work we tried to relax such a hypothesis and introduce a more general framework of mixed (and thus single) multifractal analysis where the measures constructed on the singularities sets are not Gibbs but controlled by an extra-function allowing the multifractal formalism to hold. We fall on the classical case by a particular choice of such a function.
