Let K be a knot type for which the quadratic term of the Conway polynomial is nontrivial, and let \gamma: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^3 be an analytic \mathbb{Z}-periodic function with non-vanishing derivative which parameterizes a knot of type K in space. We prove that there exists a sequence of numbers 0\leq t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_6 < 1 so that the polygonal path obtained by cyclically connecting the points \gamma(t_1), \gamma(t_2), ..., \gamma(t_6) by line segments is a trefoil knot.
