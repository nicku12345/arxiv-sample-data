We study the mean-value harmonic functions on open subsets of \mathbb{R}^n equipped with weighted Lebesgue measures and norm induced metrics. Our main result is a necessary condition saying that all such functions solve a certain homogeneous system of elliptic PDEs. Moreover, a converse result is established in case of analytic weights. Assuming Sobolev regularity of weight w \in W^{l,\infty} we show that strongly harmonic functions are as well in W^{l,\infty} and that they are analytic, whenever the weight is analytic.   The analysis is illustrated by finding all mean-value harmonic functions in \mathbb{R}^2 for the l^p-distance 1 \leq p \leq \infty. The essential outcome is a certain discontinuity with respect to p, i.e. that for all p \ne 2 there are only finitely many linearly independent mean-value harmonic functions, while for p=2 there are infinitely many of them. We conclude with a remarkable observation that strongly harmonic functions in \mathbb{R}^n possess the mean value property with respect to infinitely many weight functions obtained from a given weight.
