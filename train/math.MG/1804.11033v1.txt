For a finite planar graph, it associates with some metric spaces, called (regular) spherical polyhedral surfaces, by replacing faces with regular spherical polygons in the unit sphere and gluing them edge-to-edge. We consider the class of planar graphs which admit spherical polyhedral surfaces with the curvature bounded below by 1 in the sense of Alexandrov, i.e. the total angle at each vertex is at most 2\pi. We classify all spherical tilings with regular spherical polygons, i.e. total angles at vertices are exactly 2\pi. We prove that for any graph in this class which does not admit a spherical tiling, the area of the associated spherical polyhedral surface with the curvature bounded below by 1 is at most 4\pi - \epsilon_0 for some \epsilon_0 > 0. That is, we obtain a definite gap between the area of such a surface and that of the unit sphere.
