In the study of the real projective plane, harmonic conjugates have an essential role, with applications to projectivities, involutions, and polarity. The construction of a harmonic conjugate requires the selection of auxiliary elements; it must be verified, with an invariance theorem, that the result is independent of the choice of these auxiliary elements. A constructive proof of the invariance theorem is given here; the methods used follow principles put forward by Errett Bishop.
