This paper studies the geometry given by the projective action of the Heisenberg group on the plane. The closed orbifolds admitting Heisenberg structures are those with vanishing Euler characteristic and singularities of order at most two, and the corresponding deformation spaces are computed. Heisenberg geometry is of interest as a transitional geometry between any two of the constant-curvature geometries \mathbb{S}^2,\mathbb{E}^2,\mathbb{H}^2, and regenerations of Heisenberg tori into these geometries are completely described.
