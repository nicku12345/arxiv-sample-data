In this note we prove that the Kalton interlaced graphs do not equi-coarsely embed into the James space \mathcal J nor into its dual \mathcal J^*. It is a particular case of a more general result on the non equi-coarse embeddability of the Kalton graphs into quasi-reflexive spaces with a special asymptotic stucture. This allows us to exhibit a coarse invariant for Banach spaces, namely the non equi-coarse embeddability of this family of graphs, which is very close to but different from the celebrated property \mathcal Q of Kalton. We conclude with a remark on the coarse geometry of the James tree space \mathcal J \mathcal T and of its predual.
