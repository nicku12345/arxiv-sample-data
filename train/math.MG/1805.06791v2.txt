Given the pair of vector fields X=\partial_x+|z|^{2m}y\partial_t and  Y=\partial_y-|z|^{2m}x \partial_t, where (x,y,t)= (z,t)\in\mathbb{R}^3=\mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{R}, we give a condition on a bounded domain \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3 which ensures that \Omega is an (\epsilon,\delta)-domain for the Carnot-Carath\'eodory metric. We also analyze the Ahlfors regularity of the natural surface measure induced at the boundary by the vector fields.
