Let the \emph{double hyperbolic space} \mathbb{DH}^n, proposed in this paper as an extension of the hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^n, contain a two-sheeted hyperboloid with \mathbb{H}^n and \mathbb{H}^n_{-} connected to each other by identifying \partial\mathbb{H}^n=\partial\mathbb{H}^n_{-} projectively (but with the geodesics in the lower sheet \mathbb{H}^n_{-} negatively \emph{valued}, and so is the associated volume element of \mathbb{H}^n_{-} if n is odd). We propose to extend the volume of the polytopes in \mathbb{H}^n to polytopes in \mathbb{DH}^n, where the volume is invariant under isometry but can possibly be complex valued. We show that the total volume of \mathbb{DH}^n is equal to i^n V_n(\mathbb{S}^n) for both even and odd dimensions, and prove a Schl\"{a}fli differential formula for \mathbb{DH}^n. For n=2m+1, on top of the conformal structure of \partial\mathbb{H}^{2m+1}, it also induces an intrinsic \emph{volume} on regions in \partial\mathbb{H}^{2m+1} that we call polytopes. This volume on \partial\mathbb{H}^{2m+1} is invariant under M\"{o}bius transformations but is only finitely additive, and we explore a Schl\"{a}fli differential formula for \partial\mathbb{H}^{2m+1} as well. As a dual of \mathbb{DH}^n, an extension of the de Sitter space is proposed, which is compact without boundary and homeomorphic to \mathbb{S}^{n-1}\times\mathbb{S}^1; and it further induces an extension of \mathbb{R}^{n-1,1}, reminiscent of the conformal compactification of spacetime.
