The aim of this article is to study the behaviour of the relative multifractal spectrum under projections. First of all, we depict a relationship between the mutual multifractal spectra of a couple of measures (\mu, \nu) and its orthogonal projections in Euclidean space. As an application, we improve Svetova's result (Tr. Petrozavodsk. Gos. Univ. Ser. Mat., 11 (2004), 41-46) and study the mutual multifractal analysis of the projections of measures.
