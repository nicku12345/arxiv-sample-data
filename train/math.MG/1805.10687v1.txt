In materials science, auxetic behavior refers to lateral widening upon stretching. We investigate the problem of finding domains of auxeticity in global deformation spaces of periodic frameworks. Case studies include planar periodic mechanisms constructed from quadrilaterals with diagonals as periods and other frameworks with two vertex orbits. We relate several geometric and kinematic descriptions.
