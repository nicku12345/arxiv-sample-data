Here is a database of quasicrystal cells computed by the deBruijn Grand Dual Method. The database is in a form that can be converted and read by a variety of geometry programs. Proof of the accuracy of the computations is given by the consistency of the two values of the volumes of the cells. How the deBruijn algorithm works, and the possible use of the algorithm for modeling non-local phenomena is also discussed.
