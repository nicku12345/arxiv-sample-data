We show that for all n \geq 2, there exists a doubling linearly locally contractible metric space X that is topologically a n-sphere such that every weak tangent is isometric to \R^n but X is not quasisymmetrically equivalent to the standard n-sphere. The same example shows that 2-Ahlfors regularity in Theorem 1.1 of \cite{BK02} on quasisymmetric uniformization of metric 2-spheres is optimal.
