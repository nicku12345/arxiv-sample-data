In this paper, the following two theorems are proved: (1) every spherical convex body W of constant width \Delta (W) \geq \frac{\pi}{2} may be covered by a disk of radius \Delta(W) + \arcsin \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \cdot \cos \frac{\Delta(W)}{2}\right) - \frac{\pi}{2}; (2) every reduced spherical convex body R of thickness \Delta(R)<\frac{\pi}{2} may be covered by a disk of radius \arctan \left( \sqrt{2} \cdot \tan \frac{\Delta(R)}{2}\right).
