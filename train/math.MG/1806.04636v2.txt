In this paper, we study the multifractal Hausdorff and packing dimensions of Borel probability measures and study their behaviors under orthogonal projections. In particular, we try through these results to improve the main result of M. Dai in \cite{D} about the multifractal analysis of a measure of multifractal exact dimension.
