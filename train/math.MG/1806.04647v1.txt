In a complete metric space that is equipped with a doubling measure and supports a Poincar\'e inequality, we show that functions of bounded variation (BV functions) can be approximated in the strict sense and pointwise uniformly by special functions of bounded variation, without adding significant jumps. As a main tool, we study the variational 1-capacity and its BV analog.
