We generalize a result of J. C. Kelly to the setting of Ahlfors Q-regular metric measure spaces supporting a 1-Poincar\'e inequality. It is shown that if X and Y are two Ahlfors Q-regular spaces supporting a 1-Poincar\'e inequality and f:X\to Y is a quasiconformal mapping, then the Q/(Q-1)-modulus of the collection of measures \mathcal{H}^{Q-1}\lfloor_{\Sigma E} corresponding to any collection of sets E\subset X of finite perimeter is quasi-preserved by f. We also show that for Q/(Q-1)-modulus almost every \Sigma E, if the image surface \Sigma f(E) does not see the singular set of f as a large set, then f(E) is also of finite perimeter. Even in the standard Euclidean setting our results are more general than that of Kelly, and hence are new even in there.
