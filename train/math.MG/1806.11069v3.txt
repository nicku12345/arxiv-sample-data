A generalization of pairwise intersecting Minkowski arrangement of centrally symmetric convex bodies is the pairwise intersecting Minkowski arrangement of order \mu. Here, the homothetic copies of a centrally symmetric convex body are so that none of their interiors intersect the \mu-kernel of any other. We give general upper and lower bounds on the cardinality of such arrangements, and study two special cases: For d-dimensional translates in classical pairwise intersecting Minkowski arrangement we prove that the sharp upper bound is 3^d. For \mu=1 the general version yields to another known problem: The Bezdek-Pach Conjecture asserts that the maximum number of pairwise touching positive homothetic copies of a convex body in \mathbb{R}^d is 2^d. We verify the conjecture on the plane, that is, when d=2. Indeed, we show that the number in question is four for any planar convex body.
