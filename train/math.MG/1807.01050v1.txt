We use a new coloured multi-graph constructive method to prove that every 2-tree decomposition can be realised in the plane as a bar-joint framework which is minimally rigid (isostatic) with respect to \ell^1 or \ell^\infty distance constraints. We show how to adapt this technique to incorporate symmetry and indicate several related open problems on rigidity, redundant rigidity and forced symmetric rigidity in normed spaces.
