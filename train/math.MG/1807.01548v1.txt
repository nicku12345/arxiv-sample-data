We investigate motions of a bar structure consisting of two congruent tetrahedra, whose vertices in their basic position form the vertices of a rectangular parallelepiped. The constraint of the motion is that the originally intersecting edges should remain coplanar. We determine all finite motions of our bar structure. This generalizes our earlier work, where we did the same for the case that the rectangular parallelepiped was a cube.
