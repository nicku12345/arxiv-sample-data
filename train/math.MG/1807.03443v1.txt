K. Adaricheva and M. Bolat have recently proved that if U_0 and U_1 are circles in a triangle with vertices A_0,A_1,A_2, then there exist j\in \{0,1,2\} and k\in\{0,1\} such that U_{1-k} is included in the convex hull of U_k\cup(\{A_0,A_1, A_2\}\setminus\{A_j\}). One could say disks instead of circles. Here we prove the existence of such a j and k for the more general case where U_0 and U_1 are compact sets in the plane such that U_1 is obtained from U_0 by a positive homothety or by a translation. Also, we give a short survey to show how lattice theoretical antecedents, including a series of papers on planar semimodular lattices by G. Gratzer and E. Knapp, lead to our result.
