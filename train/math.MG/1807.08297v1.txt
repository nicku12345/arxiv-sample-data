We consider a compact hyperbolic antiprism. It is a convex polyhedron with 2n vertices in the hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^3. This polyhedron has a symmetry group S_{2n} generated by a mirror-rotational symmetry of order 2n, i.e. rotation to the angle \pi/n followed by a reflection. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such polyhedra in \mathbb{H}^3. Then we find relations between their dihedral angles and edge lengths in the form of a cosine rule. Finally, we obtain exact integral formulas expressing the volume of a hyperbolic antiprism in terms of the edge lengths.
