We verify the infinitesimal inversive rigidity of almost all triangulated circle polyhedra in the Euclidean plane \mathbb{E}^{2}, as well as the infinitesimal inversive rigidity of tangency circle packings on the 2-sphere \mathbb{S}^{2}. From this the rigidity of almost all triangulated circle polyhedra follows. The proof adapts Gluck's proof in~\cite{gluck75} of the rigidity of almost all Euclidean polyhedra to the setting of circle polyhedra, where inversive distances replace Euclidean distances and M\"obius transformations replace rigid Euclidean motions.
