We initiate a classification of uniform measures in the first Heisenberg group \mathbb H equipped with the Kor\'anyi metric d_H, that represents the first example of a noncommutative stratified group equipped with a homogeneous distance. We prove that 1-uniform measures are proportional to the spherical 1-Hausdorff measure restricted to an affine horizontal line, while 2-uniform measures are proportional to spherical 2-Hausdorff measure restricted to an affine vertical line. It remains an open question whether 3-uniform measures are proportional to the restriction of spherical 3-Hausdorff measure to an affine vertical plane. We establish this conclusion in case the support of the measure is a vertically ruled surface. Along the way, we derive asymptotic formulas for the measures of small extrinsic balls in ({\mathbb H},d_H) intersected with smooth submanifolds. The coefficients in our power series expansions involve intrinsic notions of curvature associated to smooth curves and surfaces in \mathbb H.
