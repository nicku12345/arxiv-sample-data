We consider the sound ranging, or source localization, problem - find the source-point from the moments when the wave-sphere of linearly, with time, increasing radius reaches the sensor-points - in the proper metric spaces (any closed ball is compact) and, in particular, in the finite-dimensional normed spaces. We approximate the solution to arbitrary precision by the iterative process with the stopping criterion.
