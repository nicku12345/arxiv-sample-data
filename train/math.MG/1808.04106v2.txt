Cone spherical metrics are conformal metrics with constant curvature one and finitely many conical singularities on compact Riemann surfaces. A cone spherical metric is called irreducible if each developing map of the metric does not have monodromy lying in {\rm U(1)}. We establish on compact Riemann surfaces of positive genera a correspondence between irreducible cone spherical metrics with cone angles being integral multiples of 2\pi and line subbundles of rank two stable vector bundles. Then we are motivated by it to prove a theorem of Lange-type that there always exists a stable extension of L^* by L, for L being a line bundle of negative degree on each compact Riemann surface of genus greater than one. At last, as an application of these two results, we obtain a new class of irreducible spherical metrics with cone angles being integral multiples of 2\pi on each compact Riemann surface of genus greater than one
