We develop a combinatorial rigidity theory for symmetric bar-joint frameworks in a general finite dimensional normed space. In the case of rotational symmetry, matroidal Maxwell-type sparsity counts are identified for a large class of d-dimensional normed spaces (including all \ell^p spaces with p\not=2). Complete combinatorial characterisations are obtained for half-turn rotation in the \ell^1 and \ell^\infty-plane. As a key tool, a new Henneberg-type inductive construction is developed for the matroidal class of (2,2,0)-gain-tight graphs.
