We discuss the "compactness," or shape analysis, of electoral districts, focusing on some of the most popular definitions in the political science literature, which compare area to perimeter. We identify four problems that are present in these and all contour-based scores of district geometry. To address these issues, we set the stage for {\em discrete} versions of classical shape scores, laying out definitions, goals, and questions for a promising new fusion of combinatorics and discrete geometry with electoral geography.
