Let \mathcal{S} be a set of n points in real four-dimensional space, no four coplanar and spanning the whole space. We prove that if the number of solids incident with exactly four points of \mathcal{S} is less than Kn^3 for some K=o(n^{\frac{1}{7}}) then, for n sufficiently large, all but at most O(K) points of \mathcal{S} are contained in the intersection of five linearly independent quadrics. Conversely, we prove that there are finite subgroups of size n of an elliptic curve which span less than \frac{1}{6}n^3 solids containing exactly four points of \mathcal{S}.
