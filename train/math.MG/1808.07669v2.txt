A metric measure space (X,d,\mu) is said to satisfy the strong annular decay condition if there is a constant C>0 such that  \mu\big(B(x,R)\setminus B(x,r)\big)\leq C\, \frac{R-r}{R}\, \mu (B(x,R))  for each x\in X and all 0<r \leq R. If d_{\infty} is the distance induced by the \infty-norm in \mathbb{R}^N, we construct examples of singular measures \mu on \mathbb{R}^N such that (\mathbb{R}^N, d_{\infty},\mu) satisfies the strong annular decay condition.
