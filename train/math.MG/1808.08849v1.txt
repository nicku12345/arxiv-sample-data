In this paper, we study a class \mathcal{A}(\lambda ,n,m) of self-similar sets with m exact overlaps generated by n similitudes of the same ratio  \lambda . We obtain a necessary condition for a self-similar set in \mathcal{A}(\lambda ,n,m) to be Lipschitz equivalent to a self-similar set satisfying the strong separation condition, i.e., there exists an integer  k\geq 2 such that x^{2k}-mx^{k}+n is reducible, in particular, m belongs to \{a^{i}:a\in \mathbb{N} with i\geq 2\}.
