We study properties of the volume of projections of the n-dimensional   cross-polytope \crosp^n = \{ x \in \R^n \mid |x_1| + \dots + |x_n| \leqslant 1\}. We prove that the projection of \crosp^n onto a k-dimensional coordinate subspace has the maximum possible volume for k=2 and for k=3.   We obtain the exact lower bound on the volume of such a projection onto a two-dimensional plane. Also, we show that there exist local maxima which are not global ones for the volume of a projection of \crosp^n onto a k-dimensional subspace for any n > k \geqslant 2.
