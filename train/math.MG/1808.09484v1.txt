For matrices with all nonnegative entries, the Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees the existence of an eigenvector with all nonnegative components. We show that the existence of such an eigenvector is also guaranteed for a very different class of matrices, namely real symmetric matrices with exactly two eigenvalues. We also prove a partial converse, that among real symmetric matrices with any more than two eigenvalues there exist some having no nonnegative eigenvector.
