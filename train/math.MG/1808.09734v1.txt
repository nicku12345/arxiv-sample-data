The present paper is composed of two parts. In the first one we define two pseudo-metrics L_F and K_F on the Teichmu\"uller space of semi-translation surfaces \mathcal{TQ}_g(\underline k,\epsilon), which are the symmetric counterparts to the metrics defined by William Thurston on \mathcal{T}_g^n. We prove some nice properties of L_F and K_F, most notably that they are complete pseudo-metrics. In the second part we define their asymmetric analogues L_F^a and K_F^a on \mathcal{T Q}_g^{(1)}(k, \epsilon) and prove that their equality depends on two statements regarding 1-Lipschitz maps between polygons. We are able to prove the first statement, but the second one remains a conjecture: nonetheless, we explain why we believe it is true.
