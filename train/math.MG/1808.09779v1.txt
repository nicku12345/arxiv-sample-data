Fix a space dimension d\ge 2, parameters \alpha > -1 and \beta \ge 1, and let \gamma_{d,\alpha, \beta} be the probability measure of an isotropic random vector in \mathbb{R}^d with density proportional to \begin{align*} ||x||^\alpha\, \exp\left(-\frac{\|x\|^\beta}{\beta}\right), \qquad x\in \mathbb{R}^d. \end{align*} By K_\lambda, we denote the Generalized Gamma Polytope arising as the random convex hull of a Poisson point process in \mathbb{R}^d with intensity measure \lambda\gamma_{d,\alpha,\beta}, \lambda>0. We establish that the scaling limit of the boundary of K_\lambda, as \lambda \rightarrow \infty, is given by a universal `festoon' of piecewise parabolic surfaces, independent of \alpha and \beta. Moreover, we state a list of other large scale asymptotic results, including expectation and variance asymptotics, central limit theorems, concentration inequalities, Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund-type strong laws of large numbers, as well as moderate deviation principles for the intrinsic volumes and face numbers of K_\lambda.
