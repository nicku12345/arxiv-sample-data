In Carnot groups of step 2 we consider sets having maximal or minimal possible homogeneous Hausdorff dimension compared to their Euclidean one: in the first case we prove that they must be in a sense vertical, that is a large part of these sets can lie off horizontal planes through their points, and in the latter case close to horizontal. The examples that had been used to prove the sharpness of the sub-Riemannian versus Euclidean dimension comparison intuitively satisfied these geometric properties, which we here quantify and prove to be necessary. We also show the sharpness of our statements with some examples. This paper generalizes the analogue results proved by Mattila and the author in the first Heisenberg group.
