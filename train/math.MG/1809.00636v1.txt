We establish Marstrand-type as well as Besicovich-Federer-type projection theorems for closest-point projections onto hyperplanes in the normed space \mathbb{R}^{n}. In particular, we prove that if a norm on \mathbb{R}^{n} is C^{1,1}-regular, then the analogues of the well-known statements from the Euclidean setting hold. On the other hand, we construct an example of a C^{1}-regular norm in \mathbb{R}^2 for which Marstrand-type theorems fail.
