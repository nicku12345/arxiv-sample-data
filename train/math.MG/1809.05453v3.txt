We improve the best known upper bound on the density of a planar measurable set A containing no two points at unit distance to 0.25442. We use a combination of Fourier analytic and linear programming methods to obtain the result. The estimate is achieved by means of obtaining new linear constraints on the autocorrelation function of A utilizing triple-order correlations in A, a concept that has not been previously studied.
