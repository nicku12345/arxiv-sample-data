A standard result in metric geometry is that every compact geodesic metric space can be approximated arbitrarily well by finite metric graphs in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. It is well known that the first Betti number of the approximating graphs may blow up as the approximation gets finer.   In our work, given a compact geodesic metric space X, we define a sequence (\delta^X_n)_{n \geq 0} of non-negative real numbers by \delta^X_n:=\inf \{d_{\mathrm{GH}}(X,G): G \text{ a finite metric graph, } \beta_1(G)\leq n \} .   By construction, and the above result, this is a non-increasing sequence with limit 0. We study this sequence and its rates of decay with n. We also identify a precise relationship between the sequence and the first Vietoris-Rips persistence barcode of X. Furthermore, we specifically analyze \delta_0^X and find upper and lower bounds based on hyperbolicity and other metric invariants. As a consequence of the tools we develop, our work also provides a Gromov-Hausdorff stability result for the Reeb construction on geodesic metric spaces with respect to the function given by distance to a reference point.
