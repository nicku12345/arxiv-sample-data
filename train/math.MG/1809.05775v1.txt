Let 1\leq i \leq k < n be integers. We prove the following exact inequalities for any convex body K\subset\mathbb{R}^n with centroid at the origin, and any k-dimensional subspace E\subset \mathbb{R}^n: \begin{align*} &V_i \big( K\cap E \big) \geq \left( \frac{i+1}{n+1} \right)^i \max_{x\in K} V_i \big( ( K-x) \cap E \big) , \\ &\widetilde{V}_i \big( K\cap E \big) \geq \left( \frac{i+1}{n+1} \right)^i \max_{x\in K} \widetilde{V}_i \big( ( K-x) \cap E \big) ; \end{align*} V_i is the ith intrinsic volume, and \widetilde{V}_i is the ith dual volume taken within E. Our results are an extension of an inequality of M. Fradelizi, which corresponds to the case i=k. Using the same techniques, we also establish extensions of "Gr\"unbaum's inequality for sections" and "Gr\"unbaum's inequality for projections" to dual volumes.
