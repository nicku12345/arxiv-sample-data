Lutwak's notion of affine quermassintegrals of a convex body quickly became of great importance in convex and affine geometry and more recently, also in asymptotic geometric analysis. In this note we introduce the notion of Orlicz mixed affine quermassintegrals of a convex body as a generalization of the affine quermassintegrals in the framework of the Orlicz-Brunn-Minkowski theory. We prove a Orlicz-Minkowski inequality for the Orlicz mixed and affine quermassintegrals, and an Orlicz-Brunn-Minkowski inequality, which provides of a direct generalization of Lutwak's Brunn-Minkowski inequality for affine quermassintegrals, in Orlicz spaces.
