In [G. Bianchi, R. J. Gardner and P. Gronchi, Symmetrization in Geometry, Adv. Math., vol. 306 (2017), 51-88], a systematic study of symmetrization operators on convex sets and their properties is conducted. In the end of their article, the authors pose several open questions. The primary goal of this manuscript is to study these questions.
