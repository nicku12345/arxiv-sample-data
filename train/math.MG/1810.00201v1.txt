By a Cantor-like measure we mean the unique self-similar probability measure \mu  satisfying \mu =\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}p_{i}\mu \circ S_{i}^{-1} where % S_{i}(x)=\frac{x}{d}+\frac{i}{d}\cdot \frac{d-1}{m-1} for integers 2\leq d<m\le 2d-1 and probabilities p_{i}>0, \sum p_{i}=1. In the uniform case (p_{i}=1/m for all i) we show how one can compute the entropy and Hausdorff dimension to arbitrary precision. In the non-uniform case we find bounds on the entropy.
