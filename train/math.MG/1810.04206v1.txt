A theorem of Moreau (1962) states that given a closed convex cone C and its (negative) polar cone C^\circ in a real Hilbert space H, vectors y \in C and z \in C^\circ are metric projections of a vector u \in H on C and C^\circ, respectively, if and only if they satisfy the following conditions: y and z are orthogonal and u = y + z. We show that these conditions provide characteristic properties of polar cones C and C^\circ in the family of pairs of convex subsets of H or \mathbb{R}^n. A related result on separation of C a face of C^\circ in \mathbb{R}^n is proved.
