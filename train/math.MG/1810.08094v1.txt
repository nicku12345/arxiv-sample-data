A general approach to compute the spherical measure of submanifolds in homogeneous groups is provided. We focus our attention on the homogeneous tangent space, that is a suitable weighted algebraic expansion of the submanifold. This space plays a central role for the existence of blow-ups. Main applications are area-type formulae for new classes of C^1 smooth submanifolds. We also study various classes of distances, showing how their symmetries lead to simpler area and coarea formulas. Finally, we establish the equality between spherical measure and Hausdorff measure on all horizontal submanifolds.
