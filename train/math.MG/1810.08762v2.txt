Let G be a group and let S be a generating set of G. In this article, we introduce a metric d_C on G with respect to S, called the cardinal metric. We then compare geometric structures of (G, d_C) and (G, d_W), where d_W denotes the word metric. In particular, we prove that if S is finite, then (G, d_C) and (G, d_W) are not quasi-isometric in the case when (G, d_W) has infinite diameter and they are bi-Lipschitz equivalent otherwise. We also give an alternative description of cardinal metrics by using Cayley color graphs. It turns out that color-permuting and color-preserving automorphisms of Cayley digraphs are isometries with respect to cardinal metrics.
