We extend to arbitrary finite n the notion of immobilization of a convex body O in R^n by a finite set of points P in the boundary of O. Because of its importance for this problem, necessary and sufficient conditions are found for the immobilization of an n-simplex. A fairly complete geometric description of these conditions is given: as n increases from n = 2, some qualitative difference in the nature of the sets P emerges.
