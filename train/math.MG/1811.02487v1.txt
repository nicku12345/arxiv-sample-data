The intersection L of two different non-opposite hemispheres of the unit sphere S^2 is called a lune. By \Delta (L) we denote the distance of the centers of the semicircles bounding L. By the thickness \Delta (C) of a convex body C \subset S^2 we mean the minimal value of \Delta (L) over all lunes L \supset C. We call a convex body R\subset S^2 reduced provided \Delta (Z) < \Delta (R) for every convex body Z being a proper subset of R. Our aim is to estimate the diameter of R, where \Delta (R) < \frac{\pi}{2}, in terms of its thickness.
