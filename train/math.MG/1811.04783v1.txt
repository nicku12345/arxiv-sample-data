Let E^n denote the (real) n-dimensional Euclidean space. It is not known whether an equilateral set in the \ell_1 sum of E^a and E^b, denoted here as E^a \oplus_1 E^b, has maximum size at least \dim(E^a \oplus_1 E^b) + 1 = a + b + 1 for all pairs of a and b. We show, via some explicit constructions of equilateral sets, that this holds for all a \leqslant 27, as well as some other instances.
