Given a plane triangle \Delta, one can construct a new triangle \Delta' whose vertices are intersections of two cevian triples of \Delta. We extend the family of operators \Delta\mapsto\Delta' by complexifying the defining two cevian parameters and study its rich structure from arithmetic-geometric viewpoints. We also find another useful parametrization of the operator family via finite Fourier analysis and apply it to investigate area-preserving operators on triangles.
