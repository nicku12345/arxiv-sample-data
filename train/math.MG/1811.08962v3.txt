Let H_n be the minimal number of smaller homothetic copies of an n-dimensional convex body required to cover the whole body. Equivalently, H_n can be defined via illumination of the boundary of a convex body by external light sources. The best known upper bound in three-dimensional case is H_3\le 16 and is due to Papadoperakis. We use Papadoperakis' approach to show that H_4\le 96, H_5\le 1091 and H_6\le 15373 which significantly improve the previously known upper bounds on H_n in these dimensions.
