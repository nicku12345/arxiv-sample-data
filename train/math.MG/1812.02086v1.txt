We show that, given a metric space (Y,d) of curvature bounded from above in the sense of Alexandrov, and a positive Radon measure \mu on Y giving finite mass to bounded sets, the resulting metric measure space (Y,d,\mu) is infinitesimally Hilbertian, i.e. the Sobolev space W^{1,2}(Y,d,\mu) is a Hilbert space.   The result is obtained by constructing an isometric embedding of the `abstract and analytical' space of derivations into the `concrete and geometrical' bundle whose fibre at x\in Y is the tangent cone at x of Y. The conclusion then follows from the fact that for every x\in Y such a cone is a CAT(0)-space and, as such, has a Hilbert-like structure.
