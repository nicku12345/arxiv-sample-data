We prove that a graph has an infinitesimally rigid placement in a non-Euclidean normed plane if and only if it contains a (2,2)-tight spanning subgraph. The method uses an inductive construction based on generalised Henneberg moves and the geometric properties of the normed plane. As a key step, rigid placements are constructed for the complete graph K_4 by considering smoothness and strict convexity properties of the unit ball.
