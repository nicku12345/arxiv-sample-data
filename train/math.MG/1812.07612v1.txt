The Heisenberg group \mathbb{H} equipped with a sub-Riemannian metric is one of the most well known examples of a doubling metric space which does not admit a bi-Lipschitz embedding into any Euclidean space. In this paper we investigate which \textit{subsets} of \mathbb{H} bi-Lipschitz embed into Euclidean spaces. We show that there exists a universal constant L>0 such that lines L-bi-Lipschitz embed into \mathbb{R}^3 and planes L-bi-Lipschitz embed into \mathbb{R}^4. Moreover, C^{1,1} 2-manifolds without characteristic points as well as all C^{1,1} 1-manifolds locally L-bi-Lipschitz embed into \mathbb{R}^4 where the constant L is again universal. We also consider several examples of compact surfaces with characteristic points and we prove, for example, that Kor\'{a}nyi spheres bi-Lipschitz embed into \mathbb{R}^4 with a uniform constant. Finally, we show that there exists a compact, porous subset of \mathbb{H} which does not admit a bi-Lipschitz embedding into any Euclidean space.
