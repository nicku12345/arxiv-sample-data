It is proved that a straight projective-metric space has an open set of centers, if and only if it is either the hyperbolic or a Minkowskian geometry. It is also shown that if a straight projective-metric space has some finitely many well-placed centers, then it is either the hyperbolic or a Minkowskian geometry.
