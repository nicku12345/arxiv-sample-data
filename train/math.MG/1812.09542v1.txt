We show that given any six numbers r,s,t,u,v,w \in (0,1] satisfying r \leq s \leq \min(t,u) \leq \max(t,u) \leq v \leq w, it is possible to construct a compact subset of [0,1] with Hausdorff dimension equal to r, lower modified box dimension equal to s, packing dimension equal to t, lower box dimension equal to u, upper box dimension equal to v and Assouad dimension equal to w. Moreover, the set constructed is an r-Hausdorff set and a t-packing set.
