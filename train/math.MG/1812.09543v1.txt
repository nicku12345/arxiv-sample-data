We study the path \Gamma=\{ C_{6,x}\ \vert\ x\in [0,1]\} in the moduli space of configurations of 6 equal cylinders touching the unit sphere. Among the configurations C_{6,x} is the record configuration C_{\mathfrak{m}} of \cite{OS}. We show that C_{\mathfrak{m}} is a local sharp maximum of the distance function, so in particular the configuration C_{\mathfrak{m}} is not only unlockable but rigid. We show that if \frac{(1 + x) (1 + 3 x)}{3} is a rational number but not a square of a rational number, the configuration C_{6,x} has some hidden symmetries, part of which we explain.
