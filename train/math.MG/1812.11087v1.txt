We study fine potential theory and in particular partitions of unity in quasiopen sets in the case p=1. Using these, we develop an analog of the discrete convolution technique in quasiopen (instead of open) sets. We apply this technique to show that every function of bounded variation (BV function) can be approximated in the BV and L^{\infty} norms by BV functions whose jump sets are of finite Hausdorff measure. Our results seem to be new even in Euclidean spaces but we work in a more general complete metric space that is equipped with a doubling measure and supports a Poincar\'e inequality.
