A set \cal P of n points in R^d is separated if all distances of distinct points are at least~1. Then we may ask how many of these distances, with multiplicity, lie in an interval [t, t + 1]. The authors and J. Spencer proved that the maximum is (n^2/2)(1 - 1/d) + O(1). The authors showed that for d = 2 and \cal P separated, the maximal number of distances, with multiplicity, in the union of k unit intervals is (n^2/2) (1 - 1/(k + 1) + o(1)). (In these papers the unit intervals could be replaced by intervals of length \text{const}_d\cdot n^{1/d}.) In this paper we show that for k = 2, and for any n, this maximal number is (n^2/2)(1 - 1/m_{d - 1} + o(1)), where m_{d - 1} is the maximal size of a two-distance set in R^{d - 1}. (The value of m_{d - 1} is known for d - 1 \leq 8, and for each d it lies in \left[\left({d\atop 2}\right), \left({d + 1\atop 2}\right)\right]. For d \neq 4,5 we can replace unit intervals by intervals of length \text{const}_d \cdot n^{1/d}, and the maximum is the respective Tur\'an number, for n \geq n(d).) We also investigate a variant of this question, namely with k intervals of the form [t, t(1 + \varepsilon)], for \varepsilon < \varepsilon (d, k), and for n > n(d, k). Here the maximal number of distances, with multiplicity, in the union of k such intervals is the Tur\'an number T(n, (d + 1)^k + 1). Several of these results were announced earlier by Makai-Pach-Spencer.
