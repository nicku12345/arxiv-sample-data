In this paper, our aim is to obtain new fixed-disc results on metric spaces. To do this, we present a new approach using the set of simulation functions and some known fixed-point techniques. We do not need to have some strong conditions such as completeness or compactness of the metric space or continuity of the self-mapping in our results. Taking only one geometric condition, we ensure the existence of a fixed disc of a new type contractive mapping.
