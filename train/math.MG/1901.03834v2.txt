The aim of this article is to study the behaviour of the multifractal packing function B_\mu(q) under projections in Euclidean space for q>1. We show that B_\mu(q) is preserved under almost every orthogonal projection. As an application, we study the multifractal analysis of the projections of a measure. In particular, we obtain general results for the multifractal analysis of the orthogonal projections on m-dimensional linear subspaces of a measure \mu satisfying the multifractal formalism.
