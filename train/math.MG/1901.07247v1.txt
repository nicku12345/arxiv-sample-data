We state strong Marstrand properties for two related families of fractals in Heisenberg groups \mathcal{H}^d: limit sets of Schottky groups in good position, and attractors of self-similar IFS enjoying the open set condition in the quotient \mathcal{H}^d/Z. For such a fractal X, we show that the dimension of \pi_x X does not depend on x \in \mathcal{H}^d, where \pi_x denotes the radial projection along chains passing through x. This follows from a local entropy averages argument due to Hochman and Shmerkin.
