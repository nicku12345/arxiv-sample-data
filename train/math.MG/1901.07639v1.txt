The class of Cyclotomic Aperiodic Substitution Tilings (CAST) whose vertices are supported by the 2n-th cyclotomic field \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_{2n}\right) is extended to cases with Dense Tile Orientations (DTO). It is shown that every CAST with DTO has an inflation multiplier \eta with irrational argument so that \frac{k\pi}{2n}\neq\arg\left(\eta\right)\notin\mathbb{\pi Q}. The minimal inflation multiplier \eta_{min.irr.} is discussed for n\geqq2. Examples of CASTs with DTO, minimal inflation multiplier \eta_{min.irr.} and individual dihedral symmetry D_{2n} are introduced for n\in\left\{ 2,3,4,5,6,7\right\} . The examples for n\in\left\{ 2,3,4,5,6\right\}  also yield finite local complexity (FLC).
