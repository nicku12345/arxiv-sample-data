 \newcommand{\schs}{\scriptstyle{\mathsf{S}}_1} For all n \ge 1, we give an explicit construction of m \times m matrices A_1,\ldots,A_n with m = 2^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} such that for any d and d \times d matrices A'_1,\ldots,A'_n that satisfy \[ \|A'_i-A'_j\|_{\schs} \,\leq\, \|A_i-A_j\|_{\schs}\,\leq\, (1+\delta) \|A'_i-A'_j\|_{\schs} \] for all i,j\in\{1,\ldots,n\} and small enough \delta = O(n^{-c}), where c> 0 is a universal constant, it must be the case that d \ge 2^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor -1}. This stands in contrast to the metric theory of commutative \ell_p spaces, as it is known that for any p\geq 1, any n points in \ell_p embed exactly in \ell_p^d for d=n(n-1)/2.   Our proof is based on matrices derived from a representation of the Clifford algebra generated by n anti-commuting Hermitian matrices that square to identity, and borrows ideas from the analysis of nonlocal games in quantum information theory.
