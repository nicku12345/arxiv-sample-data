We introduce a modified version of P. Jones's \beta-numbers for Carnot groups which we call stratified \beta-numbers. We show that an analogue of Jones's traveling salesman theorem on 1-rectifiability of sets holds for any Carnot group if we replace previous notions of \beta-numbers in Carnot groups with stratified \beta-numbers. In particular, we can generalize both directions of the traveling salesman theorem giving us a characterization of subsets of Carnot groups that lie on finite length rectifiable curves. Our proof expands upon previous analysis of the Hebisch-Sikora norm for Carnot groups. In particular, we find new estimates on the drift between almost parallel line segments that take advantage of the stratified \beta's and also develop a Taylor expansion technique of the norm.
