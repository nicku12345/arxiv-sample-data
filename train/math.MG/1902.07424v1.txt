M. Gromov introduced the Lipschitz order relation on the set of metric measure spaces and developed a rich theory. In particular, he claimed that an isoperimetric inequality on a non-discrete space is represented by using the Lipschitz order. We relax the definition of the Lipschitz order allowing an additive error to relate with an isoperimetric inequality on a discrete space. As an application, we obtain an isoperimetric inequality on the non-discrete n-dimensional l^1-cube by taking the limits of an isoperimetric inequality of the discrete l^1-cubes.
