Characterizations of pseudoultrametric-preserving functions and semimetric-preserving functions are found. The structural properties of pseudoultrametrics which can be represented as a composition of an ultrametric and ultrametric-pseudoultrametric-preserving function are found. A dual form of Pongsriiam-Termwuttipong characterization of the ultrametric-preserving functions is described. We also introduce a concept of k-separating family of functions and use it to characterize the ultrametric spaces.
