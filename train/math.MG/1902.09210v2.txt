It is well-known that the property of a bar-and-joint framework `to be infinitesimally rigid' is invariant under projective transformations of Eucliean d-space for every d\geqslant 2. It is less known that the property of a bar-and-joint framework `to be globally rigid' is not invariant even under affine transformations of the Euclidean plane. In this note, we prove of the latter statement for Euclidean d-space for every d\geqslant 2.
