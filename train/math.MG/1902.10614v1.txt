The spherical centroid body of a centrally-symmetric convex body in the Euclidean unit sphere is introduced. Two alternative definitions - one geometric, the other probabilistic in nature - are given and shown to lead to the same objects. The geometric approach is then used to establish a number of basic properties of spherical centroid bodies, while the probabilistic approach inspires the proof of a spherical analogue of the classical polar Busemann-Petty centroid inequality.
