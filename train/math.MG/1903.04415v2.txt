In this paper we study intrinsic regular submanifolds of \mathbb{H}^n, of low co-dimension in relation with the regularity of their intrinsic parametrization. We extend some results proved for one co-dimensional \mathbb{H}-regular surfaces, characterizing uniformly intrinsic differentiable functions \phi acting between two complementary subgroups of the Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}^n, with target space horizontal of dimension k, with 1 \leq k \leq n, in terms of the Euclidean regularity of its components with respect to a family of non linear vector fields \nabla^{\phi_j}. Moreover, we show how the area of the intrinsic graph of \phi can be computed through the component of the matrix identifying the intrinsic differential of \phi.
