We present a general formula for the Atiyah-Sutcliffe determinant function, which holds for any integer n \geq 2, as a global factor times a sum of terms, with each term similar to a higher degree cross-ratio. The formula is to our knowledge new.   We also conjecture that the Atiyah-Sutcliffe determinant is a rational linear combination of products of factors of only two simple types, each of them manifestly SO(3)-invariant. This allows us to obtain a conjectural purely angular formula for the determinant for n=4, as an illustration of how our conjecture can be applied.
