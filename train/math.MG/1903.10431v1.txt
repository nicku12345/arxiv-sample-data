An equilateral triangle cannot be dissected into finitely many mutually incongruent equilateral triangles [Tutte 1948]. Therefore Tuza [Tuza 1991] asked for the largest number s=s(n) such that there is a tiling of an equilateral triangle by n equilateral triangles of s(n) different sizes. We solve that problem completely and consider the analogous questions for dissections of convex k-gons into equilateral triangles, k=4,5,6. Moreover, we discuss all these questions for the subclass of tilings such that no two tiles are translates of each other.
