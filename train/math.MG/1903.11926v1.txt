In this paper, we prove the identity \dim_{\textrm H}(F)=d\cdot \dim_{\textrm H}(\alpha^{-1}(F)), where \dim_{\textrm H} denotes Hausdorff dimension, F\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d, and \alpha:[0,1]\to [0,1]^d is a function whose constructive definition is addressed from the viewpoint of the powerful concept of a fractal structure. Such a result stands particularly from some other results stated in a more general setting. Thus, Hausdorff dimension of higher dimensional subsets can be calculated from Hausdorff dimension of 1-dimensional subsets of [0,1]. As a consequence, Hausdorff dimension becomes available to deal with the effective calculation of the fractal dimension in applications by applying a procedure contributed by the authors in previous works. It is also worth pointing out that our results generalize both Skubalska-Rafaj\l{}owicz and Garc\'{\i}a-Mora-Redtwitz theorems.
