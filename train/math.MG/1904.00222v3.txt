We develop a new concept of non-positive curvature for metric spaces, based on intersection patterns of closed balls. In contrast to the synthetic approaches of Alexandrov and Buesemann, our concept also applies to metric spaces that might be discrete. The natural comparison spaces that emerge from our discussion are no longer Euclidean spaces, but rather tripod spaces. These tripod spaces include the hyperconvex spaces which have trivial Cech homology. This suggests a link of our geometrical method to the topological method of persistent homology in topological data analysis. We also investigate the geometry of general tripod spaces.
