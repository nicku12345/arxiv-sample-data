In this note, we give some generalisations of the classical Poincar\'{e} upper half-plane, which is the most popular model of hyperbolic plane geometry. For this, we replace the circular arcs by elliptical arcs with center on the x-axis, and foci on the x-axis or on the lines perpendicular to the x-axis at the center, in the upper half-plane. Thus, we obtain a class of generalized upper half-planes with infinite number of members.   Furthermore we show that every generalized Poincar\'{e} upper half-plane geometry is a neutral geometry satisfying the hyperbolic axiom. That is, it satisfies also all axioms of the Euclidean plane geometry except the parallelism.
