In this paper we address the following question: given a measure \mu on \mathbb{R}^n, does there exists a constant C>0 such that, for any m-dimensional subspace H \subset \mathbb{R}^n and any convex body K \subset \mathbb{R}^n, the following sectional Rogers-Shephard type inequality holds:   \[   \mu((K-K) \cap H) \leq C \sup_{y \in \mathbb{R}^n} \mu(K \cap (H+y))?   \]   We show that this inequality is affirmative in the class of measures with radially decreasing densities with the constant C(n,m) = \binom{n+m}{m}. We also prove marginal inequalities of the Rogers-Shephard type for \left(\frac{1}{s}\right)-concave, 0 \leq s < \infty, and logarithmically concave functions.
