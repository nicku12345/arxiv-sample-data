We estimate the bounds of box-counting dimension of hidden variable fractal interpolation functions (HVFIFs) and hidden variable bivariate fractal interpolation functions (HVBFIFs) with four function contractivity factors and present analytic properties of HVFIFs which are constructed to ensure more flexibility and diversity in modeling natural phenomena. Firstly, we construct the HVFIFs and analyze their smoothness and stability. Secondly, we obtain the lower and upper bounds of box-counting dimension of the HVFIFs. Finally, in the similar way, we get the lower and upper bounds of box-counting dimension of HVBFIFs constructed in [21].
