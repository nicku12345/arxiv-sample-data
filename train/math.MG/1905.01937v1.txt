Let C be a convex body and let S be a nondegenerate simplex in {\mathbb R}^n. Denote by \xi(C;S) the minimal \tau>0 such that C is a subset of the simplex \tau S. By \alpha(C;S) we mean the minimal \tau>0 such that C is contained in a translate of \tau S. Earlier the author has proved the equalities \xi(C;S)=(n+1)\max\limits_{1\leq j\leq n+1} \max\limits_{x\in C}(-\lambda_j(x))+1 \ (if C\not\subset S), \ \alpha(C;S)= \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n+1} \max\limits_{x\in C} (-\lambda_j(x))+1. Here \lambda_j are linear functions called the basic Lagrange polynomials corresponding to S. In his previous papers, the author has investigated these formulae if C=[0,1]^n. The present paper is related to the case when C coincides with the unit Euclidean ball B_n=\{x: \|x\|\leq 1\}, where \|x\|=\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \right)^{1/2}. We establish various relations for \xi(B_n;S) and \alpha(B_n;S), as well as we give their geometric interpretation.
