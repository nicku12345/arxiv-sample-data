We prove a duality relation for the moduli of the family of curves connecting two sets and the family of surfaces separating the sets, in the setting of a complete metric space equipped with a doubling measure and supporting a Poincar\'e inequality. Then we apply this to show that quasiconformal mappings can be characterized by the fact that they quasi-preserve the modulus of certain families of surfaces.
