By B=B(x^{(0)};R) we denote the Euclidean ball in {\mathbb R}^n given by the inequality \|x-x^{(0)}\|\leq R. Here x^{(0)}\in{\mathbb R}^n, R>0, \|x\|:=\left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\right)^{1/2}. We mean by C(B) the space of continuous functions f:B\to{\mathbb R} with the norm \|f\|_{C(B)}:=\max_{x\in B}|f(x)| and by \Pi_1\left({\mathbb R}^n\right) the set of polynomials in n variables of degree \leq 1, i.e., linear functions on {\mathbb R}^n. Let x^{(1)}, \ldots, x^{(n+1)} be the vertices of n-dimensional nondegenerate simplex S\subset B. The interpolation projector   P:C(B)\to \Pi_1({\mathbb R}^n) corresponding to S is defined by the equalities Pf\left(x^{(j)}\right)=f\left(x^{(j)}\right). We obtain the formula to compute the norm of P as an operator from C(B) into C(B) via x^{(0)}, R and coefficients of basic Lagrange polynomials of S. In more details we study the case when S is a regular simplex inscribed into B_n=B(0,1).
