Let B_n be the Euclidean unit ball in {\mathbb R}^n given by the inequality \|x\|\leq 1, \|x\|:=\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}. By C(B_n) we mean the space of continuous functions f:B_n\to{\mathbb R} with the norm \|f\|_{C(B_n)} := \max\limits_{x\in B_n}|f(x)|. The symbol \Pi_1\left({\mathbb R}^n\right) denotes the set of polynomials in n variables of degree \leq 1, i.e., the set of linear functions upon {\mathbb R}^n. Assume x^{(1)}, \ldots, x^{(n+1)} are the vertices of an n-dimensional nondegenerate simplex S\subset B_n. The interpolation projector P:C(B_n)\to \Pi_1({\mathbb R}^n) corresponding to S is defined by the equalities Pf\left(x^{(j)}\right) = f\left(x^{(j)}\right). Denote by \|P\|_{B_n} the norm of P as an operator from C(B_n) onto C(B_n). We describe the approach in which \|P\|_{B_n} can be estimated from below via the volume of S.
