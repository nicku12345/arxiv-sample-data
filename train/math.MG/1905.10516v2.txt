The paper is devoted to coverings by translative homothets and illuminations of convex bodies. For a given positive number \alpha and a convex body B, g_{\alpha}(B) is the infimum of \alpha-powers of finitely many homothety coefficients less than 1 such that there is a covering of B by translative homothets with these coefficients. h_{\alpha}(B) is the minimal number of directions such that B can be illuminated by this number of directions except for the set whose Hausdorff dimension is less than \alpha. In this paper, we prove that g_{\alpha}(B)\leq h_{\alpha}(B), find upper and lower bounds for both numbers, and discuss several general conjectures. In particular, we show that h_{\alpha} (B) > 2^{d-\alpha} for almost all \alpha and d when B is the d-dimensional cube, thus disproving the conjecture from Research Problems in Discrete Geometry by Brass, Moser, and Pach.
