H. Guggenheimer generalized the planar volume product problem for locally convex curves C enclosing the origin k \ge 2 times. He conjectured that the minimal volume product V(C)V(C^*) for these curves is attained if the curve consists of the longest diagonals of a regular (2k+1)-gon, with centre 0, these diagonals taken always in the positive orientation. This conjectured minimum is of the form k^2 + O(k). We investigate special cases of this conjecture. We prove it for locally convex n-gons with 2k+1 \le n \le 4k, if the central angles at 0 of all sides are equal to 2k \pi /n. For 4k+1 \le n we prove that for locally convex n-gons enclosing the origin k \ge 2 times the critical (stationary) values of the volume product V(K)V(K^*) are attained exactly when up to a non-singular linear map the vertices lie on the unit circle about 0, and the central angles of all sides are equal to 2k \pi /n. For locally convex n-gons enclosing the origin k \ge 2 times, and inscribed to the unit circle, with 2k+1 \le n, we prove the conjecture up to a multiplicative factor about 0.43.
