SRA-free spaces is a wide class of metric spaces including finite dimensional Alexandrov spaces of non-negative curvature, complete Berwald spaces of nonnegative flag curvature, Cayley Graphs of virtually abelian groups and doubling metric spaces of non-positive Busemann curvature with extendable geodesics. This class also includes arbitrary big balls in complete, locally compact CAT(k)-spaces (k \in \mathbb R) with locally extendable geodesics, finite-dimensional Alexandrov spaces of curvature \ge k with k \in R and complete Finsler manifolds satisfying the doubling condition.   We show that SRA-free spaces allow bi-Lipschitz embeddings in Euclidean spaces. As a corollary we obtain a quantitative bi-Lipschitz embedding theorem for balls in finite dimensional Alexandrov spaces of curvature bounded from below conjectured by S. Eriksson-Bique.   The main tool of the proof is an extension theorem for bi-Lipschitz maps into Euclidean spaces. This extension theorem is close in nature with the embedding theorem of J. Seo and may be of independent interest.
