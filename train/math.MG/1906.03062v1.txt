We introduce a framework based on the Delsarte-Yudin linear programming approach for improving some universal lower bounds for the minimum energy of spherical codes of prescribed dimension and cardinality, and universal upper bounds on the maximal cardinality of spherical codes of prescribed dimension and minimum separation. Our results can be considered as next level universal bounds as they have the same general nature and imply, as the first level bounds do, necessary and sufficient conditions for their local and global optimality. We explain in detail our approach for deriving second level bounds. While there are numerous cases for which our method applies, we will emphasize the model examples of 24 points (24-cell) and 120 points (600-cell) on \mathbb{S}^3. In particular, we provide a new proof that the 600-cell is universally optimal, and furthermore, we completely characterize the optimal linear programing polynomials of degree at most 17 by finding two new polynomials, which together with the Cohn-Kumar's polynomial form the vertices of the convex hull that consists of all optimal polynomials. Our framework also provides a conceptual explanation of why polynomials of degree 17 are needed to handle the 600-cell via linear programming.
