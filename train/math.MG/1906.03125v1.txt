Federer's characterization states that a set E\subset \mathbb{R}^n is of finite perimeter if and only if \mathcal H^{n-1}(\partial^*E)<\infty. Here the measure-theoretic boundary \partial^*E consists of those points where both E and its complement have positive upper density. We show that the characterization remains true if \partial^*E is replaced by a smaller boundary consisting of those points where the \emph{lower} densities of both E and its complement are at least a given number. This result is new even in Euclidean spaces but we prove it in a more general complete metric space that is equipped with a doubling measure and supports a Poincar\'e inequality.
