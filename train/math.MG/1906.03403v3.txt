We introduce the notion of a smocked metric spaces and explore the balls and geodesics in a collection of different smocked spaces. We find their rescaled Gromov-Hausdorff limits and prove these tangent cones at infinity exist, are unique, and are normed spaces. We close with a variety of open questions suitable for advanced undergraduates, masters students, and doctoral students.
