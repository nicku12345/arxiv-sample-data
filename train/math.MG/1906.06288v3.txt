Let \ell_1,\ell_2,\dots be a countable collection of lines in {\mathbb R}^d. For any t \in [0,1] we construct a compact set \Gamma\subset{\mathbb R}^d with Hausdorff dimension d-1+t which projects injectively into each \ell_i, such that the image of each projection has dimension t. This immediately implies the existence of homeomorphisms between certain Cantor-type sets whose graphs have large dimensions. As an application, we construct a collection E of disjoint, non-parallel k-planes in \mathbb{R}^d, for d \geq k+2, whose union is a small subset of \mathbb{R}^d, either in Hausdorff dimension or Lebesgue measure, while E itself has large dimension. As a second application, for any countable collection of vertical lines w_i in the plane we construct a collection of nonvertical lines H, so that F, the union of lines in H, has positive Lebesgue measure, but each point of each line w_i intersects at most one h\in H and, for each w_i, the Hausdorff dimension of F\cap w_i is zero.
