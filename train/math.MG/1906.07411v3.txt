Let X, Y be sets and let \Phi, \Psi be mappings with the domains X^{2} and Y^{2} respectively. We say that \Phi is combinatorially similar to \Psi if there are bijections f \colon \Phi(X^2) \to \Psi(Y^{2}) and g \colon Y \to X such that \Psi(x, y) = f(\Phi(g(x), g(y))) for all x, y \in Y. It is shown that the semigroups of binary relations generated by sets \{\Phi^{-1}(a) \colon a \in \Phi(X^{2})\} and \{\Psi^{-1}(b) \colon b \in \Psi(Y^{2})\} are isomorphic for combinatorially similar \Phi and \Psi. The necessary and sufficient conditions under which a given mapping is combinatorially similar to a pseudometric, or strongly rigid pseudometric, or discrete pseudometric are found. The algebraic structure of semigroups generated by \{d^{-1}(r) \colon r \in d(X^{2})\} is completely described for nondiscrete, strongly rigid pseudometrics and, also, for discrete pseudometrics d \colon X^{2} \to \mathbb{R}.
