We prove a local version of a recently established theorem by Myroshnychenko, Ryabogin and the second named author. More specifically, we show that if n\geq 3, g:\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\to\mathbb{R} is an even bounded measurable function, U is an open subset of \mathbb{S}^{n-1} and the restriction (section) of f onto any great sphere perpendicular to U is isotropic, then {\cal C}(g)|_U=c+\langle a,\cdot\rangle and {\cal R}(g)|_U=c', for some fixed constants c,c'\in\mathbb{R} and for some fixed vector a\in \mathbb{R}^n. Here, {\cal C}(g) denotes the cosine transform and {\cal R}(g) denotes the Funk transform of g. However, we show that g does not need to be equal to a constant almost everywhere in U^\perp:=\bigcup_{u\in U}(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\cap u^\perp). For the needs of our proofs, we obtain a new generalization of a result from classical differential geometry, in the setting of convex hypersurfaces, that we believe is of independent interest.
