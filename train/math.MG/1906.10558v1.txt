In this paper, we discuss the Higuchi algorithm which serves as a widely used estimator for the box-counting dimension of the graph of a bounded function f : [0,1] \to \R. We formulate the method in a mathematically precise way and show that it yields the correct dimension for a class of non-fractal functions. Furthermore, it will be shown that the algorithm follows a geometrical approach and therefore gives a reasonable estimate of the fractal dimension of a fractal function. We conclude the paper by discussing the robustness of the method and show that it can be highly unstable under perturbations.
