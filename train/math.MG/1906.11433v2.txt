We derive fundamentally new equations that are satisfied by first-order flexes of a flexible polyhedron. Moreover, we indicate two sources of such new equations. These sources are the Dehn invariants and rigidity matrix. The equations derived provide us with fundamentally new necessary conditions for the extendibility of a first-order flex of a polyhedron to its flex.
