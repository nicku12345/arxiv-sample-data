Koszul type Coxeter Simplex tilings exist in hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^n for 2 \leq n \leq 9, and their horoball packings have the highest known regular ball packing densities for 3 \leq n \leq 5. In this paper we determine the optimal horoball packings of Koszul type Coxeter simplex tilings of n-dimensional hyperbolic space for 6 \leq n \leq 9, which give new lower bounds for packing density in each dimension. The symmetries of the packings are given by Coxeter simplex groups.
