In the present paper we investigate the Gromov--Hausdorff distances between a bounded metric space X and so called simplex, i.e., a metric space all whose non-zero distances are the same. In the case when the simplex's cardinality does not exceed the cardinality of X, a new formula for this distance is obtained. The latter permits to derive an exact formula for the distance between a simplex and an ultrametric space.
