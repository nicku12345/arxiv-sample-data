We pursue the investigation of the concept of n-distance, an n-variable version of the classical concept of distance recently introduced and investigated by Kiss, Marichal, and Teheux. We especially focus on the challenging problem of computing the best constant associated with a given n-distance. In particular, we define and investigate the best constants related to partial simplex inequalities. We also introduce and discuss some subclasses of n-distances defined by considering some properties. Finally, we discuss an interesting link between the concepts of n-distance and multidistance.
