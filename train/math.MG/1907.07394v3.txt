We consider Schmidt's game on the space of compact subsets of a given metric space equipped with the Hausdorff metric, and the space of continuous functions equipped with the supremum norm. We are interested in determining the generic behaviour of objects in a metric space, mostly in the context of fractal dimensions, and the notion of `generic' we adopt is that of being winning for Schmidt's game. We find properties whose corresponding sets are winning for Schmidt's game that are starkly different from previously established, and well-known, properties which are generic in other contexts, such as being residual or of full measure.
