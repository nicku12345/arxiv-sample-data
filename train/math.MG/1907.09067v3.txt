Let \kappa be a real number. Gromov (2001) introduced the \mathrm{Cycl}_n (\kappa ) conditions for all integers n\geq 4, each of which is a necessary condition for a metric space to admit an isometric embedding into a \mathrm{CAT}(\kappa ) space. We prove an analogue of Reshetnyak's majorization theorem for (possibly non-geodesic) metric spaces that satisfy the \mathrm{Cycl}_4 (\kappa ) condition. It follows from our result that for general metric spaces, the \mathrm{Cycl}_4 (\kappa ) condition implies the \mathrm{Cycl}_n (\kappa ) conditions for all integers n\geq 5.
