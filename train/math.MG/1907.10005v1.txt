If one has a collection of large scale spaces \{(X_s,\mathcal{LSS}_s)\}_{s\in S} with certain compatibility conditions one may define a large scale space on X=\bigcup\limits_{s\in S}X_s in a way where every function on X is large scale continuous if and only if the function restricted to every X_s is large scale continuous. This large scale structure is called the asymptotic filtered colimit of \{(X_s,\mathcal{LSS}_s)\}_{s\in S}. In this paper, we explore a wide variety of coarse invariants that are preserved between \{(X_s,\mathcal{LSS}_s)\}_{s\in S} and the asymptotic filtered colimit (X,\mathcal{LSS}). These invariants include finite asymptotic dimension, exactness, property A, and being coarsely embeddable into a separable Hilbert space. We also put forth some questions and show some examples of filtered colimits that give an insight into how to construct filtered colimits and what may not be preserved as well.
