A classical theorem of P. McMullen describes all valuations on polytopes that are invariant under translations and weakly continuous, i.e., continuous with respect to parallel displacements of the facets of a polytope. While it is typically not difficult to check that a valuation is weakly continuous, it is not clear how to decide whether it admits a continuous extension to convex bodies. In a special case of McMullen's construction a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the initial data of such an extension is obtained.
