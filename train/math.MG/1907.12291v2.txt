We give a solution to the inverse problem of Moebius geometry on the circle. Namely, we describe a class of Moebius structures on the circle for each of which there is a hyperbolic space such that its boundary at infinity is the circle, and the induced Moebius structure coincides with the given one. That class is not empty and form an open neighborhood of the canonical Moebius structure in an appropriate fine topology.
