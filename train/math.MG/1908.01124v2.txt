We analyze some properties of a class of multiexponential maps appearing naturally in the geometric analysis of Carnot groups. We will see that such maps can be useful in at least two interesting problems. First, in relation to the analysis of some regularity properties of horizontally convex sets. Then, we will show that our multiexponential maps can be used to prove the Pansu differentiability of the subRiemannian distance from a fixed point.
