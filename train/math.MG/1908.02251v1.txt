For any integer n\ge 2, a square can be partitioned into n^2 smaller squares via a checkerboard-type dissection. Does there such a class-preserving grid dissection exist for some other types of quadrilaterals? For instance, is it true that a tangential quadrilateral can be partitioned into n^2 smaller tangential quadrilaterals using an n\times n grid dissection? We prove that the answer is affirmative for every integer n\ge 2.
