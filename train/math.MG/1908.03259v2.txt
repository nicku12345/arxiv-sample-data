Steiner and Schwarz symmetrizations, and their most important relatives, the Minkowski, Minkowski-Blaschke, fiber, inner rotational, and outer rotational symmetrizations, are investigated. The focus is on the convergence of successive symmetrals with respect to a sequence of i-dimensional subspaces of \mathbb{R}^n. Such a sequence is called universal for a family of sets if the successive symmetrals of any set in the family converge to a ball with center at the origin. New universal sequences for the main symmetrizations, for all valid dimensions i of the subspaces, are found by combining two groups of new results. In the first, a theorem of Klain for Steiner symmetrization is extended to Schwarz, Minkowski, Minkowski-Blaschke, and fiber symmetrizations, showing that if a sequence of subspaces is drawn from a finite set {\mathcal{F}} of subspaces, the successive symmetrals of any compact convex set converge to a compact convex set that is symmetric with respect to any subspace in {\mathcal{F}} appearing infinitely often in the sequence. The second group of results provides finite sets {\mathcal{F}} of subspaces such that symmetry with respect to each subspace in {\mathcal{F}} implies full rotational symmetry. It is also proved that for Steiner, Schwarz, and Minkowski symmetrizations, a sequence of i-dimensional subspaces is universal for the class of compact sets if and only if it is universal for the class of compact convex sets, and Klain's theorem is shown to hold for Schwarz symmetrization of compact sets.
