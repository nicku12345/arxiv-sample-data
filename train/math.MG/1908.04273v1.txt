We develop a new definition of fractals which can be considered as an abstraction of the fractals determined through self-similarity. The definition is formulated through imposing conditions which are governed the relation between the subsets of a metric space to build a porous self-similar structure. Examples are provided to confirm that the definition is satisfied by large class of self-similar fractals. The new concepts create new frontiers for fractals and chaos investigations.
