The problem of finding the largest number of points in the unit cross-polytope such that the l_{1}-distance between any two distinct points is at least 2r is investigated for r\in\left(1-\frac{1}{n},1\right] in dimensions \geq2 and for r\in\left(\frac{1}{2},1\right] in dimension 3. For the n-dimensional cross-polytope, 2n points can be placed when r\in\left(1-\frac{1}{n},1\right]. For the three-dimensional cross-polytope, 10 and 12 points can be placed if and only if r\in\left(\frac{3}{5},\frac{2}{3}\right] and r\in\left(\frac{4}{7},\frac{3}{5}\right] respectively, and no more than 14 points can be placed when r\in\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{4}{7}\right]. Also, constructive arrangements of points that attain the upper bounds of 2n, 10, and 12 are provided, as well as 13 points for dimension 3 when r\in\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{6}{11}\right].
