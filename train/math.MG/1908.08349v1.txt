Let X, Y be sets and let \Phi, \Psi be mappings with domains X^{2} and Y^{2} respectively. We say that \Phi and \Psi are combinatorially similar if there are bijections f \colon \Phi(X^2) \to \Psi(Y^{2}) and g \colon Y \to X such that \Psi(x, y) = f(\Phi(g(x), g(y))) for all x, y \in Y. Conditions under which a given mapping is combinatorially similar to an ultrametric or a pseudoultrametric are found. Combinatorial characterizations are also obtained for poset-valued ultrametric distances recently defined by Priess-Crampe and Ribenboim.
