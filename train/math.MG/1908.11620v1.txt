We develop the theory of APD profiles introduced by J. Dydak for \infty-pseudometric spaces. We connect them with transfinite asymptotic dimension defined by T. Radul. We give a characterization of spaces with transfinite asymptotic dimension at most \omega+n for n\in\omega and a sufficient condition for a space to have transfinite asymptotic dimension at most m\cdot \omega+n for m,n\in\omega, using the language of APD profiles.
