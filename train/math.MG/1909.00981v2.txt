We introduce a linear programming framework for obtaining upper bounds for the potential energy of spherical codes of fixed cardinality and minimum distance. Using Hermite interpolation we construct polynomials to derive corresponding bounds. These bounds are universal in the sense that they are valid for all absolutely monotone potential functions and the required interpolation nodes do not depend on the potentials.
