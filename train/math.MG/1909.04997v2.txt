We prove the following Helly-type result. Let \mathcal{C}_1,\dots,\mathcal{C}_{3d} be finite families of convex bodies in \mathbb{R}^d. Assume that for any colorful selection of 2d sets, C_{i_k}\in \mathcal{C}_{i_k} for each 1\leq k\leq 2d with 1\leq i_1<\dots<i_{2d}\leq 3d, the intersection \bigcap\limits_{k=1}^{2d} C_{i_k} is of volume at least 1. Then there is an 1\leq i \leq 3d such that \bigcap\limits_{C\in \mathcal{C}_i} C is of volume at least d^{-O(d^2)}.
