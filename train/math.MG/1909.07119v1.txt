We prove the existence of the curvature measures for a class of \cal U_{\rm WDC} sets, which is a direct generalization of \cal U_{\rm PR} sets studied by Rataj and Z\"ahle. Moreover, we provide a simple characterisation of \cal U_{\rm WDC} sets in \mathbb R^2 and prove that in \mathbb R^2 the class of \cal U_{\rm WDC} sets contains essentially all classes of sets known to admit curvature measures.
