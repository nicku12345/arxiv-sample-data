For a metric space X we study metrics on the two copies of X. We define composition of such metrics and show that the equivalence classes of metrics are a semigroup M(X) Our main result is that M(X) is an inverse semigroup, therefore, one can define the C^*-algebra of this inverse semigroup. We characterize the metrics that are idempotents, find a minimal projection in M(X) and give examples of metric spaces, for which the semigroup M(X) is commutative. We show that if the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces, X and Y, is finite then M(X) and M(Y) are isomorphic. We also describe the class of metrics determined by subsets of X in terms of the closures of the subsets in the Higson corona of X.
