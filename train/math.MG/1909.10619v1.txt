We prove a Carath\'eodory-type extension of BQS homeomorphisms between two domains in proper, locally path-connected metric spaces as homeomorphisms between their prime end closures. We also give a Carath\'eodory-type extension of geometric quasiconformal mappings between two such domains provided the two domains are both Ahlfors Q-regular and support a Q-Poincar\'e inequality when equipped with their respective Mazurkiewicz metrics. We also provide examples to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of prime end closures in this context.
