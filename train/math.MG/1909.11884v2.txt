In this note we introduce the problem of illumination of convex bodies in spherical spaces and solve it for a large subfamily of convex bodies. We derive from it a combinatorial version of the classical illumination problem for convex bodies in Euclidean spaces as well as a solution to that for a large subfamily of convex bodies, which in dimension three leads to special Koebe polyhedra.
