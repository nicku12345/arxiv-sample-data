We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for Lalley-Gatzouras sets to be uniform disconnected. This enable us to find all Lalley-Gatzouras sets which are quasisymmetrically equivalent to the Cantor ternary set. As another application, we also study the limit behavior of the gap sequence of Lalley-Gatzouras sets.
