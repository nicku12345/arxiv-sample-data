We analyze aspects of the behavior of the family of inner parallel bodies of a convex body for the isoperimetric quotient and deficit of arbitrary quermassintegrals. By means of technical boundary properties of the so-called form body of a convex body and similar constructions for inner parallel bodies, we point out an erroneous use of a relation between the latter bodies in two different works. We correct these results, limiting them to convex bodies having a very precise boundary structure.
