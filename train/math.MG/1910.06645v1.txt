In recent work by Alessandro Fonda, a generalization of the parallelogram law in any dimension N\geq 2 was given by considering the ratio of the quadratic mean of the measures of the N-1-dimensional diagonals to the quadratic mean of the measures of the faces of a parallelotope. In this paper, we provide a further generalization considering not only (N-1)-dimensional diagonals and faces, but the k-dimensional ones for every 1\leq k\leq N-1.
