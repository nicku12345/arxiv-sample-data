We find minimal and maximal length of intersections of lines at a fixed distance to the origin with the cross-polytope. We also find maximal volume noncentral sections of the cross-polypote by hyperplanes which are at a fixed large distance to the origin and minimal volume sections by symmetric slabs of a large fixed width. This parallels recent results about noncentral sections of the cube due to Moody, Stone, Zach and Zvavitch.
