The Clifford geometric product of blades (simple multivectors) is related to an angle bivector carrying all data about the relative position of their subspaces. The exponential of this bivector gives a rotor taking one subspace to the other, and its components give Grassmann angles between various subspaces, projection factors (volume contraction factors for orthogonal projections) and Pl\"ucker coordinates. This leads to geometric interpretations for the Clifford product and some of its properties, and to formulas relating other blade products (scalar, outer, contraction, etc., including those of Grassmann algebra) to Grassmann angles.
