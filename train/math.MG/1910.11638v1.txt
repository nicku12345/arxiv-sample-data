Let K be a convex body in \mathbb{R} ^d, with d = 2,3. We determine sharp sufficient conditions for a set E composed of 1, 2, or 3 points of {\rm bd}K, to contain at least one endpoint of a diameter of K (for d=2,3). We extend this also to convex surfaces, with their intrinsic metric. Our conditions are upper bounds on the sum of the complete angles at the points in E. We also show that such criteria do not exist for n\geq 4 points.
