In this paper, we focus on the fixed-circle problem on metric spaces by means of the multivalued mappings. We introduce new multivalued contractions using Wardowski's techniques and obtain new fixed-circle results related to multivalued contractions with some applications to integral type contractions. We verify the validity of our obtained results with illustrative examples.
