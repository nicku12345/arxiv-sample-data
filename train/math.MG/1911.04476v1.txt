The hexagon is the least-perimeter tile in the Euclidean plane for any given area. On hyperbolic surfaces, this "isoperimetric" problem differs for every given area, as solutions do not scale. Cox conjectured that a regular k-gonal tile with 120-degree angles is isoperimetric. For area \pi/3, the regular heptagon has 120-degree angles and therefore tiles many hyperbolic surfaces. For other areas, we show the existence of many tiles but provide no conjectured optima.   On closed hyperbolic surfaces, we verify via a reduction argument using cutting and pasting transformations and convex hulls that the regular 7-gon is the optimal n-gonal tile of area \pi/3 for 3\leq n \leq 10. However, for n>10, it is difficult to rule out non-convex n-gons that tile irregularly.
