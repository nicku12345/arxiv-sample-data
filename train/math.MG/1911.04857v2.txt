We present several applications of the Assouad dimension, and the related quasi-Assouad dimension and Assouad spectrum, to the box and packing dimensions of orthogonal projections of sets. For example, we show that if the (quasi-)Assouad dimension of F \subseteq R^n is no greater than m, then the box and packing dimensions of F are preserved under orthogonal projections onto almost all m-dimensional subspaces. We also show that the threshold m for the (quasi-)Assouad dimension is sharp, and bound the dimension of the exceptional set of projections strictly away from the dimension of the Grassmannian.
