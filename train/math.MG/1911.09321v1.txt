We consider quadrangles of perimeter 2 in the plane with marked directed edge. To such quadrangle Q a two-dimensional plane \Pi\in\mathbb{R}^4 with orthonormal base is corresponded. Orthogonal plane \Pi^\bot defines a plane quadrangle Q^\circ of perimeter 2 and with marked directed edge. This quadrangle is defined uniquely (up to rotation and symmetry). Quadrangles Q and Q^\circ will be called dual to each other. The following properties of duality are proved: a) duality preserves convexity, non convexity and self-intersection; b) duality preserves the length of diagonals; c) the sum of lengths of corresponding edges in Q and Q^\circ is 1.
