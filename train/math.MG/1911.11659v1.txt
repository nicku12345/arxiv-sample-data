Crofton's formula of integral geometry evaluates the total motion invariant measure of the set of k-dimensional planes having nonempty intersection with a given convex body. This note deals with motion invariant measures on sets of pairs of hyperplanes or lines meeting a convex body. Particularly simple results are obtained if, and only if, the given body is of constant width in the first case, and of constant brightness in the second case.
