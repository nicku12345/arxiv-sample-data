We study the structure of higher-order Voronoi cells on a discrete set of sites in \mathbb{R}^n, focussing on the relations between cells of different order, and paying special attention to the ill-posed case when a large number of points lie on a sphere. In particular, we prove that higher order cells of dimension n-1 do not exist, even though high-order Voronoi cells may have empty interior. We also present a number of open questions.
