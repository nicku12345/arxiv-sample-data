The Wills functional \mathcal{W}(K) of a convex body K, defined as the sum of its intrinsic volumes \mathrm{V}_i(K), turns out to have many interesting applications and properties. In this paper we make profit of the fact that it can be represented as the integral of a log-concave function, which, furthermore, is the Asplund product of other two log-concave functions, and obtain new properties of the Wills functional (indeed, we will work in a more general setting). Among others, we get upper bounds for \mathcal{W}(K) in terms of the volume of K, as well as Brunn-Minkowski and Rogers-Shephard type inequalities for this functional. We also show that the cube of edge-length 2 maximizes \mathcal{W}(K) among all 0-symmetric convex bodies in John position, and we reprove the well-known McMullen inequality \mathcal{W}(K)\leq e^{\mathrm{V}_1(K)} using a different approach.
