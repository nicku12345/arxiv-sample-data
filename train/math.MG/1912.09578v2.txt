In this note we show that given two complete geodesic Gromov hyperbolic spaces that are roughly isometric and \varepsilon>0, either the uniformization of both spaces with parameter \varepsilon results in uniform domains, or else neither uniformized space is a uniform domain. The terminology of "uniformization" is from the work of Bonk, Heinonen and Koskela, where it is shown that the uniformization, with parameter \varepsilon>0, of a complete geodesic Gromov hyperbolic space results in a uniform domain provided \varepsilon is small enough.
