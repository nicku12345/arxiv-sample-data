We give a complete and self-contained proof of a folklore theorem which says that in an Alexandrov space the distance between a point \gamma(t) on a geodesic \gamma and a compact set K is a right-differentiable function of t. Moreover, the value of this right-derivative is given by the negative cosine of the minimal angle between the geodesic and any shortest path to the compact set (Theorem 4.3). Our treatment serves as a general introduction to metric geometry and relies only on the basic elements, such as comparison triangles and upper angles.
