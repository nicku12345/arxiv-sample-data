In 1933, Borsuk proposed the following problem: Can every bounded set in \mathbb{E}^n be divided into n+1 subsets of smaller diameters? This problem has been studied by many authors, and a lot of partial results have been discovered. In particular, Kahn and Kalai's counterexamples surprised the mathematical community in 1993. Nevertheless, the problem is still far away from being completely resolved. This paper presents a broad review on related subjects and, based on a novel reformulation, introduces a computer proof program to deal with this well-known problem.
