A parametrization of integral Descartes configurations (and effectively Apollonian disk packings) by pairs of two-dimensional integral vectors is presented. The vectors, called here tangency spinors defined for pairs of tangent disks, are spinors associated to the Clifford algebra for three-dimensional Minkowski space. A version with Pauli spinors is given. The construction provides a novel interpretation to the known Diophantine equation parametrizing integral Apollonian packings.
