We introduce the novel concept of hypercomplex iterated function system (IFS) on the complete metric space (\mathbb{A}_{n+1}^k,d) and define its hypercomplex attractor. Systems of hypercomplex function systems arising from hypercomplex IFSs and their backward trajectories are also introduced and it is shown that the attractors of such backward trajectories possess different local (fractal) shapes.
