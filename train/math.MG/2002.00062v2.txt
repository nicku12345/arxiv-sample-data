We investigate isometric embeddings of finite metric trees into (\mathbb{R}^n,d_{1}) and ( \mathbb{R}^n, d_{\infty}). We prove that a finite metric tree can be isometrically embedded into (\mathbb{R}^n,d_{1}) if and only if the number of its leaves is at most 2n. We show that a finite star tree with at most 2^n leaves can be isometrically embedded into (\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_{\infty}) and a finite metric tree with more than 2^n leaves cannot be isometrically embedded into (\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_{\infty}). We conjecture that an arbitrary finite metric tree with at most 2^n leaves can be isometrically embedded into (\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_{\infty}).
