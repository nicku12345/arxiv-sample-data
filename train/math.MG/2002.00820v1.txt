We estimate the upper and lower bounds of the Hewitt\textbf{-}Stromberg dimensions. In particular, these results give new proofs of theorems on the multifractal formalism which is based on the Hewitt\textbf{-}Stromberg measures and yield results even at points q for which the upper and lower multifractal Hewitt\textbf{-}Stromberg dimension functions differ. Finally, concrete examples of a measure satisfying the above property are developed.
