We establish an area formula for the spherical measure of intrinsically regular submanifolds of low codimension in Heisenberg groups. The spherical measure is computed with respect to an arbitrary homogeneous distance. Among the arguments of the proof, we point out the differentiability properties of intrinsic graphs and a chain rule for intrinsic differentiable functions.
