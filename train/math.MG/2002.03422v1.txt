The present work considers the properties of classes of generally convex sets in the plane known as 1-semiconvex and weakly 1-semiconvex. More specifically, the examples of open and closed weakly 1-semiconvex but non 1-semiconvex sets with smooth boundary in the plane are constructed. It is proved that such sets consist of minimum four connected components. In addition, the example of closed, weakly 1-semiconvex, and non 1-semiconvex set in the plane consisting of three connected components is constructed. It is proved that such a number of components is minimal for any closed, weakly 1-semiconvex, and non 1-semiconvex set in the plane.
