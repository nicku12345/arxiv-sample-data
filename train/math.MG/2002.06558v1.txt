In this paper, it is shown that for any two non-empty closed (resp., open) and spherical convex subsets \mathcal{W}_1, \mathcal{W}_2 of S^n, the intersection \mathcal{W}_1\cap \mathcal{W}_2 is empty if and only if the subset \{P\in S^n\; |\; P\cdot Q>0 \mbox{ for any } Q\in \mathcal{W}_1 \mbox{ and } P\cdot R<0 \mbox{ for any } R\in \mathcal{W}_2\} is non-empty, open (resp., closed) and spherical convex.
