After having investigated the packings derived by horo- and hyperballs related to simple frustum Coxeter orthoscheme tilings we consider the corresponding covering problems (briefly hyp-hor coverings) in n-dimensional hyperbolic spaces \mathbb{H}^n (n=2,3).   We construct in the 2- and 3-dimensional hyperbolic spaces hyp-hor coverings that are generated by simply truncated Coxeter orthocheme tilings and we determine their thinnest covering configurations and their densities.   We prove that in the hyperbolic plane (n=2) the density of the above thinnest hyp-hor covering arbitrarily approximate the universal lower bound of the hypercycle or horocycle covering density \frac{\sqrt{12}}{\pi} and in \mathbb{H}^3 the optimal configuration belongs to the \{7,3,6\} Coxeter tiling with density \approx 1.27297 that is less than the previously known famous horosphere covering density 1.280 due to L.~Fejes T\'oth and K.~B\"or\"oczky.   Moreover, we study the hyp-hor coverings in truncated orthosche\-mes \{p,3,6\} (6< p < 7, ~ p\in \mathbb{R}) whose density function attains its minimum at parameter p\approx 6.45962 with density \approx 1.26885. That means that this locally optimal hyp-hor configuration provide smaller covering density than the former determined \approx 1.27297 but this hyp-hor packing configuration can not be extended to the entirety of hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^3.
