We introduce a affine geometric quantity and call it Orlicz mixed chord integral, which generalize the chord integrals to Orlicz space. Minkoswki and Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for the Orlicz mixed chord integrals are establish. These new inequalities in special cases yield some isoperimetric inequalities for the usual chord integrals. The related concepts and inequalities of Lp-mixed chord integrals are also derived.
