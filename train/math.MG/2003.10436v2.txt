The aim of this paper is to establish a relation between the tangent cone of the medial axis of X at given point a of R^n and the medial axis to the set of points in X realising the d(a, X). As a consequence we obtain the lower bound for the dimension of the medial axis of X in terms of the dimension of the medial axis of m(a) which which appears to be a missing link to the full description of medial axis's dimension.
