It is well known that the point group of the root lattice D_6 admits the icosahedral group as a maximal subgroup. The generators of the icosahedral group H_3, its roots and weights are determined in terms of those of D_6. Platonic and Archimedean solids possessing icosahedral symmetry have been obtained by projections of the sets of lattice vectors of D_6 determined by a pair of integers (m1, m2) in most cases, either both even or both odd. Vertices of the Danzer's ABCK tetrahedra are determined as the fundamental weights of H3 and it is shown that the inflation of the tiles can be obtained as projections of the lattice vectors characterized by the pair of integers which are linear combinations of the integers (m1, m2) with coefficients from Fibonacci sequence. Tiling procedure both for the ABCK tetrahedral tiling and the <ABCK> octahedral tiling in H_3 and the corresponding D_6 spaces are specified by determining the rotations and translation in 3D and the corresponding group elements in D_6. The tetrahedron K constitutes the fundamental region of the icosahedral group and generates the rhombic triacontahedron upon the group action. Properties of the K-polyhedron, B-polyhedron and the C-polyhedron generated by the icosahedral group have been discussed.
