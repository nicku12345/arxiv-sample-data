Supergroups of some hyperbolic space groups are classified as a continuation of our former works. Fundamental domains will be integer parts of truncated tetrahedra belonging to families F1 - F4, for a while, by the notation of E. Moln\'{a}r et al. in 2006. As an application, optimal congruent hyperball packings and coverings to the truncation base planes with their very good densities are computed. This covering density is better than the conjecture of L.~Fejes~T\'oth for balls and horoballs in 1964.
