A closed convex polytope in n dimensions defined by m linear inequality constraints is considered. If L is a straight line drawn in any direction from any feasible point P, then in general, it intersects every constraint at one point, giving m intersections. It is shown that there exists a unique feasible point Q somewhere along this line, such that the sum of 1/di values is 0, where di is the algebraic distance between Q and the intersection with constraint i, measured along the line. The point Q is defined as the harmonic point along the line L. The harmonic center of the polytope is defined as that point which is the harmonic point for all n lines drawn through it, each parallel to one of the coordinate axes. The existence and uniqueness of such a center is shown. The harmonic center can be calculated using the coordinate search algorithm (CS), as illustrated with some simple examples. The harmonic center defined here is a generalization of the BI center defined earlier and is better in several respects. It is shown that the harmonic center of the polytope is also the harmonic point for any line drawn through it in any direction. It is also shown that for any strictly feasible point P, there exists a unique harmonic hyperplane passing through it, such that P is the harmonic point for any line which lies in the harmonic hyperplane and passes through P.
