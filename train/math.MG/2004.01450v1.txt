We consider orthogonal representations \eta_n:S_n \curvearrowright \mathbb{R}^N of the symmetry groups S_n, n\ge 4, with N=n!/8 motivated by symmetries of cross-ratios. For n=5 we find the decomposition of \eta_5 into irreducible components and show that one of the components gives the solution to the equations, which describe M\"obius structures in the class of sub-M\"obius structures. In this sense, the condition defining M\"obius structures is hidden already in symmetries of cross-ratios.
