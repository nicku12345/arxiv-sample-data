We improve a lower bound for the smallest area of convex covers for closed unit curves from 0.0975 to 0.1, which makes it substantially closer to the current best upper bound 0.11023. We did this by considering the minimal area of convex hull of circle, line of length 1/2, and rectangle with side 0.1727 x 0.3273. By using geometric methods and the Box search algorithm, we proved that this area is at least 0.1. We give informal numerical evidence that the obtained lower bound is close to the limit of current techniques, and substantially new idea is required to go significantly beyond 0.10044.
