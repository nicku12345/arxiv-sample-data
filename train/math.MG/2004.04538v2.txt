If C_n(\mathbb{R}^d) denotes the configuration space of n distinct points in \mathbb{R}^d, we construct a sequence of maps (f_m), m \geq 1, where \[f_m: C_n(\mathbb{R}^d) \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\] is real analytic, and has the property that for any \mathbf{x} \in C_n(\mathbb{R}^d) and any m \geq 1, the map f_m(\mathbf{x},-): \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d is a rational map whose image lies in the convex hull of \mathbf{x}. Our Approximation Conjecture is that for any \mathbf{x} \in C_n(\mathbb{R}^d), the image of the sphere S^{d-1} under our map f_m(\mathbf{x},-) is an approximation of the boundary of the convex hull of \mathbf{x}. More precisely, we conjecture that \[ \operatorname{lim}_{m \to \infty} d_H\left(f_m(\mathbf{x},-)(S^{d-1}), \,\partial \operatorname{Conv}(\mathbf{x}) \right) = 0, \] where d_H(-,-) is the Hausdorff distance, \operatorname{Conv}(\mathbf{x}) is the convex hull of \mathbf{x} and \partial is the boundary operator. Computer generated plots will be presented in this work.
