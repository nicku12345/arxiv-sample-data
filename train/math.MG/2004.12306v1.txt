It is well-known that a line can intersect at most 2n-1 cells of the n \times n chessboard. Here we consider the high dimensional version: how many cells of the d-dimensional n\times \ldots \times n box can a hyperplane intersect? We also prove the lattice analogue of the following well-known fact. If K,L are convex bodies in R^d and K\subset L, then the surface area of K is smaller than that of L.
