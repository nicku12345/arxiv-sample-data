The first goal of this article is to provide an statement of the conditions for geometric continuity of order k, referred in the bibliography as beta-constraints, in terms of Riordan matrices. The second one is to see this new formulation in action to solve a theoretical cuestion about uniqueness of analytic solution for a general and classical problem in plane geometry: the F-chordal problem.
