We show that for any n-dimensional lattice \mathcal{L} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, the torus \mathbb{R}^n/\mathcal{L} can be embedded into Hilbert space with O(\sqrt{n\log n}) distortion. This improves the previously best known upper bound of O(n\sqrt{\log n}) shown by Haviv and Regev (APPROX 2010) and approaches the lower bound of \Omega(\sqrt{n}) due to Khot and Naor (FOCS 2005, Math. Annal. 2006).
