A tiling of the unit square is an MTP tiling if the smallest tile can tile all the other tiles. We look at the function f(n)=\max \sum s_i, where s_i is the side length of the ith tile and the sum is taken over all MTP tilings with n tiles. If n=k^2+3, it was conjectured that f(k^2+3)=k+1/k. We show that any tiling that violates the conjecture must consist of at least three tile sizes and has exactly one minimal tile.
