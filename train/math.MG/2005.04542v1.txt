The structure of k-diametral point configurations in Minkowski d-space is shown to be closely related to the properties of k-antipodal point configurations in \mathbb{R}^d. In particular, the maximum size of k-diametral point configurations of Minkowski d-spaces is obtained for given k\geq 2 and d\geq 2 generalizing Petty's results (Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 29: 369-374, 1971) on equilateral sets in Minkowski spaces. Furthermore, bounds are derived for the maximum size of k-diametral point configurations in Euclidean d-space. In the proofs convexity methods are combined with volumetric estimates and combinatorial properties of diameter graphs.
