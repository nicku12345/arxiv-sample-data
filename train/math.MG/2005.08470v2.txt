In this study, the properties of convex pentagons that can generate rotationally symmetric edge-to-edge tilings are discussed. Since the rotationally symmetric tilings are formed by concave octagons that are generated by two convex pentagons connected through a line symmetry, they are considered to be equivalent to rotationally symmetric tilings with concave octagons. In addition, under certain circumstances, tiling-like patterns with a regular polygonal hole at the center can be formed using these convex pentagons.
