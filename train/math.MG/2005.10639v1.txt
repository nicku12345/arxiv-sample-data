In this study, the properties of convex hexagons that can generate rotationally symmetric edge-to-edge tilings are discussed. Since the convex hexagons are equilateral convex parallelohexagons, convex pentagons generated by bisecting the hexagons can form rotationally symmetric non-edge-to-edge tilings. In addition, under certain circumstances, tiling-like patterns with an equilateral convex polygonal hole at the center can be formed using these convex hexagons or pentagons.
