In this study, various rotationally symmetric tilings that can be formed using pentagons that are related to rhombus are discussed. The pentagons can be convex or concave and can be degenerated into a trapezoid. If the pentagons are convex, they belong to the Type 2 family. Since the properties of pentagons correspond to those of rhombuses, the study also explains the correspondence between pentagons and various rhombic tilings.
