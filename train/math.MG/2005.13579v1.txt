For any metric space X, finite subset spaces of X provide a sequence of isometric embeddings X=X(1)\subset X(2)\subset\cdots. The existence of Lipschitz retractions r_n\colon X(n)\to X(n-1) depends on the geometry of X in a subtle way. Such retractions are known to exist when X is an Hadamard space or a finite-dimensional normed space. But even in these cases it was unknown whether the sequence \{r_n\} can be uniformly Lipschitz. We give a negative answer by proving that \operatorname{Lip}(r_n) must grow with n when X is a normed space or an Hadamard space.
