This article focuses on the problem of analytically determining the optimal placement of five points on the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^2 so that the surface area of the convex hull of the points is maximized. It is shown that the optimal polyhedron has a trigonal bipyramidal structure with two vertices placed at the north and south poles and the other three vertices forming an equilateral triangle inscribed in the equator. This result confirms a conjecture of Akkiraju, who conducted a numerical search for the maximizer. As an application to crystallography, the surface area discrepancy is considered as a measure of distortion between an observed coordination polyhedron and an ideal one. The main result yields a formula for the surface area discrepancy of any coordination polyhedron with five vertices.
