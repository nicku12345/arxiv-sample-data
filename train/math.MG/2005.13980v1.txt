Rotationally symmetric tilings by a convex pentagonal tile belonging to both the Type 1 and Type 7 families are introduced. Among them are spiral tilings with two- and four-fold rotational symmetry. Those rotationally symmetric tilings are connected edge-to-edge and have no axis of reflection symmetry.
