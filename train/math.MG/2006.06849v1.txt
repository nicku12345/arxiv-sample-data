This article extends the range of 1-DOF rigid-foldable developable quadrilateral creased papers. In a previous article, we put forward a sufficient and necessary condition for a quadrilateral creased paper to be rigid-foldable, and introduce a special sufficient condition that is convenient for practical use, generating quadrilateral creased paper by stitching basic units. In this article we develop new flat-foldable units and show how these can be used to construct a series of more complex rigid-foldable developable quadrilateral creased papers.
