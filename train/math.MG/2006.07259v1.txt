We show that for any Minkowski centered planar convex compact set C the Harmonic mean of C and -C can be optimally contained in the arithmetic mean of the same sets if and only if the Minkowski asymmetry of C is at most the golden ratio (1+\sqrt{5})/2 \approx 1.618. Moreover, the most asymmetric such set that is (up to a linear transformation) a special pentagon, which we call the golden house.
