We prove the equivalence between the simplicial Orlicz cohomology and the Orlicz-de Rham cohomology in the case of Lie groups. Since the first one is a quasi-isometry invariant for uniformly contractible simplicial complexes with bounded geometry, we obtain the invariance of the second one in the case of contractible Lie groups. We also define the Orlicz cohomology of a Gromov-hyperbolic space relative to a point on its boundary at infinity, for which the same results are true.
