The old Chinese puzzle tangram gives rise to serious mathematical problems when one asks for all tangram figures that satisfy particular geometric properties. All 13 convex tangram figures are known since 1942. They include the only triangular and all six quadrangular tangram figures. The families of all n-gonal tangram figures with n \ge 6 are either infinite or empty. Here we characterize all 53 pentagonal tangram figures, including 51 non-convex pentagons and 31 pentagons whose vertices are not contained in the same orthogonal lattice.
