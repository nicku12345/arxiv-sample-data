Start with Gott (2019)'s envelope polyhedron (Squares-4 around a point): a unit cube missing its top and bottom faces. Stretch by a factor of 2 in the vertical direction so its sides become (2x1 unit) rectangles. This has 8 faces (4 exterior, 4 interior), 8 vertices, and 16 edges. F-E+V = 0, implying a (toroidal) genus = 1. It is isometric to a flat square torus. Like any polyhedron it has zero intrinsic Gaussian curvature on its faces and edges. Since 4 right angled rectangles meet at each vertex, there is no angle deficit and zero Gaussian curvature there as well. All meridian and latitudinal circumferences are equal (4 units long).
