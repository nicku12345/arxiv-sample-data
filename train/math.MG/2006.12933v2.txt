We construct valuations on the space of finite-valued convex functions using integration of differential forms over the differential cycle associated to a convex function. We describe the kernel of this procedure and show that the intersection of this space of smooth valuations with the space of all dually epi-translation invariant valuations on convex functions is dense in the latter. We also show that the same holds true for the space spanned by mixed Hessian valuations. This is a version of McMullen's conjecture for valuations on convex functions.
