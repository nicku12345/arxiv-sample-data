In this paper we define q-spherical surfaces as the surfaces that contain the absolute conic of the Euclidean space as a q-fold curve. Particular attention is paid to the surfaces with singular points of the highest order. Two classes of such surfaces, with one and two n-fold points, are discussed in detail. We study their properties, give their algebraic equations and visualize them with the program {\it Mathematica}.
