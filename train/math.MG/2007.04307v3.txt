We shall prove a convergence result relative to sequences of Minkowski symmetrals of general compact sets. In particular, we investigate the case when this process is induced by sequences of subspaces whose elements belong to a finite family, following the path marked by Klain in [13], and the generalizations in [4] and [2]. We prove an analogue result for Fiber symmetrization of a specific class of compact sets. The idempotency for symmetrization of this family of sets is investigated, leading to a simple generalization of a result from Klartag [14] regarding the approximation of a ball through a finite number of symmetrizations, and generalizing an approximation result in [9]
