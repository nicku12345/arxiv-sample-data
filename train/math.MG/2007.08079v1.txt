Gusakova and Zaporozhets conjectured that ellipsoids in \mathbb R^n are uniquely determined (up to an isometry) by their Steiner polynomials. Petrov and Tarasov confirmed this conjecture in \mathbb R^3. In this paper we solve the dual problem. We show that any ellipsoid in \mathbb{R}^n centered at the origin is uniquely determined (up to an isometry) by its dual Steiner polynomial. To prove this result we reduce it to a problem of moments. As a by-product we give an alternative proof of the result of Petrov and Tarasov.
