We give the sharp lower bound of the volume product of three dimensional convex bodies which are invariant under a discrete subgroup of O(3) in several cases. We also characterize the convex bodies with the minimal volume product in each case. In particular, this provides a new partial result of the non-symmetric version of Mahler's conjecture in the three dimensional case.
