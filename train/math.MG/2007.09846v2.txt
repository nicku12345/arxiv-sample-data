We discuss only domestic affairs of metric spaces, leaving all external applications aside. Topics include universal spaces, injective spaces, Gromov--Hausdorff convergence, and ultralimits. These lectures were used as an introductory part to a course in metric geometry given at Penn State, Spring 2020.
