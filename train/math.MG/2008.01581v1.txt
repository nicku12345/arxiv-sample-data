We generalize the classical notion of packing a set by balls with identical radii to the case where the radii may be different. The largest number of such balls that fit inside the set without overlapping is called its {\em non-uniform packing number}. We show that the non-uniform packing number can be upper-bounded in terms of the {\em average} radius of the balls, resulting in bounds of the familiar classical form.
