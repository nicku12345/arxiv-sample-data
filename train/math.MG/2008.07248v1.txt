Minkowski's classical existence theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the unit sphere of Euclidean space to be the surface area measure of a convex body. The solution is unique up to a translation. We deal with corresponding questions for unbounded convex sets, whose behavior at infinity is determined by a given closed convex cone. We provide an existence theorem and a stability result.
