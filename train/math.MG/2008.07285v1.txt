A convex quadrangular pyramid ABCDE, where ABCD is the base and E -- the apex, is called \emph{strongly flexible}, if it belongs to a continuous family of pairwise non-congruent quadrangular pyramids that have the same lengths of corresponding edges. ABCDE is called \emph{strongly rigid}, if such family does not exist. We prove the strong rigidity of convex quadrangular pyramids and prove that strong rigidity fails in the self-intersecting case. Let L=\{l_1,\ldots,l_8\} be a set of positive numbers, then a \emph{realization} of L is a convex quadrangular pyramid ABCDE such, that |AB|=l_1, |BC|=l_2, |CD|=l_3, |DA|=l_4, |EA|=l_5, |EB|=l_6, |EC|=l_7, |ED|=l_8. We prove that the number of pairwise non-congruent realizations is \leqslant 4 and give an example of a set L with three pairwise non-congruent realizations.
