The notion of the Urysohn d-width measures to what extent a metric space can be approximated by a d-dimensional simplicial complex. We investigate how local Urysohn width bounds on a riemannian manifold affect its global width. We bound the 1-width of a Riemannian manifold in terms of its first homology and the supremal width of its unit balls. Answering a question of Larry Guth, we give examples of n-manifolds of considerable (n-1)-width in which all unit balls have arbitrarily small 1-width. We also give examples of topologically simple manifolds that are locally nearly low-dimensional.
