The classical isoperimetric inequality can be extended to a general normed plane. In the Euclidean plane, the defect in the isoperimetric inequality can be calculated in terms of the signed areas of some singular sets. In this paper we consider normed planes with smooth by parts unit balls and the corresponding class of admissible curves. For such an admissible curve, the singular sets are defined as projections in the subspaces of symmetric and constant width admissible curves. In this context, we obtain some improved isoperimetric inequalities whose equality hold for symmetric or constant width curves.
