Starting from a finite simple graph G, for each eigenvalue \theta of its adjacency matrix one can construct a convex polytope P_G(\theta), the so called \theta-eigenpolytop of G. For some polytopes this technique can be used to reconstruct the polytopes from its edge-graph. Such polytopes (we shall call them spectral) are still badly understood. We give an overview of the literature for eigenpolytopes and spectral polytopes.   We introduce a geometric condition by which to prove that a given polytope is spectral (more exactly, \theta_2-spectral). We apply this criterion to the edge-transitive polytopes. We show that every edge-transitive polytope is \theta_2-spectral, is uniquely determined by this graph, and realizes all its symmetries. We give a complete classification of distance-transitive polytopes.
