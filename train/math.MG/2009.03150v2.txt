Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the infinitesimal rigidity of braced grids in the plane with respect to non-Euclidean norms. Component rectangles of the grid may carry 0, 1 or 2 diagonal braces, and the combinatorial part of the conditions is given in terms of a matroid for the bicoloured bipartite multigraph defined by the braces.
