Horospherical products of two hyperbolic spaces unify the construction of metric spaces such as the Diestel-Leader graphs, the SOL geometry or the treebolic spaces. Given two proper, geodesically complete, Gromov hyperbolic, Busemann spaces H_p and H_q, we study the geometry of their horospherical product \mathcal{H}:=H_p\bowtie H_q through a description of its geodesics. Specifically we introduce a large family of distances on H_p\bowtie H_q. We show that all these distances produce the same large scale geometry. This description allows us to depict the shape of geodesic segments and geodesic lines. The understanding of the geodesics' behaviour leads us to the characterization of the visual boundary of the horospherical products. Our results are based on metric estimates on paths avoiding horospheres in a Gromov hyperbolic space.
