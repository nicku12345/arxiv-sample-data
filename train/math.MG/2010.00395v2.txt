The Minkowski problem in Gaussian probability space is studied in this paper. In addition to providing an existence result on a Gaussian-volume-normalized version of this problem, the main goal of the current work is to provide uniqueness and existence results on the Gaussian Minkowski problem (with no normalization required).
