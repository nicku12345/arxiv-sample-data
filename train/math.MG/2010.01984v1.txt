A new intrinsic metric called t-metric is introduced. Several sharp inequalities between this metric and the most common hyperbolic type metrics are proven for various domains G\subsetneq\mathbb{R}^n. The behaviour of the new metric is also studied under a few examples of conformal and quasiconformal mappings, and the differences between the balls drawn with all the metrics considered are compared by both graphical and analytical means.
