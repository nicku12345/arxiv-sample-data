Let d\ge 2 and let K and L be two convex bodies in {\mathbb R^d}. We say that K and L satisfy the (d+1)-equichordal property if L\subset \textrm{int}\,K, the boundary of L does not contain a segment, and for any line \ell supporting the boundary of L and for two points \{\zeta_{\pm}\} of an intersection of the boundary of K with \ell one has  \textrm{dist}^{d+1}(L\cap \ell, \zeta_+)+\textrm{dist}^{d+1}(L\cap \ell, \zeta_-)=c,  where a constant c is independent of \ell. It was shown in \cite{R} that if d\ge 3 and a smooth K is such that its Dupin floating body coincides with the B\'ar\'any-Larman-Sch\"utt-Werner convex floating body K_{\delta}, 0<\delta<\textrm{vol}_d(K), then K floats in equilibrium in every direction, provided K and K_{\delta} satisfy the (d+1)-equichordal property. We prove that if K and L have C^3-smooth boundaries and L is a body of revolution around an axis l such that L\cap l is symmetric with respect to the origin, then K and L are concentric Euclidean balls.
