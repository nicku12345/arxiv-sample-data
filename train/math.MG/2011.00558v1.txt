In the paper, we prove that in an arbitrary Delone set X in 3D space, the subset X_6 of all points from X at which local groups have axes of the order not greater than 6 is also a Delone set. Here, under the local group at point x\in X is meant the symmetry group S_x(2R) of the cluster C_x(2R) of x with radius 2R, where R (according to Delone's theory of the 'empty sphere') is the radius of the largest 'empty' ball, that is, the largest ball free of points of X.   The main result seems to be the first rigorously proved statement on absolutely generic Delone sets which implies substantial statements for Delone sets with strong crystallographic restrictions. For instance, an important observation of Shtogrin on the boundedness of local groups in Delone sets with equivalent 2R-clusters immediately follows from the main theorem.   In the paper, the 'crystalline kernel conjecture' (Conjecture 1) and its two weaker versions (Conjectures 2 and 3) are suggested. According to Conjecture 1, in a quite arbitrary Delone set, points with locally crystallographic axes (of order 2,3,4, or 6) only inevitably constitute an essential part of the set. These conjectures significantly generalize the famous statement of Crystallography on the impossibility of (global) 5-fold symmetry in a 3D lattice.
