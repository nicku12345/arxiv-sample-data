The point pair function p_G defined in a domain G\subsetneq\mathbb{R}^n is shown to be a quasi-metric and its other properties are studied. For a convex domain G\subsetneq\mathbb{R}^n, a new intrinsic quasi-metric called the function w_G is introduced. Several sharp results are established for these two quasi-metrics, and their connection to the triangular ratio metric is studied.
