Given a compact connected set E in the unit disk \mathbb{B}^2, we give a new upper bound for the conformal capacity of the condenser (\mathbb{B}^2, E)\, in terms of the hyperbolic diameter t of E. Moreover, for t>0 we construct a set of diameter t and show by numerical computation that it has larger capacity than a hyperbolic disk with the same diameter. The set we construct is of constant hyperbolic width equal to t, the so called hyperbolic Reuleaux triangle.
