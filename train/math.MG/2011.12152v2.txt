In this article we provide a definition of the concept of angle space. Unlike previous works on this topic, we do it for sets with a notion of betweenness that are not necessarily metric spaces. After this, we solve two problems proposed by K. Menger in the Annals of Mathematics in 1931. The first one consists in characterizing angle spaces that can be embedded in the euclidean plane \mathbb E^2. We answer this question in a general way characterizing those that can be embedded in \mathbb E^n. And the second one concerns a characterization of those angle spaces admitting a distance function compatible with the angle space structure.
