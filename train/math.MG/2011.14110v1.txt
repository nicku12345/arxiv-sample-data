Following the train of thought from our previous paper we revisit the theorems of Pongsriiam and Termwuttipong by further developing their characterization of certain property-preserving functions using the so-called triangle triplets. We develop more general analogues of disjoint sum lemmas for broader classes of metric-type spaces and we apply these to extend results of Bors\`ik an Dobo\v{s} as well as those obtained by Khemaratchatakumthorn and Pongsriiam. As a byproduct we obtain methods of generating non-trivial and infinite strong b-metric spaces which are not metric.
