In the present paper we study \SXR and \HXR geometries, which are homogeneous Thurston 3-geometries. We define and determine the generalized Apollonius surfaces and with them define the "surface of a geodesic triangle". Using the above Apollonius surfaces we develop a procedure to determine the centre and the radius of the circumscribed geodesic sphere of an arbitrary \SXR and \HXR tetrahedron. Moreover, we generalize the famous Menelaus' and Ceva's theorems for geodesic triangles in both spaces. In our work we will use the projective model of \SXR and \HXR geometries described by E. Moln\'ar in \cite{M97}.
