In this pape, which is a sequel to my paper "An improved lower bound for the optimal paper Moebius band", we geometric estimates for immersed paper Moebius bands having an additional geometric feature called a T pattern. These results, in particular, give bounds on the geometry of embedded paper Moebius bands of sufficiently small aspect ratio.
