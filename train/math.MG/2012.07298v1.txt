We introduce the notion of coarse metric. Every coarse metric induces a coarse structure on the underlying set. Conversely, we observe that all coarse spaces come from a particular type of coarse metric in a unique way. In the case when the coarse structure \mathcal{E} on a set X is defined by a coarse metric that takes values in a meet-complete totally ordered set, we define the associated Hausdorff coarse metric on the set \mathcal{P}_0(X) of non-empty subsets of X and show that it induces the Hausdorff coarse structure on \mathcal{P}_0(X).   On the other hand, we define the notion of pseudo uniform metric. Each pseudo uniform metric induces a uniform structure on the underlying space. In the reverse direction, we show that a uniform structure \mathcal{U} on a set X is induced by a map d from X\times X to a partially ordered set (with no requirement on d) if and only if \mathcal{U} admits a base \mathcal{B} such that \mathcal{B}\cup \{\bigcap \mathcal{U}\} is closed under arbitrary intersections. In this case, \mathcal{U} is actually defined by a pseudo uniform metric. We also show that a uniform structures \mathcal{U} comes from a pseudo uniform metric that takes values in a totally ordered set if and only if \mathcal{U} admits a totally ordered base.   Finally, a valuation ring will produce an example of a coarse and pseudo uniform metric that take values in a totally ordered set.
