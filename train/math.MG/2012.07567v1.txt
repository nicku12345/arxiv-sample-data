For an r-tuple (\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_r) of special orthogonal d\times d matrices, we say the Euclidean (d-1)-dimensional sphere S^{d-1} is (\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_r)-divisible if there is a subset A\subseteq S^{d-1} such that its translations by the rotations \gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_r partition the sphere. Motivated by some old open questions of Mycielski and Wagon, we investigate the version of this notion where the set A has to be measurable with respect to the spherical measure. Our main result shows that measurable divisibility is impossible for a "generic" (in various meanings) r-tuple of rotations. This is in stark contrast to the recent result of Conley, Marks and Unger which implies that, for every "generic" r-tuple, divisibility is possible with parts that have the property of Baire.
