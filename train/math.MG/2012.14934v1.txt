We prove that if a convex set in Cn contains two inscribed complex ellipsoid of maximal volume then one is a translate of the other. On the other hand, the circumscribed complex elipsoid of minimal volume is unique. As application we prove the complex analoge of Brunn's characterization of ellipsods.
