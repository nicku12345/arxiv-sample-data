Let M be the space of triangles, defined up to shifts, rotations and dilations. We define two maps f:M\to M and g:M\to M. The map f corresponds to a triangle of perimeter \pi the triangle with angles numerically equal to edges of the initial triangle. The map g corresponds to a triangle of perimeter 2\pi the triangle with \emph{exterior} angles numerically equal to edges of the initial triangle. For p\in M the sequence \{p,f(p),f(f(p)),\ldots\} converges to the equilateral triangle and the sequence \{p,g(p),g(g(p)),\ldots\} converges to the "degenerate triangle" with angles (0,0,\pi). In Supplement an analogous problem about inscribed-circumscribed quadrangles is discussed.
