We establish a sharp reciprocity inequality for modulus in compact metric spaces X with finite Hausdorff measure. In particular, when X is also homeomorphic to a planar rectangle, our result answers a question of K. Rajala and M. Romney. More specifically, we obtain a sharp inequality between the modulus of the family of curves connecting two disjoint continua E and F in X and the modulus of the family of surfaces of finite Hausdorff measure that separate E and F. The paper also develops approximation techniques, which may be of independent interest.
