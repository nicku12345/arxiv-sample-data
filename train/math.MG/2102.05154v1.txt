In this research-expository paper we recall the basic results of reduction theory of positive definite quadratic forms. Using the result of Ryskov on admissible centerings and the result of Tammela about the determination of a Minkowski-reduced form, we prove that the absolute values of coordinates of a minimum vector in a six-dimensional Minkowski-reduced basis are less or equal to three. To get this little sharpening of the result which can be deduced automatically from Tammela's works we combine some elementary geometric reasonings with the mentioned theoretical results.
