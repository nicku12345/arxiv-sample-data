First described in 2014, Roli's cube \mathcal{R} is a chiral 4-polytope, faithfully realized in Euclidean 4-space (a situation earlier thought to be impossible). Here we describe \mathcal{R} in a new way, determine its minimal regular cover, and reveal connections to the M\"{o}bius-Kantor configuration.
