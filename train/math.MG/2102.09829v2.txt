We prove a quantitative version of the classical Tits' alternative for discrete groups acting on packed Gromov-hyperbolic spaces supporting a convex geodesic bicombing. Some geometric consequences, as uniform estimates on systole, diastole, algebraic entropy and critical exponent of the groups, will be presented. Finally we will study the behaviour of these group actions under limits, providing new examples of compact classes of metric spaces.
