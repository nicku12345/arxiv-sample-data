In this paper, we show that the C^1-differentiability of the norm of a two-dimensional normed space depends only on distances between points of the unit sphere in two different ways.   As a consequence, we see that any isometry between the spheres of normed planes \tau:S_X\to S_Y is linear, provided that there exist linearly independent x,\overline{x}\in S_X where S_X is not differentiable and that S_X is piecewise differentiable.   We end this work by showing that the isometry \tau:C_X\to C_Y is linear even if it is not an isometry between spheres: every isometry between (planar) Jordan piecewise C^1-differentiable convex curves extends to X whenever X and Y are strictly convex and the amount of non-differentiability points of S_X and S_Y is finite and greater than 2.
