The aim of this note is to investigate isoperimetric-type problems for 3-dimensional parallelohedra; that is, for convex polyhedra whose translates tile the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Our main result states that among 3-dimensional parallelohedra with unit volume the one with minimal mean width is the regular truncated octahedron. In addition, we establish a connection between the edge lengths of 3-dimensional parallelohedra and the edge densities of the translative mosaics generated by them, and use our method to prove that among translative, convex mosaics generated by a parallelohedron with a given volume, the one with minimal edge density is the face-to-face mosaic generated by cubes.
