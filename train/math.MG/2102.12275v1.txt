Let K be a compact convex body in \mathbb R^n. For any affine line L, denote \widehat{\chi}_K(L)=\int_{L}\chi_K(x)dl(x), where dl is the arc length measure, the X-ray transform of the characteristic function \chi_K, i.e., the length of the chord K \cap L. We prove that if K is bounded by a C^{\infty} real algebraic hypersurface \partial K and the X-ray transform \widehat{\chi}_K(L) behaves, under small parallel translations of the line L to the distance t, as the m-th root of a polynomial of t, for some fixed m \in \mathbb N, then \partial K is an ellipsoid.
