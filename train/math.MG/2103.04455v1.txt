In Guo and Peng's article [Spherically convex sets and spherically convex functions, J. Convex Anal. 28 (2021), 103--122], one defines the notions of spherical convex sets and functions on "general curved surfaces" in \mathbb{R}^{n} (n\ge2), one studies several properties of these classes of sets and functions, and one establishes analogues of Radon, Helly, Carath\'eodory and Minkowski theorems for spherical convex sets, as well as some properties of spherical convex functions which are analogous to those of usual convex functions. In obtaining such results, the authors use an analytic approach based on their definitions. Our aim in this note is to provide simpler proofs for the results on spherical convex sets; our proofs are based on some characterizations/representations of spherical convex sets by usual convex sets in \mathbb{R}^{n}.
