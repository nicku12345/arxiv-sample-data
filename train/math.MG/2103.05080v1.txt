We revisit the main results from \cites{BGN_SoCG14,BGN_SIAM15} and \cite{LafforgueNaor14_GD} about the impossibility of dimension reduction for doubling subsets of \ell_q for q>2. We provide an alternative elementary proof of this impossibility result that combines the simplicity of the construction in \cites{BGN_SoCG14,BGN_SIAM15} with the generality of the approach in \cite{LafforgueNaor14_GD} (except for L_1 targets). One advantage of this different approach is that it can be naturally generalized to obtain embeddability obstructions into non-positively curved spaces or asymptotically uniformly convex Banach spaces.
