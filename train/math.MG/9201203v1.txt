It is proved that if u_1,\ldots, u_n are vectors in {\Bbb R}^k, k\le n, 1 \le p < \infty and   r = ({1\over k} \sum ^n_1 |u_i|^p)^{1\over p}   then the volume of the symmetric convex body whose boundary functionals are \pm u_1,\ldots, \pm u_n, is bounded from below as   |\{ x\in {\Bbb R}^k\colon \ |\langle x,u_i\rangle | \le 1 \ \hbox{for every} \ i\}|^{1\over k} \ge {1\over \sqrt{\rho}r}.   An application to number theory is stated.
