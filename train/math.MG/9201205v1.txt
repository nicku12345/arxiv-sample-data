It is shown that if C is an n-dimensional convex body then there is an affine image \widetilde C of C for which   {|\partial \widetilde C|\over |\widetilde C|^{n-1\over n}}   is no larger than the corresponding expression for a regular n-dimensional ``tetrahedron''. It is also shown that among n-dimensional subspaces of L_p (for each p\in [1,\infty]), \ell^n_p has maximal volume ratio.\vskip3in
