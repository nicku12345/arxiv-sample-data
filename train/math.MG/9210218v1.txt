We describe a characterization of convex polyhedra in \h^3 in terms of their dihedral angles, developed by Rivin. We also describe some geometric and combinatorial consequences of that theory. One of these consequences is a combinatorial characterization of convex polyhedra in \E^3 all of whose vertices lie on the unit sphere. That resolves a problem posed by Jakob Steiner in 1832.
