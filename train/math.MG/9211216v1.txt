Let K be an n-dimensional symmetric convex body with n \ge 4 and let K\dual be its polar body. We present an elementary proof of the fact that (\Vol K)(\Vol K\dual)\ge \frac{b_n^2}{(\log_2 n)^n}, where b_n is the volume of the Euclidean ball of radius 1. The inequality is asymptotically weaker than the estimate of Bourgain and Milman, which replaces the \log_2 n by a constant. However, there is no known elementary proof of the Bourgain-Milman theorem.
