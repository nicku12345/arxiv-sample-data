Let K be a convex body in R^d. A random polytope is the convex hull [x_1,...,x_n] of finitely many points chosen at random in K. \Bbb E(K,n) is the expectation of the volume of a random polytope of n randomly chosen points. I. B\'ar\'any showed that we have for convex bodies with C^3 boundary and everywhere positive curvature    c(d)\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac {vol_d(K)-\Bbb E(K,n)}{(\frac{vol_d(K)}{n})^{\frac{2}{d+1}}} =\int_{\partial K} \kappa(x)^{\frac{1}{d+1}}d\mu(x)    where \kappa(x) denotes the Gau\ss-Kronecker curvature. We show that the same formula holds for all convex bodies if \kappa(x) denotes the generalized Gau\ss-Kronecker curvature.
