Let \| \cdot \| be the euclidean norm on {\bf R}^n and \gamma_n the (standard) Gaussian measure on {\bf R}^n with density (2 \pi )^{-n/2} e^{- \| x\|^2 /2}. Let \vartheta ( \simeq 1.3489795) be defined by \gamma_1 ([ - \vartheta /2, \vartheta /2]) = 1/2 and let L be a lattice in {\bf R}^n generated by vectors of norm \leq \vartheta. Then, for any closed convex set V in {\bf R}^n with \gamma_n (V) \geq \frac{1}{2} and for any a \in {\bf R}^n, (a +L) \cap V \neq \phi. The above statement can be viewed as a ``nonsymmetric'' version of Minkowski Theorem.
