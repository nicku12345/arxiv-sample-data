We give a construction of a self-similar tiling of the plane with any prescribed expansion coefficient \lambda\in\C (satisfying the necessary algebraic condition of being a complex Perron number).   For any integer m>1 we show that there exists a self-similar tiling with 2\pi/m-rotational symmetry group and expansion \lambda if and only if either \lambda or \lambda e^{2\pi i/m} is a complex Perron number for which e^{2\pi i/m} is in \Q[\lambda], respectively Q[\lambda e^{2\pi i/m}].
