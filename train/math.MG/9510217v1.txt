Let P\subset\R^d be a d-dimensional polytope. The {\em realization space} of~P is the space of all polytopes P'\subset\R^d that are combinatorially equivalent to~P, modulo affine transformations. We report on work by the first author, which shows that realization spaces of \mbox{4-dimensional} polytopes can be ``arbitrarily bad'': namely, for every primary semialgebraic set~V defined over~\Z, there is a 4-polytope P(V) whose realization space is ``stably equivalent'' to~V. This implies that the realization space of a 4-polytope can have the homotopy type of an arbitrary finite simplicial complex, and that all algebraic numbers are needed to realize all 4- polytopes. The proof is constructive. These results sharply contrast the 3-dimensional case, where realization spaces are contractible and all polytopes are realizable with integral coordinates (Steinitz's Theorem). No similar universality result was previously known in any fixed dimension.
