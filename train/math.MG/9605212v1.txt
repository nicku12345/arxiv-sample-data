We say that an even continuous function H on the unit sphere \Omega in R^n admits the Blaschke-Levy representation with q>0 if there exists an even function b\in L_1(\Omega) so that H^q(x)=\int_\Omega |(x,\xi)|^q b(\xi)\ d\xi for every x\in \Omega. This representation has numerous applications in convex geometry, probability and Banach space theory. In this paper, we present a simple formula (in terms of the derivatives of H) for calculating b out of H. We use this formula to give a sufficient condition for isometric embedding of a space into L_p which contributes to the 1937 P.Levy's problem and to the study of zonoids. Another application gives a Fourier transform formula for the volume of (n-1)-dimensional central sections of star bodies in R^n. We apply this formula to find the minimal and maximal volume of central sections of the unit balls of the spaces \ell_p^n with 0<p<2.
