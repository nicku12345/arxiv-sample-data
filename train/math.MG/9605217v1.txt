We introduce the mixed convolution bodies of two convex symmetric bodies. We prove that if the boundary of a body K is smooth enough then as \delta tends to 1 the \delta--M^*--convolution body of K with itself tends to a multiple of the Euclidean ball after proper normalization. On the other hand we show that the \delta--M^*--convolution body of the n--dimensional cube is homothetic to the unit ball of \ell_1^n.
