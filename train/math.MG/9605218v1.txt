Let K be a symmetric convex body in {\mathbf R}^n. It is well-known that for every \theta\in (0,1) there exists a subspace F of {\mathbf R}^n with {\rm dim}F= [(1-\theta )n] such that {\mathcal P}_F(K)\supseteq \frac{c\sqrt{\theta }} {M_K}D_n\cap F,\leqno (\ast ) where {\mathcal P}_F denotes the orthogonal projection onto F. Consider a fixed coordinate system in {\mathbf R}^n. We study the question whether an analogue of (\ast ) can be obtained when one is restricted to choose F among the coordinate subspaces {\mathbf R}^{\sigma },\; \sigma\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n\}, with |\sigma |=[(1-\theta )n]. We prove several ``coordinate versions" of (\ast ) in terms of the cotype-2 constant, of the volume ratio and other parameters of K. The basic source of our estimates is an exact coordinate analogue of (\ast ) in the ellipsoidal case. Applications to the computation of the number of lattice points inside a convex body are considered throughout the paper.
