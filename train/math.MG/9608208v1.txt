Let y be a random vector in \rn, satisfying  \Bbb E \, \tens{y} = id.  Let M be a natural number and let y_1 \etc y_M be independent copies of y. We prove that for some absolute constant C  \enor{\frac{1}{M} \sum_i \tens{y_i} - id} \le C \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\log M}}{\sqrt{M}} \cdot \left ( \enor{y}^{\log M} \right )^{1/ \log M},  provided that the last expression is smaller than 1.   We apply this estimate to obtain a new proof of a result of Bourgain concerning the number of random points needed to bring a convex body into a nearly isotropic position.
