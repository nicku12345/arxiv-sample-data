Let K be a convex body in \Bbb R^{d} and K_{t} its floating bodies. There is a polytope with at most n vertices that satisfies  K_{t} \subset P_{n} \subset K  where  n \leq e^{16d} \frac{vol_{d}(K \setminus K_{t})}{t\ vol_{d}(B_{2}^{d})}  Let K^{t} be the illumination bodies of K and Q_{n} a polytope that contains K and has at most n d-1-dimensional faces. Then  vol_{d}(K^{t} \setminus K) \leq cd^{4} vol_{d}(Q_{n} \setminus K)  where  n \leq \frac{c}{dt} \ vol_{d}(K^{t} \setminus K)
