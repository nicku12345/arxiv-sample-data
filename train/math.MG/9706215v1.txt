Let K be a convex body in {\bf R}^n and B be the Euclidean unit ball in {\bf R}^n. We show that \mbox{lim}_{t\rightarrow 0} \frac{|K| -|K_t|}{|B| - |B_t|}= \frac{as(K)}{as(B)}, where as(K) respectively as(B) is the affine surface area of K respectively B and \{K_t\}_{t\geq 0}, \{B_t\}_{t\geq 0} are general families of convex bodies constructed from K, B satifying certain conditions. As a corollary we get results obtained in [M-W], [Schm],[S-W] and[W].
