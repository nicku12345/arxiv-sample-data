A real valued function f defined on a convex K is anemconvex function iff it satisfies  f((x+y)/2) \le (f(x)+f(y))/2 + 1.  A thorough study of approximately convex functions is made. The principal results are a sharp universal upper bound for lower semi-continuous approximately convex functions that vanish on the vertices of a simplex and an explicit description of the unique largest bounded approximately convex function~E vanishing on the vertices of a simplex.   A set A in a normed space is an approximately convex set iff for all a,b\in A the distance of the midpoint (a+b)/2 to A is \le 1. The bounds on approximately convex functions are used to show that in \R^n with the Euclidean norm, for any approximately convex set A, any point z of the convex hull of A is at a distance of at most [\log_2(n-1)]+1+(n-1)/2^{[\log_2(n-1)]} from A. Examples are given to show this is the sharp bound. Bounds for general norms on R^n are also given.
