We describe decomposition formulas for rotations of R^3 and R^4 that have special properties with respect to stereographic projection. We use the lower dimensional decomposition to analyze stereographic projections of great circles in S^2 \subset R^3. This analysis provides a pattern for our analysis of stereographic projections of the Clifford torus {\mathcal C}\subset S^3 \subset R^4. We use the higher dimensional decomposition to prove a symmetry assertion for stereographic projections of {\mathcal C} which we believe we are the first to observe and which can be used to characterize the Clifford torus among embedded minimal tori in S^3---though this last assertion goes beyond the scope of this paper. An effort is made to intuitively motivate all necessary concepts including rotation, stereographic projection, and symmetry.
