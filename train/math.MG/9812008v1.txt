Let K be an n-dimensional convex body. Define the difference body by  K-K= \{x-y \mid x,y \in K \}.  We estimate the volume of the section of K-K by a linear subspace F via the maximal volume of sections of K parallel to F. We prove that for any m-dimensional subspace F there exists x \in R^n, such that  vol ((K-K) \cap F) \le C^m (\min (n/m, \sqrt{m}))^m \cdot vol (K \cap (F+x)),  for some absolute constant C. We show that for small dimensions of F this estimate is exact up to a multiplicative constant.
