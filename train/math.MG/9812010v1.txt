Let K, D be n-dimensional convex bodes. Define the distance between K and D as  d(K,D) = \inf \{\lambda | T K \subset D+x \subset \lambda \cdot TK \},  where the infimum is taken over all x \in R^n and all invertible linear operators T. Assume that 0 is an interior point of K and define  M(K) =\int_{S^{n-1}} \| \omega \|_K d \mu (\omega),  where \mu is the uniform measure on the sphere. Let K^{\circ} be the polar body of K. We use the difference body estimate to prove that K can be embedded into R^n so that  M(K) \cdot M(K^{\circ}) \le C n^{1/3} \log^a n  for some absolute constants C and a. We apply this result to show that the distance between two n-dimensional convex bodies does not exceed n^{4/3} up to a logarithmic factor.
