A conjecture of Fuglede states that a bounded measurable set \Omega in space, of measure 1, can tile space by translations if and only if the Hilbert space L^2(\Omega) has an orthonormal basis consisting of exponentials. If \Omega has the latter property it is called spectral. We generalize a result of Fuglede, that a triangle in the plane is not spectral, proving that every non-symmetric convex domain is not spectral.
