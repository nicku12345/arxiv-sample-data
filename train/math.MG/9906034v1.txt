We review 28 uniform partitions of 3-space in order to find out which of them have graphs (skeletons) embeddable isometrically (or with scale 2) into some cubic lattice {\bf Z}_n. We also consider some relatives of those 28 partitions, including Achimedean 4-polytopes of Conway-Guy, non-compact uniform partitions, Kelvin partitions and those with unique vertex figure (i.e. Delaunay star). Among last ones we indicate two continuums of aperiodic tilings by semi-regular 3-prisms with cubes or with regular tetrahedra and regular octahedra. On the way many new partitions are added to incomplete cases considered here.
