In the previous version of the paper it was announced that ``sphere homeomorphic flexible polyhedra (with self intersections) do really exist in n-dimensional Euclidean, Lobachevskij and spherical spaces for each n\geq 3.'' Now the paper has been withdrawn by the author, due a crucial error in the proof of the main theorem.
