Let X be a normed space. A subset A of X is approximately convex if d(ta+(1-t)b,A) \le 1 for all a,b \in A and t \in [0,1] where d(x,A) is the distance of x to A. Let \Co(A) be the convex hull and \diam(A) the diameter of A. We prove that every n-dimensional normed space contains approximately convex sets A with \mathcal{H}(A,\Co(A))\ge \log_2n-1 and \diam(A) \le C\sqrt n(\ln n)^2, where \mathcal{H} denotes the Hausdorff distance. These estimates are reasonably sharp. For every D>0, we construct worst possible approximately convex sets in C[0,1] such that \mathcal{H}(A,\Co(A))=\diam(A)=D. Several results pertaining to the Hyers-Ulam stability theorem are also proved.
