In this work, we construct the algebra of differential forms with the cube of exterior differential equal to zero on one-dimensional space. We prove that this algebra is a graded q-differential algebra where q is a cubic root of unity. Since the square of differential is not equal to zero the algebra of differential forms is generated not only by the first order differential but also by the second order differential of a coordinate. We study the bimodule generated by this second order differential, and show that its structure is similar to the structure of bimodule generated by the first order differential in the case of anyonic line.
