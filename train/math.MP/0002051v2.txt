We study the right eigenvalue equation for quaternionic and complex linear matrix operators defined in n-dimensional quaternionic vector spaces. For quaternionic linear operators the eigenvalue spectrum consists of n complex values. For these operators we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the diagonalization of their quaternionic matrix representations. Our discussion is also extended to complex linear operators, whose spectrum is characterized by 2n complex eigenvalues. We show that a consistent analysis of the eigenvalue problem for complex linear operators requires the choice of a complex geometry in defining inner products. Finally, we introduce some examples of the left eigenvalue equations and highlight the main difficulties in their solution.
