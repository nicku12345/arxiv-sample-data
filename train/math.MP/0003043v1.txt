Normalized eigenvalue counting measure of the sum of two Hermitian (or real symmetric) matrices A_{n} and B_{n} rotated independently with respect to each other by the random unitary (or orthogonal) Haar distributed matrix U_{n} (i.e. A_{n}+U_{n}^{\ast}B_{n}U_{n}) is studied in the limit of large matrix order n. Convergence in probability to a limiting nonrandom measure is established. A functional equation for the Stieltjes transform of the limiting measure in terms of limiting eigenvalue measures of A_{n} and B_{n} is obtained and studied.   Keywords: random matrices, eigenvalue distribution
