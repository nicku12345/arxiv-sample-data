Hystory of topology is discussed uncluding the Golden Age Period (1950-1970), the Period of Decay (1970-1980) and the Period of Recovery in 80s and 90s based on the ideas borrowed from physics community. In the second part recent result of the present author, A.Malcev, I Dynnikov and A.Zorich concerning new observable topological phenomena in normal metals and topology of quasiperiodic functions on the plane are presented
