In scattering by singular potentials g^2U(s;r), the coupling constant g^2 is continuously decreased to zero while the stage s of singularity raised simultaneously beyond all limits by some functional relation F(g^2;s)=0. In the extreme situation of this double limit, even the mere existence of a nontrivial physical scattering problem is questionable. By iterating a pair of integral equations, the relevant solution is developed here in terms of wave functions into a pair of convergent series, each of which reduces in the double limit \{g^2\to 0;s\to\infty\} to a single term calculable by quadrature.
