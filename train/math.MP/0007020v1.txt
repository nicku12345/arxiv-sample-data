This article provides sufficient conditions for positive maps on the Schatten classes \mathcal J_{p}, 1\le p<\infty of bounded operators on a separable Hilbert space such that a corresponding Perron-Frobenius theorem holds. With applications in quantum information theory in mind sufficient conditions are given for a trace preserving, positive map on \mathcal J_{1}, the space of trace class operators, to have a unique, strictly positive density matrix which is left invariant under the map. Conversely to any given strictly positive density matrix there are trace preserving, positive maps for which the density matrix is the unique Perron-Frobenius vector.
