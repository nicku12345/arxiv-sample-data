Consider a free electron gas in a confining potential and a magnetic field in arbitrary dimensions. If this gas is in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature T >0, one can study its orbital magnetic response (omitting the spin). One defines a conveniently ``smeared out'' magnetization M, and the corresponding magnetic susceptibility \chi, which will be analyzed from a semiclassical point of view, namely when \hbar (the Planck constant) is small compared to classical actions characterizing the system. Then various regimes of temperature T are studied where M and \chi can be obtained in the form of suitable asymptotic \hbar-expansions. In particular when T is of the order of \hbar, oscillations ``\`a la de Haas-van Alphen'' appear, that can be linked to the classical periodic orbits of the electronic motion.
