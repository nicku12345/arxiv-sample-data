The fact that mass has an effect on surrounding space is the first essential element of general relativity. This paper unifies this mass/space distinction of general relativity with Newtonian gravity at a subatomic scale and with reported experimental findings of the last century. The subatomic distinction of mass concentration mainly in nucleons surrounded by empty space as we know it now was not known when the general relativity was written. The author uses this distinction to set forth a consistent classical equation of gravity valid to the Planck length and peeps into the quantum world. It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of fundamental nuclear theory for the understanding of matter in the universe and its cosmological evaluation, and also for the inclusion of gravity in the unified family of all four forces.
