We investigate various properties of p-adic differential equations which have as a solution an analytic function of the form F_k (x) = \sum_{n\geq 0} n! P_k (n) x^n, where P_k (n) = n^k + C_{k-1} n^{k-1} + ...+ C_0 is a polynomial in n with C_i\in Z (in a more general case C_i\in Q or C_i\in C_p). For some special classes of P_k (n), as well as for the general case, the existence of the corresponding linear differential equations of the first- and second-order for F_k (x), is shown. In some cases such equations are constructed. For the second-order differential equations there is no other analytic solution of the form \sum a_n x^n. Due to the fact that the corresponding inhomogeneous first-order differential equation exists one can construct infinitely many inhomogeneous second-order equations with the same analytic solution. Relation to some rational sums with the Bernoulli numbers and to F_k (x) for some x\in Z is considered. Some of these differential equations can be related to p-adic dynamics and p-adic information theory.
