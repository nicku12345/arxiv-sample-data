Magnetic fingerprints on the spectra of an interacting electron with a negatively charged ion in a parabolic quantum dot (QD), and of two interacting electrons in such a dot, are investigated via a pseudoperturbative methodical proposal. The effect of ion-electron and electron-electron interactions on the spectra are studied. The effect of the symmetry of such problem is emphasized. Compared to those obtained by Zhu et al. [6], via a series solution, the results are found in excellent accord. Higher excited - states are also reported.
