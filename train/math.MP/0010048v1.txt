We prove that the super star product on a Poisson Lie supergroup leads to the structure of quantum superalgebra (triangular Hopf superalgebra) on the super quantized enveloping algebra of the Lie superalgebra of the Lie supergroup and that equivalents super star products generate isomorphic quantum superalgebras.
