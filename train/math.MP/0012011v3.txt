We analyze the free energy and construct the Gibbs-KMS states for a class of quantum lattice systems, at low temperatures and when the interactions are almost diagonal in a suitable basis. We study systems with continuous symmetry, but our results are valid for discrete symmetry breaking only. Such phase transitions occur at intermediate temperatures where the continuous symmetry is not broken, while at very low temperature continuous symmetry breaking may occur.
