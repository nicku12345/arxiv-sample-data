We give a sufficient condition for a lightlike isotropic submanifold M, of dimension n, which is not totally geodesic in a semi-Riemannian manifold of constant curvature c and of dimension n+p (n < p), to admit a reduction of codimension. We show that this condition is a necessary and sufficient condition on the first transversal space of M. There are basic and non-trivial differences from the Riemannian case, as developed by Dajczer \textit{et al} in (\cite{dajczer}), due to the degenerate metric on M. This result extends in some sense,the one in \cite{keti} and \cite{dajczer} to lightlike isotropic submanifolds.
