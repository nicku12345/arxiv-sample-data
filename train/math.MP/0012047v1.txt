We extend the recursion formula for matrix Bessel functions, which we obtained previously, to superspace. It is sufficient to do this for the unitary orthosymplectic supergroup. By direct computations, we show that fairly explicit results can be obtained, at least up to dimension 8\times 8 for the supermatrices. Since we introduce a new technique, we discuss various of its aspects in some detail.
