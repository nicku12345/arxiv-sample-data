This is the first chapter of a new and unconventional textbook on quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. The chapter introduces standard quantum mechanics by means of a symmetry principle, without reference to classical mechanics. The mathematical foundation of this approach comes from a recent paper of Naudts and Kuna on covariance systems. The standard representation of quantum mechanics is derived. Next, spin and mass of a quantum particle are explained as labels of projective representations of the Galilei group.
