The Hamilton-Jacobi method of constrained systems is discussed. The equations of motion for three singular systems are obtained as total differential equations in many variables. The integrability conditions for these syatems lead us to the canonical reduced phase-space coordinates with out using any gauge fixing conditions. The operator and the path integral quantization of these systems is discussed.
