The abelian Chern-Simons system is treated as a constrained system using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. The equations of motion are obtained as total differential equations in many variables. It is shown that their simultaneous solutions with the constraints lead to obtain canonical phase space coordinates and the reduced phase space Hamiltonian with out introducing Lagrange multipliers and with out any additional gauge fixing condition.
