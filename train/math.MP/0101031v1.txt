The pseudoperturbative shifted - l expansion technique PSLET [12,16] is generalized for states with arbitrary number of nodal zeros. Interdimensional degeneracies, emerging from the isomorphism between angular momentum and dimensionality of the central force Schr\"odinger equation, are used to construct part of the D - dimensional anharmonic oscillator bound - state spectra. PSLET results are found to compare excellently with those from a series [5], exact and open perturbation [9] solutions.
