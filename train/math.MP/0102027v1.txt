We study the covariant free bosonic string field theory and explore its locality (causality) properties. We find covariant string fields which are strictly local and covariant, but act on an unconstrained Hilbert space with an indefinite inner product. From these we also define observable fields which act on the physical Hilbert space with an definite inner product. These are shown to be approximately local.
