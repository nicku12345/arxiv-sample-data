If f(x,k) is the Jost solution and f(x) = f(0,k), then the I-function is I(k) := \frac{f^\prime(0,k)}{f(k)}. It is proved that I(k) is in one-to-one correspondence with the scattering triple {\mathcal S} :=\{S(k), k_j, s_j, \quad 1 \leq j \leq J\} and with the spectral function \rho(\lambda) of the Sturm-Liouville operator l= -\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + q(x) on (0, \infty) with the Dirichlet condition at x=0 and q(x) \in L_{1,1} := \{q: q= \bar q, \int^\infty_0 (1+x) |q(x) dx <   \infty\}.   Analytical methods are given for finding \mathcal S from I(k) and I(k) from \mathcal S, and \rho(\lambda) from I(k) and I(k) from \rho(\lambda). Since the methods for finding q(x) from \mathcal S or from \rho(\lambda) are known, this yields the methods for finding q(x) from I(k).
