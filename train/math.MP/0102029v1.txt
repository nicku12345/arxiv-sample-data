Let u_t = u_{xx} - q(x) u, 0 \leq x \leq 1, t>0, u(0, t) = 0, u(1, t) = a(t), u(x,0) = 0, where a(t) is a given function vanishing for t>T, a(t) \not\equiv 0, \int^T_0 a(t) dt < \infty. Suppose one measures the flux u_x (0,t) := b_0 (t) for all t>0. Does this information determine q(x) uniquely? Do the measurements of the flux u_x (1,t) := b(t) give more information about q(x) than b_0 (t) does?   The above questions are answered in this paper.
