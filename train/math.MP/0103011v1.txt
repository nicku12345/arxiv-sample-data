The problem of specification of self-adjoint operators corresponding to singular bilinear forms is very important for applications, such as quantum field theory and theory of partial differential equations with coefficient functions being distributions. In particular, the formal expression -\Delta + g\delta({\bold x}) corresponds to a non-trivial self-adjoint operator \hat{H} in the space L^2({\Bbb R}^d) only if d\le 3. For spaces of larger dimensions (this corresponds to the strongly singular case), the construction of \hat{H} is much more complicated: first one should consider the space L^2({\Bbb R}^d) as a subspace of a wider Pontriagin space, then one implicitly specifies \hat{H}. It is shown in this paper that Schrodinger, parabolic and hyperbolic equations containing the operator \hat{H} can be approximated by explicitly defined systems of evolution equations of a larger order. The strong convergence of evolution operators taking the initial condition of the Cauchy problem to the solution of the Cauchy problem is proved.
