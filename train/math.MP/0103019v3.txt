The ``time-evolution operator'' in mechanics is a powerful tool which can be geometrically defined as a vector field along the Legendre map. It has been extensively used by several authors for studying the structure and properties of the dynamical systems (mainly the non-regular ones), such as the relation between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, constraints, and higher-order mechanics. This paper is devoted to defining a generalization of this operator for field theories, in a covariant formulation. In order to do this, we also use sections along maps, in particular multivector fields (skew-symmetric contravariant tensor fields of order greater than 1), jet fields and connection forms along the Legendre map. As a first relevant property, we use these geometrical objects to obtain the solutions of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field equations, and the equivalence among them (specially for non-regular field theories).
