In this paper, we calculate a series of principally specialized characters of the \hat{\mathfrak{sl}}(m|1)-modules of level 1. In particular, we show that the principally specialized characters of the basic modules L(\Lambda_0) is expressed as an infinite product. And we deduce the specialized character formula of ``quasiparticle'' type.
