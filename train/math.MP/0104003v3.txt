We discuss the mathematical aspects of wave field measurements used in traveltime inversion from seismograms. The primary information about the medium is assumed to be carried by the wave front set and its perturbation with repsect to a hypothetical background medium is to be estimated. By a convincing heuristics a detection procedure for this perturbation was proposed based on optimization of wave field correlations. We investigate its theoretical foundation in simple mathematical case studies using the distribution theoretic definition of oscillatory integrals.
