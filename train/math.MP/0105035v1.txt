A new family of one- and two-gap elliptic densities of the polar operator has been constructed by modifying the so-called "higher time approach" to constructing finite-gap solutions of the Harry Dym equation. Auto-B\"{a}cklund transformations of the obtained stationary solutions have been constructed and their properties have been studied.
