We classify the possible behaviour of Poincar\'e-Dulac normal forms for dynamical systems in R^n with nonvanishing linear part and which are equivariant under (the fundamental representation of) all the simple compact Lie algebras and thus the corresponding simple compact Lie groups. The ``renormalized forms'' (in the sense of previous work by the author) of these systems is also discussed; in this way we are able to simplify the classification and moreover to analyze systems with zero linear part. We also briefly discuss the convergence of the normalizing transformations.
