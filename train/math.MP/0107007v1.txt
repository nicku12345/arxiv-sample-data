We present an algorithm to solve First Order Ordinary Differential Equations (FOODEs) extending the Prelle-Singer (PS) Method. The usual PS-approach miss many FOODEs presenting Liouvillian functions in the solution (LFOODEs). We point out why and propose an algorithm to solve a large class of these previously unsolved LFOODEs. Although our algorithm does not cover all the LFOODEs, it is an elegant extension mantaining the semi-decision nature of the usual PS-Method.
