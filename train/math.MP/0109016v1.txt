Essential properties of semiclassical approximation for quantum mechanics are viewed as axioms of an abstract semiclassical mechanics. Its symmetry properties are discussed. Semiclassical systems being invariant under Lie groups are considered. An infinitesimal analog of group relation is written. Sufficient conditions for reconstructing semiclassical group transformations (integrability of representation of Lie algebra) are discussed. The obtained results may be used for mathematical proof of Poincare invariance of semiclasical Hamiltonian field theory and for investigation of quantum anomalies.
