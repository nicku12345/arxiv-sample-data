A wide class of q-deformed harmonic oscillators including those of Macfarlane type and of Dubna type is shown to be describable in a unified way. The Hamiltonian of the oscillator is assumed to be given by a q-deformed anti-commutator of the q-deformed ladder operators. By solving q-difference equations, explicit coordinate representations of ladder operators and wave functions are derived, and unified parametric representations are found for q-Hermite functions and related formulas for the oscillators of Macfarlane and Dubna types. In addition to the well-known solutions with globally periodic structure, there exist an infinite number of solutions with globally aperiodic structure.
