We shall try to exhibit a relation between black hole entropy and topological entropy using the famous Baum-Connes conjecture for foliated manifolds which are particular examples of noncommutative spaces. Our argument is qualitative and it is based on the microscopic origin of the Beckenstein-Hawking area-entropy formula for black holes, provided by superstring theory, in the more general noncommutative geometric context of M-Theory following the Connes- Douglas-Schwarz article.
