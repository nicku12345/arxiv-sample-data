A complete classification of generalized symmetries of the Yang-Mills equations on Minkowski space with a semi-simple structure group is carried out. It is shown that any generalized symmetry, up to a generalized gauge symmetry, agrees with a first order symmetry on solutions of the Yang-Mills equations. Let g=g_1+...+g_n be the decomposition of the Lie algebra g of the structure group into simple ideals. First order symmetries for g-valued Yang-Mills fields are found to consist of gauge symmetries, conformal symmetries for g_m-valued Yang-Mills fields, 1\leq m\leq n, and their images under a complex structure of g_m.
