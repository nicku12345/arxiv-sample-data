This paper applies the notion of relative CR embeddings to study two related questions. First, it answers negatively the question posed by Penrose whether every shear-free null rotating congruence is analytic. Second, it proves that given any shear-free null rotating congruence, there exists a null electromagnetic field which is null with respect to the given congruence. In the course of answering these questions, we introduce some new techniques for studying null electromagnetic fields and shear-free congruences in general based on the notion of a relative CR embedding.
