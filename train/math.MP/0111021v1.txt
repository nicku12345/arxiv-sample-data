The wave functions of quantum Calogero-Sutherland systems for trigonometric case are related to polynomials in l variables (l is a rank of root system) and they are the generalization of Gegenbauer polynomials and Jack polynomials. Using the technique of \kappa-deformation of Clebsch-Gordan series developed in previous authors papers we investigate some new properties of generalized Gegenbauer polynomials.Note that similar results are also valid in A_2 case for more general two-parameter deformation ((q,t)-deformation) introduced by Macdonald.
