A closed SO(5) algebraic structure in the the mean-field form of the Hamiltonian the pure p-wave superconductivity is found that can help to diagonalized by making use of the Bogoliubov rotation instead of the Balian-Werthamer approach. we point out that the eigenstate is nothing but SO(5)-coherent state with fermionic realization. By applying the approach to the Hamiltonian with dipole interaction of Leggett the consistency between the diagonalization and gap equation is proved through the double-time Green function. The relationship between the s-wave and p-wave superconductivities turns out to be recognized through Yangian algebra, a new type of infinite-dimensional algebra.
