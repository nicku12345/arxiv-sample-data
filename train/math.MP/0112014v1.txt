The eigenvalues of the 3 off-diagonal matrices of rank n with elements 1+i cot[(j-k)\pi/n], sin^{-2}[(j-k)\pi/n] and sin^{-4}[(j-k)\pi /n], (j=1,2,...,n, k=1,2,...,n, j\neq k) are computed. The sums over k from 1 to n-1 of cot(k\pi/n) sin(2sk\pi/n) and sin^{-p}(k\pi/n) cos(2sk\pi/n) are moreover computed for s integer and p=2 and 4. The results are given by simple formulae in terms of integers.
