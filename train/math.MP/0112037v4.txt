The Maxwell-Dirac equations are the equations for electronic matter, the "classical" theory underlying QED. In this article we examine the stationary Maxwell-Dirac equations under weak regularity and decay assumptions.   We prove that:   There are no embedded eigenvalues in the essential spectrum, -m\leq E\leq m.   If |E|< m then the Dirac field components (and their derivatives) decay exponentially at spatial infinity.   If E|=m then the system is "asymptotically" static and decays exponentially if the total charge is non-zero.
