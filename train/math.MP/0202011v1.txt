We present a proof of the central limit theorem for a pair of mutually non-commuting operators in mixing quantum spin chains. The operators are not necessarily strictly local but quasi-local. As a corollary we obtain a direct construction of the time evolution of the algebra of normal fluctuation for Gibbs states of finite range interactions on a one-dimensional lattice. We show that the state of the algebra of normal fluctuation satisfies the \beta-KMS condition if the microscopic state is a \beta-KMS state.
