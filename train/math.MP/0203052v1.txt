Infinite series of the type Sum{n=1,infinity}(alpha/2)_n_2F_1(-n, b; gamma; y)/(n n!) are investigated. Closed-form sums are obtained for alpha a positive integer alpha=1,2,3, ... The limiting case of b --> infinity, after y is replaced with x^2/b, leads to Sum{n=1,infinity}(alpha/2)_n_1F_1(-n; gamma; x^2)/(n n!). This type of series appears in the first-order perturbation correction for the wavefunction of the generalized spiked harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian H = -(d/dx)^2 + Bx^2 + A/x^2 + lambda/x^alpha, x >=0, alpha, lambda > 0, A >= 0. These results have immediate applications to perturbation series for the energy and wave function of the spiked harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian H = -(d/dx)^2 + Bx^2 + lambda/x^alpha, x >= 0, alpha, lambda > 0.
