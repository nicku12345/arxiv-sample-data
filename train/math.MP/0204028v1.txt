A dynamical algebra {\cal A}_q, englobing many of the deformed harmonic oscillator algebras is introduced. One of its special cases is extensively developed. A general method for constructing coherent states related to any algebra of the type {\cal A}_q is discussed. The construction following this method is carried out for the special case.
