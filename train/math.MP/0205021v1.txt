The aim of this paper is to study some examples of exponentially harmonic maps. We study such maps firstly on flat euclidean and Minkowski spaces and secondly on Friedmann-Lema\^ itre universes. We also consider some new models of exponentially harmonic maps which are coupled with gravity which happen to be based on a generalization of the lagrangian for bosonic strings coupled with dilatonic field.
