This paper considers a generalization of the existing concept of parallel (with respect to a given connection) geometric objects and its possible usage as a suggesting rule in searching for adequate field equations in theoretical physics. The generalization tries to represent mathematically the two-sided nature of the physical objects, the {\it change} and the {\it conservation}. The physical objects are presented mathematically by sections \Psi of vector bundles, the admissible changes D\Psi are described as a rsult of the action of appropriate differential operators D on these sections, and the conservation propertieis are accounted for by the requirement that suitable projections of D\Psi on \Psi and on other appropriate sections must be zero. It is shown that the most important equations of theoretical physics obey this rule. Extended forms of Maxwell and Yang-Mills equations are also considered.
