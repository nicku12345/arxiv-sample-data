We study edge states of a random Schroedinger operator for an electron submitted to a magnetic field in a finite macroscopic two dimensional system of linear dimensions equal to L. The y direction is L-periodic and in the x direction the electron is confined by two smoothly increasing parallel boundary potentials. We prove that, with large probability, for an energy range in the first spectral gap of the bulk Hamiltonian, the spectrum of the full Hamiltonian consists only on two sets of eigenenergies whose eigenfuntions have average velocities which are strictly positive/negative, uniformly with respect to the size of the system. Our result gives a well defined meaning to the notion of edge states for a finite cylinder with two boundaries, and extends previous studies on systems with only one boundary.
