Most of the mathematical approaches for quantum Langevin equation are based on the non-commutativity of the random force operators. Non-commutative random force operators are introduced in order to guarantee that the equal-time commutation relation for the stochastic annihilation and creation operators preserves in time. If it is true, it means that the origin of dissipation is of quantum mechanical. However, physically, it is hard to believe it. By making use of the unified canonical operator formalism for the system of the quantum stochastic differential equations within Non-Equilibrium Thermo Field Dynamics, it is shown that it is not true in general.
