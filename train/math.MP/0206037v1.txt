We compare two proposals for the dynamical entropy of quantum deterministic systems (CNT and AFL) by studying their extensions to classical stochastic systems. We show that the natural measurement procedure leads to a simple explicit expression for the stochastic dynamical entropy with a clear information-theoretical interpretation. Finally, we compare our construction with other recent proposals.
