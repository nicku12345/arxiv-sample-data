The classical scalar massive field satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation in a finite one-dimensional space interval of periodically varying length with Dirichlet boundary conditions is studied. For the sufficiently small mass, the energy can exponentially grow with time under the same conditions as for the massless case. The proofs are based on estimates of exactly given mass-induced corrections to the massless case.
