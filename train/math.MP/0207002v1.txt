We extend Michel's theorem on the geometry of symmetry breaking [L. Michel, {\it Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci. Paris} {\bf 272-A} (1971), 433-436] to the case of pure gauge theories, i.e. of gauge-invariant functionals defined on the space {\cal C} of connections of a principal fiber bundle. Our proof follows closely the original one by Michel, using several known results on the geometry of {\cal C}. The result (and proof) is also extended to the case of gauge theories with matter fields.
