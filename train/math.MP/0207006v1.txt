We obtain certain inequalities involving several intrinsic invariants namely scalar curvature, Ricci curvature and k-Ricci curvature, and main extrinsic invariant namely squared mean curvature for submanifolds in a locally conformal almost cosymplectic manifold with pointwise constant % \phi -sectional curvature. Applying these inequalities we obtain several inequalities for slant, invariant, anti-invariant and {\em CR}-submanifolds. The equality cases are also discussed.
