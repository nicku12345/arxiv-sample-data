We study the Schr\"odinger operator -\Delta -\alpha \delta (x-\Gamma) in L^2(\R^3) with a \delta interaction supported by an infinite non-planar surface \Gamma which is smooth, admits a global normal parameterization with a uniformly elliptic metric. We show that if \Gamma  is asymptotically planar in a suitable sense and \alpha>0 is sufficiently large this operator has a non-empty discrete spectrum and derive an asymptotic expansion of the eigenvalues in terms of a ``two-dimensional'' comparison operator determined by the geometry of the surface \Gamma.
