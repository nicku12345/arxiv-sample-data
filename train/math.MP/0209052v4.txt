A exotic class of nonlinear p-form nonabelian gauge theories is studied, arising from the most general allowed nontrivial deformation of linear abelian gauge theory for a set of massless 1-form fields and 2-form fields in four dimensions. These theories combine a Chapline-Manton type coupling of the 1-forms and 2-forms, along with a Yang-Mills coupling of the 1-forms, a Freedman-Townsend coupling of the 2-forms, and an extended Freedman-Townsend type coupling between the 1-forms and 2-forms. It is shown that the resulting theories have a geometrically interesting dual formulation that is equivalent to an exotic Yang-Mills dilaton theory involving a nonlinear sigma field. In particular, the nonlinear sigma field couples to the Yang-Mills 1-form field through a generalized Chern class 4-form term.
