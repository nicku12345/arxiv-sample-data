We consider a Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian for a particle coupled to a photon field. We discuss the effects of the increase of the binding energy and enhanced binding through coupling to a photon field, and prove that both effects are the results of the existence of the ground state of the self-energy operator with total momentum P = 0.
