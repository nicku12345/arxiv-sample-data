We review the notion of the deformation of the exterior wedge product. This allows us to construct the deformation of the algebra of exterior forms over a vector space and also over an arbitrary manifold. We relate this approach to the generalized statistics. we study quons, as a particular case of these generalized statistics. We also give their statistical properties.   A large part of the work is devoted to the problem of constructing coherent states for the deformed oscillators. we give a review of all the approaches existing in the literature concerning this point and enforce it with many examples.
