Completeness is proved for some subsystems of a system of coherent states. The linear dependence of states is investigated for the von Neumann type subsystems. A detailed study is made of the case when a regular lattice on the complex \alpha plane with cell area S=\pi corresponds to the states of the system. It is shown that in this case there exists only one linear relationship between the coherent states. This relationship is equivalent to an infinite set of identities. The symplest of these can also be obtained by means of the transformation formulas for \theta functions.
