It is now believed that the limiting distribution function of the largest eigenvalue in the three classic random matrix models GOE, GUE and GSE describe new universal limit laws for a wide variety of processes arising in mathematical physics and interacting particle systems. These distribution functions, expressed in terms of a certain Painlev\'e II function, are described and their occurences surveyed.
