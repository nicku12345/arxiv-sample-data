In this work, we will calculate and analyze the frequency dependent electric polarizability of a particle which is bound by a one-dimensional delta potential. A perturbation technique based on the work by Nozieres will be employed to calculate our expression. Comparison will be made with references which have discussed work comparable to ours.
