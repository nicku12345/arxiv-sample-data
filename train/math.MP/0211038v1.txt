Ermakov systems possessing Noether point symmetry are identified among the Ermakov systems that derive from a Lagrangian formalism and, the Ermakov invariant is shown to result from an associated symmetry of dynamical character. The Ermakov invariant and the associated Noether invariant, are sufficient to reduce these systems to quadratures.
