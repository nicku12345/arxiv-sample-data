We consider a quantum system of non-interacting fermions at temperature T, in the framework of linear response theory. We show that semiclassical theory is an appropriate framework to describe some of their thermodynamic properties, in particular through asymptotic expansions in \hbar (Planck constant) of the dynamical susceptibilities. We show how the closed orbits of the classical motion in phase space manifest themselves in these expansions, in the regime where T is of the order of \hbar.
