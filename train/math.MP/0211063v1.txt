We discuss the (right) eigenvalue equation for \mathbb{H}, \mathbb{C} and \mathbb{R} linear quaternionic operators. The possibility to introduce an isomorphism between these operators and real/complex matrices allows to translate the quaternionic problem into an {\em equivalent} real or complex counterpart. Interesting applications are found in solving differential equations within quaternionic formulations of quantum mechanics.
