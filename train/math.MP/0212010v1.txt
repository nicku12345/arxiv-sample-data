By virtue of the parabose squeezed operator, propagator of a parabose parametric amplifier, explicit form of parabose squeezed number states and normalization factors of excitation states on a parabose squeezed vacuum atate are calculated in this letter, which generalize the relevant results from ordinary Bose statistics to parabose case.
