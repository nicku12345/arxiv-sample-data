CLIFFORD performs various computations in Grassmann and Clifford algebras. It can compute with quaternions, octonions, and matrices with entries in Cl(B) - the Clifford algebra of a vector space V endowed with an arbitrary bilinear form B. Two user-selectable algorithms for Clifford product are implemented: 'cmulNUM' - based on Chevalley's recursive formula, and 'cmulRS' - based on non-recursive Rota-Stein sausage. Grassmann and Clifford bases can be used. Properties of reversion in undotted and dotted wedge bases are discussed.
