We present several second-order linear differential equations that are associated to a particular Riccati equation with only one constant parameter in its coefficients through the technique of supersymmetric factorizations and through a Dirac-like procedure. The latter approach is a minimal extension of the results obtained with the first technique in the sense that it includes up to two more constant parameters
