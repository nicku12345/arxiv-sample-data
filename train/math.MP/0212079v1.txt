The dynamical model on 3+1 dimensional spacetime admitting soliton solutions is discussed. The proposal soliton is localized in the vicinity of a closed contour, which could be linked and/or knotted. The topological charge is Hopf invariant. Some applications in realistic physical systems are indicated.
