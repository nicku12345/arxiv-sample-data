A number of equations is deduced which describe propagation of excitations along n-dimensional surfaces in R^N. Usual excitations in wave theory propagate along 1-dimensional trajectories. The role of the medium of propagation of excitations considered in this paper is played by the infinite dimensional space of (n-1)-dimensional surfaces in R^N. The role of rays is played by n-dimensional solution surfaces of the variational problem. Such a generalization of wave theory can be useful in quantum field theory. Among these equations are the generalized Hamilton--Jacobi equation (known in particular cases in the literature), generalized canonical Hamilton equations, and generalized Schrodinger equation. Besides that, a theory of integration of the generalized Hamilton--Jacobi equation is developed.
