In this paper the proofs are given of important properties of deformed Abelian differentials introduced earlier in connection with quantum integrable systems. The starting point of the construction is Baxter equation. In particular, we prove Riemann bilinear relation. Duality plays important role in our consideration. Classical limit is considered in details.
