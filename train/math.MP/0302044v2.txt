We argue that the celebrated Stefan condition on the moving interphase, accepted in mathematical physics up to now, can not be imposed if energy sources are spatially distributed in the volume. A method based on Tikhonov and Samarskii's ideas for numerical solution of the problem is developed. Mathematical modelling of energy relaxation of some processes useful in modern ion beam technologies is fulfilled. Necessity of taking into account effects completely outside the Stefan formulation is demonstrated.
