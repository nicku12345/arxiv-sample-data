Certain approximations for the spin expectations have been studied both numerically and theoretically. Approximations are constructed using solutions of the lattice heat equation. The most interesting idea is a certain randomness assumption for a theoretically derived quantity, that leads directly to a given approximation. We are betting the randomness assumption is rigorously correct.
