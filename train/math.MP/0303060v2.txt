We prove rigorously the occurrence of zero-mode Bose-Einstein condensation for a class of continuous homogeneous systems of boson particles with superstable interactions. This is the first example of a translation invariant continuous Bose-system, where the existence of the Bose-Einstein condensation is proved rigorously for the case of non-trivial two-body particle interactions, provided there is a large enough one-particle excitations spectral gap. The idea of proof consists of comparing the system with specially tuned soluble models.
