The aim of this paper is to study the spatial behaviour of the solutions to the boundary-final value problems associated with the linear theory of elastic materials with voids. More precisely the present study is devoted to porous materials with a memory effect for the intrinsic equilibrated body forces. An appropriate time-weighted volume measure is associated with the backward in time thermoelastic processes.   Then, a first-order partial differential inequality in terms of such measure is established and further is shown how it implies the spatial exponential decay of the thermoelastic process in question.
