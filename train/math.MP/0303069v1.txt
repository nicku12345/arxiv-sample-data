In this article a group-theoretical aspect of the method of dimensional reduction is presented. Then, on the base of symmetry analysis of an anisotropic space geometrical description of dimensional reduction of equation for massive spinor field is given. Formula for claculating components of the energy-momentum tensor from the variables of the field factor-equations is derived.
