This article examines the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) approximation of single-particle dynamics in systems of interacting fermions. We find the TDHF approximation to be accurate when there are sufficiently many particles and the initial many-particle state is a Slater determinant, or any Gibbs equilibrium state for noninteracting fermions. Assuming a bounded two-particle interaction, we obtain a bound on the error of the TDHF approximation, valid for short times. We further show that the error of the the TDHF approximation vanishes at all times in the mean field limit.
