We apply the technique of standard supersymmetric factorization for any q factor ordering in the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation for barotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) minisuperspace model, including the cosmological term. The resulting wave functions of the universe are exhibited as one-parameter families, which for particular values of the \gamma parameter of the barotropic model are exactly found.
