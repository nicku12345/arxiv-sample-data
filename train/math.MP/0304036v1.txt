Two examples, not connected at present, from author's papers (Nuovo Cim., 1992, v.105A, p.77 [hep-th/0207210] and GRG, 1999, v.31, p.1431 [gr-qc/0207017]) are considered here in which a physical model has discrete symmetries and additional non-observable coordinates or parameters. Then it is possible to introduce some apparent continuous symmetries of the model for an observer which cannot know values of these additional quantities.
