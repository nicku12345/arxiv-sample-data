The influence of the material texture (substructure) on the force driving the crack tip in complex materials admitting Ginzburg-Landau-like energies is analyzed in a three-dimensional continuum setting. The theory proposed accounts for finite deformations and general coarse-grained order parameters. A modified expression of the J-integral is obtained together with other path-integrals which are necessary to treat cases where the process zone around the tip has finite size. The results can be applied to a wide class of material substructures. As examples, cracks in ferroelectrics and in materials with strain-gradient effects are discussed: in these cases the specializations of the general results fit reasonably experimental data.
