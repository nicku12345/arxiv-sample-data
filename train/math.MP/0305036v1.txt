A general scheme is proposed for constructing vector coherent states, in analogy with the well-known canonical coherent states, and their deformed versions, when these latter are expressed as infinite series in powers of a complex variable z. In the present scheme, the variable z is replaced by a matrix valued function over appropriate domains. As particular examples, we analyze the quaternionic extensions of the the canonical coherent states and the Gilmore-Perelomov and Barut-Girardello coherent states arising from representations of SU(1,1).
