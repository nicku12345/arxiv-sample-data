We present a version of the conditional symmetry method in order to obtain multiple wave solutions expressed in terms of Riemann invariants. We construct an abelian distribution of vector fields which are symmetries of the original system of PDEs subjected to certain first order differential constraints. The usefulness of our approach is demonstrated on simple and double wave solutions of MHD equations. The paper also contains a comparison of the conditional symmetry method with the generalized method of characteristics.
