The purpose of this letter is to show, on the one hand, how the so-called train paradox could be resolved directly without appealing to non-linear Lorentz transformations. The resolution is established in the most general case of curvilinear motion with a variable speed train. On the other hand, we formulate a theorem on the photographic process of two moving objects with relativistic effects.
