We show that general 3n-j (n>2) symbols of the first kind and the second kind for the group SU(2) can be reformulated in terms of binomial coefficients. The proof is based on the graphical technique established by Yutsis, et al. and through a definition of a reduced 6-j symbol. The resulting 3n-j symbols thereby take a combinatorial form which is simply the product of two factors. The one is an integer or polynomial which is the single sum over the products of reduced 6-j symbols. They are in the form of summing over the products of binomial coefficients. The other is a multiplication of all the triangle relations appearing in the symbols, which can also be rewritten using binomial coefficients. The new formulation indicates that the intrinsic structure for the general recoupling coefficients is much nicer and simpler, which might serves as a bridge for the study with other fields. Along with our newly developed algorithms, this also provides a basis for a direct, exact and efficient calculation or tabulation of all the 3n-j symbols of the SU(2) group for all range of quantum angular momentum arguments. As an illustration, we present teh results for the 12-j symbols of the first kind.
