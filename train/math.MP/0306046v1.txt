Notes from a course given at Oujda university, Morocco, october 2002 - march 2003 within the support of a fellowship from the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie.   These notes present a brief introduction to Connes' non commutative geometry description of the standard model of particle physics. The notion of distance is emphasized, especially the possible interpretation of the Higgs field as the component of a discrete internal dimension. These notes are in french and are taken from the author's phD thesis.
