Using the theory of self-adjoint extensions, we study the relativistic spectral properties of the Landau operator with \delta and \delta ' interactions on a cylinder of radius R for a charged spin particle system, formally given by the Hamiltonian H^G_{B} = {(p-A)}^2 I + {\bf{\sigma}}.{\bf{B}+G}V(r), \bigg(V(r) = \delta (R-r) or V(r) = \delta' (R-r) \bigg), acting in  L^2(\R^2)\bigotimes \C^2 . G a scalar 2\times 2 real matrix. I is the identity matrix. The potential vector has the form A= (B/2)(-y, x) and B>0.
