Multidimensional contractions of irreducible representations of the Cayley-Klein unitary algebras in the Gel'fand-Zetlin basis are considered. Contracted over different parameters, algebras can turn out to be isomorphic. In this case method of transitions describes the same reducible representations in different basises, say, discrete and continuous ones.
