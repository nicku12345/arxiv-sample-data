It is known that the Whittaker functions w(q,\lambda) associated to the group SL(N) are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonians of the open Toda chain, hence satisfy a set of differential equations in the Toda variables q_i. Using the expression of the q_i for the closed Toda chain in terms of Sklyanin variables \lambda_i, and the known relations between the open and the closed Toda chains, we show that Whittaker functions also satisfy a set of new difference equations in \lambda_i.
