We present a so called Dirac-type tensor equation (DTTE). This equation is written in coordinateless form with the aid of differential operators d and \delta. A wave function of DTTE belongs to a minimal left ideal of the algebra of exterior forms with respect to the Clifford product. We show that a coordinate form of DTTE is identical to the Dirac equation in a fixed coordinate system.
