We consider Glauber-type stochastic dynamics of continuous systems \cite{BCC02}, \cite{KL03}, a particular case of spatial birth-and-death processes. The dynamics is defined by a Markov generator in such a way that Gibbs measures of Ruelle type are symmetrizing, and hence invariant for the stochastic dynamics. In this work we show that the converse statement is also true. Namely, all invariant measures satisfying Ruelle bound condition are grand canonical Gibbsian for the potential defining the dynamics. The proof is based on the observation that the well-known Kirkwood-Salsburg equation for correlation functions is indeed an equilibrium equation for the stochastic dynamics.
