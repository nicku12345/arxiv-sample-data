When utilizing a cluster decomposible relativistic scattering formalism, it is most convenient that the covariant field equations take on a linear form with respect to the energy and momentum dispersion on the fields in the manner given by the Dirac form for spin \half systems. A general spinor formulation is given for arbitrary spins by minimally extending the Lorentz algebra to include operators whose matrix representation give general Dirac matrices. The forms of these matrices are explicitly demonstrated for spin \half and spin 1 fields.
