When utilizing a cluster decomposible relativistic scattering formalism, it is most convenient that the covariant field equations take on a linear form with respect to the energy and momentum dispersion on the fields in the manner given by the Dirac form for spin {1 \over 2} systems. The general spinor formulation for arbitrary spins given in a previous paper is extended to include momentum operators. Unitary quantum mechanical representations are developed for these operators, and physical interpretations are suggested.
