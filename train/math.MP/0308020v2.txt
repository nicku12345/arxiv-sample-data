The well-known canonical coherent states are expressed as an infinite series in powers of a complex number z together with a positive sequence of real numbers \rho(m)=m. In this article, in analogy with the canonical coherent states, we present a class of vector coherent states by replacing the complex variable z by a real Clifford matrix. We also present another class of vector coherent states by simultaneously replacing z by a real Clifford matrix and \rho(m) by a real matrix. As examples, we present vector coherent states on quaternions and octonions with their real matrix representations.
