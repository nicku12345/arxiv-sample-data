We construct measures on the space \mathcal D'(Q_p^n), n\le 4, of Bruhat-Schwartz distributions over the field of p-adic numbers, corresponding to finite volume polynomial interactions in a p-adic analog of the Euclidean quantum field theory. In contrast to earlier results in this direction, our choice of the free measure is the Gaussian measure corresponding to an elliptic pseudo-differential operator over Q_p^n. Analogs of the Euclidean P(\phi)-theories with free and half-Dirichlet boundary conditions are considered.
