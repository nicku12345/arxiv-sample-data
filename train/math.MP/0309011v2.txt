We study the commutants of a Schr\"{o}dinger operator whose potential function possesses inverse square singularities along some hyperplanes passing through the origin. It is shown that the Weyl group symmetry of the potential function and the commutants naturally results from such singularities and the generic nature of the coupling constants.
