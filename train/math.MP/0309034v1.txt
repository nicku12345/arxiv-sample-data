We show that the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of the free lattice Fermion model far from equilibrium is macroscopically unstable. The problem is translated to that of the spectral analysis of {\it Liouville Operator}. We use the method of positive commutators to investigate it. We construct a positive commutator on the lattice Fermion system, whose dispersion relation is \omega(k)=\cos k-\gamma.
