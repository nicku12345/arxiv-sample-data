Starting from the C_{\lambda}-extended oscillator algebras, we obtain a new deformed w_{\infty}-algebra. More precisely, we show that the C_{\lambda}-extended w_{\infty}-algebra generators may be expressed via the annihilation and creation operators of the C_{\lambda}-extended oscillator algebras a and a^{\dagger} as an infinite-dimensional extension of the realization of sp(2) algebra.
