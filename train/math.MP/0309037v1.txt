The star product and Moyal bracket are introduced using the coherent states corresponding to quantum systems with non-linear spectra. Two kinds of coherent state are considered. The first kind is the set of Gazeau-Klauder coherent states and the second kind are constructed following the Perelomov-Klauder approach. The particular case of the harmonic oscillator is also discussed.
