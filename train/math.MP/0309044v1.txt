A one-parameter symplectic group \{e^{t\dA}\}_{t\in\RR} derives proper canonical transformations on a Boson Fock space. It has been known that the unitary operator U_t implementing such a proper canonical transformation gives a projective unitary representation of \{e^{t\dA}\}_{t\in\RR} and that U_t can be expressed as a normal-ordered form. We rigorously derive the self-adjoint operator \D(\dA) and a phase factor e^{i\int_0^t\TA(s)ds} with a real-valued function \TA such that U_t=e^{i\int_0^t\TA(s)ds}e^{it\D(\dA)}. Key words: Canonical transformations(Bogoliubov transformations), symplectic groups, projective unitary representations, one-parameter unitary groups, infinitesimal self-adjoint generators, local factors, local exponents, normal-ordered quadratic expressions.
