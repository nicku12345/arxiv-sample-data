The Laplacian in spherical coordinates contains the squared radial momentum operator  p_r^2 = - r^{-1} \partial_r^2 r  which is Hermitian and positive. However as has been pointed out by various authors the ``radial momentum operator"  - i r^{-1} \partial_r r  is not Hermitian. The positive square root operator of  p_r^2  is found and also its inverse. We discuss the relation of these operators with Fourier transforms, the Hilbert transform and fractional integral operators.
