We investigate Lifshits-tail behaviour of the integrated density of states for a wide class of Schr\"odinger operators with positive random potentials. The setting includes alloy-type and Poissonian random potentials. The considered (single-site) impurity potentials f: \mathbbm{R}^d \to [0, \infty[  decay at infinity in an anisotropic way, for example, f(x_1,x_2)\sim (|x_1|^{\alpha_1}+|x_2|^{\alpha_2})^{-1} as  |(x_1,x_2)| \to \infty . As is expected from the isotropic situation, there is a so-called quantum regime with Lifshits exponent  d/2  if both \alpha_1 and \alpha_2 are big enough, and there is a so-called classical regime with Lifshits exponent depending on \alpha_1 and \alpha_2 if both are small. In addition to this we find two new regimes where the Lifshits exponent exhibits a mixture of quantum and classical behaviour. Moreover, the transition lines between these regimes depend in a nontrivial way on  \alpha_1 and \alpha_2 simultaneously.
