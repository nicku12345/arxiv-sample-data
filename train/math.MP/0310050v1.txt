At present the theory of skew-symmetric exterior differential forms has been developed. The closed exterior forms possess the invariant properties that are of great importance. The operators of the exterior form theory lie at the basis of the differential and integral operators of the field theory. However, the theory of exterior forms, being invariant one, does not answer the questions related to the evolutionary processes. In the work the readers are introduced to the skew-symmetric differential forms that possess evolutionary properties. They were called evolutionary ones. The radical distinction between the evolutionary forms and the exterior ones consists in the fact that the exterior forms are defined on manifolds with closed metric forms, whereas the evolutionary forms are defined on manifolds with unclosed metric forms. The mathematical apparatus of exterior and evolutionary forms allows description of discrete transitions, quantum steps, evolutionary processes, generation of various structures. These are radically new possibilities of the mathematical physics. A role of exterior and evolutionary forms in the mathematical physics is conditioned by the fact that they reflect properties of the conservation laws and allow elucidate a mechanism of evolutionary processes in material media, which lead to formatting physical fields.
