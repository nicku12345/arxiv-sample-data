We discuss the space-time determinantal random field which arises for the PNG model in one dimension and resembles the one for Dyson's Brownian motion. The information of interest for growth processes is carried by the edge statistics of the random field and therefore their universal scaling is related to the edge properties of Gaussian multi-matrix models.
