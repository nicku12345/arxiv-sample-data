We investigate the two-dimensional magnetic operator   H_{c_0,B,\beta} = {(-i\nabla -A)}^{2}-\beta\delta(.-\Gamma), where \Gamma is a smooth loop. The vector potential has the form A=c_0\bigg(\frac{-y}{{x^2+y^2}}; \frac{x}{{x^2+y^2}} \bigg)+ \frac{B}{2}\bigg(-y; x\bigg) ; B>0, c_0\in]0;1[. The asymptotics of negative eigenvalues of H_{c_0,B,\beta} for \beta \longrightarrow +\infty is found. We also prove that for large enough positive value of \beta the system exhibits persistent currents.
