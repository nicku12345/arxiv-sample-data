We find some new results regarding the existence, uniqueness, boundedness, stability and attractivity of the solutions of a class of initial-boundary-value problems characterized by a quasi-linear third order equation which may have non-autonomous forcing terms. The class includes equations arising in Superconductor Theory, Quantum Mechanics and in the Theory of Viscoelastic Materials.
