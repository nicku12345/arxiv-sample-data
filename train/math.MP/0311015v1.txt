We consider the grading of sl(n,\mathbb{C}) by the group \Pi_n of generalized Pauli matrices. The grading decomposes the Lie algebra into n^2-1 one--dimensional subspaces. In the article we demonstrate that the normalizer of grading decomposition of sl(n,\mathbb{C}) in \Pi_n is the group SL(2, \mathbb{Z}_n), where \mathbb{Z}_n is the cyclic group of order n. As an example we consider sl(3,\mathbb{C}) graded by \Pi_3 and all contractions preserving that grading. We show that the set of 48 quadratic equations for grading parameters splits into just two orbits of the normalizer of the grading in \Pi_3.
