In previous papers we extended the Lorentz and Poincare groups to include a set of Dirac boosts that give a direct correspondence with a set of generators which for spin 1/2 systems are proportional to the Dirac matrices. The groups are particularly useful for developing general linear wave equations beyond spin 1/2 systems. In this paper we develop explicit group properties of the extended Poincare group to obtain group parameters that will be useful for physical calculations in systems which manifest the group properties. The inclusion of space-time translations will allow future explorations of the gauge properties inherent in the group structure.
