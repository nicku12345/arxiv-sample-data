We propose a model of "Fundamental Symmetries" leading to a dynamical origin of mass, based on the concept of "Historical Time" and described by a relativistic Schrodinger-type equation. In this framework, the matter spectrum is obtained by excitation, at the level of internal structure, of a fundamental system composed of two constituents, the relativistic free masses of which are null, with harmonic interaction and a possible null-energy vacuum (ground) state.
