Every locally normal representation of a local chiral conformal quantum theory is covariant with respect to global conformal transformations, if this theory is diffeomorphism covariant in its vacuum representation.   The unitary, strongly continuous representation implementing conformal symmetry is constructed; it consists of operators which are inner in a global sense for the representation of the quantum theory. The construction is independent of positivity of energy and applies to all locally normal representations irrespective of their statistical dimensions (index).
