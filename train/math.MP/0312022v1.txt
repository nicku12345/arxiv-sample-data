Random non-Hermitian Jacobi matrices J_n of increasing dimension n are considered. We prove that the normalized eigenvalue counting measure of J_n converges weakly to a limiting measure \mu as n\to\infty. We also extend to the non-Hermitian case the Thouless formula relating \mu and the Lyapunov exponent of the second-order difference equation associated with the sequence J_n. The measure \mu is shown to be log-H\"older continuous.
