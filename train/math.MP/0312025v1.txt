In the Nelson model particles interact through a scalar massless field. For hydrogen-like atoms there is a nucleus of infinite mass and charge Ze, Z > 0, fixed at the origin and an electron of mass m and charge e. This system forms a bound state with binding energy E_{\rm bin} = me^4Z^2/2 to leading order in e. We investigate the radiative corrections to the binding energy and prove upper and lower bounds which imply that  E_{\rm bin} = me^4 Z^2/2 + c_0 e^6 + \Ow(e^7 \ln e) with explicit coefficient c_0 and independent of the ultraviolet cutoff. c_0 can be computed by perturbation theory, which however is only formal since for the Nelson Hamiltonian the smallest eigenvalue sits exactly at the bottom of the continuous spectrum.
