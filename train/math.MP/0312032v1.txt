We consider the "thermodynamic limit"of a d-dimensional lattice of hyperbolic dynamical systems on the 2-torus, interacting via weak and nearest neighbor coupling. We prove that the SRB measure is analytic in the strength of the coupling. The proof is based on symbolic dynamics techniques that allow us to map the SRB measure into a Gibbs measure for a spin system on a (d+1)-dimensional lattice. This Gibbs measure can be studied by an extension (decimation) of the usual "cluster expansion" techniques.
