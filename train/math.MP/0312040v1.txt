The so-called Gazeau-Klauder and Perelomov coherent states are introduced for an arbitrary quantum system. We give also the general framework to construct the generalized intelligent states which minimize the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty relation. As illustration, the P\"oschl-Teller potentials of trigonometric type will be chosen. We show the advantage of the analytical representations of Gazeau-Klauder and Perelomov coherent states in obtaining the generalized intelligent states in analytical way.
