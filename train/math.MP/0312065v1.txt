We study the regular representation \rho_\zeta of the single-fermion algebra {\cal A}_\zeta, i.e., c^2=c^{+2}=0, cc^++c^+c=\zeta~1, for \zeta\in [0,1]. We show that \rho_0 is a four-dimensional nonunitary representation of {\cal A}_0 which is faithfully irreducible (it does not admit a proper faithful subrepresentation). Moreover, \rho_0 is the minimal faithfully irreducible representation of {\cal A}_0 in the sense that every faithful representation of {\cal A}_0 has a subrepresentation that is equivalent to \rho_0. We therefore identify a classical fermion with \rho_0 and view its quantization as the deformation: \zeta:0\to 1 of \rho_\zeta. The latter has the effect of mapping \rho_0 into the four-dimensional, unitary, (faithfully) reducible representation \rho_1 of {\cal A}_1 that is precisely the representation associated with a Dirac fermion.
