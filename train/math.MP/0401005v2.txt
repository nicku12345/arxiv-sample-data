Let us denote {\cal V}, the finite dimensional vector spaces of functions of the form \psi(x) = p_n(x) + f(x) p_m(x) where p_n(x) and p_m(x) are arbitrary polynomials of degree at most n and m in the variable x while f(x) represents a fixed function of x. Conditions on m,n and f(x) are found such that families of linear differential operators exist which preserve {\cal V}. A special emphasis is accorded to the cases where the set of differential operators represents the envelopping algebra of some abstract algebra.
