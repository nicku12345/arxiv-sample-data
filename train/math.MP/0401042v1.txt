This erratum corrects the proof given in \cite{E1,E2} about the existence of  3D  Skyrmions. This is done by changing the arguments of the proof while remaining in the same framework of concentration-compactness. Note however that the use of this method is here different of most of what has been done with it so far. In that sense, this new proof has some interest by itself. The proof given here is self-contained. I thank F. Lin and Y. Yang for having pointed out to me that there were gaps in my proofs.
