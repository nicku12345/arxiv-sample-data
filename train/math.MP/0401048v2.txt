Owing to the analogy between the Connes-Kreimer theory of the renormalization and the integrable systems, we derive the differential equations of the unit mass for the renormalized character \phi_+ and the counter term \phi_-. We give another proof for the scattering type formula of \phi_-. The differential equation of the counter term of coordinate on {\mathbb P}^1 is also given. The hierarchy of the renormalization groups is defined as the integrable systems.
