New Frobenius structures on Hurwitz spaces are found. A Hurwitz space is considered as a real manifold; therefore the number of coordinates is twice as large as the number of coordinates on Hurwitzs Frobenius manifolds of Dubrovin. Simple branch points of a ramified covering and their complex conjugates play the role of canonical coordinates on the constructed Frobenius manifolds. Corresponding solutions to WDVV equations and G-functions are obtained.
