The Schroedinger equation is considered on the line when the potential is real valued, compactly supported, and square integrable. The nonuniqueness is analyzed in the recovery of such a potential from the data consisting of the ratio of a corresponding reflection coefficient to the transmission coefficient. It is shown that there are a discrete number of potentials corresponding to the data and that their L^2-norms are related to each other in a simple manner. All those potentials are identified, and it is shown how an additional estimate on the L^2-norm in the data can uniquely identify the corresponding potential. The recovery is illustrated with some explicit examples.
