We examine the three-step master equation from the standpoint of the general solution of the associated discrete Riccati equation. We report by this means stationary master solutions depending on a free constant parameter, denoted by D, that should be negative in order to assure the positivity of the solution. These solutions correspond to different discrete Markov processes characterized by the value of D, which is related to specific renormalizations of the transition rates of the chain of states
