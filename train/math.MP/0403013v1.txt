Scattering of nonstationary electromagnetic fields from axially symmetrical bodies is numerically investigated. Simulations are performed using the time- and frequency-domain approaches. Computational results obtained for a finite perfectly conducting cylinder, perfectly conducting cone, and cone covered with a dielectric layer are analyzed.
