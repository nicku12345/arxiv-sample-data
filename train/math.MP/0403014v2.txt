For a system of M coupled Schroedinger equations, the relationship is found between the vector-valued norming constants and M+1 spectra corresponding to the same potential matrix but different boundary conditions. Under a special choice of particular boundary conditions, this equation for norming vectors has a unique solution. The double set of norming vectors and associated spectrum of one of the M+1 boundary value problems uniquely specifies the matrix of potentials in the multichannel Schroedinger equation.
