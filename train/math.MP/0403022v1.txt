The recent factorization scheme that we introduced for nonlinear polynomial ODEs in math-ph/0401040 is applied to the interesting case of damped wave equations with cubic nonlinearities. Traveling kink solutions are possible in the plane defined by the kink velocity versus the damping coefficient only along hyperbolas that are plotted herein
