In this paper we examine the zero and first order eigenvalue fluctuations for the \beta-Hermite and \beta-Laguerre ensembles, using the matrix models we described in \cite{dumitriu02}, in the limit as \beta \to \infty. We find that the fluctuations are described by Gaussians of variance O(1/\beta), centered at the roots of a corresponding Hermite (Laguerre) polynomial. We also show that the approximation is very good, even for small values of \beta, by plotting exact level densities versus sum of Gaussians approximations.
