In this Letter we present an exact calculation of the effective potential which appears on a helicoidal strip. This potential leads to the appearance of lcalized states at a distance \xi_0 from the central axis. The twist \omega of the strip plays the role of a magnetic field and is responsable for the appearance of these localized states and an effective transverse electric field thus this is reminiscent of the quantum Hall effect. At very low temperatures the twisted configuration of the strip may be stalilized by the electronic states.
