We consider a semi-classical completely integrable system defined by a \hbar-pseudodifferential operator \hat{H} on the torus \mathbb{T}^{d}. In order to study perturbed operators of the form \hat{H}+\hbar^{\kappa}\hat{K}, where \hat{K} is an arbitrary pseudodifferential operator and \kappa>0, we prove the conjugacy to a suitable normal form. This is then used to construct a large number of quasimodes.
