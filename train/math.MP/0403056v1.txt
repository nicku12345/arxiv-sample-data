An analog of Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko integral equations for multi- dimensional Delsarte transmutation operators is constructed by means of studying their differential-geometric structure based on the classical Lagrange identity for a formally conjugated pair of differential operators. An extension of the method for the case of affine pencils of differential operators is suggested.
