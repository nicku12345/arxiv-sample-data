We prove Maslov's conjecture that the structure of the type of square root of a quadratic form is the unique structure of weakly singular solutions (with a point singularity) of the shallow water equations with the properties of asymptotic self-similarity and stability. This fact plays a key role in the study of the dynamics of vortical singularities and their applications to the description of typhoon trajectories.
