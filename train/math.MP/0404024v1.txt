The main objective consists in endowing the elementary particles with an algebraic space-time structure in the perspective of unifying quantum field theory and general relativity: this is realized in the frame of the Langlands global program based on the infinite dimensional representations of algebraic groups over adele rings. In this context, algebraic quanta, strings and fields of particles are introduced.
