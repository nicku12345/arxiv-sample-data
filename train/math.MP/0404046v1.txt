It is shown that physical fields are formed by physical structures, which in their properties are differential-geometrical structures.   These results have been obtained due to using the mathematical apparatus of skew-symmetric differential forms.   This apparatus discloses the controlling role of the conservation laws in evolutionary processes, which proceed in material media and lead to origination of physical structures and forming physical fields and manifolds.
