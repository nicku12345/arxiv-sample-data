Let   F(u_\ve)+\ve(u_\ve-w)=0 \eqno{(1)}   where F is a nonlinear operator in a Hilbert space H, w\in H is an element, and \ve>0 is a parameter. Assume that F(y)=0, and F'(y) is not a boundedly invertible operator. Sufficient conditions are given for the existence of the solution to \eqref{e1.1} and for the convergence \lim_{\ve\to 0}\|u_\ve-y\|=0. An example of applications is considered. In this example F is a nonlinear integral operator.
