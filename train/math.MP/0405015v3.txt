We study the representation theory of the superconformal algebra W_k(g,f_{\theta}) associated with a minimal gradation of g. Here, g is a simple finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra with a non-degenerate, even supersymmetric invariant bilinear form. Thus, W_k(g,f_{\theta}) can be one of the well-known superconformal algebras including the Virasoro algebra, the Bershadsky-Polyakov algebra, the Neveu-Schwarz algebra, the Bershadsky-Knizhnik algebras, the N=2 superconformal algebra, the N=4 superconformal algebra, the N=3 superconformal algebra and the big N=4 superconformal algebra.   We prove the conjecture of V. G. Kac, S.-S. Roan and M. Wakimoto for W_k(g,f_{\theta}). In fact, we show that any irreducible highest weight character of W_k(g,f_{\theta}) at any level k\in C is determined by the corresponding irreducible highest weight character of the Kac-Moody affinization of g.
