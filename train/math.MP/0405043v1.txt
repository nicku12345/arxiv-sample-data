We study the problem of Bose-Einstein condensation in the perfect Bose gas in the canonical ensemble, in anisotropically dilated rectangular parallelpipeds (Casimir boxes). We prove that in the canonical ensemble for these anisotropic boxes there is the same type of generalized Bose-Einstein condensation as in the grand-canonical ensemble for the equivalent geometry. However the amount of condensate in the individual states is different in some cases and so are the fluctuations.
