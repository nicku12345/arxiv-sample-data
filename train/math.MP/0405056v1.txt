In this paper we will analyze the Fantappie group and its properties in connection with Cantorian space-time. Our attention will be focused on the possibility of extending special relativity. The cosmological consequences of such extension appear relevant, since thanks to the Fantappie group, the model of the Big Bang and that of stationary state become compatible. In particular, if we abandon the idea of the existence of only one time gauge, since we do not see the whole Universe but only a projection, the two models become compatible. In the end we will see the effects of the projective fractal geometry also on the galactic and extra-galactic dynamics.
