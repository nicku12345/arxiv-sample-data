The diffraction spectra of lattice gas models on Z^d with finite-range ferromagnetic two-body interaction above T_c or with certain rates of decay of the potential are considered. We show that these diffraction spectra almost surely exist, are Z^d-periodic and consist of a pure point part and an absolutely continuous part with continuous density.
