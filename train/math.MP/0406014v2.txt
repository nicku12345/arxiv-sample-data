We prove upper bounds on the ground state energies of the one- and two-component charged Bose gases. The upper bound for the one-component gas agrees with the high density asymptotic formula proposed by L. Foldy in 1961. The upper bound for the two-component gas agrees in the large particle number limit with the asymptotic formula conjectured by F. Dyson in 1967. Matching asymptotic lower bounds for these systems were proved in references \cite{LS} and \cite{LS2}. The formulas of Foldy and Dyson which are based on Bogolubov's pairing theory have thus been validated.
