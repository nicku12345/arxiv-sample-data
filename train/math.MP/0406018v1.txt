We construct the Gibbs state for \nu-dimensional quantum crystal with site displacements from \R^d, d\geq 1, and with a one-site \textit{non-polynomial} double-well potential, which has \textit{harmonic} asymptotic growth at infinity. We prove the uniqueness of the corresponding {\it Euclidean Gibbs measure} (EGM) in the \textit{light-mass regime} for the crystal particles. The corresponding state is constructed via a cluster expansion technique for an arbitrary temperature T\geq 0. We show that for all T\geq 0 the Gibbs state (correlation functions) is analytic with respect to external field conjugated to displacements provided that the mass of particles m is less than a certain value m_* >0. The high temperature regime is also discussed.
