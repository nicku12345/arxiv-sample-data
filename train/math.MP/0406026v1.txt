Consider in L^2 (\R^l) the operator family H(\epsilon):=P_0(\hbar,\omega)+\epsilon Q_0. P_0 is the quantum harmonic oscillator with diophantine frequency vector \om, Q_0 a bounded pseudodifferential operator with symbol holomorphic and decreasing to zero at infinity, and \ep\in\R. Then there exists \ep^\ast >0 with the property that if |\ep|<\ep^\ast there is a diophantine frequency \om(\ep) such that all eigenvalues E_n(\hbar,\ep) of H(\ep) near 0 are given by the quantization formula E_\alpha(\hbar,\ep)= {\cal E}(\hbar,\ep)+\la\om(\ep),\alpha\ra\hbar +|\om(\ep)|\hbar/2 + \ep O(\alpha\hbar)^2, where \alpha is an l-multi-index.
