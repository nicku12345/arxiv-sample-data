Within CPT-symmetric quantum mechanics the most elementary differential form of the charge operator C is assumed. A closed-form integrability of the related coupled differential self-consistency conditions and a natural embedding of the Hamiltonians in a supersymmetric scheme is achieved. For a particular choice of the interactions the rigorous mathematical consistency of the construction is scrutinized suggesting that quantum systems with non-self-adjoint Hamiltonians may admit probabilistic interpretation even in presence of a manifest breakdown of both T symmetry (i.e., Hermiticity) and PT symmetry.
