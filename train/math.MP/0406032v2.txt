Motivated by the analysis of Schr\"odinger operators with periodic potentials we consider the following abstract situation: Let \Delta_X be the Laplacian on a non-compact Riemannian covering manifold X with a discrete isometric group \Gamma acting on it such that the quotient X/\Gamma is a compact manifold. We prove the existence of a finite number of spectral gaps for the operator \Delta_X associated with a suitable class of manifolds X with non-abelian covering transformation groups \Gamma. This result is based on the non-abelian Floquet theory as well as the Min-Max-principle. Groups of type I specify a class of examples satisfying the assumptions of the main theorem.
