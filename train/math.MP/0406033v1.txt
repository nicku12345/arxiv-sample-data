We consider the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform C_t for a compact group K, introduced in B. C. Hall, J. Funct. Anal. 122 (1994), 103-151. Let K_C denote the complexification of K. We give a necessary-and-sufficient pointwise growth condition for a holomorphic function on K_C to be the image under C_t of a C-infinity function on K. We also characterize the image under C_t of Sobolev spaces on K. The proofs make use of a holomorphic version of the Sobolev embedding theorem.
