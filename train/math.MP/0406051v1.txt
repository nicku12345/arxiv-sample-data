We give a geometrical characterization of \lambda-prolongations of vector fields, and hence of \lambda-symmetries of ODEs. This allows an extension to the case of PDEs and systems of PDEs; in this context the central object is a horizontal one-form \mu, and we speak of \mu-prolongations of vector fields and \mu-symmetries of PDEs. We show that these are as good as standard symmetries in providing symmetry reduction of PDEs and systems, and explicit invariant solutions.
