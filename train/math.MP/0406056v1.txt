We adapt to mixtures the procedure of invariance of external power under the action of SO(3) to deduce balance equations. The two classical axioms about the growths of momentum and moment of momentum are derived with the help of a rule on the structure of the total power. We discuss also the covariance of the balance equations of each constituent and the nature of the constituent stress.
