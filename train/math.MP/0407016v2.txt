A numerical simulation shows that a massive Schwinger model used to formulate solutions to charge density wave (CDW) transport is insufficient for transport of soliton- anti soliton pairs through a pinning gap model of CDW transport. However, a model Hamiltonian with Peierls condensation energy used to couple adjacent chains (or transverse wave vectors) permits formation of soliton - anti soliton pairs that could be used to transport CDW through a potential barrier. There are analogies between this construction and the false vacuum hypothesis used for showing a necessary and sufficient condition for wave functionals for formation of soliton - anti soliton pairs. This can be established by either use of the Bogomol'nyi inequality or through an experimental artifact resulting through use of the false vacuum hypothesis to obtain a proportional distance between the soliton - anti soliton pair charge centers
