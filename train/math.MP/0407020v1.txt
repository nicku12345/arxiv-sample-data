We consider the supersymmetric quantum mechanical system which is obtained by dimensionally reducing d=6, N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group U(1) and a single charged hypermultiplet. Using the deformation method and ideas introduced by Porrati and Rozenberg, we present a detailed proof of the existence of a normalizable ground state for this system.
