Exotic baryons have been predicted in the context of the chiral soliton model. These states have been identified with strangeness +1 resonances reported in a number of experiments. In this talk it is pointed out that the technique used to quantize these solitons in most conventional treatments depends on dynamical assumptions beyond those in standard large Nc physics. These additional assumptions have never been justified.
