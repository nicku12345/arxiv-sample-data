We continue the study of quantum electrodynamics on a three dimensional torus as a limit of a lattice gauge theory. In this paper we give a preliminary treatment of the renormalization group flow. We study the propagators which arise under multiple block spin averaging, both in global and local versions. We also study low order perturbation theory. However we do not control remainders. This is left to the more complete treatment of the following paper.
