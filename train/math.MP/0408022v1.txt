We show that every tempered distribution, which is a solution of the (homogenous) Klein-Gordon equation, admits a ``tame'' restriction to the characteristic (hyper)surface \{x^0+x^n=0\} in (1+n)-dimensional Minkowski space and is uniquely determined by this restriction. The restriction belongs to the space \cS'_{\partial_-}(\R^n) which we have introduced in \cite{PullJMP}. Moreover, we show that every element of \cS'_{\partial_-}(\R^n) appears as the ``tame'' restriction of a solution of the (homogeneous) Klein-Gordon equation.
