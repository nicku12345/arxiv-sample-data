The infinite-volume limit behavior of the 2d Ising model under possibly strong random boundary conditions is studied. The model exhibits chaotic size-dependence at low temperatures and we prove that the `+' and `-' phases are the only almost sure limit Gibbs measures, assuming that the limit is taken along a sparse enough sequence of squares. In particular, we provide an argument to show that in a sufficiently large volume a typical spin configuration under a typical boundary condition contains no interfaces. In order to exclude mixtures as possible limit points, a detailed multi-scale contour analysis is performed.
