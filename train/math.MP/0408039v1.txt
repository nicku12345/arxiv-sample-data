In this note, we apply canonical quantization to the self-dual particle system describing the motion of poles to a higher rank solution of the KP hierarchy, explicitly determining both the quantum Hamiltonian and the wave function. It is verified that the quantum Hamiltonian is trivially bispectral (that is, that the wave function can be taken to be symmetric) as predicted by a widely held hypothesis of mathematical physics.
