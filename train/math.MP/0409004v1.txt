We give a geometrical interpretation of the notion of \mu-prolongations of vector fields and of the related concept of \mu-symmetry for partial differential equations (extending to PDEs the notion of \lambda-symmetry for ODEs). We give in particular a result concerning the relationship between \mu-symmetries and standard exact symmetries. The notion is also extended to the case of conditional and partial symmetries, and we analyze the relation between local \mu-symmetries and nonlocal standard symmetries.
