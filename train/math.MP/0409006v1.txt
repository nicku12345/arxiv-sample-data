This article is a short introduction to the general topic of quantum spin systems. After a brief sketch of the history of the subject, the standard mathematical framework for formulating problems and results in quantum spin systems is described. Then, three short sections are devoted to Spontaneaous Symmetry Breaking, Phase transitions, and Dynamcis.
