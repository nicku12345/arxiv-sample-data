A condition on a set of truncated Wightman functions is formulated and shown to permit the construction of the Hilbert space structure included in the Morchio--Strocchi modified Wightman axioms. The truncated Wightman functions which are obtained by analytic continuation of the (truncated) Schwinger functions of Euclidean scalar random fields and covariant vector (quaternionic) random fields constructed via convoluted generalized white noise, are then shown to satisfy this condition. As a consequence such random fields provide relativistic models for indefinite metric quantum field theory, in dimension 4 (vector case), respectively in all dimensions (scalar case).
