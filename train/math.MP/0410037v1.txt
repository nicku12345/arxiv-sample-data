We study the effect of electromagnetic radiation on the condensate of a Bose gas. In an earlier paper we considered the problem for two simple models showing the cooperative effect between Bose-Einstein condensation and superradiance. In this paper we formalise the model suggested by Ketterle et al in which the Bose condensate particles have a two level structure. We present a soluble microscopic Dicke type model describing a thermodynamically stable system. We find the equilibrium states of the system and compute the thermodynamic functions giving explicit formulae expressing the cooperative effect between Bose-Einstein condensation and superradiance.
