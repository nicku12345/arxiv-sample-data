We consider the dynamics of N boson systems interacting through a pair potential N^{-1} V_a(x_i-x_j) where V_a (x) = a^{-3} V (x/a). We denote the solution to the N-particle Schr\"odinger equation by \psi_{N, t}. Recall that the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the GP hierarchy is an infinite BBGKY hierarchy of equations so that if u_t solves the GP equation, then the family of k-particle density matrices \{\otimes_k u_t, k\ge 1 \} solves the GP hierarchy. Under the assumption that a = N^{-\eps} for 0 < \eps < 3/5, we prove that as N\to \infty the limit points of the k-particle density matrices of \psi_{N,t} are solutions of the GP hierarchy with the coupling constant in the nonlinear term of the GP equation given by \int V(x) dx. The uniqueness of the solutions to this hierarchy remains an open question.
