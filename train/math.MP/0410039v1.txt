A simple and efficient variational method is introduced to accelerate the convergence of the eigenenergy computations for a Hamiltonian H with singular potentials. Closed-form analytic expressions in N dimensions are obtained for the matrix elements of H with respect to the eigenfunctions of a soluble singular problem with two free parameters A and B. The matrix eigenvalues are then optimized with respect to A and B for a given N. Applications, convergence rates, and comparisons with earlier work are discussed in detail.
