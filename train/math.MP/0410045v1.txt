A representation of the static MHD equilibrium system in coordinates connected with magnetic surfaces is suggested. It is used for producing families of non-trivial 3D exact solutions of isotropic and anisotropic plasma equilibria in different geometries, with and without dynamics, and often without geometrical symmetries. The ways of finding coordinates in which exact equilibria can be constructed are discussed; examples and their applications as physical models are presented.
