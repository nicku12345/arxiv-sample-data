Using Bogomil'nyi inequality and the vanishing of topological charge at the unset of nucleation of a new universe permits a simpler,more direct insight into how topological defects (kinks and anti kinks) contribute to initial conditions at the onset of inflationary cosmology. Currently, there are few bridges between initial conditions for cosmological inflation and the nucleation of a new universe. This presentation shows how this can be done while still employing Venezianos prescription for forming a link between quanta of length, the magnitude of a dilaton field and forces gravitational and gauge alike.
