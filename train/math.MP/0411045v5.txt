To simplify phenomenology modeling used for charge density wave (CDW)transport, we apply a wavefunctional formulation of tunneling Hamiltonians to a physical transport problem characterized by a perturbed washboard potential. To do so, we consider tunneing between states that are wavefunctionals of a scalar quantum field. I-E curves that match Zener curves - used to fit data experimentally with wavefunctionals congruent with the false vacuum hypothesis. This has a very strong convergence with electron-positron pair production representations.The similarities in plot behavior of the current values after the threshold electric field values argue in favor of the Bardeen pinning gap paradigm proposed for quasi-one-dimensional metallic transport problems.
