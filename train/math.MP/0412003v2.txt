A problem of electromagnetic (EM) plane wave diffraction on a moving half-plane in a homogeneous and isotropic medium is considered. It is shown, that unlike the stationary case, the shadow boundaries of the incident and reflected wave are not parallel to propagation directions of those waves. Other diffraction phenomena reported earlier for objects with moving edges, are also observed here.
