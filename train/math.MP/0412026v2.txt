The effective mass \mass of the the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonain with ultraviolet cutoff \Lambda and the bare mass m in nonrelativistic QED with spin 1/2 is investigated. Analytic properties of \mass in coupling constant e are shown and explicit forms of constants a_1(\Lambda/m) and a_2(\Lambda/m) depending on \Lambda/m such that \mass/m =1 + a_1(\Lambda/m) e^2+ a_2(\Lambda/m) e^4+ {\mathcal O}(e^6) are given. It is shown that the spin interaction enhances the effective mass and that there exist strictly positive constants b_1,b_2, c_1 and c_2 such that \d b_1\leq \lim_{\Lambda\to\infty}   \frac{a_1(\Lamdda/m)}{\log (\Lambda/m)}\leq b_2, c_1\leq \lim_{\Lambda\to\infty} \frac{a_2(\Lambda/m)}{(\Lambda/m)^2}\leq -c_2. In particular a_2(\Lambda/m) does not diverges as \pm [\log(\Lambda/m)]^2 but -(\Lambda/m)^2.
