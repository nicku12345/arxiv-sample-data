This paper is my contribution to the planned publication Recent Perspectives in Random Matrix Theory (Cambridge University Press). Addressed is the problem of computing spacing distributions in the bulk for the three symmetry classes orthogonal, unitary and symplectic. Emphasis is placed on the role of Painleve transcendents.
