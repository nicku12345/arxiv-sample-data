We study spectra of Schr\"odinger operators on \RR^d. First we consider a pair of operators which differ by a compactly supported potential, as well as the corresponding semigroups. We prove almost exponential decay of the singular values \mu_n of the difference of the semigroups as n\to \infty and deduce bounds on the spectral shift function of the pair of operators.   Thereafter we consider alloy type random Schr\"odinger operators. The single site potential u is assumed to be non-negative and of compact support. The distributions of the random coupling constants are assumed to be H\"older continuous. Based on the estimates for the spectral shift function, we prove a Wegner estimate which implies H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states.
