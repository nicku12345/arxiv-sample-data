Classical r-matrices of the three-dimensional real Lie bialgebras are obtained. In this way all three-dimensional real coboundary Lie bialgebras and their types (triangular, quasitriangular or factorizable) are classified. Then, by using the Sklyanin bracket, the Poisson structures on the related Poisson-Lie groups are obtained.
