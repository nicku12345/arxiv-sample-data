We study zero modes of two-dimensional Pauli operators with Aharonov--Bohm fluxes in the case when the solenoids are arranged in periodic structures like chains or lattices. We also consider perturbations to such periodic systems which may be infinite and irregular but they are always supposed to be sufficiently scarce.
