We wish to demonstrate how the presence of a dynamic cosmological parameter, plus a model of the universe as a quantum computer can be combined to give us a picture of early universe inflationary physics which is quite non linear, with a distinct bifurcation. We claim that the bifurcation is linked to conditions which falsify initial conditions for casually continuous space times in the bridge between pre inflation to inflationary cosmology. And also give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a wormhole bridge between a prior contracting universe, and our present universe via a time dependent version of the Wheeler DeWitt equation.
