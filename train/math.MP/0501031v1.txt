In this work, we discuss the scattering theory of local, relativistic quantum fields with indefinite metric. Since the results of Haag--Ruelle theory do not carry over to the case of indefinite metric, we propose an axiomatic framework for the construction of in- and out- states, such that the LSZ asymptotic condition can be derived from the assumptions. The central mathematical object for this construction is the collection of mixed vacuum expectation values of local, in- and out- fields, called the ``form factor functional'', which is required to fulfill a Hilbert space structure condition. Given a scattering matrix with polynomial transfer functions, we then construct interpolating, local, relativistic quantum fields with indefinite metric, which fit into the given scattering framework.
