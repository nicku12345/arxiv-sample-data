Quantum fields are known to violate all the pointwise energy conditions of classical general relativity. We review the subject of quantum energy inequalities: lower bounds satisfied by weighted averages of the stress-energy tensor, which may be regarded as the vestiges of the classical energy conditions after quantisation. Contact is also made with thermodynamics and related issues in quantum mechanics, where such inequalities find analogues in sharp Gaarding inequalities.
