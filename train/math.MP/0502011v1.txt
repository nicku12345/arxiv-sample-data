Using conformal coordinates associated with projective conformal relativity we obtain a conformal Klein-Gordon partial differential equation. As a particular case we present and discuss a conformal `radial' d'Alembert-like equation. As a by-product we show that this `radial' equation can be identified with a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger-like equation in which the potential is exactly the second P\"oschl-Teller potential.
