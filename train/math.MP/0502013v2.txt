Construction of an infinite dimensional differentiable manifold {\mathbb R}^{\infty} not modelled on any Banach space is proposed. Definition, metric and differential structures of a Weyl algebra and a Weyl algebra bundle are presented. Continuity of the \circ-product in the Tichonov topology is proved. Construction of the *-product of the Fedosov type in terms of theory of connection in a fibre bundle is explained.
