We consider a charged particle following the boundary of a two-dimensional domain because a homogeneous magnetic field is applied. We develop the basic scattering theory for the corresponding quantum mechanical edge states. The scattering phase attains a limit for large magnetic fields which we interpret in terms of classical trajectories.
