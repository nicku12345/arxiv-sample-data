In the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics we derive a necessary condition for four Coulomb charges (m_{1}^+, m_{2}^-, m_{3}^+, m_{4}^-), where all masses are assumed finite, to form the stable system. The obtained stability condition is physical and is expressed through the required minimal ratio of Jacobi masses. In particular this provides the rigorous proof that the hydrogen-antihydrogen molecule is unstable. This is the first result of this sort for four particles.
