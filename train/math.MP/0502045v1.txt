Dynamics of quantum systems which are perturbed by linear coupling to the reservoir stochastically can be studied in terms of quantum stochastic differential equations (for example, quantum stochastic Liouville equation and quantum Langevin equation). To work it out one needs definition of quantum Brownian motion. Since till very recent times only its boson version has been known, in present paper we demonstrate definition which makes possible consideration also for fermion Brownian motion.
