Group classification of systems of two coupled nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation with a general diffusion matrix started in papers math-ph/0411027,, math-ph/0411028 is completed in present paper where all non-equivalent equations with triangular diffusion matrix are classified.   In addition, symmetries of diffusion systems with nilpotent diffusion matrix and additional first order derivative terms are described.
