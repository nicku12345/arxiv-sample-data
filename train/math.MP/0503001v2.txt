We consider random Schr\"odinger equations on \bR^d or \bZ^d for d\ge 3 with uncorrelated, identically distributed random potential. Denote by \lambda the coupling constant and \psi_t the solution with initial data \psi_0. Suppose that the space and time variables scale as x\sim \lambda^{-2 -\kappa/2}, t \sim \lambda^{-2 -\kappa} with 0< \kappa \leq \kappa_0, where \kappa_0 is a sufficiently small universal constant. We prove that the expectation value of the Wigner distribution of \psi_t, \bE W_{\psi_{t}} (x, v), converges weakly to a solution of a heat equation in the space variable x for arbitrary L^2 initial data in the weak coupling limit \lambda \to 0. The diffusion coefficient is uniquely determined by the kinetic energy associated to the momentum v.
