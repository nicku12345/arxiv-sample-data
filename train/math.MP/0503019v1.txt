Solution of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation perturbed by small external force is investigated. The perturbation is represented by finite collections of harmonics. The frequencies of the perturbation vary slowly and pass through the resonant values consecutively. The resonances lead to the sequence of the wave packets with the different fast oscillated carriers. Full asymptotic description of this process is presented.
