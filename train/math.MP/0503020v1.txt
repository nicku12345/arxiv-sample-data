We prove bispectral duality for the generalized Calogero-Moser-Sutherland systems related to configurations A_{n,2}(m), C_n(l,m). The trigonometric axiomatics of Baker-Akhiezer function is modified, the dual difference operators of rational Macdonald type and the Baker-Akhiezer functions related to both series are explicitly constructed.
