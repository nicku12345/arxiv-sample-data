In this paper we obtain asymptotic formulas of arbitrary order for the Bloch eigenvalues and Bloch functions of the Schrodinger operator of arbitrary dimension, with periodic, with respect to arbitrary lattice, potential. Moreover, we estimate the measure of the isoenergetic surfaces in the high energy region.
