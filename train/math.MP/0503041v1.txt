We study linear problems of mathematical physics in which the adiabatic approximation is used in the wide sense. Using the idea that all these problems can be treated as problems with operator-valued symbol, we propose a general regular scheme of adiabatic approximation based on operator methods. This scheme is a generalization of the Born-Oppenheimer and Maslov methods, the Peierls substitution, etc. The approach proposed in this paper allows one to obtain "effective" reduced equations for a wide class of states inside terms (i.e., inside modes, subregions of dimensional quantization, etc.) with the possible degeneration taken into account.
