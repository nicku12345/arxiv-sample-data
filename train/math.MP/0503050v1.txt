Starting from a faithful five-dimensional matrix representation of the group of two independent oscillators and applying the R-matrix method we generate some classes of deformed fermionic-bosonic quantum Hopf algebras. The corresponding Lie deformed superalgebras of type I--II, obtained by duality, are computed and a realization of generators of these deformed superalgebras are given in terms of the usual fermionic and bosonic creation and annihilation operators associated to the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator. Then, a generalized deformed annihilator is construted and their eigenstates are computed giving a new class of deformed coherent states.
