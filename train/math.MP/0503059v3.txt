A specific class of gauge theories is geometrically described in terms of fermions. In particular, it is shown how the geometrical frame presented naturally includes spontaneous symmetry breaking of Yang-Mills gauge theories without making use of a Higgs potential. In more physical terms, it is shown that the Yukawa coupling of fermions, together with gravity, necessarily yields a symmetry reduction provided the fermionic mass is considered as a globally well-defined concept. The structure of this symmetry breaking is shown to be compatible with the symmetry breaking that is induced by the Higgs potential of the minimal Standard Model. As a consequence, it is shown that the fermionic mass has a simple geometrical interpretation in terms of curvature and that the (semi-classical)"fermionic vacuum" determines the intrinsic geometry of space-time. We also discuss the issue of "fermion doubling" in some detail and introduce a specific projection onto the "physical sub-space" that is motivated from the Standard Model.
