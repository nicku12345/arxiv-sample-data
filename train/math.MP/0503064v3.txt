We study a class of Schr\"odinger operators on \Z^2 with a random potential decaying as |x|^{-\dex}, 0<\dex\leq\frac12, in the limit of small disorder strength \lambda. For the critical exponent \dex=\frac12, we prove that the localization length of eigenfunctions is bounded below by 2^{\lambda^{-\frac14+\eta}}, while for 0<\dex<\frac12, the lower bound is \lambda^{-\frac{2-\eta}{1-2\dex}}, for any \eta>0. These estimates "interpolate" between the lower bound \lambda^{-2+\eta} due to recent work of Schlag-Shubin-Wolff for \dex=0, and pure a.c. spectrum for \dex>\frac12 demonstrated in recent work of Bourgain.
