Symmetry of SDYM equations for "physically restricted solution" with hermitian group element G=G^H in representation of Yang is described. Such transformation D^B pass some PRS to the new one of the same kind. Transformation contain 2N_G arbirtrary functions of two independent arguments, where N_G dimension of the gauge semi-simple algebra. These functions may be considered as additional parameters typical for Backlund aproach and by this reason we use term Backlund for this transformation.
