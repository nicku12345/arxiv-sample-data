We give explicit formulas for Hadamard's coefficients in terms of the tau-function of the KdV hierarchy. We show that some of the basic properties of these coefficients can be easily derived from these formulas. The first immediate corollary is the symmetry of Hadamard's coefficients about the diagonal. Another well known fact, which follows from this approach, is that on the diagonal Hadamard's coefficients determine the right-hand sides of the equations of the KdV hierarchy. The proof of the main result uses Sato theory and simple properties of Gegenbauer polynomials.
