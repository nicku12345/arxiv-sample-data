We present particular solutions for the following important nonlinear second order differential equations: modified Emden, generalized Lienard, convective Fisher, and generalized Burgers-Huxley. For the latter two equations these solutions are obtained in the travelling frame. All these particular solutions are the result of extending a simple and efficient factorization method that we developed in Phys. Rev. E 71 (2005) 046607
