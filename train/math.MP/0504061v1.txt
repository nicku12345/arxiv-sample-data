Poincare polinomials of hyperbolic Lie algebras, which are given by HA_2 and HA_3 in the Kac's notation, are calculated explicitly. The results show that there is a significant form for hyperbolic Poincare polinomials. Their explicit forms tend to be seen as the ratio of a properly chosen finite Poincare polinomial and a polinomial of finite degree. To this end, by choosing the Poincare polinomials of D_4 and D_5 Lie algebras, we show that these polinomials come out to be of order 11 and 19 respectively for HA_2 and HA_3.
