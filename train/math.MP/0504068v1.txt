In this paper we give a precise mathematical formulation of the relation between Bose condensation and long cycles and prove its validity for the perturbed mean field model of a Bose gas. We decompose the total density \rho=\rho_{{\rm short}}+\rho_{{\rm long}} into the number density of particles belonging to cycles of finite length (\rho_{{\rm short}}) and to infinitely long cycles (\rho_{{\rm long}}) in the thermodynamic limit. For this model we prove that when there is Bose condensation, \rho_{{\rm long}} is different from zero and identical to the condensate density. This is achieved through an application of the theory of large deviations. We discuss the possible equivalence of \rho_{{\rm long}}\neq 0 with off-diagonal long range order and winding paths that occur in the path integral representation of the Bose gas.
