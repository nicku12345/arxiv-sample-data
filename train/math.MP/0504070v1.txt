By using the Jacobi metric of the configuration space, and assuming ergodicity, we calculate the Boltzmann entropy S of a finite-dimensional system around a non-degenerate critical point of its potential energy V. We compare S with the entropy of a quantum or thermal system with effective potential V_{eff}. We examine conditions, up to first order in perturbation theory, under which these entropies are equal.
