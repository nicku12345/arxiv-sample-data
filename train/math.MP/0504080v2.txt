Let A be a (G, \chi)-Hopf algebra with bijection antipode and let M be a G-graded A-bimodule. We prove that there exists an isomorphism \mathrm{HH}^*_{\rm gr}(A, M)\cong{\rm Ext}^*_{A{-}{\rm gr}} (\K, {^{ad}(M)}), where \K is viewed as the trivial graded A-module via the counit of A, ^{ad} M is the adjoint A-module associated to the graded A-bimodule M and \mathrm{HH}_{\rm gr} denotes the G-graded Hochschild cohomology. As an application, we deduce that the cohomology of color Lie algebra L is isomorphic to the graded Hochschild cohomology of the universal enveloping algebra U(L), solving a question of M. Scheunert.
