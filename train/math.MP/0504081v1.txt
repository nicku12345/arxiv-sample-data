The Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein particles satisfy corresponding statistical distributions. In the phenomena of charge fractionalization and the fractional quantum Hall effect it is found that particles behave as if they are neither fermions nor bosons. Such particles are called anyons. The integral functions for bosons and fermions are available in the literature. However, there is no anyon integral function available. In this note we propose a pair of functions that interpolate, in some sense, between the gamma function and the zeta function, which we call "gamma-zeta" functions. It is pointed out that this pair of functions very naturally provides a representation of the anyon integral function.
