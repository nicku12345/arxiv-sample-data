The structure of the lower part (i.e. \epsilon -away below the two-boson threshold) spectrum of Fr\"ohlich's polaron Hamiltonian in the weak coupling regime is obtained in spatial dimension d\geq 3. It contains a single polaron branch defined for total momentum p\in G^{(0)} , where G^{(0)}\subset {\mathbb R}^d is a bounded domain, and, for any p\in {\mathbb R}^d, a manifold of polaron + one-boson states with boson momentum q in a bounded domain depending on p. The polaron becomes unstable and dissolves into the one boson manifold at the boundary of G^{(0)}. The dispersion laws and generalized eigenfunctions are calculated.
