The existence of a Lagrangian description for the second-order Riccati equation is analyzed and the results are applied to the study of two different nonlinear systems both related with the generalized Riccati equation. The Lagrangians are nonnatural and the forces are not derivable from a potential. The constant value E of a preserved energy function can be used as an appropriate parameter for characterizing the behaviour of the solutions of these two systems. In the second part the existence of two--dimensional versions endowed with superintegrability is proved. The explicit expressions of the additional integrals are obtained in both cases. Finally it is proved that the orbits of the second system, that represents a nonlinear oscillator, can be considered as nonlinear Lissajous figures
