A novel method for solving the linear radiative transport equation (RTE) in a three-dimensional homogeneous medium is proposed and illustrated with numerical examples. The method can be used with an arbitrary phase function A(s,s') with the constraint that it depends only on the angle between the angular variables s and s'. This corresponds to spherically symmetric (on average) random medium constituents. Boundary conditions are considered in the slab and half-space geometries. The approach developed in this paper is spectral. It allows for the expansion of the solution to the RTE in terms of analytical functions of angular and spatial variables to relatively high orders. The coefficients of this expansion must be computed numerically. However, the computational complexity of this task is much smaller than in the standard method of spherical harmonics. The solutions obtained are especially convenient for solving inverse problems associated with radiative transfer.
