Summation formulas are obtained for products of associated Lagurre polynomials by means of the Green's function K for the Hamiltonian H = -{d^2\over dx^2} + x^2 + Ax^{-2}, A > 0. K is constructed by an application of a Mercer type theorem that arises in connection with integral equations. The new approach introduced in this paper may be useful for the construction of wider classes of generating function.
