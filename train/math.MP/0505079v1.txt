A frequency domain model of multimode circular microresonators for filter applications in integrated optics is investigated. Analytical basis modes of 2D bent waveguides or curved interfaces are combined with modes of straight channels in a spatial coupled mode theory framework. Free of fitting parameters, the model allows to predict quite efficiently the spectral response of the microresonators. It turns out to be sufficient to take only a few dominant cavity modes into account. Comparisons of these simulations with computationally more expensive rigorous numerical calculations show a satisfactory agreement.
