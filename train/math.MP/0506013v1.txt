We construct a deformed C_{\lambda}-extended Heisenberg algebra in two-dimensional space using non-commuting coordinates which close an algebra depends on statistical parameter characterizing exotic particles. The obtained symmetry is nothing but an exotic particles algebra interpolating between bosonic and deformed fermionic algebras.
