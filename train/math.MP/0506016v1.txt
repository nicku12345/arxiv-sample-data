We review the Johnson-Moser rotation number and the K_0-theoretical gap labelling of Bellissard for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators. We compare them with two further gap-labels, one being related to the motion of Dirichlet eigenvalues, the other being a K_1-theoretical gap label. We argue that the latter provides a natural generalisation of the Johnson-Moser rotation number to higher dimensions.
