We consider solutions of the non-linear von Neumann equation involving Jacobi's elliptic functions sn, cn, and dn, and 3 linearly independent operators. In two cases one can construct a state-dependent Hamiltonian which is such that the corresponding non-linear von Neumann equation is solved by the given density operator. We prove that in a certain context these two cases are the only possibilities to obtain special solutions of this kind. Well-known solutions of the reduced Maxwell-Bloch equations produce examples of each of the two cases. Also known solutions of the non-linear von Neumann equation in dimension 3 are reproduced by the present approach.
