In a previous paper, we introduce a class of integrable spin Calogero-Moser systems associated with the classical dynamical r-matrices with spectral parameter. Here the main purpose is to give explicit solutions of several factorization problems associated with infinite dimensional Lie groupoids which will allow us to write down the solutions of these integrable models.
