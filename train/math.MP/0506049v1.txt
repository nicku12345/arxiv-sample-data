We consider the time-dependent Hamiltonian H(t)= {1 \over 2} p^2 -E(t) \cdot x + V(t,x) on L^2(R^n), where the external electric field E(t) and the short-range electric potential V(t,x) are time-periodic with the same period. It is well-known that the short-range notion depends on the mean value E\_0 of the external field. When E\_0=0, we show that the high energy limit of the scattering operators determines uniquely V(t,x). In the other case, the same result holds in dimension n \geq 3 for generic sghort-range potentials. In dimension 2, one has to assume a stronger decay on the electric potential.
