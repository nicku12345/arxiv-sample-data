We consider a classical Hamiltonian H on \mathbb{R}^{2d}, invariant by a finite group of symmetry G, whose Weyl quantization \hat{H} is a selfadjoint operator on L^2(\mathbb{R}^d). If \chi is an irreducible character of G, we investigate the spectrum of its restriction \hat{H}\_\chi to the symmetry subspace L^2\_\chi(\mathbb{R}^d) of L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) coming from the decomposition of Peter-Weyl. We give reduced semi-classical asymptotics of a regularised spectral density describing the spectrum of \hat{H}\_\chi near a non critical energy E\in\mathbb{R}. If \Sigma\_E:=\{H=E \} is compact, assuming that periodic orbits are non-degenerate in \Sigma\_E/G, we get a reduced Gutzwiller trace formula which makes periodic orbits of the reduced space \Sigma\_E/G appear. The method is based upon the use of coherent states, whose propagation was given in the work of M. Combescure and D. Robert.
