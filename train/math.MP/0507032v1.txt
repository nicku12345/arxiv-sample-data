A normal form transformation is carried out on the operators of a complete set of commuting observables in a multidimensional, integrable quantum system, mapping them by unitary conjugation into functions of the harmonic oscillators in the various degrees of freedom. The transformation works at the level of the Weyl symbols of the operators, which are manipulated as formal power series in hbar by use of the Moyal star product. It is assumed that the Weyl symbol of one of the operators (the Hamiltonian) has a generic, stable fixed point in phase space. The normal form transformation takes place in a neighborhood of this fixed point. Once the normal form has been achieved, the Einstein-Brillouin-Keller or torus quantization rule follows easily, including higher order corrections in hbar. Crucial parts of the normal form transformation are not obvious generalizations of the one-dimensional case, nor is final quantization rule. The result raises some issues of differential geometry not found in the one-dimensional case.
