This work addresses the problem of infrared mass renormalization for a scalar electron in a translation-invariant model of non-relativistic QED. We assume that the interaction of the electron with the quantized electromagnetic field comprises a fixed ultraviolet regularization and an infrared regularization parametrized by \sigma>0. For the value p=0 of the conserved total momentum of electron and photon field, bounds on the renormalized mass are established which are uniform in \sigma\to0, and the existence of a ground state is proved. For |p|>0 sufficiently small, bounds on the renormalized mass are derived for any fixed \sigma>0. A key ingredient of our proofs is the operator-theoretic renormalization group using the isospectral smooth Feshbach map. It provides an explicit, finite algorithm that determines the renormalized electron mass at p=0 to any given precision.
