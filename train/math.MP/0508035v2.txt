In this note, we study Schwarz's conjecture on application of Q-algebras to strict quantization. We prove that in the case of a torus with a constant Poisson structure, Schwarz's formalism gives the same star product as Rieffel \cite{rif:quantization}. We construct twisted Fock modules as examples of quantization dg-modules in the case of a compact K\"ahler manifold. In particular, we relate this construction on \complex\mathbb{P}^1 to representations of a fuzzy sphere.
