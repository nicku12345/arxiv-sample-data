We obtain criteria for shock wave (SW)existence in relativistic magnetic hydrodynamics with no suppositions about convexity of the equation of state. Method of derivation involves consideration of a continuous SW profile in presence of Landau-Lifshitz relativistic viscosity tensor with both non-zero viscosity coefficients.
