We consider the semiclassical limit of systems of autonomous PDE's in 1+1 space-time dimensions in a scattering regime. We assume the matrix valued coefficients are analytic in the space variable and we further suppose that the corresponding dispersion relation admits real-valued modes only with one-dimensional polarization subspaces. Hence a BKW-type analysis of the solutions is possible. We typically consider time-dependent solutions to the PDE which are carried asymptotically in the past and as x\to -\infty along one mode only and determine the piece of the solution that is carried for x\to +\infty along some other mode in the future. Because of the assumed non-degeneracy of the modes, such transitions between modes are exponentially small in the semiclassical parameter; this is an expression of the Landau-Zener mechanism. We completely elucidate the space-time properties of the leading term of this exponentially small wave, when the semiclassical parameter is small, for large values of x and t, when some avoided crossing of finite width takes place between the involved modes.
