We consider a classical Hamiltonian H on \mathbb{R}^{2d}, invariant by a Lie group of symmetry G, whose Weyl quantization \hat{H} is a selfadjoint operator on L^2(\mathbb{R}^d). If \chi is an irreducible character of G, we investigate the spectrum of its restriction \hat{H}\_{\chi} to the symmetry subspace L^2\_{\chi}(\mathbb{R}^d) of L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) coming from the decomposition of Peter-Weyl. We give semi-classical Weyl asymptotics for the eigenvalues counting function of \hat{H}\_{\chi} in an interval of \mathbb{R}, and interpret it geometrically in terms of dynamics in the reduced space \mathbb{R}^{2d}/G. Besides, oscillations of the spectral density of \hat{H}\_{\chi} are described by a Gutzwiller trace formula involving periodic orbits of the reduced space, corresponding to quasi-periodic orbits of \mathbb{R}^{2d}.
