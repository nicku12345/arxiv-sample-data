Higher orders in perturbation theory require the calculation of Feynman integrals at multiple loops. We report on an approach to systematically solve Feynman integrals by means of symbolic summation and discuss the underlying algorithms. Examples such as the non-planar vertex at two loops, or integrals from the recent calculation of the three-loop QCD corrections to structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering are given.
