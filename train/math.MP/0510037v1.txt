The concept of objectivity in classical field theories is traditionally based on time dependent Euclidean transformations. In this paper we treat objectivity in a four-dimensional setting, calculate Christoffel symbols of the spacetime transformations, and give covariant and material time derivatives. The usual objective time derivatives are investigated.
