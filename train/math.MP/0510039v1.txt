We introduce a new class of models for interacting particles. Our construction is based on Jacobians for the radial coordinates on certain superspaces. The resulting models contain two parameters determining the strengths of the interactions. This extends and generalizes the models of the Calogero--Moser--Sutherland type for interacting particles in ordinary spaces. The latter ones are included in our models as special cases. Using results which we obtained previously for spherical functions in superspaces, we obtain various properties and some explicit forms for the solutions. We present physical interpretations. Our models involve two kinds of interacting particles. One of the models can be viewed as describing interacting electrons in a lower and upper band of a one--dimensional semiconductor. Another model is quasi--two--dimensional. Two kinds of particles are confined to two different spatial directions, the interaction contains dipole--dipole or tensor forces.
