We study self-adjoint operators defined by factorizing second order differential operators in first order ones. We discuss examples where such factorizations introduce singular interactions into simple quantum mechanical models like the harmonic oscillator or the free particle on the circle. The generalization of these examples to the many-body case yields quantum models of distinguishable and interacting particles in one dimensions which can be solved explicitly and by simple means. Our considerations lead us to a simple method to construct exactly solvable quantum many-body systems of Calogero-Sutherland type.
