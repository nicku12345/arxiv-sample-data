We consider a {\mu}-deformation of the Segal-Bargmann transform, which is a unitary map from a {\mu}-deformed quantum configuration space onto a {\mu}-deformed quantum phase space (the {\mu}-deformed Segal-Bargmann space). Both of these Hilbert spaces have canonical orthonormal bases. We obtain explicit formulas for the Shannon entropy of some of the elements of these bases. We also consider two reverse log-Sobolev inequalities in the {\mu}-deformed Segal-Bargmann space, which have been proved in a previous work, and show that a certain known coefficient in them is the best possible.
