We prove that a perfect four-feet square table, posed in a continuous irregular ground with a local slope of at most 15 degrees can be put in equilibrium on the ground by a "rotation" of less than 90 degrees. We also discuss the case of non-square tables and make the conjecture that equilibrium can be found if the four feet are on a circle
