We expand a partial difference equation (P\DeltaE) on multiple lattices and obtain the P\DeltaE which governs its far field behaviour. The perturbative--reductive approach is here performed on well known nonlinear P\DeltaEs, both integrable and non integrable. We study the cases of the lattice modified Korteweg--de Vries (mKdV) equation, the Hietarinta equation, the lattice Volterra--Kac--Van Moerbeke (VKVM) equation and a non integrable lattice KdV equation. Such reductions allow us to obtain many new P\DeltaEs of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) type.
