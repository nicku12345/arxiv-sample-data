A hypergeometric type equation satisfying certain conditions defines either a finite or an infinite system of orthogonal polynomials. We present in a unified and explicit way all these systems of orthogonal polynomials, the associated special functions and some systems of coherent states. This general formalism allows us to extend some results known only in particular cases.
