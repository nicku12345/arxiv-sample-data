We review a method providing explicit formulas for the Jack polynomials. Our method is based on the relation of the Jack polynomials to the eigenfunctions of a well-known exactly solvable quantum many-body system of Calogero-Sutherland type. We also sketch a generalization of our method allowing to find the exact solution of the elliptic generalization of the Calogero-Sutherland model. We present the resulting explicit formulas for certain symmetric functions generalizing the Jack polynomials to the elliptic case.
