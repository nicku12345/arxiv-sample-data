A generalized definition of a deformation of the fermionic oscillator (k-fermionic oscillators) is proposed. Two prescriptions for the construction of generalized Grassmann coherent states for this kind of oscillators are derived. The two prescriptions differs in the nature of the generalized Grassmann variables used. While we use Majid's definition for such variables in the first case, Kerner's definition is used in the second one.
