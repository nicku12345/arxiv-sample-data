Let \lambda_i(\Omega,V) be the ith eigenvalue of the Schr\"odinger operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions on a bounded domain \Omega \subset \R^n and with the positive potential V. Following the spirit of the Payne-P\'olya-Weinberger conjecture and under some convexity assumptions on the spherically rearranged potential V_\star, we prove that \lambda_2(\Omega,V) \le \lambda_2(S_1,V_\star). Here S_1 denotes the ball, centered at the origin, that satisfies the condition \lambda_1(\Omega,V) = \lambda_1(S_1,V_\star).   Further we prove under the same convexity assumptions on a spherically symmetric potential V, that \lambda_2(B_R, V) / \lambda_1(B_R, V) decreases when the radius R of the ball B_R increases.   We conclude with several results about the first two eigenvalues of the Laplace operator with respect to a measure of Gaussian or inverted Gaussian density.
