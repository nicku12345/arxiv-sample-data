In this paper, we describe an example of a hyperkaehler quotient of a Banach manifold by a Banach Lie group. Although the initial manifold is not diffeomorphic to a Hilbert manifold (not even to a manifold modelled on a reflexive Banach space), the quotient space obtained is a Hilbert manifold, which can furthermore be identified either with the cotangent space of a connected component of the restricted Grassmannian or with a natural complexification of this connected component, thus proving that these two manifolds are isomorphic hyperkaehler manifolds. In addition, Kaehler potentials are computed using Kostant-Souriau's theory of prequantization.
