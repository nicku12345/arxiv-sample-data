This is part two of a series of four methodological papers on (bi)quaternions and their use in theoretical and mathematical physics: 1- Alphabetical bibliography, 2- Analytical bibliography, 3- Notations and terminology, and 4- Formulas and identities.   This quaternion bibliography will be further updated and corrected if necessary by the authors, who welcome any comment and reference that is not contained within the list.
