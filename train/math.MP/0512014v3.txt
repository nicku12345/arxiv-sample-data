We consider random Schr\"odinger equations on \bR^d for d\ge 3 with a homogeneous Anderson-Poisson type random potential. Denote by \lambda the coupling constant and \psi_t the solution with initial data \psi_0. The space and time variables scale as x\sim \lambda^{-2 -\kappa/2}, t \sim \lambda^{-2 -\kappa} with 0< \kappa < \kappa_0(d). We prove that, in the limit \lambda \to 0, the expectation of the Wigner distribution of \psi_t converges weakly to the solution of a heat equation in the space variable x for arbitrary L^2 initial data.   The proof is based on analyzing the phase cancellations of multiple scatterings on the random potential by expanding the propagator into a sum of Feynman graphs. In this paper we consider the non-recollision graphs and prove that the amplitude of the {\it non-ladder} diagrams is smaller than their "naive size" by an extra \lambda^c factor {\em per non-(anti)ladder vertex} for some c > 0. This is the first rigorous result showing that the improvement over the naive estimates on the Feynman graphs grows as a power of the small parameter with the exponent depending linearly on the number of vertices. This estimate allows us to prove the convergence of the perturbation series.
