Recently we found that canonical gauge-natural superpotentials are obtained as global sections of the {\em reduced} (n-2)-degree and (2s-1)-order quotient sheaf on the fibered manifold \bY_{\zet} \times_{\bX} \mathfrak{K}, where \mathfrak{K} is an appropriate subbundle of the vector bundle of (prolongations of) infinitesimal right-invariant automorphisms \bar{\Xi}. In this paper, we provide an alternative proof of the fact that the naturality property \cL_{j_{s}\bar{\Xi}_{H}}\omega (\lambda, \mathfrak{K})=0 holds true for the {\em new} Lagrangian \omega (\lambda, \mathfrak{K}) obtained contracting the Euler--Lagrange form of the original Lagrangian with \bar{\Xi}_{V}\in \mathfrak{K}. We use as fundamental tools an invariant decomposition formula of vertical morphisms due to Kol\'a\v{r} and the theory of iterated Lie derivatives of sections of fibered bundles. As a consequence, we recover the existence of a canonical generalized energy--momentum conserved tensor density associated with \omega (\lambda, \mathfrak{K}).
