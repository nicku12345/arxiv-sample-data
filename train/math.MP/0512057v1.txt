We get a generalization of Krein's formula -which relates the resolvents of different selfadjoint extensions of a differential operator with regular coefficients- to the non-regular case A=-\partial_x^2+(\nu^2-1/4)/x^2+V(x), where 0<\nu<1 and V(x) is an analytic function of x\in\mathbb{R}^+ bounded from below. We show that the trace of the heat-kernel e^{-tA} admits a non-standard small-t asymptotic expansion which contains, in general, integer powers of t^\nu. In particular, these powers are present for those selfadjoint extensions of A which are characterized by boundary conditions that break the local formal scale invariance at the singularity.
