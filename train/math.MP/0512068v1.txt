The analysis of the relation between modular P_1CT-symmetry -- a consequence of the Unruh effect -- and Pauli's spin-statistics relation is continued. The result in the predecessor to this article is extended to the Lorentz symmetric situation. A model \G_L of the universal covering \widetilde{L_+^\uparrow}\cong SL(2,\complex) of the restricted Lorentz group L_+^\uparrow is modelled as a reflection group at the classical level. Based on this picture, a representation of \G_L is constructed from pairs of modular P_1CT-conjugations, and this representation can easily be verified to satisfy the spin-statistics relation.
