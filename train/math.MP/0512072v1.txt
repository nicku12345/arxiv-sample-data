In the paper it is shown that, even without a knowledge of the concrete form of the equations of mathematical physics and field theories, with the help of skew-symmetric differential forms one can see specific features of the equations of mathematical physics, the relation between mathematical physics and field theory, to understand the mechanism of evolutionary processes that develop in material media and lead to emergency of physical structures forming physical fields. This discloses a physical meaning of such concepts like "conservation laws", "postulates" and "causality" and gives answers to many principal questions of mathematical physics and general field theory.   In present paper, beside the exterior forms, the skew-symmetric differential forms, whose basis (in contrast to the exterior forms) are deforming manifolds, are used. Mathematical apparatus of such differential forms(which were named evolutionary ones) includes nontraditional elements like nonidentical relations and degenerate transformations and this enables one to describe discrete transitions, quantum steps, evolutionary processes, and generation of various structures.
