A semi-classical non-Hamiltonian model of a spontaneous collapse of unstable quantum system is given. The time evolution of the system becomes non-Hamiltonian at random instants of transition of pure states to reduced ones, given by a contraction C. The counting trajectories are assumed to satisfy the Poisson law. A unitary dilation of the concractive stochastic dynamics is found. In particular, in the limit of frequent detection corresponding to the large number limit we obtain the Ito-Schroedinger stochastic unitary evolution for the pure state of unstable quantum system providing a new stochastic version of the quantum Zeno effect.
