We consider a spin-\frac12 electron in a translation-invariant model of non-relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). Let H(\vp,\sig) denote the fiber Hamiltonian corresponding to the conserved total momentum \vp\in\R^3 of the Pauli electron and the photon field, regularized by a fixed ultraviolet cutoff in the interaction term, and an infrared regularization parametrized by 0<\sig\ll1 which we ultimately remove by taking \sig\searrow0. For |\vp|<\puppbd, all \sig>0, and all values of the finestructure constant \gs<\gs_0, with \gs_0\ll1 sufficiently small and {\em independent} of \sig, we prove the existence of a ground state eigenvalue of multiplicity two at the bottom of the essential spectrum. Moreover, we prove that the renormalized electron mass satisfies 1<m_{ren}(\vp,\sig)<1+c\alpha, {\em uniformly} in \sig\geq0, in units where the bare mass has the value 1, and we prove the existence of the renormalized mass in the limit \sig\searrow0. Our analysis uses the isospectral renormalization group method of Bach-Fr\"ohlich-Sigal introduced in \cite{bfs1,bfs2} and further developed in \cite{bcfs1,bcfs2}. The limit \sig\searrow0 determines a scaling-critical renormalization group problem of endpoint type, in which the interaction is strictly marginal (of scale-independent size). The main achievement of this paper is the development of a method that provides rigorous control of the renormalization of a {\em strictly marginal} quantum field theory characterized by a {\em non-trivial scaling limit}.
