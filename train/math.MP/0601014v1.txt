Consider quantum harmonic oscillator, perturbed by an even almost-periodic complex-valued potential with bounded derivative and primitive. Suppose that we know the first correction to the spectral asymptotics \{\Delta\mu_n\}_{n=0}^\infty (\Delta\mu_n=\mu_n-\mu_n^0+o(n^{-1/4}), where \mu_n^0 and \mu_n is the spectrum of the unperturbed and the perturbed operators, respectively). We obtain the formula that recovers the frequencies and the Fourier coefficients of the perturbation.
