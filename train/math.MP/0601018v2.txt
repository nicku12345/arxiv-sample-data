In this paper using the apparatus of the Clifford bundle formalism we show how straightforwardly solve in Minkowski spacetime the Dirac-Hestenes equation -- which is an appropriate representative in the Clifford bundle of differential forms of the usual Dirac equation -- by separation of variables for the case of a potential having spherical symmetry in the Cartesian and spherical gauges. We show that contrary to what is expected at a first sight, the solution of the DHE in both gauges has exactly the same mathematical difficulty.
