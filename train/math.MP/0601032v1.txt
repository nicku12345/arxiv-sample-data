Resonant motions of integrable systems subject to perturbations may continue to exist and to cover surfaces with parametric equations admitting a formal power expansion in the strength of the perturbation. Such series may be, sometimes, summed via suitable sum rules defining C^\infty functions of the perturbation strength: here we find sufficient conditions for the Borel summability of their sums in the case of two-dimensional rotation vectors with Diophantine exponent \tau=1 (e. g. with ratio of the two independent frequencies equal to the golden mean).
