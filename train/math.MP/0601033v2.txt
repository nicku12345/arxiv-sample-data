We consider solutions of the one-dimensional equation -u'' +(Q+ \lambda V) u = 0 where Q: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} is locally integrable, V : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} is integrable with supp(V) \subset [0,1], and \lambda \in \mathbb{R} is a coupling constant. Given a family of solutions \{u_{\lambda} \}_{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}} which satisfy u_{\lambda}(x) = u_0(x) for all x<0, we prove that the zeros of b(\lambda) := W[u_0, u_{\lambda}], the Wronskian of u_0 and u_{\lambda}, form a discrete set unless V \equiv 0. Setting Q(x) := -E, one sees that a particular consequence of this result may be stated as: if the fixed energy scattering experiment -u'' + \lambda V u = Eu gives rise to a reflection coefficient which vanishes on a set of couplings with an accumulation point, then V \equiv 0.
