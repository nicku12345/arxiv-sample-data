The purpose of this work is to discuss recent progress in deriving the fundamental laws of thermodynamics (0th, 1st and 2nd-law) from nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. Basic thermodynamic notions are clarified and different reversible and irreversible thermodynamic processes are studied from the point of view of quantum statistical mechanics. Special emphasis is put on new adiabatic theorems for steady states close to and far from equilibrium, and on investigating cyclic thermodynamic processes using an extension of Floquet theory.
