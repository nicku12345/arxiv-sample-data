The degeneracy of the lowest weight representations of the quantum superalgebra osp_q(1|2) and their tensor products at exceptional values of %when deformation parameter q takes exceptional values is studied. The main features of the structures of the finite dimensional lowest weight representations and their fusion rules are illustrated using realization of group generators as finite-difference operators acting in the space of the polynomials. The complete fusion rules for the decompositions of the tensor products at roots of unity are presented. The appearance of indecomposable representations in the fusions is described using Clebsh-Gordan coefficients derived for general values of q and at roots of unity.
