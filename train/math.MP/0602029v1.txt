We use the Hellman-Feynman (HF) and Hypervirial (HV) theorems, to calculate the perturbative coefficients of the eigenenergies formal series, in the case of the Coulomb potential with a radial linear term and the radial quartic anharmonic oscillator potential. This calculation method, contrary to the usual Rayleigh-Schrodinger Perturbation Theory (RSPT), does not require the calculation of eigenfunctions coefficients. This method is a fast and efficient tool for the calculation of large order eigenenergies coefficients.
