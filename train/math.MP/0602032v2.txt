Integer moments of the spectral determinant |\det(zI-W)|^2 of complex random matrices W are obtained in terms of the characteristic polynomial of the Hermitian matrix WW^* for the class of matrices W=AU where A is a given matrix and U is random unitary. This work is motivated by studies of complex eigenvalues of random matrices and potential applications of the obtained results in this context are discussed.
