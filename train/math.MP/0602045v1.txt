A close inspection on the 3D hydrogen atom Hamiltonian revealed formal eigenvectors often discarded in the literature. Although not in its domain, such eigenvectors belong to the Hilbert space, and so their time evolution is well defined. They are then related to the 1D and 2D hydrogen atoms and it is numerically found that they have continuous components, so that ionization can take place.
