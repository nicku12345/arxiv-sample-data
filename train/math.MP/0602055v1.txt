The ground energy level of an oscillator cannot be zero because of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We use methods from symplectic topology (Gromov's non-squeezing theorem, and the existence of symplectic capacities) to analyze and extend this heuristic observation to Liouville-integrable systems, and to propose a topological quantization scheme for such systems, thus extending previous results of ours.
