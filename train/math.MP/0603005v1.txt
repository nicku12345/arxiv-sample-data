Some subjects related to the geometric theory of singular dynamical systems are reviewed in this paper. In particular, the following two matters are considered: the theory of canonical transformations for presymplectic Hamiltonian systems, and the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian constraint algorithms and the time-evolution operator.
