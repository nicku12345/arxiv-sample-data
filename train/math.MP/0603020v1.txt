We put into evidence graphs with adjacency operator whose singular subspace is prescribed by the kernel of an auxiliary operator. In particular, for a family of graphs called admissible, the singular continuous spectrum is absent and there is at most an eigenvalue located at the origin. Among other examples, the one-dimensional XY model of solid-state physics is covered. The proofs rely on commutators methods.
