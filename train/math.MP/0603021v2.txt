Symmetry properties of PDE's are considered within a systematic and unifying scheme: particular attention is devoted to the notion of conditional symmetry, leading to the distinction and a precise characterization of the notions of ``true'' and ``weak'' conditional symmetry. Their relationship with exact and partial symmetries is also discussed. An extensive use of ``symmetry-adapted'' variables is made; several clarifying examples, including the case of Boussinesq equation, are also provided.
