We prove exponential and dynamical localization for the Schr\"odinger operator with a nonnegative Poisson random potential at the bottom of the spectrum in any dimension. We also conclude that the eigenvalues in that spectral region of localization have finite multiplicity. We prove similar localization results in a prescribed energy interval at the bottom of the spectrum provided the density of the Poisson process is large enough.
