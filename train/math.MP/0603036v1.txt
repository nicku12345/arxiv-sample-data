If a Hamiltonian dynamical system with n degrees of freedom admits m constants of motion more than 2n-1, then there exist some functional relations between the constants of motion. Among these relations the number of functionally independent ones are s=m-(2n-1). It is shown that for such a system in which the constants of motion constitute a polynomial algebra closing in Poisson bracket, the Nambu brackets can be written in terms of these s constraint functionals. The exemplification is very rich and several of them are analyzed in the text.
