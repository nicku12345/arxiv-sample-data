Let us consider the quantum/versus classical dynamics for Hamiltonians of the form \beq \label{0.1} H\_{g}^{\epsilon} := \frac{P^2}{2}+ \epsilon \frac{Q^2}{2}+ \frac{g^2}{Q^2} \edq where \epsilon = \pm 1, g is a real constant. We shall in particular study the Quantum Fidelity between H\_{g}^{\epsilon} and H\_{0}^{\epsilon} defined as \beq \label{0.2} F\_{Q}^{\epsilon}(t,g):= < \exp(-it H\_{0}^{\epsilon})\psi, exp(-itH\_{g}^ {\epsilon})\psi > \edq for some reference state \psi in the domain of the relevant operators. We shall also propose a definition of the Classical Fidelity, already present in the literature (\cite{becave1}, \cite{becave2}, \cite{ec}, \cite{prozni}, \cite{vepro}) and compare it with the behaviour of the Quantum Fidelity, as time evolves, and as the coupling constant g is varied.
