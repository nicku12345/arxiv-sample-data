We consider a Schr\"odinger operator (h\mathbf D -\mathbf A)^2 with a positive magnetic field B=\curl\mathbf A in a domain \Omega\subset\R^2. The imposing of Neumann boundary conditions leads to spectrum below h\inf B. This is a boundary effect and it is related to the existence of edge states of the system. We show that the number of these eigenvalues, in the semi-classical limit h\to 0, is governed by a Weyl-type law and that it involves a symbol on \partial\Omega. In the particular case of a constant magnetic field, the curvature plays a major role.
