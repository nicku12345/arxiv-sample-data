Traditionally, the discussion about the geometrical interpretation of inertial forces is reserved for General Relativity handbooks. In these notes an analysis of the effect of such forces in a classical (newtonian) context is made, as well as a study of the relation between the precession of the Foucault pendulum and the holonomy on a surface, including some critical remarks about the common statement \textquotedblleft precession of Foucault pendulum equals holonomy on the sphere\textquotedblright.
