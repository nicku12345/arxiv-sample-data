We give a general construction for the classical limit of a quantum system defined in terms of generators of an arbitrary compact semisimple Lie algebra, generalizing known results for the \mathfrak{su}_2 and \mathfrak{su}_3 cases. The classical limit depends on the physical problem in question and is determined by the sequence of representations by which it is reached. Only in the simplest cases it is unique. We present explicit formulae useful in determining the classical limit in all important cases.
