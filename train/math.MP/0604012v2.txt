We consider ensembles of Gaussian (Hermite) and Wishart (Laguerre) N\times N hermitian matrices. We study the effect of finite rank perturbations of these ensembles by a source term. The rank r of the perturbation corresponds to the number of non-null eigenvalues of the source matrix. In the perturbed ensembles, the correlation functions can be written in terms of kernels. We show that for all N, the difference between the perturbed and the unperturbed kernels is a degenerate kernel of size r which depends on multiple Hermite or Laguerre functions. We also compute asymptotic formulas for the multiple Laguerre functions kernels in terms multiple Bessel (resp. Airy) functions. This leads to the large N limiting kernels at the hard (resp. soft) edge of the spectrum of the perturbed Laguerre ensemble. Similar results are obtained in the Hermite case.
