We prove L^p-bounds on the Fourier transform of measures \mu supported on two dimensional surfaces. Our method allows to consider surfaces whose Gauss curvature vanishes on a one-dimensional submanifold. Under a certain non-degeneracy condition, we prove that \wh\mu\in L^{4+\beta}, \beta>0, and we give a logarithmically divergent bound on the L^4-norm. We use this latter bound to estimate almost singular integrals involving the dispersion relation, e(p)= \sum_1^3 [1-\cos p_j], of the discrete Laplace operator on the cubic lattice. We briefly explain our motivation for this bound originating in the theory of random Schr\"odinger operators.
