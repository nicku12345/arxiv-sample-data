For a class of negative slowly decaying potentials including the attractive Coulombic one we study the classical scattering theory in the low-energy regime. We construct a (continuous) family of classical orbits parametrized by initial position x\in \R^d, final direction \omega\in S^{d-1} of escape (to infinity) and the energy \lambda\geq 0, yielding a complete classification of the set of outgoing scattering orbits. The construction is given in the outgoing part of phase-space (a similar construction may be done in the incoming part of phase-space). For fixed \omega\in S^{d-1} and \lambda\geq 0 the collection of constructed orbits constitutes a smooth manifold that we show is Lagrangian. The family of those Lagrangians can be used to study the quantum mechanical scattering theory in the low-energy regime for the class of potentials considered here. We devote this study to a subsequent paper.
