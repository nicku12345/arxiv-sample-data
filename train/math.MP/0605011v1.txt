Carath\'eodory showed that n complex numbers c_1,...,c_n can uniquely be written in the form c_p=\sum_{j=1}^m \rho_j {\epsilon_j}^p with p=1,...,n, where the \epsilon_js are different unimodular complex numbers, the \rho_js are strictly positive numbers and integer m never exceeds n. We give the conditions to be obeyed for the former property to hold true if the \rho_js are simply required to be real and different from zero. It turns out that the number of the possible choices of the signs of the \rho_js are {at most} equal to the number of the different eigenvalues of the Hermitian Toeplitz matrix whose i,j-th entry is c_{j-i}, where c_{-p} is equal to the complex conjugate of c_{p} and c_{0}=0. This generalization is relevant for neutron scattering. Its proof is made possible by a lemma - which is an interesting side result - that establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for the unimodularity of the roots of a polynomial based only on the polynomial coefficients.
