Recently reported computations have been extended to give ten more decimals of accuracy in the ground state energy of the Schrodinger equation for the idealized Helium atom. With the F basis - Hylleraas coordinates with negative powers and a logarithm of s - carried to the fiftieth order (N = 24,099 terms) we find the eigenvalue E = -2.90372 43770 34119 59831 11592 45194 40444 66969 25309 ...
