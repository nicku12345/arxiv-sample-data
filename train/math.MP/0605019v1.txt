The system we consider here is a charged fermions gas in the effective mass approximation, and in grand-canonical conditions. We assume that the particles are confined in a three dimensional cubic box \Lambda with side L\geq 1, and subjected to a constant magnetic field of intensity  B \geq 0 . Define the grand canonical generalized susceptibilities \chi_L^N, N\geq 1, as successive partial derivatives with respect to B of the grand canonical pressure P_L. Denote by P_{\infty} the thermodynamic limit of P_L. Our main result is that \chi_L^N admit as thermodynamic limit the corresponding partial derivatives with respect to B of P_{\infty}. In this paper we only give the main steps of the proofs, technical details will be given elsewhere.
