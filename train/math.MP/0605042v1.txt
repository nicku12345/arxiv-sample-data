We study the higher-order correlation functions of covariant families of observables associated with random Schr\"odinger operators on the lattice in the strong disorder regime. We prove that if the distribution of the random variables has a density analytic in a strip about the real axis, then these correlation functions are analytic functions of the energy outside of the planes corresponding to coincident energies. In particular, this implies the analyticity of the density of states, and of the current-current correlation function outside of the diagonal. Consequently, this proves that the current-current correlation function has an analytic density outside of the diagonal at strong disorder.
