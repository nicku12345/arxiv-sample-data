Relation between natural nonequilibrium steady states of Ruelle and MacLennan-Zubarev ensembles is discussed for a system consisting of M infinitely extended systems coupled with a small system. And a characterization of quasistatic processes is investigated for a small system coupled with a single reservoir.
