Based on the discrete fractional random transform (DFRNT), we present the discrete fractional random cosine and sine transforms (DFRNCT and DFRNST). We demonstrate that the DFRNCT and DFRNST can be regarded as special kinds of DFRNT and thus their mathematical properties are inherited from the DFRNT. Numeral results of DFRNCT and DFRNST for one and two dimensional functions have been given.
