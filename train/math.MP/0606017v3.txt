Consider a system of N bosons in three dimensions interacting via a repulsive short range pair potential N^2V(N(x_i-x_j)), where \bx=(x_1, >..., x_N) denotes the positions of the particles. Let H_N denote the Hamiltonian of the system and let \psi_{N,t} be the solution to the Schr\"odinger equation. Suppose that the initial data \psi_{N,0} satisfies the energy condition \[ < \psi_{N,0}, H_N^k \psi_{N,0} > \leq C^k N^k \] for k=1,2,... . We also assume that the k-particle density matrices of the initial state are asymptotically factorized as N\to\infty. We prove that the k-particle density matrices of \psi_{N,t} are also asymptotically factorized and the one particle orbital wave function solves the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, a cubic non-linear Schr\"odinger equation with the coupling constant given by the scattering length of the potential V. We also prove the same conclusion if the energy condition holds only for k=1 but the factorization of \psi_{N,0} is assumed in a stronger sense.
