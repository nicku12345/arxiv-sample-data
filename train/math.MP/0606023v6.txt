If A_q(\beta, \alpha, k) is the scattering amplitude, corresponding to a potential q\in L^2(D), where D\subset\R^3 is a bounded domain, and e^{ik\alpha \cdot x} is the incident plane wave, then we call the radiation pattern the function A(\beta):=A_q(\beta, \alpha, k), where the unit vector \alpha, the incident direction, is fixed, and k>0, the wavenumber, is fixed. It is shown that any function f(\beta)\in L^2(S^2), where S^2 is the unit sphere in \R^3, can be approximated with any desired accuracy by a radiation pattern: ||f(\beta)-A(\beta)||_{L^2(S^2)}<\epsilon, where \epsilon>0 is an arbitrary small fixed number. The potential q, corresponding to A(\beta), depends on f and \epsilon, and can be calculated analytically. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the above potential and the density of the number of small acoustically soft particles D_m\subset D, 1\leq m\leq M, distributed in an a priori given bounded domain D\subset\R^3. The geometrical shape of a small particle D_m is arbitrary, the boundary S_m of D_m is Lipschitz uniformly with respect to m. The wave number k and the direction \alpha of the incident upon D plane wave are fixed.It is shown that a suitable distribution of the above particles in D can produce the scattering amplitude A(\alpha',\alpha), \alpha',\alpha\in S^2, at a fixed k>0, arbitrarily close in the norm of L^2(S^2\times S^2) to an arbitrary given scattering amplitude f(\alpha',\alpha), corresponding to a real-valued potential q\in L^2(D).
