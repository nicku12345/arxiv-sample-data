A system of a Dirac particle interacting with the radiation field is considered. The Hamiltonian of the system is defined by H = \alpha\cdot(\hat\mathbf{p}-q\mathbf{A}(\hat\mathbf{x}))+m\beta + H_f where q\in\mathbb{R} is a coupling constant, \mathbf{A}(\hat\mathbf{x}) denotes the quantized vector potential and H_f denotes the free photon Hamiltonian. Since the total momentum is conserved, H is decomposed with respect to the total momentum with fiber Hamiltonian H(\mathbf{p}), (\mathbf{p}\in\mathbb{R}^3). Since the self-adjoint operator H(\mathbf{p}) is bounded from below, one can define the lowest energy E(\mathbf{p},m):=\inf\sigma(H(\mathbf{p})). We prove that E(\mathbf{p},m) is an eigenvalue of H(\mathbf{p}) under the following conditions: (i) infrared regularization and (ii) E(\mathbf{p},m)<E(\mathbf{p},0). We also discuss the polarization vectors and the angular momenta.
