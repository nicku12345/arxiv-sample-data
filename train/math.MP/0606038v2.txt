The standard block orthogonal (SBO) polynomials P_{i;n}(x), 0\le i\le n are real polynomials of degree n which are orthogonal with respect to a first Euclidean scalar product to polynomials of degree less than i. In addition, they are mutually orthogonal with respect to a second Euclidean scalar product. Applying the general results obtained in a previous paper, we determine and investigate these polynomials when the first scalar product corresponds to Hermite (resp. Laguerre) polynomials. These new sets of polynomials, we call Hermite (resp. Laguerre) SBO polynomials, provide a basis of functional spaces well-suited for some applications requiring to take into account special linear constraints which can be recast into an Euclidean orthogonality relation.
