The Ostrovsky equation is a model for gravity waves propagating down a channel under the influence of Coriolis force. This equation is a modification of the famous Korteweg-de Vries equation and is also Hamiltonian. However the Ostrovsky equation is not integrable and in this contribution we prove its nonintegrability. We also study local bifurcations of its solitary waves.
