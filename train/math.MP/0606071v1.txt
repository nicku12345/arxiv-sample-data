In a Borel subalgebra U(B) of the sl(2) loop algebra, we introduce a highest weight vector \Psi. We call such a representation of U(B) that is generated by \Psi highest weight. We define a generalization of the Drinfeld polynomial for a finite-dimensional highest weight representation of U(B). We show that every finite-dimensional highest weight representation of the Borel subalgebra is irreducible if the evaluation parameters are distinct. We also discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite-dimensional highest weight representation of U(B) to be irreducible.
