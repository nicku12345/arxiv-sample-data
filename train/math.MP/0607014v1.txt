A translation invariant Hamiltonian H in the nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics is studied. This Hamiltonian is decomposed with respect to the total momentum \tot: H=\int_{\BR} ^\oplus \fri(P) dP, where the self-adjoint fiber Hamiltonian \fri(P) is defined for arbitrary values of coupling constants. It is discussed a relationship between rotation invariance of H(P) and polarization vectors, and functional integral representations of n point Euclidean Green functions of H(P) is given. From these, some applications concerning with degeneracy of ground states, ground state energy and expectation values of suitable observables with respect to ground states are given.
