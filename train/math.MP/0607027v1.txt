In some quasi-one-dimensional weakly disordered media, impurities are large and rare rather than small and dense. For an Anderson model with a low density of strong impurities, a perturbation theory in the impurity density is developed for the Lyapunov exponent and the density of states. The Lyapunov exponent grows linearly with the density. Anomalies of the Kappus-Wegner type appear for all rational quasi-momenta even in lowest order perturbation theory.
