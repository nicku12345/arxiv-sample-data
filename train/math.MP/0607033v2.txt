We exhibit scarring for certain nonlinear ergodic toral automorphisms. There are perturbed quantized hyperbolic toral automorphisms preserving certain co-isotropic submanifolds. The classical dynamics is ergodic, hence in the semiclassical limit almost all eigenstates converge to the volume measure of the torus. Nevertheless, we show that for each of the invariant submanifolds, there are also eigenstates which localize and converge to the volume measure of the corresponding submanifold.
