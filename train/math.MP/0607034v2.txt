A general technique for the study of embedded quantum graphs with magnetic fields and spin-orbit interaction is presented. The analysis is used to understand the contribution of Rashba constant to the extreme localization induced by magnetic field in the T3 shaped quantum graph. We show that this effect is destroyed at generic values of the Rashba constant. On the other hand, for certain combinations of the Rashba constant and the magnetic parameters another series of infinitely degenerate eigenvalues appears.
