The aim of this paper is to study generalized q-analogs of the well-known q-deformed harmonic oscillators and to connect them with q-Hermite polynomials. We give a construction of the appropriate oscillator-like algebras and show that corresponding Hermite polynomials are generalization of the discrete q-Hermite I and the discrete q-Hermite II polynomials. We also construct generalized coherent states of Barut-Girardello type for oscillator-like systems connected with these polynomials.
