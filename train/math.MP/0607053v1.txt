The possibility of deformation of two body quantum Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models is studied. Obtained are some necessary conditions for the singular locus of the potential function. Such locus is determined if it consists of two, three or four lines. Furthermore, a new deformation of elliptic B_{2} type Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model is explicitly constructed.
