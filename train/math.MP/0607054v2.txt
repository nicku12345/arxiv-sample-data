We study the adiabatic time evolution of quantum resonances over time scales which are small compared to the lifetime of the resonances. We consider three typical examples of resonances: The first one is that of shape resonances corresponding, for example, to the state of a quantum-mechanical particle in a potential well whose shape changes over time scales small compared to the escape time of the particle from the well. Our approach to studying the adiabatic evolution of shape resonances is based on a precise form of the time-energy uncertainty relation and the usual adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics. The second example concerns resonances that appear as isolated complex eigenvalues of spectrally deformed Hamiltonians, such as those encountered in the N-body Stark effect. Our approach to study such resonances is based on the Balslev-Combes theory of dilatation-analytic Hamiltonians and an adiabatic theorem for nonnormal generators of time evolution. Our third example concerns resonances arising from eigenvalues embedded in the continuous spectrum when a perturbation is turned on, such as those encountered when a small system is coupled to an infinitely extended, dispersive medium. Our approach to this class of examples is based on an extension of adiabatic theorems without a spectral gap condition. We finally comment on resonance crossings, which can be studied using the last approach.
