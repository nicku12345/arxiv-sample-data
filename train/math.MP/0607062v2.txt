We introduce a new renormalization for the powers of the Dirac delta function. We show that this new renormalization leads to a second quantized version of the Virasoro sector w_{\infty} of the extended conformal algebra with infinite symmetries W_{\infty} of Conformal Field Theory. In particular we construct a white noise (boson) representation of the w_{\infty} generators and commutation relations and of their second quantization.
