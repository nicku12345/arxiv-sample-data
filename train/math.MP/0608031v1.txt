We investigate the survival probability of a localized 1-d quantum particle subjected to a time dependent potential of the form rU(x)\sin{\omega t} with U(x)=2\delta (x-a) or U(x)= 2\delta(x-a)-2\delta (x+a). The particle is initially in a bound state produced by the binding potential -2\delta (x). We prove that this probability goes to zero as t\to\infty for almost all values of r, \omega, and a. The decay is initially exponential followed by a t^{-3} law if \omega is not close to resonances and r is small; otherwise the exponential disappears and Fermi's golden rule fails. For exceptional sets of parameters r,\omega and a the survival probability never decays to zero, corresponding to the Floquet operator having a bound state. We show similar behavior even in the absence of a binding potential: permitting a free particle to be trapped by harmonically oscillating delta function potential.
