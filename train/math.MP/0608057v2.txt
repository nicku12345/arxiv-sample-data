An exact approach for the factorization of the relativistic linear singular oscillator is proposed. This model is expressed by the finite-difference Schr\"odinger-like equation. We have found finite-difference raising and lowering operators, which are with the Hamiltonian operator form the close Lie algebra of the SU(1, 1) group.
