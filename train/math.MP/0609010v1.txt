In this article, we present the analytical solution of the radial Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the Hulth\'{e}n potential within the framework of the asymptotic iteration method by using an approximation to the centrifugal potential for any l states. We obtain the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions for different screening parameters. The wave functions are physical and energy eigenvalues are in good agreement with the results obtained by other methods for different \delta  values. In order to demonstrate this, the results of the asymptotic iteration method are compared with the results of the supersymmetry, the numerical integration, the variational and the shifted 1/N expansion methods.
