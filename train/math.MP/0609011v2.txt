We show that a monic polynomial in a discrete variable n, with coefficients depending on time variables t_1, t_2,... is a \tau-function for the discrete Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy if and only if the motion of its zeros is governed by a hierarchy of Ruijsenaars-Schneider systems. These \tau-functions were considered in [12], where it was proved that they parametrize rank one solutions to a difference-differential version of the bispectral problem.
