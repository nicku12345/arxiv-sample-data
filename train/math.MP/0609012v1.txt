We study the dynamical evolution of the deposition interface using both discrete and continuous models for which shadowing effects are important. We explain why continuous and discrete models implying both only shadowing deposition do not give the same result and propose a continuous model which allow to recover the result of the discrete one exhibiting a strong columnar morphology.
