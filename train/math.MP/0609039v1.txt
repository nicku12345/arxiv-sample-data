We study the dynamics of a classical particle moving in a punctured plane under the influence of a strong homogeneous magnetic field, an electrical background, and driven by a time-dependent singular flux tube through the hole.   We exhibit a striking classical (de)localization effect: in the far past the trajectories are spirals around a bound center; the particle moves inward towards the flux tube loosing kinetic energy. After hitting the puncture it becomes ``conducting'': the motion is a cycloid around a center whose drift is outgoing, orthogonal to the electric field, diffusive, and without energy loss.
