The "loop equations" of random matrix theory are a hierarchy of equations born of attempts to obtain explicit formulae for generating functions of map enumeration problems. These equations, originating in the physics of 2-dimensional quantum gravity, have lacked mathematical justification. The goal of this paper is to provide a complete and short proof, relying on a recently established complete asymptotic expansion for the random matrix theory partition function.
