We study the massless minimally coupled scalar field on a two--dimensional de Sitter space-time in the setting of axiomatic quantum field theory. We construct the invariant Wightman distribution obtained as the renormalized zero--mass limit of the massive one. Insisting on gauge invariance of the model we construct a vacuum state and a Hilbert space of physical states which are invariant under the action of the whole de Sitter group. We also present the integral expression of the conserved charge which generates the gauge invariance and propose a definition of dual field.
