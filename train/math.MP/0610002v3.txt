We present a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite-dimensional highest weight representation of the sl_2 loop algebra to be irreducible. In particular, for a highest weight representation with degenerate parameters of the highest weight, we can explicitly determine whether it is irreducible or not. We also present an algorithm for constructing finite-dimensional highest weight representations with a given highest weight. We give a conjecture that all the highest weight representations with the same highest weight can be constructed by the algorithm. For some examples we show the conjecture explicitly. The result should be useful in analyzing the spectra of integrable lattice models related to roots of unity representations of quantum groups, in particular, the spectral degeneracy of the XXZ spin chain at roots of unity associated with the sl_2 loop algebra.
