In this paper we explain the photoelectric effect in a variant of the standard model of non relativistic quantum electrodynamics, which is in some aspects more closely related to the physical picture, than the one studied in [BKZ]: Now we can apply our results to an electron with more than one bound state and to a larger class of electron-photon interactions. We will specify a situation, where ionisation probability in second order is a weighted sum of single photon terms. Furthermore we will see, that Einstein's equality \[E_{kin}=h\nu-\bigtriangleup E>0\] for the maximal kinetic energy E_{kin} of the electron, energy h\nu of the photon and ionisation gap \bigtriangleup E is the crucial condition for these single photon terms to be nonzero.
