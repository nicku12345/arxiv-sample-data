We consider a class of singular Riemannian manifolds, the deformed spheres S^N_k, defined as the classical spheres with a one parameter family g[k] of singular Riemannian structures, that reduces for k=1 to the classical metric. After giving explicit formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the metric Laplacian \Delta_{S^N_k}, we study the associated zeta functions \zeta(s,\Delta_{S^N_k}). We introduce a general method to deal with some classes of simple and double abstract zeta functions, generalizing the ones appearing in \zeta(s,\Delta_{S^N_k}). An application of this method allows to obtain the main zeta invariants for these zeta functions in all dimensions, and in particular \zeta(0,\Delta_{S^N_k}) and \zeta'(0,\Delta_{S^N_k}). We give explicit formulas for the zeta regularized determinant in the low dimensional cases, N=2,3, thus generalizing a result of Dowker \cite{Dow1}, and we compute the first coefficients in the expansion of these determinants in powers of the deformation parameter k.
