We present a set of conditions which, if satisfied, provide for a complete asymptotic analysis of random matrices with source term containing two distinct eigenvalues. These conditions are shown to be equivalent to the existence of a particular algebraic curve. For the case of a quartic external field, the curve in question is proven to exist, yielding precise asymptotic information about the limiting mean density of eigenvalues, as well as bulk and edge universality.
