Some features of the calculation of fluid dynamo systems in magnetohydrodynamics are studied. In the coupled set of the ordinary linear differential equations for the spherically symmetric \alpha^2-dynamos, the problem represented by the presence of the mixed (Robin) boundary conditions is addressed and a new treatment for it is proposed. The perturbation formalism of large-\ell expansions is shown applicable and its main technical steps are outlined.
