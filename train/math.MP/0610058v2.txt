We consider the phenomenon of eigenvalue absorption for a many body Hamiltonian, which depends on a parameter. The conditions on pair potentials, which guarantee that the eigenvalues approaching the bottom of the continuous spectrum become absorbed as the parameter approaches a critical value, are derived. We also discuss the behavior of bound states' wave functions when the corresponding levels approach the bottom of the continuous spectrum. The results have applications in atomic and molecular physics. An application to the stability problem of three Coulomb charges is presented.
