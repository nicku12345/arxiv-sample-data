We study the interfaces separating different phases of 3D systems by means of the Reflection Positivity method. We treat discrete non-linear sigma-models, which exhibit power-law decay of correlations at low temperatures, and we prove the rigidity property of the interface.   Our method is applicable to the Ising and Potts models, where it simplifies the derivation of some known results. The method also works for large-entropy systems of continuous spins.
