In this work we explore the geometrical interpretation of gauge theories through the formalism of fiber bundles. Moreover, we conduct an investigation in the topology of fiber bundles, providing a proof of the Classification Theorem. In the last chapter we present some applications, such as electromagnetism and generalized Kaluza-Klein Theory.
