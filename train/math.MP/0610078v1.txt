The form of the phenomenological stress-energy-momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field in a class of inhomogeneous, anisotropic magneto-electric media is calculated from first principles, leading to a coherent understanding of the phenomenological stresses and energy-momentum exchanges induced by electromagnetic interactions with such matter in terms of a fully relativistic covariant variational framework.
