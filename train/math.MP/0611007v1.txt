The main facts of the geometry of Finslerian 4-spinors are formulated. It is shown that twistors are a special case of Finslerian 4-spinors. The close connection between Finslerian 4-spinors and the geometry of a 16-dimensional vector Finslerian space is established. The isometry group of this space is described. The procedure of dimensional reduction to 4-dimensional quantities is formulated.
