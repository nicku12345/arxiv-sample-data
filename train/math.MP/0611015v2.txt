In looking for qualitative differences between quaternionic and complex formulations of quantum physical theories, we provide a detailed discussion of the behavior of a wave packet in presence of a quaternionic time-independent potential step. In this paper, we restrict our attention to diffusion phenomena. For the group velocity of the wave packet moving in the potential region and for the reflection and transmission times, the study shows a striking difference between the complex and quaternionic formulations which could be matter of further theoretical discussions and could represent the starting point for a possible experimental investigation.
