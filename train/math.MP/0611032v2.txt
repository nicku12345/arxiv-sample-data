We study conservation laws and potential symmetries of (systems of) differential equations applying equivalence relations generated by point transformations between the equations. A Fokker-Planck equation and the Burgers equation are considered as examples. Using reducibility of them to the one-dimensional linear heat equation, we construct complete hierarchies of local and potential conservation laws for them and describe, in some sense, all their potential symmetries. Known results on the subject are interpreted in the proposed framework. This paper is an extended comment on the paper of J.-q. Mei and H.-q. Zhang [Internat. J. Theoret. Phys., 2006, in press].
