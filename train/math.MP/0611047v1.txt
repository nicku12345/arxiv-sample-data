In the extensive literature dealing with the relativistic phenomenon of Thomas rotation several methods have been developed for calculating the Thomas rotation angle of a gyroscope along a circular world line. One of the most appealing concepts, introduced in \cite{rindler}, is to consider a rotating reference frame co-moving with the gyroscope, and relate the precession of the gyroscope to the angular velocity of the reference frame. A recent paper \cite{herrera}, however, applies this principle to three different co-moving rotating reference frames and arrives at three different Thomas rotation angles. The reason for this apparent paradox is that the principle of \cite{rindler} is used for a situation to which it does not apply. In this paper we rigorously examine the theoretical background and limitations of applicability of the principle of \cite{rindler}. Along the way we also establish some general properties of {\it rotating reference frames}, which may be of independent interest.
