We present a refinement of the Spectral Method by incorporating an optimization method into it and generalize it to two space dimensions. We then apply this Refined Spectral Method as an extremely accurate technique for finding the bound states of the two dimensional time-independent Schrodinger equation. We first illustrate the use of this method on an exactly solvable case and then use it on a case which is not so. This method is very simple to program, fast, extremely accurate (e.g. a relative error of 10^(-15) is easily obtainable in two dimensions), very robust and stable. Most importantly, one can obtain the energies and the wave functions of as many of the bound states as desired with a single run of the algorithm.
