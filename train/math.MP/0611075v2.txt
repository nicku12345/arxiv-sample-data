The eigenvalue absorption for a many-particle Hamiltonian depending on a parameter is analyzed in the framework of non--relativistic quantum mechanics. The long--range part of pair potentials is assumed to be pure Coulomb and no restriction on the particle statistics is imposed. It is proved that if the lowest dissociation threshold corresponds to the decay into two likewise non--zero charged clusters then the bound state, which approaches the threshold, does not spread and eventually becomes the bound state at threshold. The obtained results have a direct application in atomic and nuclear physics. Under minor assumptions a positive proof is given to the conjecture that negative atomic ions have a bound state at the threshold when the nuclear charge becomes critical.
