Quantum Field Theory with fields as Operator Valued Distributions with adequate test functions, -the basis of Epstein-Glaser approach known now as Causal Perturbation Theory-, is recalled. Its recent revival is due to new developments in understanding its renormalization structure, which was a major and somehow fatal disease to its widespread use in the seventies. In keeping with the usual way of definition of integrals of differential forms, fields are defined through integrals over the whole manifold, which are given an atlas-independent meaning with the help of the partition of unity. Using such partition of unity test functions turns out to be the key to the fulfilment of the Poincar\'e commutator algebra as well as to provide a direct Lorentz invariant scheme to the Epstein-Glaser extension procedure of singular distributions. These test functions also simplify the analysis of QFT behaviour both in the UV and IR domains, leaving only a finite renormalization at a point related to the arbitrary scale present in the test functions. Some well known UV and IR cases are examplified. Finally the possible implementation of Epstein-Glaser approach in light-front field theory is discussed, focussing on the intrinsic non-pertubative character of the initial light-cone interaction Hamiltonian and on the expected benefits of a divergence-free procedure with only finite RG-analysis on physical observables in the end.
