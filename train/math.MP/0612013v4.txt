We consider a singularly perturbed second order elliptic system in the whole space. The coefficients of the systems fast oscillate and depend both of slow and fast variables. We obtain the homogenized operator and in the uniform norm sense we construct the leading terms of the asymptotics expansion for the resolvent of the operator described by the system. The convergence of the spectrum is established. The convergence of the spectrum is established. The examples are given.
