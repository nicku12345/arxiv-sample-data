Exactly solvable N-dimensional model of the quantum isotropic singular oscillator in the relativistic configurational \vec r_N-space is proposed. It is shown that through the simple substitutions the finite-difference equation for the N-dimensional singular oscillator can be reduced to the similar finite-difference equation for the relativistic isotropic three-dimensional singular oscillator. We have found the radial wavefunctions and energy spectrum of the problem and constructed a dynamical symmetry algebra.
