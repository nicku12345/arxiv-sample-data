For the nonlocal T-periodic Gross-Pitaevsky operator, formal solutions of the Floquet problem asymptotic in small parameter \hbar, \hbar\to0, up to O(\hbar^{3/2}) have been constructed. The quasi-energy spectral series found correspond to the closed phase trajectories of the Hamilton-Ehrenfest system which are stable in the linear approximation. The monodromy operator of this equation has been constructed to within \hat O(\hbar^{3/2}) in the class of trajectory-concentrated functions. The Aharonov-Anandan phases have been calculated for the quasi-energy states.
