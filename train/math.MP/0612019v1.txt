We have shown that Lorentz transformation is not necessary to present relativistic relative velocity. A modified definition of velocity together with Galilean transformation is equivalent to relativistic relative velocity. On the other hand, Galilean relative velocity can be presented as a Lorentz transformation. Again the definition of velocity requires a modification.
