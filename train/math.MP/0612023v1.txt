The classical far field concept of wave velocities has its merits while exibiting intrinsic difficulties. A general local approach for the definition of velocities and especially phase velocities for waves avoiding these difficulties is proposed. It includes the classical definitions as particular cases and can be applied to waves of an arbitrary structure, and to arbitrary propagation media as well. Applications of the formalism are elucidated and some basic properties of the local concept defined here are discussed.
