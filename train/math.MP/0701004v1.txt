Let A be a non-negative self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space \mathcal{H} and A_{0} be some densely defined closed restriction of A_{0}, A_{0}\subseteq A \neq A_{0}. It is of interest to know whether A is the unique non-negative self-adjoint extensions of A_{0} in \mathcal{H}. We give a natural criterion that this is the case and if it fails, we describe all non-negative extensions of A_{0}. The obtained results are applied to investigation of non-negative singular point perturbations of the Laplace and poly-harmonic operators in \mathbb{L}_{2}(\mathbf{R}_{n}).
