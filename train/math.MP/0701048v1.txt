Classical thermodynamic theory still holds true in subsystem that is a percolation connected by 8 orders of self-similar 2-body-3-body coupling clusters. The fixed point, B_2^* \equiv 3/8, for the clusters of different size, existing in reduced second Virial coefficients has been proved by scaling theory in percolation field. It is shown that, if B_2^* \equiv 3/8 is combined with B_3^* \equiv 5/8, the potentials of 2-body-3-body coupling clusters, in critical local cluster growth phase transition, balance the kinetic energy in the glass transition. It is also proved that the glass transition corresponds to the regime in which the chemical potentials in all subsystems hold zero.
