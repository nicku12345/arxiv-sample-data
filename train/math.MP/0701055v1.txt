In the present paper the low density limit of the non-chronological multitime correlation functions of boson number type operators is investigated. We prove that the limiting truncated non-chronological correlation can be computed using only a sub-class of diagrams associated to non-crossing pair partitions and thus coincide with the non-truncated correlation functions of suitable free number operators. The independent in the limit subalgebras are found and the limiting statistics is investigated. In particular, it is found that the cumulants of certain elements coincide in the limit with the cumulants of the Poisson distribution. An explicit representation of the limiting correlation functions and thus of the limiting algebra is constructed in a special case through suitably defined quantum white noise operators.
