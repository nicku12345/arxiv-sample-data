The structure of discrete resonances in water-wave turbulence is studied. It is shown that the number of exact 4-wave resonances is huge (hundreds million) even in comparatively small spectral domain when both scale and angle energy transport is taken into account. It is also shown that angle transport can contribute inexplicitly to scale transport. Restrictions for quasi-resonances to start are written out. The general approach can be applied directly to mesoscopic systems encountered in condensed matter (quantum dots), medical physics, etc.
