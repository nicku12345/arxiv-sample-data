Maxwell's equations with massive photons and magnetic monopoles are formulated using spacetime algebra. It is demonstrated that a single non-homogeneous multi-vectorial equation describes the theory. Two limiting cases are considered and their symmetries highlighted: massless photons with magnetic monopoles and finite photon mass in the absence of monopoles. Finally, it is shown that the EM-duality invariance is a symmetry of the Hamiltonian density (for Minkowskian spacetime) and Lagrangian density (for Euclidean 4-space) that reflects the signature of the respective metric manifold.
