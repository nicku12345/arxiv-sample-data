We develop and describe continuous and discrete transforms of class functions on compact simple Lie group G as their expansions into series of uncommon special functions, called here \E-functions in recognition of the fact that the functions generalize common exponential functions. The rank of G is the number of variables in the \E-functions. A uniform discretization of the decomposition problem is described on lattices of any density and symmetry admissible for the Lie group G.
