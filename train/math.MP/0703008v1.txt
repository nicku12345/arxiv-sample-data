The description of electron current through a splitting is a mathematical problem of electron transport in quantum networks. For quantum networks constructed on the interface of narrow-gap semiconductors the relevant scattering problem for the multi-dimensional Schoedinger equation may be substituted by the corresponding problem on a one-dimensional linear graph with proper selfadjoint boundary conditions at the nodes. However, realistic boundary conditions for splittings have not yet been derived.   Here we consider some compact domain attached to a few semi-infinite lines as a model for a quantum network. An asymptotic formula for the scattering matrix for this object is derived in terms of the properties of the compact domain. This allows us to propose designs for devices for manipulating quantum current through a splitting.
