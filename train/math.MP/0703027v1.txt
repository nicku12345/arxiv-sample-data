Here we give brief account of hermitian symplectic spaces, showing that they are intimately connected to symmetric as well as self-adjoint extensions of a symmetric operator. Furthermore we find an explicit parameterisation of the Lagrange Grassmannian in terms of the unitary matrices \U (n). This allows us to explicitly describe all self-adjoint boundary conditions for the Schroedinger operator on the graph in terms of a unitary matrix. We show that the asymptotics of the scattering matrix can be simply expressed in terms of this unitary matrix.
