We present the exact and iterative solutions of the radial Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a class of potential, V(r)=\frac{A}{r^{2}}-\frac{B}{r}+Cr^{\kappa}, for various values of \kappa from -2 to 2, for any n and l quantum states by applying the asymptotic iteration method. The global analysis of this potential family by using the asymptotic iteration method results in exact analytical solutions for the values of \kappa=0 ,-1 and -2. Nevertheless, there are no analytical solutions for the cases \kappa=1 and 2. Therefore, the energy eigenvalues are obtained numerically. Our results are in excellent agreement with the previous works.
