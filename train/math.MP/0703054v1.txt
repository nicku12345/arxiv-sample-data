In this paper we study in details the properties of the duality product of multivectors and multiforms (used in the definition of the hyperbolic Clifford algebra of multivefors) and introduce the theory of the k multivector and l multiform variables multivector (or multiform) extensors over V studying their properties with considerable detail.
