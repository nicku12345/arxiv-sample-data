The domain {\cal D} of all the coupling strengths compatible with the reality of the energies is studied for a family of non-Hermitian N by N matrix Hamiltonians H^{(N)} with tridiagonal and {\cal PT}-symmetric structure. At all dimensions N, the coordinates are found of the extremal points at which the boundary hypersurface \partial {\cal D} touches the circumscribed sphere (for odd N=2M+1) or ellipsoid (for even N=2K).
