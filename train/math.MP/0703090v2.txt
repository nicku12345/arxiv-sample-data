In this paper we consider a large class of many-variable polynomials which contains generalisations of the classical Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel polynomials as special cases, and which occur as the polynomial part in the eigenfunctions of Calogero-Sutherland type operators and their deformations recently found and studied by Chalykh, Feigin, Sergeev, and Veselov. We present a unified and explicit construction of all these polynomials.
