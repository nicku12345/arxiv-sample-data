Relations between states and maps, which are known for quantum systems in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, are formulated rigorously in geometrical terms with no use of coordinate (matrix) interpretation. In a tensor product realization they are represented simply by a permutation of factors. This leads to natural generalizations for infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and a simple proof of a generalized Choi Theorem. The natural framework is based on spaces of Hilbert-Schmidt operators \mathcal{L}_2(\mathcal{H}_2,\mathcal{H}_1) and the corresponding tensor products \mathcal{H}_1\otimes\mathcal{H}_2^* of Hilbert spaces. It is proved that the corresponding isomorphisms cannot be naturally extended to compact (or bounded) operators, nor reduced to the trace-class operators. On the other hand, it is proven that there is a natural continuous map \mathcal{C}:\mathcal{L}_1(\mathcal{L}_2(\mathcal{H}_2,\mathcal{H}_1))\to \mathcal{L}_\infty(\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}_2),\mathcal{L}_1(\mathcal{H}_1)) from trace-class operators on \mathcal{L}_2(\mathcal{H}_2,\mathcal{H}_1) (with the nuclear norm) into compact operators mapping the space of all bounded operators on \mathcal{H}_2 into trace class operators on \mathcal{H}_1 (with the operator-norm). Also in the infinite-dimensional context, the Schmidt measure of entanglement and multipartite generalizations of state-maps relations are considered in the paper.
