We compute the three point correlation function for the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on quantum star graphs in the limit where the number of edges tends to infinity. This extends a work by Berkolaiko and Keating, where they get the 2-point correlation function and show that it follows neither Poisson, nor random matrix statistics. It makes use of the trace formula and combinatorial analysis.
