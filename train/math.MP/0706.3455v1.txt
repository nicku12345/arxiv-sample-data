We consider the wide class of few-particle systems that have some analog of the thermodynamic laws. These systems are characterized by the distributions that are determined by the Hamiltonian and satisfy the Liouville equation. Few-particle systems of this class are described by a non-holonomic constraint: the power of non-potential forces is directly proportional to the velocity of the elementary phase volume change. The coefficient of this proportionality is determined by the Hamiltonian. In the general case, the examples of the few-particle systems of this class are the constant temperature systems, canonical-dissipative systems, and Fermi-Bose classical systems.
