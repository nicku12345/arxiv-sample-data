We give a short review of Frobenius manifolds and algebraic integrability and study their intersection. The simplest case is the relation between the Frobenius manifold of simple singularities, which is almost dual to the integrable open Toda chain. New types of manifolds called extra special Kaehler and special F-manifolds are introduced which capture the intersection.
