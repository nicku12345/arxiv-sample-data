An intriguingly natural generalization, using complex octonions, of general relativity is pointed out. The starting point is the vierbein-based double dual formulation of the Einstein-Hilbert action. In terms of two natural structures on the (complex) quaternions and (complex) octonions, the inner product and the cross products, respectively, this action is linked with the complex quaternionic structure constants, and subsequently generalized to an achtbein-based 'double chi-dual' action in terms of the complex octonionic structure constants.
