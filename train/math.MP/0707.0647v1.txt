The modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (mKP) equation is shown in this paper to be decomposable into the first two soliton equations of the 2N-coupled Chen-Lee-Liu and Kaup-Newell hierarchies by respectively nonlinearizing two sets of symmetry Lax pairs. In these two cases, the decomposed (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear systems both have a couple of different Lax representations, which means that there are two linear systems associated with the mKP equation under the same constraint between the potential and eigenfunctions. For each Lax representation of the decomposed (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear systems, the corresponding Darboux transformation is further constructed such that a series of explicit solutions of the mKP equation can be recursively generated with the assistance of symbolic computation. In illustration, four new families of solitary-wave solutions are presented and the relevant stability is analyzed.
