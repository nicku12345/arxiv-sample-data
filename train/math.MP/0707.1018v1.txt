In a recent paper by Barton (J. Phys. A40, 1011 (2007)), the 1-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation was solved analytically for the non-singular Coulomb-like potential V_1(|x|) = -\alpha/(|x|+a). In the present paper, these results are completely confirmed by a numerical formulation that also allows a solution for an alternative cutoff Coulomb potential V_2(|x|) = -\alpha/|x|, ~|x| > a, and otherwise V_2(|x|) = -\alpha/a.
