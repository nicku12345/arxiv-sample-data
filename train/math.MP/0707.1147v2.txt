In this paper we prove a nontrivial lower bound for the determinant of the covariance matrix of quantum mechanical observables, which was conjectured by Gibilisco, Isola and Imparato. The lower bound is given in terms of the commutator of the state and the observables and their scalar product, which is generated by an arbitrary symmetric operator monotone function.
