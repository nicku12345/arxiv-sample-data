For a quantum Markov semigroup \T on the algebra \B with a faithful invariant state \rho, we can define an adjoint \widetilde{\T} with respect to the scalar product determined by \rho. In this paper, we solve the open problems of characterising adjoints \widetilde{\T} that are also a quantum Markov semigroup and satisfy the detailed balance condition in terms of the operators H,L_k in the Gorini Kossakowski Sudarshan Lindblad representation \Ll(x)=i[H,x] - {1/2}\sum_k(L^*_kL_k x-2L^*_kxL_k + xL^*_kL_k) of the generator of \T. We study the adjoint semigroup with respect to both scalar products <a,b> = \tr(\rho a^* b) and <a,b> = \tr(\rho^{1/2} a^* \rho^{1/2}b).
