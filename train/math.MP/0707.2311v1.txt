We investigate a system of two weakly coupled oscillators. It is shown that an external periodic perturbation can lead to the capture into resonance. Asymptotic description and numerical simulations are presented. We have obtained the explicit formula for the threshold value for the amplitude of the perturbation that leads to the autoresonance.
