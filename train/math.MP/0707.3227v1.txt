Both direct and reverse log-Sobolev inequalities, relating the Shannon entropy with a \mu-deformed energy, are shown to hold in a family of \mu-deformed Segal-Bargmann spaces. This shows that the \mu-deformed energy of a state is finite if and only if its Shannon entropy is finite. The direct inequality is a new result, while the reverse inequality has already been shown by the authors but using different methods. Next the \mu-deformed energy of a state is shown to be finite if and only if its Dirichlet form energy is finite. This leads to both direct and reverse log-Sobolev inequalities that relate the Shannon entropy with the Dirichlet energy. We obtain that the Dirichlet energy of a state is finite if and only if its Shannon entropy is finite. The main method used here is based on a study of the reproducing kernel function of these spaces and the associated integral kernel transform.
