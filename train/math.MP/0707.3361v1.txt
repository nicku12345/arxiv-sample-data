In the years from 2001 to 2006, Guseinov and his coworkers published 40 articles on the derivation and application of one-range addition theorems. In E. J. Weniger, Extended Comment on ``One-Range Addition Theorems for Coulomb Interaction Potential and Its Derivatives'' by I. I. Guseinov (Chem. Phys. Vol. 309 (2005), pp. 209 - 213), arXiv:0704.1088v2 [math-ph], it was argued that Guseinov's treatment of one-range addition theorems is at best questionable and in some cases fundamentally flawed. In I. I. Guseinov, Extended Rejoinder to "Extended Comment on "One-Range Addition Theorems for Coulomb Interaction Potential and Its Derivatives'' by I. I. Guseinov (Chem. Phys. and Vol. 309 (2005)'', pp. 209-213), arXiv:0706.0975v2 [physics.chem-ph], these claims were disputed. To clarify the situation, the most serious mathematical flaws in Guseinov's treatment of one-range addition theorems are discussed in more depth.
