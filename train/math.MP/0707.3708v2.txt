This paper presents an observation that under reasonable conditions, many partial differential equations from mathematical physics possess three structural properties. One of them can be understand as a variant of the celebrated Onsager reciprocal relation in Modern Thermodynamics. It displays a direct relation of irreversible processes to the entropy change. We show that the properties imply various entropy dissipation conditions for hyperbolic relaxation problems. As an application of the observation, we propose an approximation method to solve relaxation problems. Moreover, the observation is interpreted physically and verified with eight (sets of) systems from different fields.
