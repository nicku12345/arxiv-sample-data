We prove localization at the bottom of the spectrum for a random Schr\"odinger operator in the continuum with a single-site potential probability distribution supported by a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue measure. This distribution is too singular to be treated by the usual methods. In particular, an "a priori" Wegner estimate is not available. To prove the result we perform a multiscale analysis following the work of Bourgain and Kenig for the Bernoulli-Anderson Hamiltonian, and obtain the required Wegner estimate scale by scale. To do so, we generalize their argument based on Sperner's Lemma by resorting to the LYM inequality for multisets, and combine it with the concept of scale dependent equivalent classes of configurations introduced by Germinet, Hislop and Klein for the study of Poisson Hamiltonians.
