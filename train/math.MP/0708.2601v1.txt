Recently, random graphs in which vertices are characterized by hidden variables controlling the establishment of edges between pairs of vertices have attracted much attention. Here, we present a specific realization of a class of random network models in which the connection probability between two vertices (i,j) is a specific function of degrees ki and kj. In the framework of the configuration model of random graphs, we find analytical expressions for the degree correlation and clustering as a function of the variance of the desired degree distribution. The expressions obtained are checked by means of numerical simulations. Possible applications of our model are discussed.
