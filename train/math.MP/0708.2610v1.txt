Recently, the classical configuration model for random graphs with given degree distribution has been extensively used as a null model in contraposition to real networks with the same degree distribution. In this paper, we briefly review the applications of this model and derive analytical expression for connection probability by the expanding coefficient method. We also use our expanding coefficient method to obtain the connection probability for the directed configuration model.
