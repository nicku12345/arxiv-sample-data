We consider a kinetic model for a system of two species of particles interacting through a longrange repulsive potential and a reservoir at given temperature. The model is described by a set of two coupled Vlasov-Fokker-Plank equations. The important front solution, which represents the phase boundary, is a one-dimensional stationary solution on the real line with given asymptotic values at infinity. We prove the asymptotic stability of the front for small symmetric perturbations.
