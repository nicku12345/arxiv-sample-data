We obtain an embedding of a one-parameter family of exceptional simple Lie superalgebras D(2, 1 ; \alpha) into the Lie superalgebra of pseudodifferential symbols on the supercircle S^{1|2}. Correspondingly, there is an embedding of D(2, 1 ; \alpha) into a nontrivial central extension of the derived contact superconformal algebra K'(4) realized in terms of 4\times 4 matrices over a Weyl algebra.
