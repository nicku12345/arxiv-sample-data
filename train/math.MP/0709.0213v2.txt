We give a variational proof of the existence of infinitely many bound states below the continuous spectrum for spin-orbit Hamiltonians (including the Rashba and Dresselhaus cases) perturbed by measure potentials thus extending the results of J.Bruening, V.Geyler, K.Pankrashkin: J. Phys. A 40 (2007) F113--F117.
