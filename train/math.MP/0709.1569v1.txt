A generic PT-symmetric Hamiltonian is assumed tridiagonalized and truncated to N dimensions, and its up-down symmetrized special cases with J=[N/2] real couplings are considered. In the strongly non-Hermitian regime the secular equation gets partially factorized at all N. This enables us to reveal a fine-tuned alignment of the dominant couplings implying an asymptotically sharply spiked shape of the boundary of the J-dimensional quasi-Hermiticity domain in which all the spectrum of energies remains real and observable.
