We have constructed a sequence of solutions of the Helmholtz equation forming an orthogonal sequence on a given surface. Coefficients of these functions depend on an explicit algebraic formulae from the coefficient of the surface. Moreover, for exterior Helmholtz equation we have constructed an explicit normal derivative of the Dirichlet Green function. In the same way the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator is constructed. We proved that normalized coefficients are uniformly bounded from zero.
