This article employs Schramm-Loewner Evolution to obtain intersection exponents for several chordal SLE_{8/3} curves in a wedge. As SLE_{8/3} is believed to describe the continuum limit of self-avoiding walks, these exponents correspond to those obtained by Cardy, Duplantier and Saleur for self-avoiding walks in an arbitrary wedge-shaped geometry using conformal invariance based arguments. Our approach builds on work by Werner, where the restriction property for SLE(\kappa,\rho) processes and an absolute continuity relation allow the calculation of such exponents in the half-plane. Furthermore, the method by which these results are extended is general enough to apply to the new class of hiding exponents introduced by Werner.
