We consider quantum scattering from a compactly supported potential q. The semiclassical limit amounts to letting the wavenumber k \to \infty while rescaling the potential as k^2 q (alternatively, one can scale Planck's constant \hbar \searrow 0). It is well-known that, under appropriate conditions, for \om \in \bbS_{n-1} such that there is exactly one outgoing ray with direction \om (in the sense of geometric optics), the differential scattering cross section |f(\om,k)|^{2} tends to the classical differential cross section |f_{cl}(\om)|^2 as k \uparrow \infty. It is also clear that the same can not be true if there is more than one outgoing ray with direction \om or for \emph{nonregular} directions (including the forward direction \theta_0). However, based on physical intuition, one could conjecture |f|^2 \to |f_{cl}|^2 + \sigma_{cl} \delta_{\theta_0} where |f_{cl}|^2 is the classical cross section and \delta_{\theta_0} is the Dirac measure supported at the forward direction \theta_0. The aim of this paper is to prove this conjecture.
