We construct infraparticle scattering states for Compton scattering in the standard model of non-relativistic QED. In our construction, an infrared cutoff initially introduced to regularize the model is removed completely. We rigorously establish the properties of infraparticle scattering theory predicted in the classic work of Bloch and Nordsieck from the 1930's, Faddeev and Kulish, and others. Our results represent a basic step towards solving the infrared problem in (non-relativistic) QED.
