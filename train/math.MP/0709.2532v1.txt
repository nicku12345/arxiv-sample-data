It is shown that in the weak field approximation the new geometrical approach can lead to the linear field equations for the several independent fields. For the stronger fields and in the second order approximation the field equations become non-linear, and the fields become dependent. This breaks the superposition principle for every separate field and produces the interaction between different fields.The unification of the gravitational and electromagnetic field theories is performed in frames of the geometrical approach in the pseudo Riemannian space and in the curved Berwald-Moor space.
