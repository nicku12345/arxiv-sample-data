In Bose-Einstein condensation, a macroscopically large number of particles occupy the same single-particle quantum state. Our goal is to study time-dependent aspects of particle excitations to states other than the single-particle macroscopic state in trapped dilute atomic gases. We adopt the view that atoms are excited in pairs so that their scattering from the single-particle state to vector positions x and y at time t is described by the pair-excitation function, K0(x,y,t). We solve a nonlocal equation for K0 under a slowly varying external potential by assuming that the wave function of the macroscopic state satisfies a time-independent nonlinear Schroedinger equation. For zero initial excitation (K0=0 at t=0) and sufficiently large t, we evaluate asymptotically K0 in terms of the one-variable Lommel function for any distance |x-y|.
