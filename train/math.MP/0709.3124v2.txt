The combinatorial basis of entropy by Boltzmann can be written H= {N}^{-1} \ln \mathbb{W}, where H is the dimensionless entropy of a system, per unit entity, N is the number of entities and \mathbb{W} is the number of ways in which a given realization of the system can occur, known as its statistical weight. Maximizing the entropy (``MaxEnt'') of a system, subject to its constraints, is then equivalent to choosing its most probable (``MaxProb'') realization. For a system of distinguishable entities and states, \mathbb{W} is given by the multinomial weight, and H asymptotically approaches the Shannon entropy. In general, however, \mathbb{W} need not be multinomial, leading to different entropy measures. This work examines the allocation of distinguishable entities to non-degenerate or equally degenerate, indistinguishable states. The non-degenerate form converges to the Shannon entropy in some circumstances, whilst the degenerate case gives a new entropy measure, a function of a multinomial coefficient, coding parameters, and Stirling numbers of the second kind.
