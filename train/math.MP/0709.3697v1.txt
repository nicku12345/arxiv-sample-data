We introduce the harmonic oscillator on the Lobachevsky plane with the aid of the potential V(r)=(a^2\omega^2/4)sinh(r/a)^2 where a is the curvature radius and r is the geodesic distance from a fixed center. Thus the potential is rotationally symmetric and unbounded likewise as in the Euclidean case. The eigenvalue equation leads to the differential equation of spheroidal functions. We provide a basic numerical analysis of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in the case when the value of the angular momentum, m, equals 0.
