An approximate solution of the Klein-Gordon equation for the general Hulth\'en-type potentials in D-dimensions within the framework of an approximation to the centrifugal term is obtained. The bound state energy eigenvalues and the normalized eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of hypergeometric polynomials.
