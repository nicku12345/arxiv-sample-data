A rigorous analytical representation for the multiple scattering coefficients of the fields radiated by an infinite grating of dielectric circular cylinders excited by an obliquely incident plane electromagnetic wave is derived in terms of the "well-known scattering coefficients of an isolated dielectric cylinder at oblique incidence" and "Schl\"omilch series". In addition, a generalized sum-integral grating equation is acquired for the multiple scattered amplitude of a cylinder at oblique incidence in the grating in terms of the scattering coefficients of the insulating dielectric circular cylinder at oblique incidence.
