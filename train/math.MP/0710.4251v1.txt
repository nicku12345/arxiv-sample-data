This paper completes investigation of symmetry properties of nonlinear variable coefficient diffusion-convection equations of the form f(x)u_t=(g(x)A(u)u_x)_x+h(x)B(u)u_x. Potential symmetries of equations from the considered class are found and the connection of them with Lie symmetries of diffusion-type equations is shown. Exact solutions of the Fujita--Storm equation u_t=(u^{-2}u_x)_x are constructed.
