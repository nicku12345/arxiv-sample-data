I present the exact energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of a quantum many-body system of bosons on non-commutative space and in a harmonic oszillator confining potential at the selfdual point. I also argue that this exactly solvable system is a prototype model which provides a generalization of mean field theory taking into account non-trivial correlations which are peculiar to boson systems in two space dimensions and relevant in condensed matter physics. The prologue and epilogue contain a few remarks to relate my main story to recent developments in non-commutative quantum field theory and an addendum to our previous work together with Szabo and Zarembo on this latter subject.
