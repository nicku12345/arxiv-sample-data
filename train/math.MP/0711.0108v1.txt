A computational algorithm for the exact equations representing the scattering coefficients of an infinite grating of insulating dielectric circular cylinders associated with obliquely incident vertically polarized plane electromagnetic waves is generated by matrix methods, and the solution for the scattering coefficients is acquired by a matrix inversion procedure.
