In this paper we take an approach similar to that in [M] to establish a positive mass theorem for asymptotically hyperbolic spin manifolds admitting corners along a hypersurface. The main analysis uses an integral representation of a solution to a perturbed eigenfunction equation to obtain an asymptotic expansion of the solution in the right order. This allows us to understand the change of the mass aspect of a conformal change of asymptotically hyperbolic metrics.
