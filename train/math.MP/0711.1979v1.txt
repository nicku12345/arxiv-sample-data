In this paper, we classify space-time curves up to Galilean group of transformations with Cartan's method of equivalence. As an aim, we elicit invariats from action of special Galilean group on space-time curves, that are, in fact, conservation laws in physics. We also state a necessary and sufficient condition for equivalent Galilean motions.
