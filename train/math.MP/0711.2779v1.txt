The newest model for space-time is based on sub-Riemannian geometry. In this paper, we use a combination of Lorentzian and sub-Riemannian geometry, the suggest a new model which likes to its ancestors, but with the most efficient in application. In continuation, we try to show a new connection which calls generalized connection, and prove some its properties.
