The algebra of fourvectors is described. The fourvectors are more appropriate than the Hamilton quaternions for its use in Physics and the sciences in general. The fourvectors embrace the 3D vectors in a natural form. It is shown the excellent ability to perform rotations with the use of fourvectors, as well as their use in relativity for producing Lorentz boosts, which are understood as simple rotations.
