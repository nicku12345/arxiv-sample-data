We consider transformations of deterministic and random signals governed by simple dynamical mappings. It is shown that the resulting signal can be a random process described in terms of fractal distributions and fractal domain integrals. In typical cases a steady state satisfies a dilatation equation, relating an unknown function f(x) to f(\kappa x) (for example, {f(x)=g(x)f(\kappa x)}). We discuss simple linear models as well as nonlinear systems with chaotic behavior including dissipative circuits with delayed feedback.
