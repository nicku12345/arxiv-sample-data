We consider the parastatistics algebra with both parabosonic and parafermionic operators and show that the states in the universal parastatistics Fock space are in bijection with the Super Semistandard Young Tableaux (SSYT). Using deformation of the parastatistics algebra we get a monoid structure on SSYT which is a super version of the plactic monoid.
