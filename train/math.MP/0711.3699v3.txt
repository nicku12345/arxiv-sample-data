Exact and quasi-exact solvabilities of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation are discussed from a unified viewpoint based on the prepotential together with Bethe ansatz equations. This is a constructive approach which gives the potential as well as the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues simultaneously. The novel feature of the present work is the realization that both exact and quasi-exact solvabilities can be solely classified by two integers, the degrees of two polynomials which determine the change of variable and the zero-th order prepotential. Most of the well-known exactly and quasi-exactly solvable models, and many new quasi-exactly solvable ones, can be generated by appropriately choosing the two polynomials. This approach can be easily extended to the constructions of exactly and quasi-exactly solvable Dirac, Pauli, and Fokker-Planck equations.
