In this note, we study a continuous matrix-valued Anderson-type model. Both leading Lyapounov exponents of this model are proved to be positive and distincts for all energies in (2,+\infty) except those in a discrete set, which leads to absence of absolutely continuous spectrum in (2,+\infty). The methods, using group theory results by Breuillard and Gelander, allow for singular Bernoulli distributions.
