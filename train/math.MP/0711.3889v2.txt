We study a class of continuous matrix-valued Anderson models acting on L^{2}(\R^{d})\otimes \C^{N}. We prove the existence of their Integrated Density of States for any d\geq 1 and N\geq 1. Then for d=1 and for arbitrary N, we prove the H\"older continuity of the Integrated Density of States under some assumption on the group G_{\mu_{E}} generated by the transfer matrices associated to our models. This regularity result is based upon the analoguous regularity of the Lyapounov exponents associated to our model, and a new Thouless formula which relates the sum of the positive Lyapounov exponents to the Integrated Density of States. In the final section, we present an example of matrix-valued Anderson model for which we have already proved, in a previous article, that the assumption on the group G_{\mu_{E}} is verified. Therefore the general results developed here can be applied to this model.
