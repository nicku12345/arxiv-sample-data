Theory of scattering by many small bodies is developed under various assumptions concerning the ratio \frac{a}{d}, where a is the characteristic dimension of a small body and d is the distance between neighboring bodies d = O(a^{\ka_1}), 0 < \ka_1 < 1. On the boundary S_m of every small body an impedance-type condition is assumed u_N = \zeta_m u on S_m, 1 \leq m \leq M, \zeta_m = h_m a^{-\ka}, 0 < \ka, h_m are constants independent of a. The behavior of the field in the region in which M = M(a)\gg 1 small particles are embedded is studied as a\ra 0 and m(a)\ra \ue. Formulas for the refraction coefficient of the limiting medium are derived under the assumptions: a)  \ka_1=(2-\ka)/3, 0<\ka\leq 1, and b) \ka_1=1/3, \ka>1.
