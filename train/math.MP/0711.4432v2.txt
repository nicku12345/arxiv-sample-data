We show that skew-orthogonal functions, defined with respect to Jacobi weight w_{a,b}(x)={(1-x)}^a{(1+x)}^b, a, b>-1, including the limiting cases of Laguerre (w_{a}(x)=x^{a}e^{-x}, a > -1) and Gaussian weight (w(x)=e^{-x^2}), satisfy three-term recursion relation in the quaternion space. From this, we derive generalized Christoffel-Darboux (GCD) formul\ae\ for kernel functions arising in the study of the corresponding orthogonal and symplectic ensembles of random 2N\times 2N matrices. Using the GCD formul\ae we calculate the level-densities and prove that in the bulk of the spectrum, under appropriate scaling, the eigenvalue correlations are universal. We also provide evidence to show that there exists a mapping between skew-orthogonal functions arising in the study of orthogonal and symplectic ensembles of random matrices.
