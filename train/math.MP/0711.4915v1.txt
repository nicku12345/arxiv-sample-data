In this contribution, we discuss three situations in which complete integrability of a three dimensional classical system and its quantum version can be achieved under some conditions. The former is a system with axial symmetry. In the second, we discuss a three dimensional system without spatial symmetry which admits separation of variables if we use ellipsoidal coordinates. In both cases, and as a condition for integrability, certain conditions arise in the integrals of motion. Finally, we study integrability in the three dimensional sphere and a particular case associated with the Kepler problem in S^3.
