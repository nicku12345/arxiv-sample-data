We investigate steady symmetric gravity water waves on finite depth. For non-positive vorticity it is shown that the particles display a mean forward drift, and for a class of waves we prove that the size of this drift is strictly increasing from bottom to surface. We also provide detailed information concerning the streamlines and the particle trajectories. This includes the case of particles within irrotational waves.
