The scalar scattering of the plane wave by a strictly convex obstacle with impedance boundary conditions is considered. The uniform boundedness of the Total Cross Section for all values of frequencies is proved. The high frequency limit of the Transport Cross Section is founded and presented as a classical functional of the variational theory.
