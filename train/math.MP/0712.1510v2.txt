The class of static, spherically symmetric, and finite energy hedgehog solutions in the SU(2) Skyrme model is examined on a metric three-cylinder. The exact analytic shape function of the 1-Skyrmion is found. It can be expressed via elliptic integrals. Its energy is calculated, and its stability with respect to radial and spherically symmetric deformations is analyzed. No other topologically nontrivial solutions belonging to this class are possible on the three-cylinder.
