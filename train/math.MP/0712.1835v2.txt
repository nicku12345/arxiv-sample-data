An algorithmic method using conservation law multipliers is introduced that yields necessary and sufficient conditions to find invertible mappings of a given nonlinear PDE to some linear PDE and to construct such a mapping when it exists. Previous methods yielded such conditions from admitted point or contact symmetries of the nonlinear PDE. Through examples, these two linearization approaches are contrasted.
