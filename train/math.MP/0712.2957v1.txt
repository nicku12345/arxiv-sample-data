Umbral calculus can be viewed as an abstract theory of the Heisenberg commutation relation [\hat P,\hat M]=1. In ordinary quantum mechanics \hat P is the derivative and \hat M the coordinate operator. Here we shall realize \hat P as a second order differential operator and \hat M as a first order integral one. We show that this makes it possible to solve large classes of differential and integro-differential equations and to introduce new classes of orthogonal polynomials, related to Laguerre polynomials. These polynomials are particularly well suited for describing so called flatenned beams in laser theory
