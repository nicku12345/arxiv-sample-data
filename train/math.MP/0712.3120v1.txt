For scattering systems consisting of a (family of) maximal dissipative extension(s) and a selfadjoint extension of a symmetric operator with finite deficiency indices, the spectral shift function is expressed in terms of an abstract Titchmarsh-Weyl function and a variant of the Birman-Krein formula is proved.
