The main objective of this article are two-fold. First, we introduce some general principles on phase transition dynamics, including a new dynamic transition classification scheme, and a Ginzburg-Landau theory for modeling equilibrium phase transitions. Second, apply the general principles and the recently developed dynamic transition theory to study dynamic phase transitions of PVT systems. In particular, we establish a new time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model, whose dynamic transition analysis is carried out. It is worth pointing out that the new dynamic transition theory, along with the dynamic classification scheme and new time-dependent Ginzburg Landau models for equilibrium phase transitions can be used in other phase transition problems, including e.g. the ferromagnetism and superfluidity, which will be reported elsewhere. In addition, the analysis for the PVT system in this article leads to a few physical predications, which are otherwise unclear from the physical point of view.
