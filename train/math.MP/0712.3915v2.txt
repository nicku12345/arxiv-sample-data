In White Noise Analysis (WNA), various random quantities are analyzed as elements of (S)^{\ast}, the space of Hida distributions ([1]). Hida distributions are generalized functions of white noise, which is to be naturally viewed as the derivative of the Brownian motion. On (S)^{\ast}, the Wick product is defined in terms of the \mathcal{S}-transform. We have found such a remarkable property that the Wick product has no zero devisors among Hida distributions. This result is a WNA version of Titchmarsh's theorem and is expected to play fundamental roles in developing the \textquotedblleft operational calculus\textquotedblright in WNA along the line of Mikusi\'{n}ski's version for solving differential equations.
