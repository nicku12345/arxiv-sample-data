This is a continuation of the paper [4] of Bleher and Fokin, in which the large n asymptotics is obtained for the partition function Z_n of the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions in the disordered phase. In the present paper we obtain the large n asymptotics of Z_n in the ferroelectric phase. We prove that for any \ep>0, as n\to\infty, Z_n=CG^nF^{n^2}[1+O(e^{-n^{1-\ep}})], and we find the exact value of the constants C,G and F. The proof is based on the large n asymptotics for the underlying discrete orthogonal polynomials and on the Toda equation for the tau-function.
