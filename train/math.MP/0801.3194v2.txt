The computer program `Fecom.nb' implementing the Fedosov *-product in Darboux coordinates is presented. It has been written in Mathematica 6.0 but it can be easily modified to be run in some earlier version of Mathematica. To optimize computations elements of the Weyl algebra are treated as polynomials. Several procedures which order the terms are included.   The program is available at the web page http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEBU_v1_0.html
