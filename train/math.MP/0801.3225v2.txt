By using the Moutard transformation of two-dimensional Schroedinger operators we derive a procedure for constructing explicit examples of such operators with rational fast decaying potentials and degenerate L_2-kernels (this construction was sketched in arXiv:0706.3595) and show that if we take some of these potentials as the Cauchy data for the Novikov-Veselov equation (a two-dimensional version of the Korteweg-de Vries equation), then the corresponding solutions blow up in a finite time
