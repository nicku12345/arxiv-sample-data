We give a general construction of realizations of the contact superconformal algebras K(2) and \hat{K}'(4), and the exceptional superconformal algebra CK_6 as subsuperalgebras of matrices over a Weyl algebra of size 2^N\times 2^N, where N = 1, 2 and 3. We show that there is no such a realization for K(2N), if N\geq 4.
