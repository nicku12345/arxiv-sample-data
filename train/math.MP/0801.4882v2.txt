We extend to the semi-classical setting the Maupertuis-Jacobi correspondance for a pair of hamiltonians (H(x,hD_x), {\cal H}(x,hD_x). If {\cal H}(p,x) is completely integrable, or has merely has invariant diohantine torus \Lambda in energy surface {\cal E}, then we can construct a family of quasi-modes for H(x,hD_x) at the corresponding energy E. This applies in particular to the theory of water-waves in shallow water, and determines trapped modes by an island, from the knowledge of Liouville metrics.
