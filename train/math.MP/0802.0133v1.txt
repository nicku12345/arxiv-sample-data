We study the operator theory associated with such infinite graphs G as occur in electrical networks, in fractals, in statistical mechanics, and even in internet search engines. Our emphasis is on the determination of spectral data for a natural Laplace operator associated with the graph in question. This operator \Delta will depend not only on G, but also on a prescribed positive real valued function c defined on the edges in G. In electrical network models, this function c will determine a conductance number for each edge. We show that the corresponding Laplace operator \Delta is automatically essential selfadjoint. By this we mean that \Delta is defined on the dense subspace \mathcal{D} (of all the real valued functions on the set of vertices G^{0} with finite support) in the Hilbert space l^{2}% (G^{0}). The conclusion is that the closure of the operator \Delta is selfadjoint in l^{2}(G^{0}), and so in particular that it has a unique spectral resolution, determined by a projection valued measure on the Borel subsets of the infinite half-line. We prove that generically our graph Laplace operator \Delta=\Delta_{c} will have continuous spectrum. For a given infinite graph G with conductance function c, we set up a system of finite graphs with periodic boundary conditions such the finite spectra, for an ascending family of finite graphs, will have the Laplace operator for G as its limit.
