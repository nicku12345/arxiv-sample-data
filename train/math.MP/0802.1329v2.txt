We study birational transformations of the projective space originating from lattice statistical mechanics, specifically from various chiral Potts models. Associating these models to \emph{stable patterns} and \emph{signed-patterns}, we give general results which allow us to find \emph{all} chiral q-state spin-edge Potts models when the number of states q is a prime or the square of a prime, as well as several q-dependent family of models. We also prove the absence of monocolor stable signed-pattern with more than four states. This demonstrates a conjecture about cyclic Hadamard matrices in a particular case. The birational transformations associated to these lattice spin-edge models show complexity reduction. In particular we recover a one-parameter family of integrable transformations, for which we give a matrix representation
