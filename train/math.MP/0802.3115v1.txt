Presented is description of kinematics and dynamics of material points with internal degrees of freedom moving in a Riemannian manifold. The models of internal degrees of freedom we concentrate on are based on the orthogonal and affine groups. Roughly speaking, we consider infinitesimal gyroscopes and homogeneously deformable gyroscopes (affienly-rigid bodies) in curved manifolds. We follow our earlier models of extended rigid and affinely-rigid bodies moving in a flat space. It is well known that in curved spaces in general there is no well-defined concept of extended rigid or affinely-rigid body. Our infinitesimal models are mathematically well defined and physically they may be interpreted as an approximate description of "small" rigid and affinely-rigid bodies. We derive equations of motion and show how internal degrees of freedom interact with spatial geometry, first of all with the curvature but also with the torsion. Integrability and degeneracy problems are discussed.
