Having in view some applications in nanophysics, in particular in nanophysics of materials, we develop new dynamical models of structured bodies with affine internal degrees of freedom. In particular, we construct some models where not only kinematics but also dynamics of systems of affine bodies is affinely invariant. Quantization schemes are developed. This is necessary in the range of physical phenomena we are interested in.
