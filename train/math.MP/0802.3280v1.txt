Discussed is kinematics and dynamics of bodies with affine degrees of freedom, i.e., homogeneously deformable "gyroscopes". The special stress is laid on the status and physical justification of affine dynamical invariance. On the basis of classical Hamiltonian formalism the Schroedinger quantization procedure is performed. Some methods of the partial separation of variables, analytical treatment and search of rigorous solutions are developed. The possiblity of applications in theory of structured media, nanophysics, and molecular physics is discussed.
