Discussed are field-theoretic models with degrees of freedom described by the n-leg field in an n-dimensional "space-time" manifold. Lagrangians are generally-covariant and invariant under the internal group GL(n,{\bf R}). It is shown that the resulting field equations have some correspondence with Einstein theory and possess homogeneous vacuum solutions given by semisimple Lie group spaces or their appropriate deformations. There exists a characteristic link with the generalized Born-Infeld type nonlinearity and relativistic mechanics of structured continua. In our model signature is not introduced by hands, but is given by integration constants for certain differential equations.
