We consider an invariant quantum Hamiltonian H=-\Delta_{LB}+V in the L^{2} space based on a Riemannian manifold \tilde{M} with a countable discrete symmetry group \Gamma. Typically, \tilde{M} is the universal covering space of a multiply connected Riemannian manifold M and \Gamma is the fundamental group of M. On the one hand, following the basic step of the Bloch analysis, one decomposes the L^{2} space over \tilde{M} into a direct integral of Hilbert spaces formed by equivariant functions on \tilde{M}. The Hamiltonian H decomposes correspondingly, with each component H_{\Lambda} being defined by a quasi-periodic boundary condition. The quasi-periodic boundary conditions are in turn determined by irreducible unitary representations \Lambda of \Gamma. On the other hand, fixing a quasi-periodic boundary condition (i.e., a unitary representation \Lambda of \Gamma) one can express the corresponding propagator in terms of the propagator associated to the Hamiltonian H. We discuss these procedures in detail and show that in a sense they are mutually inverse.
