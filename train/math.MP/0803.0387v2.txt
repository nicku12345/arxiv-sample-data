Symmetries of a differential equations is one of the most important concepts in theory of differential equations and physics. One of the most prominent equations is KdV (Kortwege-de Vries) equation with application in shallow water theory. In this paper we are going to explain a particular method for finding symmetries of KdV equation, which is called Harrison method. Our tools in this method are Lie derivatives and differential forms, which will be discussed in the first section more precisely. In second chapter we will have some analysis on the solutions of KdV equation and we give a method, which is called first integral method for finding the solutions of KdV equation.
