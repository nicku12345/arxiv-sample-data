Within the framework of the well-known curvature models, a fluid lipid bilayer membrane is regarded as a surface embedded in the three-dimensional Euclidean space whose equilibrium shapes are described in terms of its mean and Gaussian curvatures by the so-called membrane shape equation. In the present paper, all solutions to this equation determining cylindrical membrane shapes are found and presented, together with the expressions for the corresponding position vectors, in explicit analytic form. The necessary and sufficient conditions for such a surface to be closed are derived and several sufficient conditions for its directrix to be simple or self-intersecting are given.
