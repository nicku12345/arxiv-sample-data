We consider the Vlasov-Poisson system with spherical symmetry and an exterior potential which is induced by a point mass in the center. This system can be used as a simple model for a newtonian galaxy surrounding a black hole. For this system, we establish a global existence result for classical solutions with shell-like initial data, i.e. the support of the density is bounded away from the point mass singularity. We also prove existence and stability of stationary solutions which describe static shells, where we use a variational approach which was established by Y. Guo and G. Rein.
