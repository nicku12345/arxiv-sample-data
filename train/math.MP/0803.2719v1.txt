Relation of ultrametric analysis, wavelet theory and cascade models of turbulence is discussed. We construct the explicit solutions for the nonlinear ultrametric integral equation with quadratic nonlinearity. These solutions are built by means of the recurrent hierarchical procedure which is analogous to the procedure used for the cascade models of turbulence.
