In 1993, Baxter gave 2^{m_Q} eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the N-state superintegrable chiral Potts model with spin-translation quantum number Q, where m_Q=\lfloor(NL-L-Q)/N\rfloor. In our previous paper we studied the Q=0 ground state sector, when the size L of the transfer matrix is chosen to be a multiple of N. It was shown that the corresponding \tau_2 matrix has a degenerate eigenspace generated by the generators of r=m_0 simple sl_2 algebras. These results enable us to express the transfer matrix in the subspace in terms of these generators E_m^{\pm} and H_m for m=1,...,r. Moreover, the corresponding 2^r eigenvectors of the transfer matrix are expressed in terms of rotated eigenvectors of H_m.
