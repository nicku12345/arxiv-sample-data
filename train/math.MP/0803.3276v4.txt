I tell about different mathematical tool that is important in general relativity. The text of the book includes definition of geometrical object, concept of reference frame, geometry of metric-affinne manifold. Using this concept I learn few physical applications: dynamics and Lorentz transformation in gravitational fields, Doppler shift.   A reference frame in event space is a smooth field of orthonormal bases. Every reference frame is equipped by anholonomic coordinates. Using anholonomic coordinates allows to find out relative speed of two observers and appropriate Lorentz transformation. Synchronization of a reference frame is an anholonomic time coordinate. Simple calculations show how synchronization influences time measurement in the vicinity of the Earth. Measurement of Doppler shift from the star orbiting the black hole helps to determine mass of the black hole.   We call a manifold with torsion and nonmetricity the metric\hyph affine manifold. The nonmetricity leads to a difference between the auto parallel line and the extreme line, and to a change in the expression of the Frenet transport and moving basis. The torsion leads to a change in the Killing equation. We also need to add a similar equation for the connection.   The analysis of the Frenet transport leads to the concept of the Cartan transport and an introduction of the connection compatible with the metric tensor. The dynamics of a particle follows to the Cartan transport. We need additional physical constraints to make a nonmetricity observable. Learning how torsion influences on tidal force reveals similarity between tidal equation for geodesic and the Killing equation of second type.
