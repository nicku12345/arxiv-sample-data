In the search of a mathematical basis for quantum mechanics, in order to render it self-consistent and rationally understandable, we find that the best approach is to adopt E. Cartan's way for discovering spinors; that is to start from 3-dimensional null vectors and then show how they may be represented by two dimensional spinors. We have now only to go along this path, however in the opposite direction; with these spinors (which are pure) construct bilinearly null vectors: and we find that they naturally generate null vectors of Minkowski momentum space, where Cartan equations defining pure spinors are identical to all equations of motion for massless systems: both the quantum (Weyl's) and the classical ones (Maxwell's), are determined by them. We have then the possibility of a new, purely mathematical, determination of h: the Planck's constant, and thus the possible mathematical starting point for the representation of quantum mechanics.
