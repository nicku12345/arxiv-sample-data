The paper describes conditions for transformation from the Dirac representation to the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation. The necessary condition is the block-diagonal transformation of Hamiltonian relative to the upper and lower components of the wave function. The sufficient condition is the wave function transformation law described by relation (6). It has been demonstrated that the unitary transformations offered by the authors of the papers [14], [15], [16], [17] do not satisfy the sufficiency condition (6) and, hence, they are not the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformations. In applications, the matrix elements of any operator in the FW representation can be calculated, according to (6), using the normalized two-component wave functions in the Dirac representation known for the given problem.
