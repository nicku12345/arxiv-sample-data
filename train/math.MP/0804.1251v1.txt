In earlier work (*) we studied an extension of the canonical symplectic structure in the cotangent bundle of an affine space {\cal Q}={\bf R}^N, by additional terms implying the Poisson non-commutativity of both configuration and momentum variables. In this article, we claim that such an extension can be done consistently when {\cal Q} is a Lie group G. -- (*) : F.J.Vanhecke, C.Sigaud and A.R.da Silva, arXiv:math-phys/0502003 and Braz.J.Phys.{\bf 36},no IB,194(2006)
