Recently, a quantum version of Painleve equations from the point of view of their symmetries was proposed by H. Nagoya. These quantum Painleve equations can be written as Hamiltonian systems with a (noncommutative) polynomial Hamiltonian. We give a characterization of the quantum Painleve equations by certain holomorphic properties. Namely, we introduce canonical transformations such that the Painleve Hamiltonian system is again transformed into a polynomial Hamiltonian system, and we show that the Hamiltonian can be uniquely characterized through this holomorphic property.
