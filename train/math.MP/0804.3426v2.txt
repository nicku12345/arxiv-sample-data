A thin layer of liquid in a horizontal cell is subjected to a periodic vertical force with two control parameters: acceleration and frequency. The influence of the rheological behavior of the fluid was considered over the empirically obtained results, which were subjected to a multfractal spectrum process. As control parameters varied, so did the corresponding spectra, according to theoretical models; each change of state was visually detected, which permitted interpreting the corresponding spectral changes.
