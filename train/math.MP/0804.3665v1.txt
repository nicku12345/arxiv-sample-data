Consider the polynomial tr (A + tB)^m in t for positive hermitian matrices A and B with m \in \N. The Bessis-Moussa-Villani conjecture (in the equivalent form of Lieb and Seiringer) states that this polynomial has nonnegative coefficients only. We prove that they are at least asymptotically positive, for the nontrivial case of AB \neq 0. More precisely, we show that the k-th coefficient is positive for all integer m \geq m_0, where m_0 depends on A, B and k.
