We introduce a new fractional oscillator process which can be obtained as solution of a stochastic differential equation with two fractional orders. Basic properties such as fractal dimension and short range dependence of the process are studied by considering the asymptotic properties of its covariance function. The fluctuation--dissipation relation of the process is investigated. The fractional oscillator process can be regarded as one-dimensional fractional Euclidean Klein-Gordon field, which can be obtained by applying the Parisi-Wu stochastic quantization method to a nonlocal Euclidean action. The Casimir energy associated with the fractional field at positive temperature is calculated by using the zeta function regularization technique.
