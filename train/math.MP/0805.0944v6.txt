The collective properties of small material systems considered as semidynamical systems revealing the Markov-type irreversible evolution, are investigated. It is shown that these material systems admit their treatment as thermodynamic systems in diathermal and isothermal conditions. A kinetic equation describing statistical regularities of the Markov-type material systems and constrained by the compatibility condition with the first and second laws of thermodynamics and with the relaxation postulate, is proposed. The influence of external parameters on the Gibbs distribution of small material systems is discussed.
