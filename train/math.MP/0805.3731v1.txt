Three dimensional continuous and discrete Fourier-like transforms, based on the three simple and four semisimple compact Lie groups of rank 3, are presented. For each simple Lie group, there are three families of special functions (C-, S-, and E-functions) on which the transforms are built. Pertinent properties of the functions are described in detail, such as their orthogonality within each family, when integrated over a finite region F of the 3-dimensional Euclidean space (continuous orthogonality), as well as when summed up over a lattice grid F_M\subset F (discrete orthogonality). The positive integer M sets up the density of the lattice containing F_M. The expansion of functions given either on F or on F_M is the paper's main focus.
