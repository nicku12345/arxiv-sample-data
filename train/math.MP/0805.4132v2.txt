The relative power of actions in a Cauchy body suffering mutations due to defect evolution is introduced. It is shown that its invariance under the action of the Euclidean group over the ambient space and the material space allows one to obtain (i) the balance of standard and configurational actions and (ii) the identification of configurational ingredients from a unique source.
