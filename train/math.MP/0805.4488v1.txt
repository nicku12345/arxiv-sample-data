This second part deals with applications of a general method to describe the quantum time evolution determined by a Schroedinger equation with time-dependent Hamiltonian. A new aspect of our approach is that we find all solutions starting from one special solution. The two main applications are reviewed, namely the Bloch equations and the harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency. Even in these well-known examples some new results are obtained.
