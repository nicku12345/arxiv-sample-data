We introduce a new 2N--parametric family of maximally superintegrable systems in N dimensions, obtained as a reduction of an anisotropic harmonic oscillator in a 2N--dimensional configuration space. These systems possess closed bounded orbits and integrals of motion which are polynomial in the momenta. They generalize known examples of superintegrable models in the Euclidean plane.
