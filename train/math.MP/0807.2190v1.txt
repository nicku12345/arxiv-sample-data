The phenomenon in the essence of classical uncertainty principles is well known since the thirties of the last century. We introduce a new phenomenon which is in the essence of a new notion that we introduce: "Generalized Uncertainty Principles". We show the relation between classical uncertainty principles and generalized uncertainty principles. We generalized "Landau-Pollak-Slepian" uncertainty principle. Our generalization relates the following two quantities and two scaling parameters: 1) The weighted time spreading \int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2w_1(x)dx, (w_1(x) is a non-negative function). 2) The weighted frequency spreading \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\hat{f}(\omega)|^2w_2(\omega)d\omega. 3) The time weight scale a, {w_1}_a(x)=w_1(xa^{-1}) and 4) The frequency weight scale b, {w_2}_b(\omega)=w_2(\omega b^{-1}). "Generalized Uncertainty Principle" is an inequality that summarizes the constraints on the relations between the two spreading quantities and two scaling parameters. For any two reasonable weights w_1(x) and w_2(\omega), we introduced a three dimensional set in R^3 that is in the essence of many uncertainty principles. The set is called "possibility body". We showed that classical uncertainty principles (such as the Heiseneberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principle) stem from lower bounds for different functions defined on the possibility body. We investigated qualitative properties of general uncertainty principles and possibility bodies. Using this approach we derived new (quantitative) uncertainty principles for Landau-Pollak-Slepian weights. We found the general uncertainty principles related to homogeneous weights, w_1(x)=w_2(x)=x^k, k\in N, up to a constant.
