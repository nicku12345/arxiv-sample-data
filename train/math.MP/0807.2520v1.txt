We consider the alternating sign matrices of the odd order that have some kind of central symmetry. Namely, we deal with matrices invariant under the half-turn, quarter-turn and flips in both diagonals. In all these cases, there are two natural structures in the centre of the matrix. For example, for the matrices invariant under the half-turn the central element is equal \pm 1. It was recently found that A^+_{HT}(2m+1)/A^-_{HT}(2m+1)=(m+1)/m. We conjecture that similar very simple relations are valid in the two remaining cases.
