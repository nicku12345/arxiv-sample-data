We formulate the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method for the case of anyonic grading. This provides a general framework for constructing integrable models describing interacting hard-core anyons. Through this method we reconstruct the known integrable model of hard core anyons associated with the XXX model, and as a new application we construct the anyonic t-J model. The energy spectrum for each model is derived by means of a generalisation of the algebraic Bethe ansatz. The grading parameters implementing the anyonic signature give rise to sector-dependent phase factors in the Bethe ansatz equations.
