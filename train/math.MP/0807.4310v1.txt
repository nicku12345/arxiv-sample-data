We consider the Dirac equation on the background of a Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black hole. By performing variable separation, we show that there exists no time-periodic and normalizable solution of the Dirac equation. This conclusion holds true even in the extremal case. With respect to previously considered cases, the novelty is represented by the presence, together with a black hole event horizon, of a cosmological (non degenerate) event horizon, which is at the root of the possibility to draw a conclusion on the aforementioned topic in a straightforward way even in the extremal case.
