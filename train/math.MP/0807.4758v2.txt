In this paper we study the characteristic or generating function of a certain discontinuous linear statistics of the Laguerre unitary ensembles and show that this is a particular fifth Painl\'eve transcendant in the variable t, the position of the discontinuity.   The proof of the ladder operators adapted to orthogonal polynomial with discontinuous weight announced sometime ago is presented here, followed by the non-linear difference equations satisfied by two auxiliary quantities and the derivation of the Painl\'eve equation.
