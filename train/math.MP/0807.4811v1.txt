We study non-trivial deformations of the natural action of the Lie superalgebra mathcalK(1) of contact vector fields on the (1,1)-dimensional superspace mathbbR^{1|1} of th espace of symbols.   We calculate obstructions for integrability of infinitesimal multi-parameter deformation and determine the complete commutative algebra corresponding to the miniversal deformation in the sense of A. Fialowski.   Besides, we compute the first even differential cohomology space mathrmH^1_{mathrm{diff}}(cK(1);widetilde{cD}_{lambda,mu}) of the Lie superalgebra mathcalK(1) of contact vector fields on the (1,1)-dimensional superspace mathbbR^{1|1} with coefficients in the superspace widetilde{mathcalD}_{lambda,mu} of linear differential operators from the superspace of weighted densities \fF_{\lamda} to \fF_{\mu}.
