From the 16-component Dirac-K\"{a}hler field theory, spinor equations for two types of massless vector photon fields with different parities have been derived. Their equivalent tensor equations in terms of the strength tensor F_{ab} and respective 4-vector A_{b} and 4-pseudovector \tilde{A}_{b} depending on intrinsic photon parity are derived; they include additional sources, electric 4-vector j_{b} and magnetic 4-pseudovector \tilde{j}_{b}. The theories of two types of photon fields are explicitly uncoupled, their linear combination through summing or subtracting results in Maxwell electrodynamics with electric and magnetic charges in 2-potential approach. So the problem of existence of magnetic charge can be understood as a super selection rule for different photon fields in intrinsic parity. The whole analysis is extended straightforwardly to a curved space-time background. In the frames of that extended Maxwell theory, the known electromagnetic duality is described as a linear transformation mixing the field variables referred to photons with different parities. That extended dual transformation concerns both strength tensors and 4-potentials A_{b}, \tilde{A}_{b}.
