We extend to incremental thermoelectroelasticity with biasing fields certain classical theorems, that have been stated and proved in linear thermopiezoelectricity referred to a natural configuration. A uniqueness theorem for the solutions to the initial boundary value problem, the generalized Hamilton principle and a theorem of reciprocity of work are deduced for incremental fields superposed on finite biasing fields in a thermoelectroelastic body.
