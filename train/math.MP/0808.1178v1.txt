We are interested in solutions \Psi_t of the Schr\"odinger equation of N interacting bosons under the influence of a time dependent external field, where the range and the coupling constant of the interaction scale with N in such a way, that the interaction energy per particle stays more or less constant. Let \mathcal{N}^{\phi_0} be the particle number operator with respect to some \phi_0\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{C}). Assume that the relative particle number of the initial wave function N^{-1}< \Psi_0,\mathcal{N}^{\phi_0}\Psi_0> converges to one as N\to\infty. We shall show that we can find a \phi_t\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{C}) such that \lim_{N\to\infty}N^{-1}< \Psi_t,\mathcal{N}^{\phi_t}\Psi_t>=1 and that \phi_t is -- dependent of the scaling of the range of the interaction -- solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii or Hartree equation.   We shall also show that under additional decay conditions of \phi_t the limit can be taken uniform in t<\infty and that convergence of the relative particle number implies convergence of the k-particle density matrices of \Psi_t.
