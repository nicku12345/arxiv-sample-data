We construct L_p-estimates for the inhomogeneous Oseen system studied in a two dimensional exterior domain \Omega with inhomogeneous slip boundary conditions. The kernel of the paper is a result for the half space \mathbb{R}^2_+. Analysis of this model system shows us a parabolic character of the studied problem, resulting as an appearance of the wake region behind the obstacle. Main tools are given by the Fourier analysis to obtain the maximal regularity estimates. The results imply the solvability for the Navier-Stokes system for small velocity at infinity.
