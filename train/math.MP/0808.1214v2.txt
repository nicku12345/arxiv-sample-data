The cascade kinetic fragmentation process of solids is investigated when the condition probability density of splinter formation do not depends on time and has the property P(\rho, r, t) = P(\rho/r). It is obtained the evolution equation for the probability distribution density in terms of its Mellin transformation. In the particular case P(\rho/r) = C (\rho/r)^\alpha, the limit solution of this equation at t \to \infty is found. It differs essentially from the Kolmogorov law.
