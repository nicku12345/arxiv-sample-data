We derive the complete asymptotic expansion in terms of powers of N for the Riesz s-energy of N equally spaced points on the unit circle as N\to \infty. For s\ge -2, such points form optimal energy N-point configurations with respect to the Riesz potential 1/r^{s}, s\neq0, where r is the Euclidean distance between points.   By analytic continuation we deduce the expansion for all complex values of s.   The Riemann zeta function plays an essential role in this asymptotic expansion.
