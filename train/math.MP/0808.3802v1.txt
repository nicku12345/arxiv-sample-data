Let A be a compact set in {\mathbb R}^p of Hausdorff dimension d. For s\in(0,d), the Riesz s-equilibrium measure \mu^s is the unique Borel probability measure with support in A that minimizes  I_s(\mu):=\iint\frac{1}{|x-y|^s}d\mu(y)d\mu(x) over all such probability measures. If A is strongly ({\mathcal H}^d, d)-rectifiable, then \mu^s converges in the weak-star topology to normalized d-dimensional Hausdorff measure restricted to A as s approaches d from below.
