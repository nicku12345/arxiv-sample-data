The leading term of the ground state energy/particle of a dilute gas of bosons with mass m in the thermodynamic limit is 2\pi \hbar^2 a \rho/m when the density of the gas is \rho, the interaction potential is non-negative and the scattering length a is positive. In this paper, we generalize the upper bound part of this result to any interaction potential with positive scattering length, i.e, a>0 and the lower bound part to some interaction potentials with shallow and/or narrow negative parts.
