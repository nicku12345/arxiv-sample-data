In this paper we studied the asymptotic eigenvalue statistics of the 2 matrix model with a quartic monomial and a general even polynomial potential. We studied the correlation kernel for the eigenvalues of one of the matrices in asymptotic limit. We extended the results of Duits and Kuijlaars to the case when the limiting eigenvalue density for one of the matrices is supported on multiple intervals. The results are achieved by constructing the parametrix to a Riemann-Hilbert problem obtained by Duits and Kuijlaars with theta functions and then showing that this parametrix is well-defined by studying the theta divisor.
