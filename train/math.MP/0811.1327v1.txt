The Lee-Yang circle theorem describes complex polynomials of degree n in z with all their zeros on the unit circle |z|=1. These polynomials are obtained by taking z_1=...=z_n=z in certain multiaffine polynomials \Psi(z_1,...,z_n) which we call Lee-Yang polynomials (they do not vanish when |z_1|,...,|z_n|<1 or |z_1|,...,|z_n|>1). We characterize the Lee-Yang polynomials \Psi in n+1 variables in terms of polynomials \Phi in n variables (those such that \Phi(z_1,...,z_n)\ne0 when |z_1|,...,|z_n|<1). This characterization gives us a good understanding of Lee-Yang polynomials and allows us to exhibit some new examples. In the physical situation where the \Psi are temperature dependent partition functions, we find that those \Psi which are Lee-Yang polynomials for all temperatures are precisely the polynomials with pair interactions originally considered by Lee and Yang.
