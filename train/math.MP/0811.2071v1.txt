We compute the fluctuations of the magnetization and of the multi-overlaps for the dilute mean field ferromagnet, in the high temperature region. The rescaled magnetization tends to a centered Gaussian variable with variance diverging at the critical line. The rescaled multi-overlaps also tend to centered independent Gaussian variables, but their covariance remain finite at the critical line.
