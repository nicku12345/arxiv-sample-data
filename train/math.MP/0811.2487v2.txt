In the Coxeter group W(R) generated by the root system R, let Q(R) be the number of conjugacy classes having no eigenvalue -1. The superalgebra of observables of the rational Calogero model based on the root system R possesses Q(R) supertraces. The numbers Q(R) are determined for all irreducible root systems (hence for all root systems).
