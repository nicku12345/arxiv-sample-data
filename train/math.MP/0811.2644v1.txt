We present another expression to regularize the Euler product representation of the Riemann zeta function. % in this paper. The expression itself is essentially same as the usual Euler product that is the infinite product, but we define a new one as the limit of the product of some terms derived from the usual Euler product. We also refer to the relation between the Bernoulli number and P(z), which is an infinite summation of a z power of the inverse primes. When we apply the same technique to the L-function associated to an elliptic curve, we can evaluate the power of the Taylor expansion for the function even in the critical strip, which is deeply related to problems known as the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and the Beilinson conjecture.
