We introduce a class of variational principles on measure spaces which are causal in the sense that they generate a relation on pairs of points, giving rise to a distinction between spacelike and timelike separation. General existence results are proved. It is shown in examples that minimizers need not be unique. Counter examples to compactness are discussed. The existence results are applied to variational principles formulated in indefinite inner product spaces.
