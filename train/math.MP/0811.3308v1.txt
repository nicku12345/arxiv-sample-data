We study quantum graphs corresponding to isotropic lattices with quasiperiodic coupling constants given by the same expressions as the coefficients of the discrete surface Maryland model. The absolutely continuous and the pure point spectra are described. It is shown that the transition between them is governed by the Hill operator corresponding to the edge potential.
