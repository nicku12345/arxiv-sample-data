An approximate solution of the Schrodinger equation with the Hulth\acute{e}n potential is obtained in D-dimensions with an exponential approximation of the centrifugal term. Solution to the corresponding hyper-radial equation is given using the conventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The normalization constants for the Hulth\acute{e}n potential are also computed. The expectation values <r^{-2}>,<V(r)>, are also obtained using the Feynman-Hellmann theorem.
