The nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger-Helmholtz (SH) equation in N space dimensions with 2\sigma nonlinear power was proposed as a regularization of the classical nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation. It was shown that the SH equation has a larger regime (1\le\sigma<\frac{4}{N}) of global existence and uniqueness of solutions compared to that of the classical NLS (0<\sigma<\frac{2}{N}). In the limiting case where the Schr\"{o}dinger-Helmholtz equation is viewed as a perturbed system of the classical NLS equation, we apply modulation theory to the classical critical case (\sigma=1,\:N=2) and show that the regularization prevents the formation of singularities of the NLS equation. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations
