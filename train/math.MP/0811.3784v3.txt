Using Krichever-Phong's universal formula, we show that a multiplicative representation linearizes Sklyanin quadratic brackets for a multi-pole Lax function with a spectral parameter. The spectral parameter can be either rational or elliptic. As a by-product, we obtain an extension of a Sklyanin algebra in the elliptic case. Krichever-Phong's formula provides a hierarchy of symplectic structures, and we show that there exists a non-trivial cubic bracket in Sklyanin's case.
