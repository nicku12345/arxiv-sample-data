We present the solutions of the Schr\ddot{o}dinger equation with the Hulth\acute{e}n potential plus ring-shape potential for \ell\neq 0 states within the framework of an exponential approximation of the centrifugal potential.Solutions to the corresponding angular and radial equations are obtained in terms of special functions using the conventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The normalization constant for the Hulth\acute{e}n potential is also computed.
