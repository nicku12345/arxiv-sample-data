Fermi transport of spinors can be precisely understood in terms of 2-spinor geometry. By using a partly original, previously developed treatment of 2-spinors and classical fields, we describe the family of all transports, along a given 1-dimensional timelike submanifold of spacetime, which yield the standard Fermi transport of vectors. Moreover we show that this family has a distinguished member, whose relation to the Fermi transport of vectors is similar to the relation between the spinor connection and spacetime connection. Various properties of the Fermi transport of spinors are discussed, and applied to the construction of free electron states for a detector-dependent QED formalism introduced in a previous paper.
