An appropriate rational approximation to the eigenfunction of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for anharmonic oscillators enables one to obtain the eigenvalue accurately as the limit of a sequence of roots of Hankel determinants. The convergence rate of this approach is greater than that for a well--established method based on a power--series expansions weighted by a Gaussian factor with an adjustable parameter (the so--called Hill--determinant method).
