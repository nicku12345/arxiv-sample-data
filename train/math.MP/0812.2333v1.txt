We show that the braid-group extension of the monodromy-based topological quantum computation scheme of Das Sarma et al. can be understood in terms of the universal R matrix for the Ising model giving similar results to those obtained by direct analytic continuation of multi-anyon Pfaffian wave functions. It is necessary, however, to take into account the projection on spinor states with definite total parity which is responsible for the topological entanglement in the Pfaffian topological quantum computer.
