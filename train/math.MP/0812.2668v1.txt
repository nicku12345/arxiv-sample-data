The Pauli channel acting on 2 x 2 matrices is generalized to an n-level quantum system. When the full matrix algebra M is decomposed into pairwise complementary subalgebras, then trace-preserving linear mappings from M to M are constructed such that the restriction to the subalgebras are depolarizing channels. The result is the necessary and sufficient condition of complete positivity. The main examples appear on bipartite systems
