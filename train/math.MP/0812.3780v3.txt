The exact solutions of the N-dimensional Schrodinger equation with the Mie-type potentials are obtained using the conventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method.The expectation values r^{-1} and r^{-2} and the virial theorem are also obtained in N-dimensions using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem.The ladder operators are also construct for the Mie-type potentials in N-dimensions and the matrix elements of some operators r and r\frac{d}{dr} are analytically obtained from the ladder operators.And the general results reduce to the 3-dimensional case when N=3.
