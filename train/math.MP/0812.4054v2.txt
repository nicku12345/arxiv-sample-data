Conditions are established for the existence of a scattering length and an effective range in the low-energy expansion of the S-wave phase-shift of a central potential in two and three dimensions. The behavior of the phase-shift as a function of the momentum is also derived for longer-range power-law potentials which do not fulfill these conditions.
