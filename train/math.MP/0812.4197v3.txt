We study the wave equation for the gravitational waves in the Randal-Sundrum brane cosmology model. We solve the global Cauchy problem and we establish that the solutions are the sum of a slowly decaying massless wave localized near the brane, and a superposition of massive dispersive waves. We compute the kernel of the truncated resolvent. We prove some L^1-L^{\infty}, L^2-L^{\infty} decay estimates and global L^p Strichartz type inequalities. We develop the complete scattering theory : existence and asymptotic completeness of the wave operators, computation of the scattering matrix, determination of the resonances on the logarithmic Riemann surface.
