In this study, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems, which are mathematical models of mechanical systems, were introduced on the horizontal and the vertical distributions of tangent and cotangent bundles. Finally, some geometrical and physical results related to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamical systems were deduced.
