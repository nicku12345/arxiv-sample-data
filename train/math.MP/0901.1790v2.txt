Intermittency of \mathcal{E}_N(x,g)=\exp\lbrack g| S_N(x)|^2\rbrack as N\to +\infty is investigated on a d-dimensional torus \Lambda, when S_N(x) is a finite Steinhaus series of (2N+1)^d terms normalized to <| S_N(x)|^2> =1. Assuming ergodicity of \mathcal{E}_N(x,g) as N\to +\infty in the domain g<1, where \lim_{N\to +\infty}<\mathcal{E}_N(g)> exists, transition to intermittency is proved as g increases past the threshold g_{th}=1. This transition goes together with a transition from (assumed) ergodicity at g<g_{th} to a regime where \lim_{N\to +\infty}\lbrack|\Lambda|<\mathcal{E}_N(g)>\rbrack^{-1}\int_{\Lambda}\mathcal{E}_N(x,g) d^dx=0 at g>g_{th}. In this asymptotic sense one can say that ergodicity is lost as g increases past the value g=1.
