By decomposing the regular representation of a particular (Heisenberg-like) Lie supergroup into irreducible subspaces, we show that not all of them can be obtained by applying geometric quantization to coadjoint orbits with an even symplectic form. However, all of them can be obtained by introducing coadjoint orbits through non-homogeneous points and with non-homogeneous symplectic forms as described in \cite{Tu1}. In this approach it turns out that the choice of a polarization can change (dramatically) the representation associated to an orbit. On the other hand, the procedure is not completely mechanical (meaning that some parts have to be done "by hand"), hence work remains to be done in order to understand all details of what is happening.
