Following the original approach introduced by T. Cazenave and P.L. Lions in \cite{CaLi} we prove the existence and the orbital stability of standing waves for the following class of NLS: \label{intr1} i\partial_t u+ \Delta u - V(x) u + Q(x) u|u|^{p-2}=0, \hbox{} (t,x) \in \R\times \R^n, \hbox{} 2<p<2+\frac 4n and \label{intr2} i\partial_t u - \Delta^2 u - V(x) u + Q(x) u|u|^{p-2}=0, \hbox{} (t,x) \in \R\times \R^n, \hbox{} 2<p<2+\frac 8n under suitable assumptions on the potentials V(x) and Q(x). More precisely we assume V(x), Q(x) \in L^\infty(\R^n) and meas\{Q(x)>\lambda_0\}\in (0,\infty) for a suitable \lambda_0>0. The main point is the analysis of the compactness of minimiziang sequences to suitable constrained minimization problems related to \eqref{intr1} and \eqref{intr2}.
