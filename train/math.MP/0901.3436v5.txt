A Toeplitz matrix is one in which the matrix elements are constant along diagonals. The Fisher-Hartwig matrices are much-studied singular matrices in the Toeplitz family. The matrices are defined for all orders, N. They are parametrized by two constants, \alpha and \beta. Their spectrum of eigenvalues has a simple asymptotic form in the limit as N goes to infinity. Here we study the structure of their eigenvalues and eigenvectors in this limiting case. We specialize to the case 0<\alpha<|\beta|<1, where the behavior is particularly simple.
