Using adjoint representation of Lie superalgebras, we obtain the matrix form of super-Jacobi and mixed super-Jacobi identities of Lie superbialgebras. By direct calculations of these identities, and use of automorphism supergroups of two and three dimensional Lie superalgebras, we obtain and classify all two and three dimensional Lie superbialgebras.
