Nonextensive statistical mechanics has been a source of investigation in mathematical structures such as deformed algebraic structures. In this work, we present some consequences of q-operations on the construction of q-numbers for all numerical sets. Based on such a construction, we present a new product that distributes over the q-sum. Finally, we present different patterns of q-Pascal's triangles, based on q-sum, whose elements are q-numbers.
