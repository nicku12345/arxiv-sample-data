Using the auxiliary field method, we give an analytical expression for the eigenenergies of a system composed of two non-relativistic particles interacting via a potential of type \sqrt{a^2 r^2 + b}. This situation is usual in the case of hybrid mesons in which the quark-antiquark pair evolves in an excited gluonic field. Asymptotic expressions are proposed and the approximate results are compared to the exact ones. It is shown that the accuracy is excellent.
