We prove locality estimates, in the form of Lieb-Robinson bounds, for classical oscillator systems defined on a lattice. Our results hold for the harmonic system and a variety of anharmonic perturbations with long range interactions. The anharmonic estimates are applicable to a special class of observables, the Weyl functions, and the bounds which follow are not only independent of the volume but also the initial condition.
