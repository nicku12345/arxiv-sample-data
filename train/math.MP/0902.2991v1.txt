This paper addresses new results on the factorization of the general   Heun's operator, extending the investigations performed in previous works   [{\it Applied   Mathematics and Computation} {\bf 141} (2003), 177 - 184 and {\bf 189} (2007), 816 - 820]. Both generalized Heun and generalized Lam\'e equations are considered.
