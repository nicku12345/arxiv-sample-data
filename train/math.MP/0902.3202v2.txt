We reexamine and extend a group of solutions in series of Bessel functions for a limiting case of the confluent Heun equation and, then, apply such solutions to the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with an inverted quasi-exactly solvable potential as well as to the angular equation for an electron in the field of a point electric dipole. For the first problem we find finite- and infinite-series solutions which are convergent and bounded for any value of the independent variable. For the angular equation, we also find expansions in series of Jacobi polynomials.
