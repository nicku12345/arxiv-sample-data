We apply the algebraic Bethe ansatz developed in our previous paper \cite{CM} to three different families of U(1) integrable vertex models with arbitrary N bond states. These statistical mechanics systems are based on the higher spin representations of the quantum group U_q[SU(2)] for both generic and non-generic values of q as well as on the non-compact discrete representation of the SL(2,{\cal R}) algebra. We present for all these models the explicit expressions for both the on-shell and the off-shell properties associated to the respective transfer matrices eigenvalue problems. The amplitudes governing the vectors not parallel to the Bethe states are shown to factorize in terms of elementary building blocks functions. The results for the non-compact SL(2,{\cal R}) model are argued to be derived from those obtained for the compact systems by taking suitable N \to \infty limits. This permits us to study the properties of the non-compact SL(2,{\cal R}) model starting from systems with finite degrees of freedom.
