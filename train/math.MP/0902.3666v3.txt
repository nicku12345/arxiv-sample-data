By means of the Minlos Theorem on support of cylindrical measures on vectorial topological spaces, we present several results on the rigorous definitions of Euclidean path integrals and applications to some problems on non-linear diffusion, nonlinear wave propagations and covariant Polyakov"s path Integrals yielding news results on the subject as well.
