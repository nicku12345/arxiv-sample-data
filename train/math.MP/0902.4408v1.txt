Symplectic and symmetry analysis for studying MHD superfluid flows is devised, a new version of the Z. Peradzynski helicity theorem based on differential - geometric and group-theoretical methods is derived. Having reanalyzed the Peradzynski helicity theorem within the modern symplectic theory of differential- geometric structures on manifolds, a new unified proof and a new generalization of this theorem for the case of compressible MHD superfluid flow are proposed. As a by-product, a sequence of nontrivial helicity type local and global conservation laws for the case of incompressible superfluid flow, playing a crucial role for studying the stability problem under suitable boundary conditions, is constructed.
