Introductive backgrounds of a new mathematical physics discipline - Quantum Mathematics - are discussed and analyzed both from historical and analytical points of view. The magic properties of the second quantization method, invented by V. Fock in 1932, are demonstrated, and an impressive application to the nonlinear dynamical systems theory is considered.
