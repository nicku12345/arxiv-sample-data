A detailed derivation of a two dimensional (2D) low energy effective model for spinless fermions on a square lattice with local interactions is given. This derivation utilizes a particular continuum limit that is justified by physical arguments. It is shown that the effective model thus obtained can be treated by exact bosonization methods. It is also discussed how this effective model can be used to obtain physical information about the corresponding lattice fermion system.
