We study the effect of spatially dependent mass functions over the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in the (3+1)-dimensions for spinless bosonic particles where the mixed scalar-vector Coulomb-like field potentials and masses are directly proportional and inversely proportional to the distance from force center. The exact bound state energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions of the Klein-Gordon equation for mixed scalar-vector and pure scalar Coulomb-like field potentials are obtained by means of the Nikiforov-Uvarov (NU) method. The energy spectrum is discussed for different scalar-vector potential mixing cases and also for constant mass case.
