A reduction of Benney's equations is constructed corresponding to Schwartz-Christoffel maps associated with a family of genus six cyclic tetragonal curves. The mapping function, a second kind Abelian integral on the associated Riemann surface, is constructed explicitly as a rational expression in derivatives of the Kleinian sigma-function of the curve.
