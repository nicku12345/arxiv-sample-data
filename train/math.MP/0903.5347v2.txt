Consider N bosons in a finite box \Lambda= [0,L]^3\subset \mathbf R^3 interacting via a two-body smooth repulsive short range potential. We construct a variational state which gives the following upper bound on the ground state energy per particle \[\bar\lim_{\rho\to0} \bar \lim_{L \to \infty,   N/L^3 \to \rho} (\frac{e_0(\rho)- 4 \pi a \rho}{(4 \pi a)^{5/2}(\rho)^{3/2}})\leq \frac{16}{15\pi^2}, \] where a is the scattering length of the potential. Previously, an upper bound of the form C 16/15\pi^2 for some constant C > 1 was obtained in \cite{ESY}. Our result proves the upper bound of the the prediction by Lee-Yang \cite{LYang} and Lee-Huang-Yang \cite{LHY}.
