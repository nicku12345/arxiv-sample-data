We discuss the possibility of defining an algebraic dynamics within the settings of O^\star-algebras. Compared with our previous results on this subject, the main improvement here is that we are not assuming the existence of some hamiltonian for the {\em full} physical system. We will show that, under suitable conditions, the dynamics can still be defined via some limiting procedure starting from a given {\em regularized sequence}.
