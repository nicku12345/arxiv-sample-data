Non-commutative L^p-spaces are shown to constitute examples of a class of Banach quasi *-algebras called CQ*-algebras. For p\geq 2 they are also proved to possess a {\em sufficient} family of bounded positive sesquilinear forms satisfying certain invariance properties. CQ *-algebras of measurable operators over a finite von Neumann algebra are also constructed and it is proven that any abstract CQ*-algebra (\X,\Ao) possessing a sufficient family of bounded positive tracial sesquilinear forms can be represented as a CQ*-algebra of this type.
