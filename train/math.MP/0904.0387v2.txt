In this article, a class of Fourier Integral Operators which converge to the unitary group of the Schr\"odinger equation in semiclassical limit \epsilon\to 0 is constructed. The convergence is in the uniform operator norm and allows for a error bound C_N\epsilon^{N+1} for any integer N and extends to Ehrenfest timescaleswith bound C_N\epsilon^{N+1-\rho} where \rho can be made arbitrary small. In the chemical literature those approximations are known as simple Initial Value Representations.
