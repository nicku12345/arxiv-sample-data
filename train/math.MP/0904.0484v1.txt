It is shown that the E_7 trigonometric Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonian, when written in terms of the Fundamental Trigonometric Invariants (FTI), is in algebraic form, i.e., has polynomial coefficients, and preserves the infinite flag of polynomial spaces with the characteristic vector \vec \alpha = (1,2,2,2,3,3,4). Its flag coincides with one of the minimal characteristic vector for the E_7 rational model.
