The Mallows model on S_n is a probability distribution on permutations, q^{d(\pi,e)}/P_n(q), where d(\pi,e) is the distance between \pi and the identity element, relative to the Coxeter generators. Equivalently, it is the number of inversions: pairs (i,j) where 1\leq i<j\leq n, but \pi_i>\pi_j. Analyzing the normalization P_n(q), Diaconis and Ram calculated the mean and variance of d(\pi,e) in the Mallows model, which suggests the appropriate n \to \infty limit has q_n scaling as 1-\beta/n. We calculate the distribution of the empirical measure in this limit, u(x,y) dx dy = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta_{(i,\pi_i)}. Treating it as a mean-field problem, analogous to the Curie-Weiss model, the self-consistent mean-field equations are \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} \ln u(x,y) = 2 \beta u(x,y), which is an integrable PDE, known as the hyperbolic Liouville equation. The explicit solution also gives a new proof of formulas for the blocking measures in the weakly asymmetric exclusion process, and the ground state of the \mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)-symmetric XXZ ferromagnet.
