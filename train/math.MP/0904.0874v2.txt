Four point correlation functions for many electrons at finite temperature in periodic lattice are analyzed by the perturbation theory with respect to the coupling constant. The correlation functions are characterized as a limit of finite dimensional Grassmann integrals. A lower bound on the radius of convergence and an upper bound on the perturbation series are obtained. The perturbation series up to second order is numerically implemented along with the volume-independent upper bounds on the sum of the higher order terms in 2 dimensional case.
