Let (A, A_o) be a topological quasi *-algebra, which means in particular that A_o is a topological *-algebra, dense in A. Let \pi^o be a *-representation of A_o in some pre-Hilbert space {\cal D} \subset {\cal H}. Then we present several ways of extending   \pi^o, by closure, to some larger quasi *-algebra contained in A, either by Hilbert space operators, or by sesquilinear forms on {\cal D}. Explicit examples are discussed, both abelian and nonabelian, including the CCR algebra.
