The completion \overline{A}[\tau] of a locally convex *-algebra A [ \tau ] with not jointly continuous multiplication is a *-vector space with partial multiplication xy defined only for x or y \in A_{0}, and it is called a topological quasi *-algebra. In this paper two classes of topological quasi *-algebras called strict CQ^*-algebras and HCQ^*-algebras are studied. Roughly speaking, a strict CQ^*-algebra (resp. HCQ^*-algebra) is a Banach (resp. Hilbert) quasi *-algebra containing a C^*-algebra endowed with another involution \sharp and C^*-norm \| \|_{\sharp}. HCQ^*-algebras are closely related to left Hilbert algebras. We shall show that a Hilbert space is a HCQ^*-algebra if and only if it contains a left Hilbert algebra with unit as a dense subspace. Further, we shall give a necessary and sufficient condition under which a strict CQ^*-algebra is embedded in a HCQ^*-algebra.
