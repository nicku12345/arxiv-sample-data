In this paper we show how to construct a certain class of orthonormal bases in L^2({\bf R}^d) starting from one or more Gabor orthonormal bases in L^2({\bf R}). Each such basis can be obtained acting on a single function \Psi(\underline x)\in L^2({\bf R}^d) with a set of unitary operators which operate as translation and modulation operators {\em in suitable variables}. The same procedure is also extended to frames and wavelets. Many examples are discussed.
