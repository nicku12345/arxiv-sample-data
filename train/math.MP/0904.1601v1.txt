We consider the Fuchsian linear differential equation obtained (modulo a prime) for \tilde{\chi}^{(5)}, the five-particle contribution to the susceptibility of the square lattice Ising model. We show that one can understand the factorization of the corresponding linear differential operator from calculations using just a single prime. A particular linear combination of \tilde{\chi}^{(1)} and \tilde{\chi}^{(3)} can be removed from \tilde{\chi}^{(5)} and the resulting series is annihilated by a high order globally nilpotent linear ODE. The corresponding (minimal order) linear differential operator, of order 29, splits into factors of small orders. A fifth order linear differential operator occurs as the left-most factor of the "depleted" differential operator and it is shown to be equivalent to the symmetric fourth power of L_E, the linear differential operator corresponding to the elliptic integral E. This result generalizes what we have found for the lower order terms \tilde{\chi}^{(3)} and \tilde{\chi}^{(4)}. We conjecture that a linear differential operator equivalent to a symmetric (n-1)-th power of L_E occurs as a left-most factor in the minimal order linear differential operators for all \tilde{\chi}^{(n)}'s.
