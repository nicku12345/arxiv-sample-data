This paper clarifies the local structure of the energy representation of a local gauge group. The group to be considered is a smooth map from a manifold into a compact Lie group. It acts on a Boson Fock spaces generated by connection 1-forms on the manifold. The irreduciblity depends on the dimensionality of a manifold. However, we showed that even if the representation is reducible(for example, dim=1 case) the commutant is very small. The discussion is based on the support property of the function, which is analogous to the algebraic Quantum Field Theory.
