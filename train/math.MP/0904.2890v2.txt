This paper is devoted to the study of the random displacement model on \R^d. We prove that, in the weak displacement regime, Anderson and dynamical localization holds near the bottom of the spectrum under a generic assumption on the single site potential and a fairly general assumption on the support of the possible displacements. This result follows from the proof of the existence of Lifshitz tail and of a Wegner estimate for the model under scrutiny.
