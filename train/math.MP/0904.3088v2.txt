We obtain the large n asymptotics of the partition function Z_n of the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions in the antiferroelectric phase region, with the weights a=\sinh(\ga-t), b=\sinh(\ga+t), c=\sinh(2\ga), |t|<\ga. We prove the conjecture of Zinn-Justin, that as n\to\infty, Z_n=C\th_4(n\om) F^{n^2}[1+O(n^{-1})], where \om and F are given by explicit expressions in \ga and t, and \th_4(z) is the Jacobi theta function. The proof is based on the Riemann-Hilbert approach to the large n asymptotic expansion of the underlying discrete orthogonal polynomials and on the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method.
