A quantum effect is an operator A on a complex Hilbert space H that satisfies 0\leq A\leq I, {\cal E} (H) is the set of all quantum effects on H. In 2001, Professor Gudder and Nagy studied the sequential product A\circ B=A^{{1/2}}BA^{{1/2}} of A, B\in {\cal E}(H). In 2005, Professor Gudder asked: Is A\circ B=A^{{1/2}}BA^{{1/2}} the only sequential product on {\cal E} (H)? Recently, Liu and Wu presented an example to show that the answer is negative. In this paper, firstly, we characterize some algebraic properties of the abstract sequential product on {\cal E} (H); secondly, we present a general method for constructing sequential products on {\cal E} (H); finally, we study some properties of the sequential products constructed by the method
