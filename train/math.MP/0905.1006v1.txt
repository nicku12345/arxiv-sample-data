We consider a (semi-)relativistic spin-1/2 particle interacting with quantized radiation. The Hamiltonian has the form \hat{H}_c^V:=\{c^2[(\mathbf{p}+{\bf A})^2+{\bf \sigma}\cdot{\bf B}]+(mc^2)^2\}^{1/2}-mc^2+V+H_f. Assuming that the potential |V| is bounded with respect to the momentum |\mathbf{p}|, we show that \hat{H}_c^V converges in norm-resolvent sense to the usual Pauli-Fierz operator when c, the speed of light, tends to \infty.
