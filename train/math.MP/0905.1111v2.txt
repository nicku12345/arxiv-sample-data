The Stieltjes constants \gamma_k(a) appear as the coefficients in the regular part of the Laurent expansion of the Hurwitz zeta function \zeta(s,a) about s=1. We present series representations of these constants of interest to theoretical and computational analytic number theory. A particular result gives an addition formula for the Stieltjes constants. As a byproduct, expressions for derivatives of all orders of the Stieltjes coefficients are given. Many other results are obtained, including instances of an exponentially fast converging series representation for \gamma_k=\gamma_k(1). Some extensions are briefly described, as well as the relevance to expansions of Dirichlet L functions.
