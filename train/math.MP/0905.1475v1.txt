The Duffin-Kemmer form of massless vector field (Maxwell field) is extended to the case of arbitrary pseudo-Riemannian space-time in accordance with the tetrad recipe of Tetrode-Weyl-Fock-Ivanenko. In this approach, the Maxwell equations are solved exactly on the background of simplest static cosmological model, space of constant curvature of Riemann parameterized by spherical coordinates. Separation of variables is realized in the basis of Schr\"odinger- Pauli type, description of angular dependence in electromagnetic filed functions is given in terms of Wigner D-functions. A discrete frequency spectrum for electromagnetic modes depending on the curvature radius of space and three discrete parameters is found. 4-potentials for spherical electro- magnetic waves of magnetic and electric type have been constructed.
