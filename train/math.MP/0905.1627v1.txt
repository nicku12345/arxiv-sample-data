In this work, we present a new approach to the construction of variational integrators. In the general case, the estimation of the action integral in a time interval [q_k,q_{k+1}] is used to construct a symplectic map (q_k,q_{k+1})\to (q_{k+1},q_{k+2}). The basic idea here, is that only the partial derivatives of the estimation of the action integral of the Lagrangian are needed in the general theory. The analytic calculation of these derivatives, give raise to a new integral which depends not on the Lagrangian but on the Euler--Lagrange vector, which in the continuous and exact case vanishes. Since this new integral can only be computed through a numerical method based on some internal grid points, we can locally fit the exact curve by demanding the Euler--Lagrange vector to vanish at these grid points. Thus the integral vanishes, and the process dramatically simplifies the calculation of high order approximations. The new technique is tested for high order solutions in the two-body problem with high eccentricity (up to 0.99) and in the outer solar system.
