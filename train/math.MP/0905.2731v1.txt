In this work, the analytical solution of the radial Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the Woods-Saxon potential is presented. In our calculations, we have applied the Nikiforov-Uvarov method by using the Pekeris approximation to the centrifugal potential for arbitrary l states. The bound state energy eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained for various values of n and l quantum numbers.
