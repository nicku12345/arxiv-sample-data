Recently, two different approaches were put forward to extend the supersymmetry method in random matrix theory from Gaussian ensembles to general rotation invariant ensembles. These approaches are the generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and the superbosonization formula. Here, we prove the equivalence of both approaches. To this end, we reduce integrals over functions of supersymmetric Wishart-matrices to integrals over quadratic supermatrices of certain symmetries.
