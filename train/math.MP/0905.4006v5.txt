The crossing property is perhaps the most subtle aspect of the particle-field relation. Although it is not difficult to state its content in terms of certain analytic properties relating different matrixelements of the S-matrix or formfactors, its relation to the localization- and positive energy spectral principles requires a level of insight into the inner workings of QFT which goes beyond anything which can be found in typical textbooks on QFT. This paper presents a recent account based on new ideas derived from "modular localization" including a mathematic appendix on this subject. Its main novel achievement is the proof of the crossing property of formfactors from a two-algebra generalization of the KMS condition. The main content of this article is the presentation of the derailments of particle theory during more than 4 decades: the S-matrix bootstrap, the dual model and its string theoretic extension. Rather than being related to crossing, string theory is the (only known) realization of a dynamic infinite component one-particle wave function space and its associated infinite component field. Here "dynamic" means that, unlike a mere collection of infinitely many irreducible unitary Poincar\'e group representation or free fields, the formalism contains also operators which communicate between the different irreducible Poincar\'e represenations (the levels of the "infinite tower") and set the mass/spin spectrum. Wheras in pre-string times there were unsuccessful attempts to achieve this in analogy to the O(4,2) hydrogen spectrum by the use of higher noncompact groups, the superstring in d=9+1, which uses instead (bosonic/fermionic) oscillators obtained from multicomponent chiral currents is the only known unitary positive energy solution of the dynamical infinite component pointlike localized field project.
