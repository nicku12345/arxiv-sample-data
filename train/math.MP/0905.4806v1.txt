We consider the lattice dynamics in the half-space. The initial data are random according to a probability measure which enforces slow spatial variation on the linear scale \varepsilon^{-1}. We establish two time regimes. For times of order \varepsilon^{-\gamma}, 0<\gamma<1, locally the measure converges to a Gaussian measure which is time stationary with a covariance inherited from the initial measure (non-Gaussian, in general). For times of order \varepsilon^{-1}, this covariance changes in time and is governed by a semiclassical transport equation.
