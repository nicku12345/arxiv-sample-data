Teleportation of optical field states (as continuous quantum variables) is usually described in terms of Wigner functions. This is in marked contrast to the theoretical treatment of teleportation of qubits. In this paper we show that by using the holomorphic representation of the canonical commutation relations, teleportation of continuous quantum variables can be treated in complete analogy to the case of teleportation of qubits. In order to emphasize this analogy, short descriptions of the basic experimental schemes both for teleportation of qubits and of continuous variables are included. We conclude our paper with a brief discussion of the effectiveness of our description of continuous variable teleportation and of the role of localization of quantum states in teleportation problems.
