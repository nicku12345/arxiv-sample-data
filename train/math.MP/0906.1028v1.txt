In 2006, Gudder introduced a logic order on bounded quantum observable set S(H). In 2007, Pulmannova and Vincekova proved that for each subset \cal D of S(H), the infimum of \cal D exists with respect to this logic order. In this paper, we present the spectral representation for the infimum of \cal D.
