In this paper, we prove that if \mathcal{A}=\{E_i\}_{i=1}^{n} is a finite commutative quantum measurement, then the fixed points set of L\"{u}ders operation L_{{\cal A}} is the commutant {\cal A}' of {\cal A}, the result answers an open problem partially. We also give a concrete example of a L\"{u}ders operation L_{{\cal A}} with n=3 such that L_{{\cal A}}(B)=B does not imply that the quantum effect B commutes with all E_1, E_2 and E_3, this example answers another open problem.
