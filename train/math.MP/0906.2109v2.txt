Vertices of the 4-dimensional semi-regular polytope,   \textit{snub 24-cell} and its symmetry group W(D_{4}):C_{3}  of order 576 are represented in terms of quaternions with unit norm. It follows from the icosian representation of \textbf{E_{8} } root system. The quaternionic root system of H_{4}  splits as the vertices of 24-cell and the \textit{snub 24-cell} under the symmetry group of the \textit{snub 24-cell} which is one of the maximal subgroups of the group \textbf{W(H_{4})} as well as W(F_{4}). It is noted that the group is isomorphic to the\textbf{}semi-direct product of the Weyl group of D_{4} with the cyclic group of order 3 denoted by W(D_{4}):C_{3} , the Coxeter notation for which is [3,4,3^{+}]. We analyze the vertex structure of the \textit{snub 24-cell} and decompose the orbits of \textbf{W(H_{4})} under the orbits of W(D_{4}):C_{3} . The cell structure of the snub 24-cell has been explicitly analyzed with quaternions by using the subgroups of the group W(D_{4}):C_{3} . In particular, it has been shown that the dual polytopes 600-cell with 120 vertices and 120-cell with 600 vertices decompose as 120=24+96 and 600=24+96+192+288 respectively under the group W(D_{4}):C_{3} . The dual polytope of the \textit{snub 24-cell} is explicitly constructed. Decompositions of the Archimedean W(H_{4}) polytopes under the symmetry of the group W(D_{4}):C_{3}  are given in the appendix.
