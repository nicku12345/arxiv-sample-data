We present an exposition of a method of discretizing ordinary differential equations while preserving their Lie point symmetries. This method is very general and can be applied to any ODE with a nontrivial symmetry group. The method is applied to obtain numerical slutions of second and third order ODEs invariant under two different realizations of SL(2,\mathbb{R}). The symmetry preserving method is shown to provide a better qualitative description of solutions than standard methods. In particular it provides solutions that are valid close to singularities and beyond them.
