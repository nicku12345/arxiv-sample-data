We consider the semiclassical limit of nonrelativistic quantum many-boson systems with delta potential in one dimensional space. We prove that time evolved coherent states behave semiclassically as squeezed states by a Bogoliubov time-dependent affine transformation. This allows us to obtain properties analogous to those proved by Hepp and Ginibre-Velo (\cite{Hep}, \cite{GiVe1,GiVe2}) and also to show propagation of chaos for Schr\"odinger dynamics in the mean field limit. Thus, we provide a derivation of the cubic NLS equation in one dimension.
