The governing equation is [\nabla^2+k^2-q(x)]u=0 in \R^3. It is shown that any desired potential q(x), vanishing outside a bounded domain D, can be obtained if one embeds into D many small scatterers q_m(x), vanishing outside balls B_m:=\{x: |x-x_m|<a\}, such that q_m=A_m in B_m, q_m=0 outside B_m, 1\leq m \leq M, M=M(a). It is proved that if the number of small scatterers in any subdomain \Delta is defined as N(\Delta):=\sum_{x_m\in \Delta}1 and is given by the formula N(\Delta)=|V(a)|^{-1}\int_{\Delta}n(x)dx [1+o(1)] as a\to 0, where V(a)=4\pi a^3/3, then the limit of the function u_{M}(x), \lim_{a\to 0}U_M=u_e(x) does exist and solves the equation [\nabla^2+k^2-q(x)]u=0 in \R^3, where q(x)=n(x)A(x),and A(x_m)=A_m. The total number M of small inhomogeneities is equal to N(D) and is of the order O(a^{-3}) as a\to 0.   A similar result is derived in the one-dimensional case.
