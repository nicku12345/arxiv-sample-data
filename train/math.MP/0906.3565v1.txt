In this article, we classify the solutions of the dispersionless Toda hierarchy into degenerate and non-degenerate cases. We show that every non-degenerate solution is determined by a function \mathcal{H}(z_1,z_2) of two variables. We interpret these non-degenerate solutions as defining evolutions on the space \mathfrak{D} of pairs of conformal mappings (g,f), where g is a univalent function on the exterior of the unit disc, f is a univalent function on the unit disc, normalized such that g(\infty)=\infty, f(0)=0 and f'(0)g'(\infty)=1. For each solution, we show how to define the natural time variables t_n, n\in\Z, as complex coordinates on the space \mathfrak{D}. We also find explicit formulas for the tau function of the dispersionless Toda hierarchy in terms of \mathcal{H}(z_1, z_2). Imposing some conditions on the function \mathcal{H}(z_1, z_2), we show that the dispersionless Toda flows can be naturally restricted to the subspace \Sigma of \mathfrak{D} defined by f(w)=1/\overline{g(1/\bar{w})}. This recovers the result of Zabrodin.
