An analysis is given of particlelike nonlinear bound states in the Newtonian limit of the coupled Einstein-Dirac system introduced by Finster, Smoller and Yau. A proof is given of existence of these bound states in the almost Newtonianian regime, and it is proved that they may be approximated by the energy minimizing solution of the Newton-Schr\"odinger system obtained by Lieb.
