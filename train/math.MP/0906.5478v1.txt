We consider in this paper space-cutoff charged P(\varphi)_{2} models arising from the quantization of the non-linear charged Klein-Gordon equation: \[ (\p_{t}+\i V(x))^{2}\phi(t, x)+ (-\Delta_{x}+ m^{2})\phi(t,x)+ g(x)\p_{\overline{z}}P(\phi(t,x), \overline{\phi}(t,x))=0, \] where V(x) is an electrostatic potential, g(x)\geq 0 a space-cutoff and P(\lambda, \overline{\lambda}) a real bounded below polynomial. We discuss various ways to quantize this equation, starting from different CCR representations. After describing the construction of the interacting Hamiltonian H we study its spectral and scattering theory. We describe the essential spectrum of H, prove the existence of asymptotic fields and of wave operators, and finally prove the {\em asymptotic completeness} of wave operators. These results are similar to the case when V=0.
