The abstract mathematical structure behind the positive energy quantization of linear classical systems is described. It is separated into 3 stages: the description of a classical system, the algebraic quantization and the Hilbert space quantization. 4 kinds of systems are distinguished: neutral bosonic, neutral bosonic, charged bosonic and charged fermionic. The formalism that is described follows closely the usual constructions employed in quantum physics to introduce non-interacting quantum fields.
