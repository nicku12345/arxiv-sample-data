We consider a finite dimensional damped second order system and obtain spectral inclusion theorems for the related quadratic eigenvalue problem. The inclusion sets are the 'quasi Cassini ovals' which may greatly outperform standard Gershgorin circles. As the unperturbed system we take a modally damped part of the system; this includes the known proportionally damped models, but may give much sharper estimates. These inclusions are then applied to derive some easily calculable sufficient conditions for the overdampedness of a given damped system.
