It is shown how a recently proposed method of cloaking is effective over a broad range of frequencies. The method is based on three or more active devices. The devices, while not radiating significantly, create a ``quiet zone'' between the devices where the wave amplitude is small. Objects placed within this region are virtually invisible. The cloaking is demonstrated by simulations with a broadband incident pulse.
