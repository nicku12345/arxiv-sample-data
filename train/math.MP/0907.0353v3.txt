We consider the Navier-Stokes system solution, based at parametric representation of desired function. This solution is unique and it show the velocity of a stream element as its density structure [{\rho}_S (x,y,z,t);{\rho}^\to_L (x,y,z,t)] function. The solution is smooth, defining conditions of turbulence occurrence and supersonic shock waves in the viscous substance. Given solution brings to light the genesis of earthquakes and volcanic activity, of turbulence phenomenon and possible stave off natural and anthropogenic catastrophes, connecting with this effect. Given solution allows to evaluate the Bernoulli's law {\guillemotleft}line density{\guillemotright} mechanism for aerodynamical airplanes checkouts and hydromechanical tests correlation, for high-speed extension flood river compensation. In addition given function allows to apply {\guillemotleft}isostatic breakdown{\guillemotright} mechanism for resolution of the Gulf of Mexico and similar problem.
