We present a new setting of the geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theory by using the so-called time-evolution operator K. This new approach unifies both the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formulation of the problem developed in a previous paper [7], and can be applied to the case of singular Lagrangian dynamical systems.
