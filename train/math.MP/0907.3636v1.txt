The classical dynamics and pulse propagation are presented for a series of lattice-like structures whose spatial dimensionality ranges from one to four: four representing a hyper lattice. The lattices are connected one-dimensional wave bearing systems of varying lengths and can illuminate some aspects of higher dimension structures. Short pulses are launched at an arbitrary point, reverberate throughout the entire structure, and detected at another point. Some aspects of increasing dimensionality are illustrated with particular emphasis on the transition from three to four spatial dimensions. In a hypothetical four dimension world where only three are observable, the classical conservation laws and causality do not hold. The lack of causality is illustrated at each step in dimensionality by showing the unexpected pulse returns from the next higher dimension.
