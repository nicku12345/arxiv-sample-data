The phase-space representation for a relativistic linear oscillator in a homogeneous external field expressed through the finite-difference equation is constructed. Explicit expressions of the relativistic oscillator Wigner quasi-distribution function for the stationary states as well as of states of thermodynamical equilibrium are obtained and their correct limits are shown.
