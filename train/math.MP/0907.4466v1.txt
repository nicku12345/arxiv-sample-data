Using a new method it is possible to derive mean field equations from the microscopic N body Schr\"odinger evolution of interacting particles without using BBGKY hierarchies.   In this paper we wish to analyze scalings which lead to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation which is usually derived assuming positivity of the interaction. The new method for dealing with mean field limits presented in [6] allows us to relax this condition. The price we have to pay for this relaxation is however that we have to restrict the scaling behavior to \beta<1/3 and that we have to assume fast convergence of the reduced one particle marginal density matrix of the initial wave function \mu^{\Psi_0} to a pure state |\phi_0><\phi_0|.
