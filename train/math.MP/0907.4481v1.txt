We comment on some analytical solutions to a class of Boussinesq-like equations derived recently by means of the homotopy perturbation method (HPM). We show that one may obtain exactly the same result by means of the Taylor series in the time variable. We derive more general results by means of travelling waves and argue that a curious superposition principle may not be of any mathematical or physical significance.
