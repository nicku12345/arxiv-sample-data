We give a proof of dynamical localization in the form of exponential decay of spatial correlations in the time evolution for the one-dimensional continuum Anderson model via the fractional moments method. This follows via exponential decay of fractional moments of the Green function, which is shown to hold at arbitrary energy and for any single-site distribution with bounded, compactly supported density.
