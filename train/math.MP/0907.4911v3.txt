The Fedosov deformation quantization on a cotangent bundle with a symplectic connection induced by some linear symmetric connection on the base space is considered. A global construction of the symplectic homogeneous connection on the cotangent bundle modelled on the linear symmetric connection from the base space is proposed. Examples of the induced symplectic connection are given. A detailed analysis of the Abelian connection and flat sections representing special types of functions for this kind of symplectic connection is presented. Some properties of the *-product determined by the induced symplectic connection are shown.
