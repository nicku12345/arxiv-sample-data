We consider N\times N symmetric random matrices where the probability distribution for each matrix element is given by a measure \nu with a subexponential decay. We prove that the eigenvalue spacing statistics in the bulk of the spectrum for these matrices and for GOE are the same in the limit N \to \infty. Our approach is based on the study of the Dyson Brownian motion via a related new dynamics, the local relaxation flow.
