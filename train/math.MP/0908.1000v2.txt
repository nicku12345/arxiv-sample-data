From the homotopy groups of three distinct octahedral spherical 3-manifolds we construct the isomorphic groups H of deck transformations acting on the 3-sphere. The H-invariant polynomials on the 3-sphere constructed by representation theory span the bases for the harmonic analysis on three spherical manifolds. Analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background in terms of these new bases can reveal a non-simple topology of the space part of space-time.
