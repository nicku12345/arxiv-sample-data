An all speed scheme for the Isentropic Euler equation is presented in this paper. When the Mach number tends to zero, the compressible Euler equation converges to its incompressible counterpart, in which the density becomes a constant. Increasing approximation errors and severe stability constraints are the main difficulty in the low Mach regime. The key idea of our all speed scheme is the special semi-implicit time discretization, in which the low Mach number stiff term is divided into two parts, one being treated explicitly and the other one implicitly. Moreover, the flux of the density equation is also treated implicitly and an elliptic type equation is derived to obtain the density. In this way, the correct limit can be captured without requesting the mesh size and time step to be smaller than the Mach number. Compared with previous semi-implicit methods, nonphysical oscillations can be suppressed. We develop this semi-implicit time discretization in the framework of a first order local Lax-Friedrich (LLF) scheme and numerical tests are displayed to demonstrate its performances.
