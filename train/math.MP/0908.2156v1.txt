We present an application of the theory of stochastic processes to model and categorize non-equilibrium physical phenomena. The concepts of uniformly continuous probability measures and modular evolution lead to a systematic hierarchical structure for (physical) correlation functions and non-equilibrium thermodynamical potentials. It is proposed that macroscopic evolution equations (such as dynamic correlation functions) may be obtained from a non-equilibrium thermodynamical description, by using the fact that extended thermodynamical potentials belong to a certain class of statistical systems whose probability distribution functions are defined by a stationary measure; although a measure which is, in general, different from the equilibrium Gibbs measure. These probability measures obey a certain hierarchy on its stochastic evolution towards the most probable (stationary) measure.   This in turns defines a convergence sequence. We propose a formalism which considers the mesoscopic stage (typical of non-local dissipative processes such as the ones described by extended irreversible thermodynamics) as being governed by stochastic dynamics due to the effect of non-equilibrium fluctuations. Some applications of the formalism are described.
