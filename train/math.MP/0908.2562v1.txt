This paper is a first presentation of a new approach of physics that we propose to refer as the Absolute Relativity Theory (ART) since it refutes the idea of a pre-existing space-time. It includes an algebraic definition of particles, interactions and Lagrangians. It proposed also a purely algebraic explanation of the passing of time phenomenon that leads to see usual Euler-Lagrange equations as the continuous version of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov monodromy. The identification of this monodromy with the local ones of the Lorentzian manifolds gives the Einstein equation algebraically explained in a quantized context. A fact that could lead to the unification of physics. By giving an algebraic classification of particles and interactions, the ART also proposes a new branch of physics, namely the Mass Quantification Theory, that provides a general method to calculate the characteristics of particles and interactions. Some examples are provided. The MQT also predicts the existence of as of today not yet observed particles that could be part of the dark matter. By giving a new interpretation of the weak interaction, it also suggests an interpretation of the so-called dark energy.
