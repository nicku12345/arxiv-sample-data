A covariant Hamiltonian description was introduced in the dynamics of charges and electromagnetic interaction. By a canonical transformation this Hamiltonian formalism was transformed to obtain the Dirac generators for any form of relativistic dynamics, as coefficients of a first degree polynomial in the ten translation and rotation velocities of the Poincar\'e transformation. The Currie's world line conditions were generalized to any form of the dynamics. The explicit relation between the covariant field variables and the more usual 3-dimensional Fourier variables was derived.
