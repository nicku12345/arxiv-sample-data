The following work is an exploration into certain topics in the broad world of integrable models, both classical and quantum, and consists of two main parts of roughly equal length. The first part, consisting of chapters 1-3, concerns itself mainly with correlations between results in classical hierarchies and quantum lattice models. The second part, consisting of chapters 4-6, deals almost entirely with deriving results concerned with quantum lattice models.
