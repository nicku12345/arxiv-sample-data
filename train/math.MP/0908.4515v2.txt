We provide a unified framework for the treatment of special integrable systems which we propose to call "generalized mean field systems". Thereby previous results on integrable classical and quantum systems are generalized. Following Ballesteros and Ragnisco, the framework consists of a unital algebra with brackets, a Casimir element, and a coproduct which can be lifted to higher tensor products. The coupling scheme of the iterated tensor product is encoded in a binary tree. The theory is exemplified by the case of a spin octahedron.
