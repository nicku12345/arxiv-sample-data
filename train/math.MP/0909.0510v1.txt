It is proposed to create materials with a desired refraction coefficient in a bounded domain D\subset \R^3 by embedding many small balls with constant refraction coefficients into a given material. The number of small balls per unit volume around every point x\in D, i.e., their density distribution, is calculated, as well as the constant refraction coefficients in these balls. Embedding into D small balls with these refraction coefficients according to the calculated density distribution creates in D a material with a desired refraction coefficient.
