A method is given for creating material with a desired refraction coefficient. The method consists of embedding into a material with known refraction coefficient many small particles of size a. The number of particles per unit volume around any point is prescribed, the distance between neighboring particles is O(a^{\frac{2-\kappa}{3}}) as a\to 0, 0<\kappa<1 is a fixed parameter. The total number of the embedded particle is O(a^{\kappa-2}). The physical properties of the particles are described by the boundary impedance \zeta_m of the m-th particle, \zeta_m=O(a^{-\kappa}) as a\to 0. The refraction coefficient is the coefficient n^2(x) in the wave equation [\nabla^2+k^2n^2(x)]u=0.
