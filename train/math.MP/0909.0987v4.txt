For entire operators and entire operators in the generalized sense, we provide characterizations based on the spectra of their selfadjoint extensions. In order to obtain these spectral characterizations, we discuss the representation of a simple, regular, closed symmetric operator with deficiency indices (1,1) as a multiplication operator in a certain de Branges space.
