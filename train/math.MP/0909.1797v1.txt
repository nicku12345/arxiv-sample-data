In the context of Covariant Quantum Mechanics for a spin particle, we classify the ``quantum vector fields'', i.e. the projectable Hermitian vector fields of a complex bundle of complex dimension 2 over spacetime. Indeed, we prove that the Lie algebra of quantum vector fields is naturally isomorphic to a certain Lie algebra of functions of the classical phase space, called ``special phase functions''. This result provides a covariant procedure to achieve the quantum operators generated by the quantum vector fields and the corresponding observables described by the special phase functions.
