We show that for decaying solutions of the Ablowitz-Ladik system, the leading asymptotic term is time independent. In addition, two arbitrary bounded solutions of the Ablowitz-Ladik system which are asymptotically close at the initial time stay close. All results are also derived for the associated hierarchy.
