We describe some new families of quasimodes for the Laplacian perturbed by the addition of a potential formally described by a Dirac delta function. As an application we find, under some additional hypotheses on the spectrum, subsequences of eigenfunctions of Seba billiards that localise around a pair of unperturbed eigenfunctions.
