This paper addresses the computation of Noether currrents for the renormalizable Grosse-Wulkenhaar (GW) \phi^{\star 4} model subjected to a dynamical noncomutativity realized through a twisted Moyal product. The noncommutative (NC) energy-momentum tensor (EMT), angular momentum tensor (AMT) and the dilatation current (DC) are explicitly derived. The breaking of translation and rotation invariances has been avoided via a constraint equation.
