We consider the spectrum of a Schroedinger operator in a multi-dimensional cylinder perturbed by a shrinking potential. We study the phenomenon of a new eigenvalue emerging from the threshold of the essential spectrum and give the sufficient conditions for such eigenvalues to emerge. If such eigenvalues exist, we construct their asymptotic expansions.
