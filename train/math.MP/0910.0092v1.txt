Elements of supergeometry are an ingredient in many contemporary classical and quantum field models involving odd fields. For instance, this is the case of SUSY field theory, BRST theory, supergravity. Addressing to theoreticians, these Lectures aim to summarize the relevant material on supergeometry of modules over graded commutative rings, graded manifolds and supermanifolds.
