In [7] we proposed a non-generational conjectural derivation of all first class constraints (involving, only, variables compatible with canonical Poisson brackets) for realistic gauge (singular) field theories; and we verified the conjecture in cases of electromagnetic field, Yang Mills fields interacting with scalar and spinor fields, and the gravitational field. Here we will further verify our conjecture for the case of 't Hooft- Polyakov (HP) monopole's field (i.e. in the Higgs Vacuum); and show that we will reproduce the results in Ref.[6], which we reached at using Dirac's standard multi-generational algorithm.
