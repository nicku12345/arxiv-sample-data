We consider a U(1)-invariant nonlinear Dirac equation in dimension n=3, interacting with itself via the mean field mechanism. We analyze the long-time asymptotics of solutions and prove that, under certain generic assumptions, each finite charge solution converges as t\to\pm\infty to the two-dimensional set of all "nonlinear eigenfunctions" of the form \phi(x)e\sp{-i\omega t}. This global attraction is caused by the nonlinear energy transfer from lower harmonics to the continuous spectrum and subsequent dispersive radiation.   The research is inspired by Bohr's postulate on quantum transitions and Schr\"odinger's identification of the quantum stationary states to the nonlinear eigenfunctions of the coupled U(1)-invariant Maxwell-Schr\"odinger and Maxwell-Dirac equations.
