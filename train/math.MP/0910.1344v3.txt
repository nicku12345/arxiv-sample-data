We give a derivation of the thermodynamic restrictions on the constitutive relations of an electrically polarizable and finitely deformable heat conducting elastic continuum, interacting with the electric field. This is made following the method of Coleman-Noll in a thermodynamic theory with the Clausius-Duhem inequality.
