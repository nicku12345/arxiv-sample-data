It is well-known that the central extensions of the loop group of a compact, simple and 1-connected Lie group are parametrised by their level k \in Z. This article concerns the question how much can be said for arbitrary k \in R and we show that for each k there exists a Lie groupoid which has the level k central extension as its quotient if k \in Z. By considering categorified principal bundles we show, moreover, that the corresponding Lie groupoid has the expected bundle structure.
