We study conditions of reduction of the multidimensional wave equation - a system of the d'Alembert and Hamilton equations. We prove necessary conditions for compatibility of such system of the reduction conditions. Possible types of the reduced equations represent interesting classes of two-dimensional parabolic, hyperbolic and elliptic equations. Ansatzes and methods used for reduction of the d'Alembert (n-dimensional wave) equation can be also used for arbitrary Poincare-invariant equations. This seemingly simple and partial problem involves many important aspects in the studies of the PDE.
