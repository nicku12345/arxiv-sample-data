We generalize the classical study of (generalized) Lax pairs and the related O-operators and the (modified) classical Yang-Baxter equation by introducing the concepts of nonabelian generalized Lax pairs, extended \calo-operators and the extended classical Yang-Baxter equation. We study in this context the nonabelian generalized r-matrix ansatz and the related double Lie algebra structures. Relationship between extended O-operators and the extended classical Yang-Baxter equation is established, especially for self-dual Lie algebras. This relationship allows us to obtain explicit description of the Manin triples for a new class of Lie bialgebras. Furthermore, we show that a natural structure of PostLie algebra is behind O-operators and fits in a setup of triple Lie algebra that produces self-dual nonabelian generalized Lax pairs.
