We review some recent results concerning the derivation of effective evolution equations from first principle quantum dynamics. In particular, we discuss the derivation of the Hartree equation for mean field systems and the derivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the time evolution of Bose-Einstein condensates.
