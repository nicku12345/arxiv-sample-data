In this paper we propose a new proof of some non-existence results for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon-Maxwell system of equations. The proof is based on the scaling arguments, i.e. special variations of the fields, only. We also apply the obtained results to the case of the simplest Q-balls and present some restrictions on their existence.
