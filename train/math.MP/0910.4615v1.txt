We study the McKean--Vlasov equation on the finite tori of length scale L in d--dimensions. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a phase transition, which are based on the criteria first uncovered in \cite{GP} and \cite{KM}. Therein and in subsequent works, one finds indications pointing to critical transitions at a particular model dependent value, \theta^{\sharp} of the interaction parameter. We show that the uniform density (which may be interpreted as the liquid phase) is dynamically stable for \theta < \theta^{\sharp} and prove, abstractly, that a {\it critical} transition must occur at \theta = \theta^{\sharp}. However for this system we show that under generic conditions -- L large, d \geq 2 and isotropic interactions -- the phase transition is in fact discontinuous and occurs at some \theta\t < \theta^{\sharp}. Finally, for H--stable, bounded interactions with discontinuous transitions we show that, with suitable scaling, the \theta\t(L) tend to a definitive non--trivial limit as L\to\infty.
