The current associated with field emission is greatly dependent on the electric field at the emitting electrode. This field is a combination of the electric field in vacuum and the space charge created by the current. The latter becomes more important as the currentdensity increases. Here, a study is performed using a modified classical 1D Child-Langmuir description that allows for exact solutions in order to characterize the contributions due to space charge. Methods to connect the 1D approach to an array of periodic 3D structures are considered.
