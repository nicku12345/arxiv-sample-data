A discrete N-point Runge-Kutta version H^{(N)}({\lambda}) of one of the simplest non-Hermitian square-well Hamiltonians with real spectrum is studied. A complete set of its possible hermitizations (i.e., of the eligible metrics \Theta^{(N)}({\lambda}) defining its non-equivalent physical Hilbert spaces of states) is constructed, in closed form, for any coupling {\lambda}\in (-1,1) and any matrix dimension N.
