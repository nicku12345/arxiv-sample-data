Exact procedures that follow Dirac's constraint quantization of gauge theories are usually technically involved and often difficult to implement in practice. We overview an "effective" scheme for obtaining the leading order semiclassical corrections to the dynamics of constrained quantum systems developed elsewhere. Motivated by the geometrical view of quantum mechanics, our method mimics the classical Dirac-Bergmann algorithm and avoids direct reference to a particular representation of the physical Hilbert space. We illustrate the procedure through the example of a relativistic particle in Minkowski spacetime.
