The aim of this article is the formulation of the basic laws of Physics by frames, i.e. quadruples of exterior differential one forms. The basic operator is a modification of the Hodge-de Rham Laplacian d*d*+*d*d, where * is the hyperbolic star. In this article it is modified depending on the frame. The modified * is invariant w.r. to any diffeomorphism. Consequently, the modified Laplavian is invariant. The field equation developed in this article is a complete alternative to the field equation of General Relativity in vacuum. The frame-field equation yields a derivation of Newtonian (Einstein) law of attraction without recourse to the geodesic postulate. Coulomb law is also derived. Invariant formulation of Maxwell equations is exhibited. Then first order linear approximation is considered. It is used to derive invariant formulation of Schroedinger equation (classical and relativistic) and Dirac equation all of which are linear. The lhs of the field equation, defined on a four dimensional manifold, is the same for all bodies. Thus hopefully, it may set the foundation for a field theory. The interaction of the particles has to be worked out. The basic equation of this article is motivated by the Einstein equation in nonempty space.
