Properties of the four families of recently introduced special functions of two real variables, denoted here by E^\pm, and \cos^\pm, are studied. The superscripts ^+ and ^- refer to the symmetric and antisymmetric functions respectively. The functions are considered in all details required for their exploitation in Fourier expansions of digital data, sampled on square grids of any density and for general position of the grid in the real plane relative to the lattice defined by the underlying group theory. Quality of continuous interpolation, resulting from the discrete expansions, is studied, exemplified and compared for some model functions.
