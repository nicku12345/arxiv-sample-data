In this paper the stationary Klein-Gordon equation is considered for the Coulomb potential in non-commutative space. The energy shift due to noncommutativeity is obtained via the perturbation theory. Furthermore, we show that the degeneracy of the initial spectral line is broken in transition from commutative space to non-commutative space.
