We consider the adjacency matrix A of a large random graph and study fluctuations of the function f_n(z,u)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n\exp\{-uG_{kk}(z)\} with G(z)=(z-iA)^{-1}. We prove that the moments of fluctuations normalized by n^{-1/2} in the limit n\to\infty satisfy the Wick relations for the Gaussian random variables. This allows us to prove central limit theorem for \hbox{Tr}G(z) and then extend the result on the linear eigenvalue statistics \hbox{Tr}\phi(A) of any function \phi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R} which increases, together with its first two derivatives, at infinity not faster than an exponential.
