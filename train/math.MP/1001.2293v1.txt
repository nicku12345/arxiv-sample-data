In view of the role of reaction equations in physical problems, the authors derive the explicit solution of a fractional reaction equation of general character, that unifies and extends earlier results. Further, an alternative shorter method based on a result developed by the authors is given to derive the solution of a fractional diffusion equation. Fox functions and Mittag-Leffler functions are used for closed-form representations of the solutions of the respective differential equations.
