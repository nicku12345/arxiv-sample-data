We provide a mathematically rigorous framework for supersymmetric fermion lattice systems.   We construct supersymmetric C*-dynamics in terms of a nilpotent superderivation   and a one-parameter group of automorphisms on the CAR-algebra. (We do not make use of Grassmann numbers.) We establish several basic properties of superderivations on the fermion lattice system. Among others, we obtain a criterion of superderivations to yield supersymmetic dynamics.
