We propose a new kind of supersymmetric (SUSY) transformation in the case of the two-channel scattering problem with equal thresholds, for partial waves of the same parity. This two-fold transformation is based on two imaginary factorization energies with opposite signs and with mutually conjugated factorization solutions. We call it an eigenphase preserving SUSY transformation as it relates two Hamiltonians, the scattering matrices of which have identical eigenphase shifts. In contrast to known phase-equivalent transformations, the mixing parameter is modified by the eigenphase preserving transformation.
