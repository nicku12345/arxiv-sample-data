The asymptotic expansion of n-dimensional cyclic integrals was expressed as a series of functionals acting on the symmetric function involved in the cyclic integral. In this article, we give an explicit formula for the action of these functionals on a specific class of symmetric functions. These results are necessary for the computation of the O(1) part in the long-distance asymptotic behavior of correlation functions in integrable models.
