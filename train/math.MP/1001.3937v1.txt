Dielectric permeability of the degenerate electronic gas for the collisional plasmas is found. The kinetic equation of Wigner -- Vlasov -- Boltzmann with integral of collisions in relaxation form in coordinate space is used. We will notice that dielectric permeability with using of the relaxation equation in the momentum space has been received by Mermin.
