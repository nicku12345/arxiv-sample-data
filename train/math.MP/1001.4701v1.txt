In a previous work we have introduced the concept of quasi-integrable quantum system. In the present one we determine sufficient conditions under which, given an integrable classical system, it is possible to construct a quasi-integrable quantum system by means of a quantization procedure based on the symmetrized product of operators. This procedure will be applied to concrete classes of integrable systems in two following papers.
