Using a new method [9] it is possible to derive mean field equations from the microscopic N-body Schrodinger evolution of interacting particles without using BBGKY hierarchies.   Recently this method was used to derive the Hartree equation for singular interactions [4] and the Gross Pitaevskii equation without positivity condition on the interaction [10] where one had to restrict the scaling behaviour of the interaction.   In this paper more general scalings shall be considered assuming positivity of the interaction.
