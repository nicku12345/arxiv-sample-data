We present here a set of lecture notes on tomography. The Radon transform and some of its generalizations are considered and their inversion formulae are proved. We will also look from a group-theoretc point of view at the more general problem of expressing a function on a manifold in terms of its integrals over certain submanifolds. Finally, the extension of the tomographic maps to the quantum case is considered, as a Weyl-Wigner quantization of the classical case.
