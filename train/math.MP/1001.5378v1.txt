The aim of the article to clarify the status of Shapiro plane wave solutions of the Schr\"odinger's equation in the frames of the well-known general method of separation of variables. To solve this task, we use the well-known cylindrical coordinates in Riemann and Lobachevsky spaces, naturally related with Euler angle-parameters. Conclusion may be drawn: the general method of separation of variables embraces the all plane wave solutions; the plane waves in Lobachevsky and Riemann space consist of a small part of the whole set of basis wave functions of Schr\"odinger equation.   In space of constant positive curvature S_{3}, a complex analog of horospherical coordinates of Lobachevsky space H_{3} is introduced. To parameterize real space S_{3}, two complex coordinates (r,z) must obey additional restriction in the form of the equation r^{2} = e^{z-z^{*}} - e^{2z} . The metrical tensor of space S_{3} is expressed in terms of (r,z) with additional constraint, or through pairs of conjugate variables (r,r^{*}) or (z,z^{*}); correspondingly exist three different representations for Schr\"{o}dinger Hamiltonian. Shapiro plane waves are determined and explored as solutions of Schr\"odinger equation in complex horosperical coordinates of S_{3}. In particular, two oppositely directed plane waves may be presented as exponentials in conjugated coordinates. \Psi_{-}= e^{-\alpha z} and \Psi_{+}= e^{-\alpha z^{*}}. Solutions constructed are single-valued, finite, and continuous functions in spherical space and correspond to discrete energy levels.
