We review developments made since 1959 in the search for a closed form for the susceptibility of the Ising model. The expressions for the form factors in terms of the nome q and the modulus k are compared and contrasted. The \lambda generalized correlations C(M,N;\lambda) are defined and explicitly computed in terms of theta functions for M=N=0,1.
