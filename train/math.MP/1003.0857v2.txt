Kernel functions related to quantum many-body systems of Calogero-Sutherland type are discussed, in particular for the elliptic case. The main result is an elliptic generalization of an identity due to Sen that is a source for many such kernel functions. Applications are given, including simple exact eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenvalues of Chalykh-Feigin-Veselov-Sergeev-type deformations of the elliptic Calogero-Sutherland model for special parameter values.
