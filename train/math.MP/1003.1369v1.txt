In this paper we define the degree of a morphism between (generalized) Verma modules over a graded Lie superalgebra and construct series of morphisms of various degrees between (generalized) Verma modules over the exceptional infinite-dimensional linearly compact simple Lie superalgebra E(5,10). We prove that all such morphisms of degree 1 are found.
