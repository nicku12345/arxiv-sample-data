We consider diatomic systems in which the kinetic energy of the electrons is treated in a simple relativistic model. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is assumed. We investigate questions of stability, deducing bounds on the number N of electrons, the binding energy \Delta E_b and the equilibrium bond distance R_0. We use a known localization argument adopted to the present relativistic setting, with particular consideration of the critical point of stability, as well as the recently proved relativistic Scott correction.
