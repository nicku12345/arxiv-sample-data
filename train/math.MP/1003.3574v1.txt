We study measures on the real line and present various versions of what it means for such a measure to take only finitely many values. We then study perturbations of the Laplacian by such measures. Using Kotani-Remling theory, we show that the resulting operators have empty absolutely continuous spectrum if the measures are not periodic. When combined with Gordon type arguments this allows us to prove purely singular continuous spectrum for some continuum models of quasicrystals.
