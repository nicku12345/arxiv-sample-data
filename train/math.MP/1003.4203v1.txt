Various qualitative properties of solutions to the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in a periodic or a confining potential are studied in this paper. We consider a class of quasi-Markovian GLEs, similar to the model that was introduced in \cite{EPR99}. Geometric ergodicity, a homogenization theorem (invariance principle), short time asymptotics and the white noise limit are studied. Our proofs are based on a careful analysis of a hypoelliptic operator which is the generator of an auxiliary Markov process. Systematic use of the recently developed theory of hypocoercivity \cite{Vil04HPI} is made.
