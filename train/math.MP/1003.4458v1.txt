We show that, for a detector rotating in a random classical zero-point electromagnetic or massless scalar field at zero temperature, thermal effects exist. The rotating reference system is constructed as an infinite set of Frenet-Seret tetrads so that the detector is at rest in a tetrad at each proper time. Frequency spectrum of correlation functions contains the Planck thermal factor with temperature T_{rot} = \frac{\hbar \Omega}{2 \pi k_B} . The energy density the rotating detector observes is proportional to the sum of energy densities of Planck's spectrum at the temperature T_{rot} and zero-point radiation. The proportionality factor is 2/3 (4 \gamma^2 -1) for an EMF and 2/9 (4 \gamma^2 -1) for a MSF, where \gamma = (1 - (\frac{\Omega r}{c})^2)^{-1/2}, and r is a rotation radius. The origin of these thermal effects is the periodicity of the correlation functions and their discrete spectrum, both following rotation with angular velocity \Omega. The thermal energy can also be interpreted as a source of a vacuum force (VF) applied to the rotating detector from the vacuum field. The VF depends on the size of neither the charge nor the mass, like the force in the Casimir model for a charged particle, but, contrary to the last one, VF is attractive and directed to the center of the circular orbit. VF infinitely grows in magnitude with orbit radius. The orbits with a radius greater than c/ \Omega do not exist because the returning VF becomes infinite. On the uttermost orbit with the radius c / \Omega, a linear velocity of the rotating particle would have become c. The VF becomes very small and proportional to radius when r is very small. Such VF dependence on radius, at large and small radii, can be associated respectively with so called confinement and asymptotic freedom, known in quantum chromodynamics, and provide a new explanation for them.
