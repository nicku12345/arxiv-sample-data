We introduce a new family of Hamiltonians with a deformed Kepler- Coulomb potential dependent on an indexing parameter k. We show that this family is superintegrable for all rational k and compute the classical trajectories and quantum wave functions. We show that this system is related, via coupling constant metamorphosis, to a family of superintegrable deformations of the harmonic oscillator given by Tremblay, Turbiner and Winternitz. In doing so, we prove that all Hamiltonians with an oscillator term are related by coupling constant metamorphosis to systems with a Kepler-Coulomb term, both on Euclidean space. We also look at the effect of the transformation on the integrals of the motion, the classical trajectories and the wave functions and give the transformed integrals explicitly for the classical system.
