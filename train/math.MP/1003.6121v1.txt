We study the expectation of linear eigenvalue statistics of matrix models with any \beta>0, assuming that the potential V is a real analytic function and that the corresponding equilibrium measure has a one-interval support. We obtain the first order (with respect to n^{-1}) correction terms for the expectation and apply this result to prove bulk universality for real symmetric and symplectic matrix models with the same V.
