Statistical thermodynamics of small systems shows dramatic differences from normal systems. Parallel to the recently presented steady-state thermodynamic formalism for master equation and Fokker-Planck equation, we show that a ``thermodynamic'' theory can also be developed based on Tsallis' generalized entropy S^{(q)}=\sum_{i=1}^N(p_i-p_i^q)/[q(q-1)] and Shiino's generalized free energy F^{(q)}=[\sum_{i=1}^Np_i(p_i/\pi_i)^{q-1}-1]/[q(q-1)], where \pi_i is the stationary distribution. dF^{(q)}/dt=-f_d^{(q)}\le 0 and it is zero iff the system is in its stationary state. dS^{(q)}/dt-Q_{ex}^{(q)} = f_d^{(q)} where Q_{ex}^{(q)} characterizes the heat exchange. For systems approaching equilibrium with detailed balance, f_d^{(q)} is the product of Onsager's thermodynamic flux and force. However, it is discovered that the Onsager's force is non-local. This is a consequence of the particular transformation invariance for zero energy of Tsallis' statistics.
