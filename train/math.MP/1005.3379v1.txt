We study waves in a rod of finite length with a viscoelastic constitutive equation of fractional distributed-order type for the special choice of weight functions. Prescribing boundary conditions on displacement, we obtain case corresponding to stress relaxation. In solving system of differential and integro-differential equations we use the Laplace transformation in the time domain.
