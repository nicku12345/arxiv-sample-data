We derive the ground state energy up to the fourth order in the fine structure constant \alpha for the translation invariant Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian for a spinless electron coupled to the quantized radiation field. As a consequence, we obtain the non-analyticity of the ground state energy of the Pauli-Fierz operator for a single particle in the Coulomb field of a nucleus.
