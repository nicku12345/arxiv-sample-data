We prove a Goldstone Theorem in thermal relativistic quantum field theory, which relates spontaneous symmetry breaking to the rate of space-like decay of the two-point function. The critical rate of fall-off coincides with that of the massless free scalar field theory. Related results and open problems are briefly discussed.
