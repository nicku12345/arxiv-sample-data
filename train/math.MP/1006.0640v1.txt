In this paper, we consider stochastic Schroedinger equations with two-dimensional white noise. Such equations are used to describe the evolution of an open quantum system undergoing a process of continuous measurement. Representations are obtained for solutions of such equations using a generalization to the stochastic case of the classical construction of Feynman path integrals over trajectories in the phase space.
