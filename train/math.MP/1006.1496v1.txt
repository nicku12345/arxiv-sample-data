The knowledge of the isotropic correlation function of a plane figure is useful to determine the correlation function of the cylinders having the plane figure as right-section and a given height as well as to analyze the out of plane intensity collected in grazing incidence small-angle scattering from a film formed by a particulate collection of these cylinders. The correlation function of plane polygons can always be determined in closed algebraic form. Here we report its analytic expression for the case of a triangle. The expressions take four different forms that depend on the relative order among the sides and the heights of the triangle.
