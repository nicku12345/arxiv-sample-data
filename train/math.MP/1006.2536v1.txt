We consider the asymptotics of the correlation functions of the characteristic polynomials of the hermitian Wigner matrices H_n=n^{-1/2}W_n. We show that for the correlation function of any even order the asymptotic coincides with this for the GUE up to a factor, depending only on the forth moment of the common probability law Q of entries \Im W_{jk}, \Re W_{jk}, i.e. that the higher moments of Q do not contribute to the above limit.
