A supersymmetric analysis is presented for the d-dimensional Dirac equation with central potentials under spin-symmetric   (S(r) = V(r)) and pseudo-spin-symmetric (S(r) = - V(r)) regimes. We construct the explicit shift operators that are required to factorize the Dirac Hamiltonian with the Kratzer potential. Exact solutions are provided for both the Coulomb and Kratzer potentials.
