We study motion of a relativistic particle in the 3-dimensional Lobachevsky space in the presence of an external magnetic field which is analogous to a constant uniform magnetic field in the Euclidean space. Three integrals of motion are found and equations of motion are solved exactly in the special cylindrical coordinates. Motion on surface of the cylinder of constant radius is considered in detail.
