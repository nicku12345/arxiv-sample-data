Lowest weight modules, in particular, Verma modules over the N = 1,2 super Schrodinger algebras in (1+1) dimensional spacetime are investigated. The reducibility of the Verma modules is analyzed via explicitly constructed singular vectors. The classification of the irreducible lowest weight modules is given for both massive and massless representations. A vector field realization of the N = 1, 2 super Schrodinger algebras is also presented.
