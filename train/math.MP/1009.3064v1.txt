In this paper, we simplify and extend the results of \cite{GZ} to include the case in which \Om =\R^3. Let {[L^2({\mathbb{R}}^3)]^3} be the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on {\mathbb {R}}^3  and let {\mathbb H}[{\mathbb{R}}^3]^3 =: {\mathbb H} be the completion of the set, {{{\bf{u}} \in (\mathbb {C}_0^\infty [ \R^3 ])^3. {} | \nabla \cdot {\bf{u}} = 0}}, with respect to the inner product of {[L^2({\mathbb{R}}^3)]^3} . In this paper, we consider sufficiency conditions on a class of functions in {\mathbb H} which allow global-in-time strong solutions to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on {\mathbb {R}}^3. These equations describe the time evolution of the fluid velocity and pressure of an incompressible viscous homogeneous Newtonian fluid in terms of a given initial velocity and given external body forces. Our approach uses the analytic nature of the Stokes semigroup to construct an equivalent norm for \mathbb{H} which allows us to prove a reverse of the Poincar\'e inequality. This result allows us to provide strong bounds on the nonlinear term. We then prove that, under appropriate conditions, there exists a positive constant  {{u}_+}, depending only on the domain, the viscosity and the body forces such that, for all functions in a dense set \mathbb{D} contained in the closed ball {{\mathbb B} ({\mathbb {R}}^3)}=: {\mathbb B} of radius  (1/2){{u}_ +}  in {\mathbb {H}}, the Navier-Stokes equations have unique strong solutions in {\mathbb C}^{1} ({(0,\infty),{\mathbb {H}}}).
