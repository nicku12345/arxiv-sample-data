We propose an operational method for the solution of differential equations involving vector products. The technique we propose is based on the use of the evolution operator, defined in such a way that the wealth of techniques developed within the context of quantum mechanics can also be exploited for classical problems. We discuss the application of the method to the solution of the Lorentz-type equations.
