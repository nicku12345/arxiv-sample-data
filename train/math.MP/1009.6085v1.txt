In our former study (J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 43, (2010) 325210 or arXiv:1002.0999v1 [math-ph]) we introduced a modified Fourier-Cattaneo law and derived a non-autonomous telegraph-type heat conduction equation which has desirable self-similar solution. Now we present a detailed in-depth analysis of this model and discuss additional analytic solutions for different parameters. The solutions have a very rich and interesting mathematical structure due to various special functions.
