Consider a quantum system \cS that interacts sequentially with a chain (environment) of identical probes {\cal C} = \cP+\cP+..., with each interaction governed by a fixed interaction time \tau and operator V. It is known how to construct the asymptotic state (large times) if the initial states of \cP belong to a class of so-called reference states. We generalize the analysis to a broader class of initial states, including the physically important situation of pure states. This is done by a simple modification to the effective dynamics generator.
