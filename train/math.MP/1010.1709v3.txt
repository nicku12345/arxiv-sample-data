Quantum wire networks have recently become of great interest. Here we deal with a novel nano material structure of a Double Gyroid wire network. We use methods of commutative and non-commutative geometry to describe this wire network. Its non--commutative geometry is closely related to non-commutative 3-tori as we discuss in detail.
