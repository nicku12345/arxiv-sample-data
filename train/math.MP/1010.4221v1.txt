In a series of recent papers one of us has analyzed in some details a class of elementary excitations called {\em pseudo-bosons}. They arise from a special deformation of the canonical commutation relation [a,a^\dagger]=\1, which is replaced by [a,b]=\1, with b not necessarily equal to a^\dagger. Here, after a two-dimensional extension of the general framework, we apply the theory to a generalized version of the two-dimensional Hamiltonian describing Landau levels. Moreover, for this system, we discuss coherent states and we deduce a resolution of the identity. We also consider a different class of examples arising from a classical system, i.e. a damped harmonic oscillator.
