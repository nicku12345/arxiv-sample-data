Continuing a previous analysis originally motivated by physics, we consider representable states on quasi-local quasi *-algebras, starting with examining the possibility for a {\em compatible} family of {\em local} states to give rise to a {\em global} state. Some properties of {\em local modifications} of representable states and some aspects of their asymptotic behavior are also considered.
