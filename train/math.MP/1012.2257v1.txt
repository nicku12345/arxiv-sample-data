A geometric approach is used to study the Abel first order differential equation of the first kind. The approach is based on the recently developed theory of quasi-Lie systems which allows us to characterise some particular examples of integrable Abel equations. Second order Abel equations will be discussed and the inverse problem of the Lagrangian dynamics is analysed: the existence of two alternative Lagrangian formulations is proved, both Lagrangians being of a non-natural class. The study is carried out by means of the Darboux polynomials and Jacobi multipliers.
