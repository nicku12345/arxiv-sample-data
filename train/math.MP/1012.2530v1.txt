The work presents an integral solution of the time-fractional subdiffusion through a preliminary defined profile with unknown coefficients and the concept of penetration layer well known from the heat diffusion The profile satisfies the boundary conditions imposed at the boundary of the boundary layer in a weak form that allows its coefficients to be expressed through the boundary layer depth as unique parameter describing the profile. The technique is demonstrated by a solution of a time fractional subdiffusion equation in rectilinear 1-D conditions
