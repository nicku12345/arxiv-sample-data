Being based on V. Konoplev's axiomatic approach to continuum mechanics, the paper broadens its frontiers in order to bring together continuum mechanics with classical mechanics in a new theory of mechanical systems. There are derived motion equations of `abstract' mechanical systems specified for mass-points, multibody systems and continua: Newton-Euler equations, Lagrange equations of II kind and Navier-Stokes ones. Quasi-linear constitutive equations are introduced in conformity with V. Konoplev's definition of stress and strain (rate) matrices.
