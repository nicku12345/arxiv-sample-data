In these notes we review some recent results concerning the derivation of effective equations from first principle quantum dynamics. In particular, we discuss the derivation of the semi-relativistic Hartree equation for the evolution of boson stars, and the derivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates.
