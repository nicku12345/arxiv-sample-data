An explicit homomorphism that relates the elements of the infinite dimensional non-Abelian algebra generating O_q(\hat{sl_2}) currents and the standard generators of the q-Onsager algebra is proposed. Two straightforward applications of the result are then considered: First, for the class of quantum integrable models which integrability condition originates in the q-Onsager spectrum generating algebra, the infinite q-deformed Dolan-Grady hierarchy is derived - bypassing the transfer matrix formalism. Secondly, higher Askey-Wilson relations that arise in the study of symmetric special functions generalizing the Askey-Wilson q-orthogonal polynomials are proposed.
