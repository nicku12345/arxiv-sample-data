We prove that the steady--state Navier--Stokes problem in a plane Lipschitz domain \Omega exterior to a bounded and simply connected set has a D-solution provided the boundary datum \a \in L^2(\partial\Omega) satisfies {1\over 2\pi}|\int_{\partial\Omega}\a\cdot\n|<1. If \Omega is of class C^{1,1}, we can assume \a\in W^{-1/4,4}(\partial\Omega). Moreover, we show that for every D--solution (\u,p) of the Navier--Stokes equations it holds \nabla p = o(r^{-1}), \nabla_k p = O(r^{\epsilon-3/2}), \nabla_k\u = O(r^{\epsilon-3/4}), for all k\in{\Bbb N}\setminus\{1\} and for all positive \epsilon, and if the flux of \u through a circumference surrounding \complement\Omega is zero, then there is a constant vector \u_0 such that \u=\u_0+o(1).
