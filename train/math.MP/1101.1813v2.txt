We consider the deformed Gaussian ensemble H_n=H_n^{(0)}+M_n in which H_n^{(0)} is a hermitian matrix (possibly random) and M_n is the Gaussian unitary random matrix (GUE) independent of H_n^{(0)}. Assuming that the Normalized Counting Measure of H_n^{(0)} converges weakly (in probability if random) to a non-random measure N^{(0)} with a bounded support and assuming some conditions on the convergence rate, we prove universality of the local eigenvalue statistics near the edge of the limiting spectrum of H_n.
