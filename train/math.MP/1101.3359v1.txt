We apply variational principles in the context of geometrothermodynamics. The thermodynamic phase space {\cal T} and the space of equilibrium states {\cal E} turn out to be described by Riemannian metrics which are invariant with respect to Legendre transformations and satisfy the differential equations following from the variation of a Nambu-Goto-like action. This implies that the volume element of {\cal E} is an extremal and that {\cal E} and {\cal T} are related by an embedding harmonic map.   We explore the physical meaning of geodesic curves in {\cal E} as describing quasi-static processes that connect different equilibrium states. We present a Legendre invariant metric which is flat (curved) in the case of an ideal (van der Waals) gas and satisfies Nambu-Goto equations. The method is used to derive some new solutions which could represent particular thermodynamic systems.
