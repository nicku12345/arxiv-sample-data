For 0\neq x>-1 let \Delta(x)={{\ln \Gamma(x+1)} \over x}. Recently Adell and Alzer proved the complete monotonicity of \Delta' on (-1,\infty) by giving an integral representation of (-1)^n \Delta^{(n+1)}(x) in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function \zeta(s,a). We reprove this integral representation in different ways, and then re-express it in terms of fractional part integrals. Special cases then have explicit evaluations. Other relations for \Delta^{(n+1)}(x) are presented, including its leading asymptotic form as x \to \infty.
