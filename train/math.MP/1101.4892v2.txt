We consider a class of ensembles of lattice Schr\"odinger operators with deterministic random potentials, including quasi-periodic potentials with Diophantine frequencies, depending upon an infinite number of parameters in an auxiliary measurable space. Using a variant of the Multi-Scale Analysis, we prove Anderson localization for generic ensembles in the strong disorder regime and establish an analog of Minami-type bounds for spectral spacings.
