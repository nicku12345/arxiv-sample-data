We present a general method for analytically factorizing the n-fold form factor integrals f^{(n)}_{N,N}(t) for the correlation functions of the Ising model on the diagonal in terms of the hypergeometric functions _2F_1([1/2,N+1/2];[N+1];t) which appear in the form factor f^{(1)}_{N,N}(t). New quadratic recursion and quartic identities are obtained for the form factors for n=2,3. For n= 2,3,4 explicit results are given for the form factors. These factorizations are proved for all N for n= 2,3. These results yield the emergence of palindromic polynomials canonically associated with elliptic curves. As a consequence, understanding the form factors amounts to describing and understanding an infinite set of palindromic polynomials, canonically associated with elliptic curves. From an analytical viewpoint the relation of these palindromic polynomials with hypergeometric functions associated with elliptic curves is made very explicitly, and from a differential algebra viewpoint this corresponds to the emergence of direct sums of differential operators homomorphic to symmetric powers of a second order operator associated with elliptic curve.
