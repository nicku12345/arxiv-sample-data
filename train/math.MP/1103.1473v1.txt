In the first part of these notes, we review some of the recent developments in the study of the spectral properties of Wigner matrices. In the second part, we present a new proof of a Wegner estimate for the eigenvalues of a large class of Wigner matrices. The Wegner estimate gives an upper bound for the probability to find an eigenvalue in an interval I, proportional to the size |I| of the interval.
