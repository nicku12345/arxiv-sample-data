The theme of doing quantum mechanics on all abelian groups goes back to Schwinger and Weyl. If the group is a vector space of finite dimension over a non-archimedean locally compact division ring, it is of interest to examine the structure of dynamical systems defined by Hamiltonians analogous to those encountered over the field of real numbers. In this letter a path integral formula for the imaginary time propagators of these Hamiltonians is derived.
