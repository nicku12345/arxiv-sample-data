In previous report (J. Phys. A (1997) 30 4019-4029), I showed that the Dirac field confined in a surface immersed in R^3 by means of a mass type potential is governed by the Konopelchenko-Kenmotsu-Weierstrass-Enneper equation. In this article, I quantized the Dirac field and calculated the gauge transformation which exhibits the gauge freedom of the parameterization of the surface. Then using the Ward-Takahashi identity, I showed that the expectation value of the action of the Dirac field is expressed by the Willmore functional and area of the surface.
