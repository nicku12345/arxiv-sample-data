The study concerns a special symbolic calculus of interest for signal analysis. This calculus associates functions on the time-frequency half-plane f>0 with linear operators defined on the positive-frequency signals. Full attention is given to its construction which is entirely based on the study of the affine group in a simple and direct way. The correspondence rule is detailed and the associated Wigner function is given. Formulas expressing the basic operation (star-bracket) of the Lie algebra of symbols, which is isomorphic to that of the operators, are obtained. In addition, it is shown that the resulting calculus is covariant under a three-parameter group which contains the affine group as subgroup. This observation is the starting point of an investigation leading to a whole class of symbolic calculi which can be considered as modifications of the original one.
