We will derive both quaternion and octonion algebras as the Clebsch-Gordan algebras based upon the su(2) Lie algebra by considering angular momentum spaces of spin one and three. If we consider both spin 1 and 1/2 states, then the same method will lead to the Lie-super algebra osp(1,2). Also, the quantum generalization of the method is discussed on the basis of the quantum group su_q(2).
