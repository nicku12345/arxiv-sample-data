A new simple Young diagrammatic method for Kronecker products of O(n) and Sp(2m) is proposed based on representation theory of Brauer algebras. A general procedure for the decomposition of tensor products of representations for O(n) and Sp(2m) is outlined, which is similar to that for U(n) known as the Littlewood rules together with trace contractions from a Brauer algebra and some modification rules given by King.
