Group theoretical methods are used to study some properties of the Riccati equation, which is the only differential equation admitting a nonlinear superposition principle. The Wei-Norman method is applied to obtain the associated differential equation in the group SL(2,R). The superposition principle for first order differential equation systems and Lie-Scheffers theorem are also analysed from this group theoretical perspective. Finally, the theory is applied in the solution of second order differential equations like time-independent Schroedinger equation
