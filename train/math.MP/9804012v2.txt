The quantum derivatives of e^{-A}, A^{-1} and \log A, which play a basic role in quantum statistical physics, are derived and their convergence is proven for an unbounded positive operator A in a Hilbert space. Using the quantum analysis based on these quantum derivatives, a basic equation for the entropy operator in nonequilibrium systems is derived, and Zubarev's theory is extended to infinite order with respect to a perturbation. Using the first-order term of this general perturbational expansion of the entropy operator, Kubo's linear response is rederived and expressed in terms of the inner derivation \delta_{{\cal H}} for the relevant Hamiltonian {\cal H}. Some remarks on the conductivity \sigma (\omega) are given.
