It is shown that any dynamic equation on a configuration bundle Q\to R of non-relativistic time-dependent mechanics is associated with connections on the affine jet bundle J^1Q\to Q and on the tangent bundle TQ\to Q. As a consequence, any non-relativistic dynamic equation can be seen as a geodesic equation with respect to a (non-linear) connection on the tangent bundle TQ\to Q. Using this fact, the relationship between relativistic and non-relativistic equations of motion is studied. The geometric notions of reference frames and relative accelerations in non-relativistic mechanics are introduced in the terms of connections. The covariant form of non-relativistic dynamic equations is written.
