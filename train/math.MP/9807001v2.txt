We study charge transport driven by deformations in molecular rings and chains. Level crossings and the associated Longuet-Higgins phase play a central role in this theory. In molecular rings a vanishing cycle of shears pinching a gap closure leads, generically, to diverging charge transport around the ring. We call such behavior homeopathic. In an infinite chain such a cycle leads to integral charge transport which is independent of the strength of deformation. In the Jahn-Teller model of a planar molecular ring there is a distinguished cycle in the space of uniform shears which keeps the molecule in its manifold of ground states and pinches level crossing. The charge transport in this cycle gives information on the derivative of the hopping amplitudes.
