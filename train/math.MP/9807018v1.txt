In this paper we study generalized classes of volume preserving multidimensional integrable systems via Nambu-Poisson mechanics. These integrable systems belong to the same class of dispersionless KP type equation. Hence they bear a close resemblance to the self dual Einstein equation. Recently Takasaki-Takebe provided the twistor construction of dispersionless KP and dToda type equations by using the Gindikin's pencil of two forms. In this paper we generalize this twistor construction to our systems.
