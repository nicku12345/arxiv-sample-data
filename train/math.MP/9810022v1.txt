We analyse the behaviour of the Dirac equation in d=1+1 with Lorentz scalar potential. As the system is known to provide a physical realization of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we take advantage of the factorization method in order to enlarge the restricted class of solvable problems. To be precise, it suffices to integrate a Ricatti equation to construct one-parameter families of solvable potentials. To illustrate the procedure in a simple but relevant context, we resort to a model which has proved useful in showing the phenomenon of fermion number fractionalization.
