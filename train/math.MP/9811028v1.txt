For a pseudo-relativistic model of matter, based on the no-pair Hamiltonian, we prove that the inclusion of the interaction with the self-generated magnetic field leads to instability for all positive values of the fine structure constant. This is true no matter whether this interaction is accounted for by the Breit potential, by an external magnetic field which is chosen to minimize the energy, or by the quantized radiation field.
