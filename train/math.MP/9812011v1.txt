In this letter, the h--analogue of Newton's binomial formula is obtained in the h--deformed quantum plane which does not have any q--analogue. For h=0, this is just the usual one as it should be. Furthermore, the binomial coefficients reduce to \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} for h=1. \\ Some properties of the h--binomial coefficients are also given. \\ Finally, I hope that such results will contribute to an introduction of the h--analogue of the well--known functions, h--special functions and h--deformed analysis.
