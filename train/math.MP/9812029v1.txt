New mathematical objects called Finslerian N-spinors are discussed. The Finslerian N-spinor algebra is developed. It is found that Finslerian N-spinors are associated with an N^2-dimensional flat Finslerian space. A generalization of the epimorphism SL(2,C) --> SO^\uparrow(1,3) to a case of the group SL(N,C) is constructed.
