We study the time and temperature dependent correlation functions for an impenetrable Bose gas with Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions \langle \psi(x_1,0)\psi^\dagger(x_2,t)\rangle _{\pm,T}. We derive the Fredholm determinant formulae for the correlation functions, by means of the Bethe Ansatz. For the special case x_1=0, we express correlation functions with Neumann boundary conditions \langle\psi(0,0)\psi^\dagger(x_2,t)\rangle _{+,T}, in terms of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations which were introduced in \cite{kojima:Sl} as a generalization of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. We generalize the Fredholm minor determinant formulae of ground state correlation functions \langle\psi(x_1)\psi^\dagger(x_2)\rangle _{\pm,0} in \cite{kojima:K}, to the Fredholm determinant formulae for the time and temperature dependent correlation functions \langle\psi(x_1,0)\psi^\dagger(x_2,t)\rangle _{\pm,T}, t \in {\bf R}, T \geq 0.
