These notes are the second part of a common course on Renormalization Theory given with Professor P. da Veiga at X Jorge Andre Swieca Summer School, Aguas de Lindoia, Brazil, February 7-12, 1999. I emphasize the rigorous non-perturbative or constructive aspects of the theory. The usual formalism for the renormalization group in field theory or statistical mechanics is reviewed, together with its limits. The constructive formalism is introduced step by step. Taylor forest formulas allow to perform easily the cluster and Mayer expansions which are needed for a single step of the renormalization group in the case of Bosonic theories. The iteration of this single step leads to further difficulties whose solution is briefly sketched. The second part of the course is devoted to Fermionic models. These models are easier to treat on the constructive level, so they are very well suited to beginners in constructive theory. It is shown how the Taylor forest formulas allow to reorganize perturbation theory nicely in order to construct the Gross-Neveu2 model without any need for cluster or Mayer expansions. Finally applications of this technique to condensed matter and renormalization group around Fermi surface are briefly reviewed.
