Instead of a linear system of equations for a free electromagnetic field, we propose a nonlinear system of equations. The classical electrodynamics is preseved. The appeared solutions (the electromagnetic fields) having photon properties. The theory posits the vacuum is a physical medium. The most important problems of relativistic interaction of interpenetrating mediums are studied.
