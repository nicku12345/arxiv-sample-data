We study the geometrical background of the Hamiltonian formalism of first-order Classical Field Theories. In particular, different proposals of multimomentum bundles existing in the usual literature (including their canonical structures) are analyzed and compared. The corresponding Legendre maps are introduced. As a consequence, the definition of regular and almost-regular Lagrangian systems is reviewed and extended from different but equivalent ways.
