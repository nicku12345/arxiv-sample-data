We found hermitian realizations of the position vector \vec{r}, the angular momentum \vec{\Lambda} and the linear momentum \vec{p}, all behaving like vectors under the su_q(2) algebra, generated by L_0 and L_\pm. They are used to introduce a q-deformed Schr\" odinger equation. Its solutions for the particular cases of the Coulomb and the harmonic oscillator potentials are given and briefly discussed.
