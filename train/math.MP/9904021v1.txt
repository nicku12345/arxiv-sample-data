An explicit form of the generators of quantum and ordinary semisimple algebras for an arbitrary finite-dimensional representation is found. The generators corresponding to the simple roots are obtained in terms of a solution of a system of matrix equations. The result is presented in the form of N_l\times N_l matrices, where N_l is the dimension of the corresponding representation, determined by the invariant Weyl formula.
