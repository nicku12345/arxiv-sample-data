We describe non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems coming from the Hitchin integrable systems. The Hitchin integrals of motion depend on the W-structures of the basic curve. The parameters of the W-structures play the role of times. In particular, the quadratic integrals dependent on the complex structure (W_2-structure) of the basic curve and times are coordinate on the Teichmuller space. The corresponding flows are the monodromy preserving equations such as the Schlesinger equations, the Painleve VI equation and their generalizations. The equations corresponding to the highest integrals are monodromy preserving conditions with respect to changing of the W_k-structures (k>2). They are derived by the symplectic reduction from the gauge field theory on the basic curve interacting with W_k-gravity. As by product we obtain the classical Ward identities in this theory.
