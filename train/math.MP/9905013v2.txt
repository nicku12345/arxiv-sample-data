We show that the electromagnetic field tensor and the Lorentz Force are both a natural consequence of the geometric structure of Minkowskian space, being related to infinitesimal boosts and rotations in spacetime. The longstanding issue about the apparent empirical origin of the Lorentz Force is clarified.
