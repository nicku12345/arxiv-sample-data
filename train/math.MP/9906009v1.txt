We consider quantum (unitary) continuous time evolution of spins on a lattice together with quantum evolution of the lattice itself. In physics such evolution was discussed in connection with quantum gravity. It is also related to what is called quantum circuits, one of the incarnations of a quantum computer. We consider simpler models for which one can obtain exact mathematical results. We prove existence of the dynamics in both Schroedinger and Heisenberg pictures, construct KMS states on appropriate C*-algebras. We show (for high temperatures) that for each system where the lattice undergoes quantum evolution, there is a natural scaling leading to a quantum spin system on a fixed lattice, defined by a renormalized Hamiltonian.
