We study dynamical properties of random Schr\"odinger operators H^{(\omega)} defined on the Hilbert space \ell^2(\bbZ^d) or L^2(\bbR^d). Building on results from existing multi-scale analyses, we give sufficient conditions on H^{(\omega)} to obtain the vanishing of the diffusion exponent    \sigma_{\rm diff}^+ := \limsup_{T\rightarrow\infty } \frac{\log   \bbE \left(\la\la\vert X   \vert^2\ra\ra_{T,f_I(H^{(\omega)})\psi}\right) }{\log T}=0.  Here \bbE is the expectation over randomness, f_{I} is any smooth characteristic function of a bounded energy-interval I and \psi is a state vector in the domain of H^{(\omega)} with compact spatial support. The quantity \la\la |X|^2 \ra\ra_{T,\varphi} denotes the Cesaro mean up to time T of the second moment of position \la |X|^2\ra_{t,\varphi} at times 0\le t\le T of an initial state vector \varphi. If the Hilbert space is \ell^2(\bbZ^d), the method of proof can be strengthened to yield dynamical localization. Under weaker assumptions, we also prove a theorem on the absence of diffusion. The results are applied to a randomly perturbed periodic Schr\"odinger operator on L^2(\bbR^d), to a simple Anderson-type model on the lattice and to a model with a correlated random potential in continuous space.
