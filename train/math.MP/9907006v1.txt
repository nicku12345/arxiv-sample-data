We study the one-dimensional random dimer model, with Hamiltonian H_\omega=\Delta + V_\omega, where for all x\in\Z, V_\omega(2x)=V_\omega(2x+1) and where the V_\omega(2x) are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables taking the values \pm V, V>0. We show that, for all values of V and with probability one in \omega, the spectrum of H is pure point. If V\leq1 and V\neq 1/\sqrt{2}, the Lyapounov exponent vanishes only at the two critical energies given by E=\pm V. For the particular value V=1/\sqrt{2}, respectively V=\sqrt{2}, we show the existence of additional critical energies at E=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}, resp. E=0. On any compact interval I not containing the critical energies, the eigenfunctions are then shown to be semi-uniformly exponentially localized, and this implies dynamical localization: for all q>0 and for all \psi\in\ell^2(\Z) with sufficiently rapid decrease:    \sup_t r^{(q)}_{\psi,I}(t) \equiv \sup_t < P_I(H_\omega)\psi_t, |X|^q P_I(H_\omega)\psi_t > <\infty.    Here \psi_t=e^{-iH_\omega t} \psi, and P_I(H_\omega) is the spectral projector of H_\omega onto the interval I. In particular if V>1 and V\neq \sqrt{2}, these results hold on the entire spectrum (so that one can take I=\sigma(H_\omega)).
