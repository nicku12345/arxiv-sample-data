Two results on palindromicity of bi-infinite words in a finite alphabet are presented. The first is a simple, but efficient criterion to exclude palindromicity of minimal sequences and applies, in particular, to the Rudin-Shapiro sequence. The second provides a constructive method to build palindromic minimal sequences based upon regular, generic model sets with centro-symmetric window. These give rise to diagonal tight-binding models in one dimension with purely singular continuous spectrum.
