The determinant for complex matrices cannot be extended to quaternionic matrices. Instead, the Study determinant and the closely related q-determinant are widely used. We show that the Study determinant can be characterized as the unique functional which extends the {\em absolute value} of the complex determinant and discuss its spectral and linear algebraic aspects.
