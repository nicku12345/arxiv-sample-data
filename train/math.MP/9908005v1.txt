In this work, we consider the algebra M_{N}(C) of N\times N matrices as a cyclic quantum plane. We also analyze the coaction of the quantum group {\cal F} and the action of its dual quantum algebra {\cal H} on it. Then, we study the decomposition of M_{N}(C) in terms of the quantum algebra representations. Finally, we develop the differential algebra of the cyclic group Z_{N} with d^{N}=0, and treat the particular case N=3.
