The Clifford action on superspaces is analyzed with a view on generalized Dirac fields taking values in some Clifford supermodule. the stress is here on two principles: complexification and polarisation. For applications in field theory, the underlying vector space may carry either a Euclidean or a Minkowskian structure.
