The basic concepts of factorizable problems in one-dimensional Quantum Mechanics, as well as the theory of Shape Invariant potentials are reviewed. The relation of this last theory with a generalization of the classical Factorization Method presented by Infeld and Hull is analyzed in detail. By the use of some properties of the Riccati equation the solutions of Infeld and Hull are greatly generalized in a simple way.
