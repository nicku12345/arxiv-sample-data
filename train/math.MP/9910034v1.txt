For a charged quantum particle in the Euclidean plane subject to a perpendicular constant magnetic field and repulsive impurities, randomly distributed according to Poisson's law, we determine the leading low-energy fall-off of the integrated density of states in case the single-impurity potential has either super-Gaussian or regular sub-Gaussian long-distance decay. The forms of the resulting so-called magnetic Lifshits tails reflect the great variety of these decays. On the whole, we summarize, unify, and generalize results in previous works of K. Broderix, L. Erd\H{o}s, D.\ Hundertmark, W. Kirsch, and ourselves.
