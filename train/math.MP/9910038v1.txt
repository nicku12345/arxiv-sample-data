The main result of this paper is the evidence of an explicit linearization of dynamical systems of Ruijsenaars-Schneider type and of the perturbations introduced by F. Calogero of these systems with all orbits periodic of same period. Several other systems share the existence of this explicit linearization, among them, the Calogero-Moser system (with and without external potential) and the Calogero-Sutherland system. This explicit linearization is compared with the notion of maximal superintegrability which has been discussed in several articles.
