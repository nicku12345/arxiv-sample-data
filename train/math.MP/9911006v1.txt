Motivated by the supersymmetric version of Dirac's theory, chiral models in field theory, and the quest of a geometric fundament for the Standard Model, we describe an approach to the differential geometry of vector bundles on (semi)-Riemannian manifolds based on the concepts of superspaces, superalgebras, superconnections, and generalized Dirac operators. In doing so we stay within the realm of commutative geometry.
