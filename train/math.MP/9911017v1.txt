In this paper we provide a quantitative comparison of two obstructions for a given symmetric operator S with dense domain in Hilbert space {\cal H} to be selfadjoint. The first one is the pair of deficiency spaces of von Neumann, and the second one is of more recent vintage: Let P be a projection in {\cal H}. We say that it is smooth relative to S if its range is contained in the domain of S. We say that smooth projections \{P_i \}_{i=1}^{\infty} diagonalize S if (a) (I-P_{i})SP_i=0 for all i, and (b) \sup_{i}P_{i}=I. If such projections exist, then S has a selfadjoint closure (i.e., \bar{S} has a spectral resolution), and so our second obstruction to selfadjointness is defined from smooth projections P_i with (I-P_i)SP_i \neq 0. We prove results both in the case of a single operator S and a system of operators.
