Let E(B,Z,N) denote the ground state energy of an atom with N electrons and nuclear charge Z in a homogeneous magnetic field B. We study the asymptotics of E(B,Z,N) as B\to \infty with N and Z fixed but arbitrary. It is shown that the leading term has the form (\ln B)^2 e(Z,N), where e(Z,N) is the ground state energy of a system of N {\em bosons} with delta interactions in {\em one} dimension. This extends and refines previously known results for N=1 on the one hand, and N,Z\to\infty with B/Z^3\to\infty on the other hand.
