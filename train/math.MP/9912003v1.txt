In a recent article we have discussed the connections between averages of powers of Riemann's \zeta-function on the critical line, and averages of characteristic polynomials of random matrices. The result for random matrices was shown to be universal, i.e. independent of the specific probability distribution, and the results were derived for arbitrary moments. This allows one to extend the previous results to logarithmic moments, for which we derive the explicit universal expressions in random matrix theory. We then compare these results to various results and conjectures for \zeta-functions, and the correspondence is again striking.
