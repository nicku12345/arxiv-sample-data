The Ginzburg--Landau (GL) equations of superconductivity provide a computational model for the study of magnetic flux vortices in type-II superconductors. In this article we show through numerical examples and rigorous mathematical analysis that the GL model reduces to the frozen-field model when the charge of the Cooper pairs (the superconducting charge carriers) goes to zero while the applied field stays near the upper critical field.
