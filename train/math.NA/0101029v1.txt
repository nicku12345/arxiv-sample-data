Mean values of some observables describing quantum interaction between the Bose field in a cavity and a movable mirror can be represented as expectations of rapidly oscillating functions w.r.t. the Poisson measure with a large mean value (N\approx 10^{23}) corresponding to the average number of photons in laser beam. Straightforward summation of the series is impossible because over 2\sqrt N summands make a significant contribution. We derive an analytical expression approximating this sum with the error O(N^{-1}).
