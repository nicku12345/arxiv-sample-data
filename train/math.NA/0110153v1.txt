I introduce an innovative methodology for deriving numerical models of systems of partial differential equations which exhibit the evolution of spatial patterns. The new approach directly produces a discretisation for the evolution of the pattern amplitude, has the rigorous support of centre manifold theory at finite grid size h, and naturally incorporates physical boundaries. The results presented here for the Swift-Hohenberg equation suggest the approach will form a powerful method in computationally exploring pattern selection in general. With the aid of computer algebra, the techniques may be applied to a wide variety of equations to derive numerical models that accurately and stably capture the dynamics including the influence of possibly forced boundaries.
