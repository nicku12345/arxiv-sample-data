A floating hemisphere under forced harmonic oscillation at very high and very low frequencies is considered. The problem is reduced to an elliptic one, that is, the Laplace operator in the exterior domain with standard Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, so the flow problem is simplified to standard ones, with well known analytic solutions in some cases. The general procedure is based in the use of spherical harmonics and its derivation is based on a physics insight. The results can be used to test the accuracy achieved by numerical codes as, for example, by finite elements or boundary elements.
