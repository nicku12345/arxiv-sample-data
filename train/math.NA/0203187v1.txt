A neutral fixed point of a real iteration map u becomes a super attracting fixed point using a suitable double newtonisation. The map u is so transformed into a map w which is here called the standard accelerator of u. The map w provides a unifying process to deal with a large set of fixed point sequences which are not convergent or converge slowly. Several examples illustrate the main results obtained.
