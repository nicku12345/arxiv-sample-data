The existing methods to obtain an exact-fit polynomial does not give the resulting polynomial in its standard form, and further manipulations are needed to obtain that. The new method presented here gives the coefficients of the polynomial in the standard form directly. It is also possible to obtain the exact-fit exponential using a similar method. Part I of the Document explains the method to find the Exact-Fit Polynomial and Part II explains the method to obtain an Exact-Fit Exponential.
