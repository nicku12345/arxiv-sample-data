The purpose of this paper is to present an algorithm for evaluating Hankel transform of the null and the first kind. The result is the exact analytical representation as the series of the Bessel and Struve functions multiplied by the wavelet coefficients of the input function. Numerical evaluation of the test function with known analytical Hankel transform illustrates the proposed algorithm.
