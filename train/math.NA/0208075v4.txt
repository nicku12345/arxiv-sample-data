We present explicit inverses of two Brownian--type matrices, which are defined as Hadamard products of certain already known matrices. The matrices under consideration are defined by 3n-1 parameters and their lower Hessenberg form inverses are expressed analytically in terms of these parameters. Such matrices are useful in the theory of digital signal processing and in testing matrix inversion algorithms.
