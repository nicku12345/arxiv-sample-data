Many problems in physics, material sciences, chemistry and biology can be abstractly formulated as a system that navigates over a complex energy landscape of high or infinite dimensions. Well-known examples include phase transitions of condensed matter, conformational changes of biopolymers, and chemical reactions. The energy landscape typically exhibits multiscale features, giving rise to the multiscale nature of the dynamics. This is one of the main challenges that we face in computational science. In this report, we will review the recent work done by scientists from several disciplines on probing such energy landscapes. Of particular interest is the analysis and computation of transition pathways and transition rates between metastable states. We will then present the string method that has proven to be very effective for some truly complex systems in material science and chemistry.
