Many materials such as martensitic or ferromagnetic crystals are observed to be in metastable states exhibiting a fine-scale, structured spatial oscillation called microstructure; and hysteresis is observed as the temperature, boundary forces, or external magnetic field changes. We have developed a numerical analysis of microstructure and used this theory to construct numerical methods that have been used to compute approximations to the deformation of crystals with microstructure.
