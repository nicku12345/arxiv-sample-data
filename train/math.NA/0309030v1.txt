This article discusses computational techniques for simulating natural convection in three-dimensional domains using finite element methods with tetrahedral elements. These techniques form a new numerical procedure for this kind of problems. In this procedure, the treatment of advection by a wave equation approach is extended to three-dimensional unstructured meshes with tetrahedra.   Numerical results of natural convection of an incompressible Newtonian fluid in a cubical enclosure at Rayleigh numbers in the range 10^3 to 10 ^6 are obtained and they are in good agreement with those in literature obtained by other methods.
