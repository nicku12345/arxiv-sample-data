Dual scattering channel schemes extend the transmission line matrix numerical method (JOHNS' TLM algorithm) in two directions. For one point, transmission line links are replaced by abstract scattering channels in terms of paired distributions (characteristic impedances are thus neither needed, nor in general defined, e.g.). In the second place, non-trivial cell interface scattering is admitted during the connection cycle. Both extensions open a wide field of application beyond the range of classical time domain schemes, such as YEE's FDTD method and TLM. A DSC heat propagation [diffusion] scheme in non-orthogonal mesh, wherein heat sources are coupled to a lossy Maxwell field, illustrates the approach.
