The numerical solution of strain gradient-dependent continuum problems has been dogged by continuity demands on the basis functions. For most commonly accepted models, solutions using the finite element method demand C^{1} continuity of the shape functions. Here, recent development in discontinuous Galerkin methods are explored and exploited for the solution of a prototype nonlinear strain gradient dependent continuum model. A formulation is developed that allows the rigorous solution of a strain gradient damage model using standard C^{0} shape functions. The formulation is tested in one-dimension for the simplest possible finite element formulation: piecewise linear displacement and constant (on elements) internal variable. Numerical results are shown to compare excellently with a benchmark solution. The results are remarkable given the simplicity of the proposed formulation.
