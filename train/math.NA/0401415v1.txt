For a family of weight functions that include the general Jacobi weight functions as special cases, exact condition for the convergence of the Fourier orthogonal series in the weighted L^p space is given. The result is then used to establish a Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund type inequality and to study weighted mean convergence of various interpolating polynomials based on the zeros of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials.
