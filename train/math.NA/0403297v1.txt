In many applications, and in particular in seismology, realistic propagation media disperse and attenuate waves. This dissipative behavior can be taken into account by using a viscoacoustic propagation model, which incorporates a complex and frequency-dependent viscoacoustic modulus in the constitutive relation. The main difficulty then lies in finding an efficient way to discretize the constitutive equation as it becomes a convolution integral in the time domain. To overcome this difficulty the usual approach consists in approximating the viscoacoustic modulus by a low-order rational function of frequency. We use here such an approximation and show how it can be incorporated in the velocity-pressure formulation for viscoacoustic waves. This formulation is coupled with the fictitious domain method which permit us to model efficiently diffraction by objects of complicated geometry and with the Perfectly Matched Layer Model which allows us to model wave propagation in unbounded domains. The space discretization of the problem is based on a mixed finite element method and for the discretization in time a 2nd order centered finite difference scheme is employed. Several numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the method.
