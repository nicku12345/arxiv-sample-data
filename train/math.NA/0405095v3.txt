Dual scattering channel (DSC) schemes generalize Johns' TLM algorithm in replacing transmission lines with abstract scattering channels in terms of paired distributions. A well known merit of TLM schemes is unconditional stability, a property that is commonly drawn upon the passivity of linear transmission line networks. So the question arises, if DSC algorithms remain stable in a neat sense. It is shown that a large class of alpha-passive processes are in fact unconditionally stable. The analysis applies to TLM and DSC schemes alike and includes non-linear situations.
