It is known that Goertzel's algorithm is much less numerically accurate than the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)(Cf. \cite{gen:69}). In order to improve accuracy we propose modifications of both Goertzel's and Horner's algorithms based on the divide-and-conquer techniques. The proof of the numerical stability of these two modified algorithms is given. The numerical tests in Matlab demonstrate the computational advantages of the proposed modifications. The appendix contains the proof of numerical stability of Goertzel's algorithm of polynomial evaluation.
