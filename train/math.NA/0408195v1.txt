An optimal algorithm is described for solving the deconvolution problem of the form {\bf k}u:=\int_0^tk(t-s)u(s)ds=f(t) given the noisy data f_\delta, ||f-f_\delta||\leq \delta. The idea of the method consists of the representation {\bf k}=A(I+S), where S is a compact operator, I+S is injective, I is the identity operator, A is not boundedly invertible, and an optimal regularizer is constructed for A. The optimal regularizer is constructed using the results of the paper MR 40#5130.
