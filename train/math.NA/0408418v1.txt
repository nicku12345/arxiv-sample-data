In a 1973 paper Carl de Boor conjectured and 26 years later in 1999 Alexei Shadrin proved in full generality that the L_\infty-norm of the spline orthoprojector is bounded independently of the knot sequence for every order of the spline space. Following the appearance of Shadrin's proof, it was only very natural to carry the study of L_\infty-boundedness of the orthoprojector over to L-splines. This is a modest attempt in the direction.   We consider orthoprojectors on spaces of L-splines generated by certain second-order linear differential operators with constant coefficients. We concern ourselves with whether the L_2-norms of the resulting orthoprojectors are bounded independenly of the knot sequence.   For exponential splines generated by the operator L=D^2-\alpha^2 we find the exact mesh-independent bound, which proves to be the same as in the corresponding polynomial case of linear splines, that is 3. For exponential splines generated by the operator L=(D-\alpha^2)(D+\beta^2) we prove mesh-independent boundedness without finding an explicit bound.   For trigonometric splines generated by the operator L=D^2+\alpha^2 with standard constraints on the partition diameter we find a mesh-independent bound. We also consider a model example which shows that the above constraints are not necessary for mesh-independent boundedness to hold - due to an interesting "interference" phenomenon, the L_2-approximant remains bounded while both its coefficients and the norms of LB-splines tend to infinity.
