Roughly speaking, a near-best (abbr. NB) quasi-interpolant (abbr. QI) is an approximation operator of the form Q_af=\sum_{\alpha\in A} \Lambda_\alpha (f) B_\alpha where the B_\alpha's are B-splines and the \Lambda_\alpha (f)'s are linear discrete or integral forms acting on the given function f. These forms depend on a finite number of coefficients which are the components of vectors a_\alpha for \alpha\in A. The index a refers to this sequence of vectors. In order that Q_a p=p for all polynomials p belonging to some subspace included in the space of splines generated by the B_\alpha's, each vector a_\alpha must lie in an affine subspace V_\alpha, i.e. satisfy some linear constraints. However there remain some degrees of freedom which are used to minimize \Vert a_\alpha \Vert_1 for each \alpha\in A. It is easy to prove that \max \{\Vert a_\alpha \Vert_1 ; \alpha\in A\} is an upper bound of \Vert Q_a \Vert_{\infty}: thus, instead of minimizing the infinite norm of Q_a, which is a difficult problem, we minimize an upper bound of this norm, which is much easier to do. Moreover, the latter problem has always at least one solution, which is associated with a NB QI. In the first part of the paper, we give a survey on NB univariate or bivariate spline QIs defined on uniform or non-uniform partitions and already studied by the author and coworkers. In the second part, we give some new results, mainly on univariate and bivariate integral QIs on {\sl non-uniform} partitions: in that case, NB QIs are more difficult to characterize and the optimal properties strongly depend on the geometry of the partition. Therefore we have restricted our study to QIs having interesting shape properties and/or infinite norms uniformly bounded independently of the partition.
