We present several new quadrature formulas in the triangle for exact integration of polynomials. The points were computed numerically with a cardinal function algorithm which imposes that the number of quadrature points N be equal to the dimension of a lower dimensional polynomial space. Quadrature forumulas are presented for up to degree d=25, all which have positive weights and contain no points outside the triangle. Seven of these quadrature formulas improve on previously known results.
