Laplace transforms which admit a holomorphic extension to some sector strictly containing the right half plane and exhibiting a potential behavior are considered. A spectral order, parallelizable method for their numerical inversion is proposed. The method takes into account the available information about the errors arising in the evaluations. Several numerical illustrations are provided.
