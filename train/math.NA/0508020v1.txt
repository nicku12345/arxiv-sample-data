In Evans function computations of the spectra of asymptotically constant-coefficient linear operators, a basic issue is the efficient and numerically stable computation of subspaces evolving according to the associated eigenvalue ODE. For small systems, a fast, shooting algorithm may be obtained by representing subspaces as single exterior products \cite{AS,Br.1,Br.2,BrZ,BDG}. For large systems, however, the dimension of the exterior-product space quickly becomes prohibitive, growing as \binom{n}{k}, where n is the dimension of the system written as a first-order ODE and k (typically \sim n/2) is the dimension of the subspace. We resolve this difficulty by the introduction of a simple polar coordinate algorithm representing ``pure'' (monomial) products as scalar multiples of orthonormal bases, for which the angular equation is a numerically optimized version of the continuous orthogonalization method of Drury--Davey \cite{Da,Dr} and the radial equation is evaluable by quadrature. Notably, the polar-coordinate method preserves the important property of analyticity with respect to parameters.
