A fast method for the computation of layer potentials that arise in acoustic scattering is introduced. The principal idea is to split the singular kernel into a smooth and a local part. The potential due to the smooth part is computed efficiently using non-equispaced FFTs, the potential due to the local part is expanded as a series in the mollification parameter. The complexity of the approach is shown to be O(n + \kappa^3 \log \kappa), where n is the number of degrees of freedom in the discretization and \kappa is the wave number. The constant factor in this asymptotic estimate is small since no singular surface integrals must be computed. Therefore the method is particularly efficient for medium-sized scatterers (50-100 wavelengths) that may have complicated geometry
