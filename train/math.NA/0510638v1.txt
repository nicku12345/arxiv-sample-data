The problem of image reconstruction in thermoacoustic tomography requires inversion of a generalized Radon transform, which integrates the unknown function over circles in 2D or spheres in 3D. The paper investigates implementation of the recently discovered backprojection type inversion formulas for the case of spherical acquisition in 3D. A numerical simulation of the data acquisition with subsequent reconstructions are made for the Defrise phantom as well as for some other phantoms. Both full and partial scan situations are considered. The results are compared with the implementation of a previously used approximate inversion formula.
