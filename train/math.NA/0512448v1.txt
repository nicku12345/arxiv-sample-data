The approach to curve implicitization through Sylvester and Bezout resultant matrices and bivariate interpolation in the usual power basis is extended to the case of Bernstein-Bezoutian matrices constructed when the polynomials are given in the Bernstein basis. The coefficients of the implicit equation are also computed in the bivariate tensor-product Bernstein basis, and their computation involves the bidiagonal factorization of the inverses of certain totally positive matrices.
