A nonstandard application of bivariate polynomial interpolation is discussed: the implicitization of a rational algebraic curve given by its parametric equations. Three different approaches using the same interpolation space are considered, and their respective computational complexities are analyzed. Although the techniques employed are usually asociated to numerical analysis, in this case all the computations are carried out using exact rational arithmetic. The power of the Kronecker product of matrices in this application is stressed.
