In the field of radial basis functions mathematicians have been endeavouring to find infinitely differentiable and compactly supported radial functions. This kind of functions is extremely important. One of the reasons is that its error bound will converge very fast. However there is hitherto no such function which can be expressed in a simple form. This is a famous question. The purpose of this paper is to answer this question.
