Radial function interpolation of scattered data is a frequently used method for multivariate data fitting. One of the most frequently used radial functions is called shifted surface spline, introduced by Dyn, Levin and Rippa in \cite{Dy1} for R^{2}. Then it's extended to R^{n} for n\geq 1. Many articles have studied its properties, as can be seen in \cite{Bu,Du,Dy2,Po,Ri,Yo1,Yo2,Yo3,Yo4}. When dealing with this function, the most commonly used error bounds are the one raised by Wu and Schaback in \cite{WS}, and the one raised by Madych and Nelson in \cite{MN2}. Both are O(d^{l}) as d\to 0, where l is a positive integer and d is the fill-distance. In this paper we present an improved error bound which is O(\omega^{1/d}) as d\to 0, where 0<\omega <1 is a constant which can be accurately calculated.
