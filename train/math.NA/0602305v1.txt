The univariate spline quasi-interpolants (abbr. QIs) studied in this paper are approximation operators using B-spline expansions with coefficients which are linear combinations of discrete or weighted mean values of the function to be approximated. When working with nonuniform partitions, the main challenge is to find QIs which have both good approximation orders and uniform norms which are bounded independently of the given partition. Near-best QIs are obtained by minimizing an upper bound of the infinity norm of QIs depending on a certain number of free parameters, thus reducing this norm. This paper is devoted to the study of two families of near-best QIs of approximation order 3.
