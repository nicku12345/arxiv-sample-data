Given a non-uniform criss-cross partition of a rectangular domain \Omega, we analyse the error between a function f defined on \Omega and two types of C^1-quadratic spline quasi-interpolants (QIs) obtained as linear combinations of B-splines with discrete functionals as coefficients. The main novelties are the facts that supports of B-splines are contained in \Omega and that data sites also lie inside or on the boundary of \Omega. Moreover, the infinity norms of these QIs are small and do not depend on the triangulation: as the two QIs are exact on quadratic polynomials, they give the optimal approximation order for smooth functions. Our analysis is done for f and its partial derivatives of the first and second orders and a particular effort has been made in order to give the best possible error bounds in terms of the smoothness of f and of the mesh ratios of the triangulation.
