We consider weakly damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations perturbed by a noise of small amplitude. The small noise is either complex and of additive type or real and of multiplicative type. It is white in time and colored in space. Zero is an asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the deterministic equations. We study the exit from a neighborhood of zero, invariant by the flow of the deterministic equation, in \xLtwo or in \xHone. Due to noise, large fluctuations off zero occur. Thus, on a sufficiently large time scale, exit from these domains of attraction occur. A formal characterization of the small noise asymptotic of both the first exit times and the exit points is given.
