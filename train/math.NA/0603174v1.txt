A many to one discrete auditory transform is presented to map a sound signal to a perceptually meaningful spectrum on the scale of human auditory filter band widths (critical bands). A generalized inverse is constructed in closed analytical form, preserving the band energy and band signal to noise ratio of the input sound signal. The forward and inverse transforms can be implemented in real time. Experiments on speech and music segments show that the inversion gives a perceptually equivalent though mathematically different sound from the input.
