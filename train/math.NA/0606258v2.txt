An error analysis result is given for classical Gram--Schmidt factorization of a full rank matrix A into A=QR where Q is left orthogonal (has orthonormal columns) and R is upper triangular. The work presented here shows that the computed R satisfies \normal{R}=\normal{A}+E where E is an appropriately small backward error, but only if the diagonals of R are computed in a manner similar to Cholesky factorization of the normal equations matrix.   A similar result is stated in [Giraud at al, Numer. Math. 101(1):87--100,2005]. However, for that result to hold, the diagonals of R must be computed in the manner recommended in this work.
