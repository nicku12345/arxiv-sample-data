Differential equations arising in fluid mechanics are usually derived from the intrinsic properties of mechanical systems, in the form of conservation laws, and bear symmetries, which are not generally preserved by a finite difference approximation, and leading to inaccurate numerical results. This paper proposes a method that enables us to build a scheme that preserves some of those symmetries.
