We propose an adaptive approach in picking the wave-number parameter of absorbing boundary conditions for Schr\"{o}dinger-type equations. Based on the Gabor transform which captures local frequency information in the vicinity of artificial boundaries, the parameter is determined by an energy-weighted method and yields a quasi-optimal absorbing boundary conditions. It is shown that this approach can minimize reflected waves even when the wave function is composed of waves with different group velocities. We also extend the split local absorbing boundary (SLAB) method [Z. Xu and H. Han, {\it Phys. Rev. E}, 74(2006), pp. 037704] to problems in multidimensional nonlinear cases by coupling the adaptive approach. Numerical examples of nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations in one- and two dimensions are presented to demonstrate the properties of the discussed absorbing boundary conditions.
