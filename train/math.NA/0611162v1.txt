In the 1990's exponential-type error bounds appeared in the theory of radial basis functions. This kind of error bounds is very powerful. However it only measures the difference between the approximant and approximand. Mathematicians and engineers often need to know the matching of the derivatives when dealing with partial differential equations. In this paper we extend this kind of error bounds to a form which measures the difference between the derivatives of the approximant and approximand.
