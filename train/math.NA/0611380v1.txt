We compare the performances of symplectic and non-symplectic integrators for the computation of normal geodesics and conjugate points in sub-Riemannian geometry at the example of the Martinet case. For this case study we consider first the flat metric, and then a one parameter perturbation leading to non integrable geodesics. From our computations we deduce that near the abnormal directions a symplectic method is much more efficient for this optimal control problem. The explanation relies on the theory of backward error analysis in geometric numerical integration.
