The Evans function is a tool for assessing the stability of travelling wave solutions for partial differential equations. A recent paper (math.NA/0605581) analyzes the order reduction experienced when evaluating the Evans function numerically. The details of some lengthy calculations were excluded from that paper for clarity. The purpose of this technical report is to make these details publicly available. The report is not intended to be read on its own; the reader is referred to math.NA/0605581 for background and references.
