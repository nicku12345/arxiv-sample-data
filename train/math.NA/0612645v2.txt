The problem of finding the correct asymptotic rate of approximation by polynomial loops in dependence of the smoothness of the elements of a loop group seems not well-understood in general. For matrix Lie groups such as SU(N), it can be viewed as a problem of nonlinearly constrained trigonometric approximation. Motivated by applications to optical FIR filter design and control, we present some initial results for the case of SU(N)-loops, N>1. In particular, using representations via the exponential map and ideas from splitting methods, we prove that the best approximation of an SU(N)-loop belonging to a Hoelder-Zygmund class Lip_alpha with alpha>1/2 by a polynomial SU(N)-loop of degree n is of the order O(n^{-\alpha/(1+\alpha)}) as n tends to infinity. Although this approximation rate is not considered final (and can be improved in special cases), to our knowledge it is the first general, nontrivial result of this type.
