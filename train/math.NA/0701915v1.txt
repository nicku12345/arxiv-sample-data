We introduce a non-overlapping variant of the Schwarz waveform relaxation algorithm for semilinear wave propagation in one dimension. Using the theory of absorbing boundary conditions, we derive a new nonlinear algorithm. We show that the algorithm is well-posed and we prove its convergence by energy estimates and a Galerkin method. We then introduce an explicit scheme. We prove the convergence of the discrete algorithm with suitable assumptions on the nonlinearity. We finally illustrate our analysis with numerical experiments.
