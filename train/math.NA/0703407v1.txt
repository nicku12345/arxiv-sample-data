The Diffusion Monte Carlo method is devoted to the computation of electronic ground-state energies of molecules. In this paper, we focus on implementations of this method which consist in exploring the configuration space with a {\bf fixed} number of random walkers evolving according to a Stochastic Differential Equation discretized in time. We allow stochastic reconfigurations of the walkers to reduce the discrepancy between the weights that they carry. On a simple one-dimensional example, we prove the convergence of the method for a fixed number of reconfigurations when the number of walkers tends to +\infty while the timestep tends to 0. We confirm our theoretical rates of convergence by numerical experiments. Various resampling algorithms are investigated, both theoretically and numerically
