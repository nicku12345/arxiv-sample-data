The paper analyzes a two-grid and a multigrid method for matrices belonging to the DCT-III algebra and generated by a polynomial symbol. The aim is to prove that the convergence rate of the considered multigrid method (V-cycle) is constant independent of the size of the given matrix. Numerical examples from differential and integral equations are considered to illustrate the claimed convergence properties.
