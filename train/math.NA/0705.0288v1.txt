We design and analyze a new non-conforming domain decomposition method based on Schwarz type approaches that allows for the use of Robin interface conditions on non-conforming grids. The method is proven to be well posed, and the iterative solver to converge. The error analysis is performed in 2D piecewise polynomials of low and high order and extended in 3D for P_1 elements. Numerical results in 2D illustrate the new method.
