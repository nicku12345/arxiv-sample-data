This article deals with a viscoplastic material model of overstress type. The model is based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic and inelastic part. An additional multiplicative decomposition of inelastic part is used to describe a nonlinear kinematic hardening of Armstrong-Frederick type.   Two implicit time-stepping methods are adopted for numerical integration of evolution equations, such that the plastic incompressibility constraint is exactly satisfied. The first method is based on the tensor exponential. The second method is a modified Euler-Backward method. Special numerical tests show that both approaches yield similar results even for finite inelastic increments.   The basic features of the material response, predicted by the material model, are illustrated with a series of numerical simulations.
