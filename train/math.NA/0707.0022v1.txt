Euler-Lagrange equations and variational integrators are developed for Lagrangian mechanical systems evolving on a product of two-spheres. The geometric structure of a product of two-spheres is carefully considered in order to obtain global equations of motion. Both continuous equations of motion and variational integrators completely avoid the singularities and complexities introduced by local parameterizations or explicit constraints. We derive global expressions for the Euler-Lagrange equations on two-spheres which are more compact than existing equations written in terms of angles. Since the variational integrators are derived from Hamilton's principle, they preserve the geometric features of the dynamics such as symplecticity, momentum maps, or total energy, as well as the structure of the configuration manifold. Computational properties of the variational integrators are illustrated for several mechanical systems.
