This paper is devoted to the analysis of a numerical scheme for the coagulation and fragmentation equation with diffusion in space. A finite volume scheme is developed, based on a conservative formulation of the space nonhomogeneous coagulation-fragmentation model, it is shown that the scheme preserves positivity, total volume and global steady states. Finally, several numerical simulations are performed to investigate the long time behavior of the solution.
