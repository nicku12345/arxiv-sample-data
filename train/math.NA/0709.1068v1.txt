In this paper we study some iterative methods for simultaneous approximation of polynomial zeros. We give new semilocal convergence theorems with error bounds for Ehrlich's and Nourein's iterations. Our theorems generalize and improve recent results of Zheng and Huang [J. Comput. Math. 18 (2000), 113--122], Petkovi\'c and Herceg [J. Comput. Appl. Math. 136 (2001), 283--307] and Nedi\'c [Novi Sad J. Math. 31 (2001), 103--111]. We also present a new sufficient condition for simple zeros of a polynomial.
