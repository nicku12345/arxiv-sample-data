Motivated by the difficulty to solve numerically the weakly compressible 1D isentropic Euler equations with classical methods, we develop in this paper a two scale numerical method on this model. This method is based on two scale convergence theory developped by N'Guetseng and Allaire, and finite volume scheme. Furthermore, we do some numerical simulations in order to verify that the two-scale numerical method is more and more accurate when the Mach number diminishes.
