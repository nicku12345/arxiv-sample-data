The Euclidean algorithm makes possible a simple but powerful generalization of Taylor's theorem. Instead of expanding a function in a series around a single point, one spreads out the spectrum to include any number of points with given multiplicities. Taken together with a simple expression for the remainder, this theorem becomes a powerful tool for approximation and interpolation in numerical analysis. We also have a corresponding theorem for rational approximation.
