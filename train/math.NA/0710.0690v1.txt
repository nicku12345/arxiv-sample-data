This paper addresses the deconvolution of an image that has been obtained by superimposing many copies of an underlying unknown image of interest. The superposition is assumed to not be exact due to noise, and is described using an error distribution in position, orientation, or both. We assume that a good estimate of the error distribution is known. The most natural approach to take for the purely translational case is to apply the Fourier transform and use the classical convolution theorem together with a Weiner filter to invert. In the case of purely rotational deblurring, the similar Fourier analysis is applied. That is, for an blurred image function defined on polar coordinates, the Fourier series and the convolution theorem for the series can be applied. In the case of combinations of translational and rotational errors, the motion-group Fourier transform is used. In addition, for the three cases we present the alternative method using Hermite and Laguerre-Fourier expansion, which has a special property in Fourier transform. The problem that is solved here is motivated by one of the steps in the cryo-electron-tomographic reconstruction of biomolecular complexes such as viruses and ion channels.
