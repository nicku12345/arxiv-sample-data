In this paper we study the approximation of the distribution of X_t Hilbert--valued stochastic process solution of a linear parabolic stochastic partial differential equation written in an abstract form as  dX_t+AX_t dt = Q^{1/2} d W_t, \quad X_0=x \in H, \quad t\in[0,T],  driven by a Gaussian space time noise whose covariance operator Q is given. We assume that A^{-\alpha} is a finite trace operator for some \alpha>0 and that Q is bounded from H into D(A^\beta) for some \beta\geq 0. It is not required to be nuclear or to commute with A. The discretization is achieved thanks to finite element methods in space (parameter h>0) and implicit Euler schemes in time (parameter \Delta t=T/N). We define a discrete solution X^n_h and for suitable functions \phi defined on H, we show that  |\E \phi(X^N_h) - \E \phi(X_T) | = O(h^{2\gamma} + \Delta t^\gamma)  \noindent where \gamma<1- \alpha + \beta. Let us note that as in the finite dimensional case the rate of convergence is twice the one for pathwise approximations.
