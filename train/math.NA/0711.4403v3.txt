Based on a regularized Volterra equation, two different approaches for numerical differentiation are considered. The first approach consists of solving a regularized Volterra equation while the second approach is based on solving a disretized version of the regularized Volterra equation. Numerical experiments show that these methods are efficient and compete favorably with the variational regularization method for stable calculating the derivatives of noisy functions.
