The variational free-Lagrange (VFL) method for shallow water is a free-Lagrange method with the additional property that it preserves the variational structure of shallow water. The VFL method was first derived in this context by \cite{AUG84} who discretized Hamilton's action principle with a free-Lagrange data structure. The purpose of this article is to assess the long-time conservation properties of the VFL method for regularized shallow water which are useful for climate simulation. Long-time regularized shallow water simulations show that the VFL method exhibits no secular drift in the (i) energy error through the application of symplectic integrators; and (ii) the potential vorticity error through the construction of discrete curl, divergence and gradient operators which satisfy semi-discrete divergence and potential vorticity conservation laws. These diagnostic semi-discrete equations augment the description of the VFL method by characterizing the evolution of its respective irrotational and solenoidal components in the Lagrangian frame. Like the continuum equations, the former exhibits a \text{div}^2\mathbf{U} term which indicates that the flow has a very strong tendency towards a purely rotational state.   Numerical results show (i) the preservation of shape and strength of an initially radially symmetric vortex pair in purely rotational regularized shallow water and (ii) how the Voronoi diagram retains the history of the flow field and (iii) that energy is conserved to \mathcal{O}(\Delta^2) and potential vorticity error to within 5% with no secular growth over a 50 year period.
