This technical report yields detailed calculations of the paper [1] (B. Bid\'egaray-Fesquet, "Stability of FD-TD schemes for Maxwell-Debye and Maxwell-Lorentz equations", Technical report, LMC-IMAG, 2005) which have been however automated since (see http://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Brigitte.Bidegaray/NAUtil/). It deals with the stability analysis of various finite difference schemes for Maxwell--Debye and Maxwell--Lorentz equations. This work gives a systematic and rigorous continuation to Petropoulos previous work [5] (P.G. Petropoulos.,"Stability and phase error analysis of FD-TD in dispersive dielectrics", IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, 42(1):62--69, 1994).
