We propose here a model and a numerical scheme to compute the motion of rigid particles interacting through the lubrication force. In the case of a particle approaching a plane, we propose an algorithm and prove its convergence towards the solutions to the gluey particle model proposed by B. Maury. We propose a multi-particle version of this gluey model which is based on the projection of the velocities onto a set of admissible velocities. Then, we describe a multi-particle algorithm for the simulation of such systems and present numerical results.
