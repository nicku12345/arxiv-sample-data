A parallel implementation of the BDDC method using the frontal solver is employed to solve systems of linear equations from finite element analysis, and incorporated into a standard finite element system for engineering analysis by linear elasticity. Results of computation of stress in a hip replacement are presented. The part is made of titanium and loaded by the weight of human body. The performance of BDDC with added constraints by averages and with added corners is compared.
