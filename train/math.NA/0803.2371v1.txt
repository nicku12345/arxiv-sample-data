A matrix (and any associated linear system) will be referred to as structured if it has a small displacement rank. It is known that the inverse of a structured matrix is structured, which allows fast inversion (or solution), and reduced storage requirements. According to two definitions of displacement structure of practical interest, it is shown here that several types of inverses are also structured, including the Moore-Penrose inverse of rank-deficient matrices.
