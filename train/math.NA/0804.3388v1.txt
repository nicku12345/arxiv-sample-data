An iterative scheme for solving ill-posed nonlinear operator equations with monotone operators is introduced and studied in this paper. A Dynamical Systems Method (DSM) algorithm for stable solution of ill-posed operator equations with monotone operators is proposed and its convergence is proved. A new discrepancy principle is proposed and justified. A priori and a posteriori stopping rules for the DSM algorithm are formulated and justified.
