We prove that if F is twice Frechet differentiable and coercivity conditions hold, then F is surjective, i.e., the equation F(u)=h is solvable for every h\in H. This is a basic result in the theory of monotone operators. Our aim is to give a simple and short proof of this result based on the Dynamical Systems Method (DSM), developed in the monograph A.G. Ramm, Dynamical systems method, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2007.
