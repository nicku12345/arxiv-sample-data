A recent theoretical result on optimized Schwarz algorithms demonstrated at the algebraic level enables the modification of an existing Schwarz procedure to its optimized counterpart. In this work, it is shown how to modify a bilinear FEM based Schwarz preconditioning strategy originally presented in [Fischer, JCP 133:84 1997] to its optimized version. The latter is employed to precondition the pseudo--Laplacian operator arising from the spectral element discretization of the magnetohydrodynamic equations in Elsasser form.
