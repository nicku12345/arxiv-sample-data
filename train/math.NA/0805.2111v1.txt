By using the three-term recurrence equation satisfied by a family of orthogonal polynomials, the Christoffel-Darboux-type bilinear generating function and their asymptotic expressions, we obtain quadrature formulas for integral transforms generated by the classical orthogonal polynomials. These integral transforms, related to the so-called Poisson integrals, correspond to a modified Fourier Transform in the case of the Hermite polynomials, a Bessel Transform in the case of the Laguerre polynomials and to an Appell Transform in the case of the Jacobi polynomials.
