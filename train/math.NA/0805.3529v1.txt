A new algebraic cubature formula of degree 2n+1 for the product Chebyshev measure in the d-cube with \approx n^d/2^{d-1} nodes is established. The new formula is then applied to polynomial hyperinterpolation of degree n in three variables, in which coefficients of the product Chebyshev orthonormal basis are computed by a fast algorithm based on the 3-dimensional FFT. Moreover, integration of the hyperinterpolant provides a new Clenshaw-Curtis type cubature formula in the 3-cube.
