Several cubature formulas on the cubic domains are derived using the discrete Fourier analysis associated with lattice tiling, as developed in \cite{LSX}. The main results consist of a new derivation of the Gaussian type cubature for the product Chebyshev weight functions and associated interpolation polynomials on [-1,1]^2, as well as new results on [-1,1]^3. In particular, compact formulas for the fundamental interpolation polynomials are derived, based on n^3/4 +\CO(n^2) nodes of a cubature formula on [-1,1]^3.
