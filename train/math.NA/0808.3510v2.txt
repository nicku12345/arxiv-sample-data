Fourier reconstruction algorithms significantly outperform conventional back-projection algorithms in terms of computation time. In photoacoustic imaging, these methods require interpolation in the Fourier space domain, which creates artifacts in reconstructed images. We propose a novel reconstruction algorithm that applies the one-dimensional nonuniform fast Fourier transform to photoacoustic imaging. It is shown theoretically and numerically that our algorithm avoids artifacts while preserving the computational effectiveness of Fourier reconstruction.
