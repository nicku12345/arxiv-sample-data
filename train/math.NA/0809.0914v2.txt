The splitting of \e^{h(A+B)} into a single product of \e^{h A} and \e^{hB} results in symplectic integrators when A and B are classical Lie operators. However, at high orders, a single product splitting, with exponentially growing number of operators, is very difficult to derive. This work shows that, if the splitting is generalized to a sum of products, then a simple choice of the basis product reduces the problem to that of extrapolation, with analytically known coefficients and only quadratically growing number of operators. When a multi-product splitting is applied to classical Hamiltonian systems, the resulting algorithm is no longer symplectic but is of the Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om (RKN) type. Multi-product splitting, in conjunction with a special force-reduction process,explains why at orders p=4 and 6, RKN integrators only need p-1 force evaluations.
