In this paper we present algorithms for approximating real band-limited signals by multiple Gaussian Chirps. These algorithms do not rely on matching pursuit ideas. They are hierarchial and, at each stage, the number of terms in a given approximation depends only on the number of positive-valued maxima and negative-valued minima of a signed amplitude function characterizing part of the signal. Like the algorithms used in \cite{gre2} and unlike previous methods, our chirplet approximations require neither a complete dictionary of chirps nor complicated multi-dimensional searches to obtain suitable choices of chirp parameters.
