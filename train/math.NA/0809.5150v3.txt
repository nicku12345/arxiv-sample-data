This paper is devoted to a new approach of the arithmetic of intervals. We present the set of intervals as a normed vector space. We define also a four-dimensional associative algebra whose product gives the product of intervals in any cases. This approach allows to give a notion of divisibility and in some cases an euclidian division. We introduce differential calculus and give some applications.
