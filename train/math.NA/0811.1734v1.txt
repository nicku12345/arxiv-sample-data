We compute the length of geodesics on a Riemannian manifold by regular polynomial interpolation of the global solution of the eikonal equation related to the line element ds^2=g_{ij}dx^idx^j of the manifold. Our algorithm approximates the length functional in arbitrarily strong Sobolev norms. Error estimates are obtained where the geometric information is used. It is pointed out how the algorithm can be used to get accurate approximation of solutions of parabolic partial differential equations leading obvious applications to finance and physics.
