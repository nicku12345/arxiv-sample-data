In this paper in the space L_2^{(m)}(0,1) the problem of construction of optimal quadrature formulas is considered. Here the quadrature sum consists on values of integrand at nodes and values of first derivative of integrand at the end points of integration interval. The optimal coefficients are found and norm of the error functional is calculated for arbitrary fixed N and for any m\geq 2. It is shown that when m=2 and m=3 the Euler-Maclaurin quadrature formula is optimal.
