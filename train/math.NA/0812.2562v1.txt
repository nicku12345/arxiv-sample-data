This paper is devoted to the presentation and the analysis of a new nonlinear subdivision scheme eliminating the Gibbs oscillations close to discontinuities. Its convergence, stability and order of approximation are analyzed. It is proved that this schemes converges towards limit functions of H\"older regularity index larger than 1.192. Numerical estimates provide an H\"older regularity index of 2.438. Up to our knowledge, this scheme is the first one that achieves simultaneously the control of the Gibbs phenomenon and regularity index larger than 1 for its limit functions.
