A generalization of the Vandermonde matrices which arise when the power basis is replaced by the Said-Ball basis is considered. When the nodes are inside the interval (0,1), then those matrices are strictly totally positive. An algorithm for computing the bidiagonal decomposition of those Said-Ball-Vandermonde matrices is presented, which allows to use known algorithms for totally positive matrices represented by their bidiagonal decomposition. The algorithm is shown to be fast and to guarantee high relative accuracy. Some numerical experiments which illustrate the good behaviour of the algorithm are included.
