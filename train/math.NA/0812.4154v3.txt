We derive computable expressions of structured backward errors of approximate eigenelements of *-palindromic and *-anti-palindromic matrix polynomials. We also characterize minimal structured perturbations such that approximate eigenelements are exact eigenelements of the perturbed polynomials. We detect structure preserving linearizations which have almost no adverse effect on the structured backward errors of approximate eigenelements of the *-palindromic and *-anti-palindromic polynomials.
