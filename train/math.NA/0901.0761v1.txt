We consider the first family of \Hcurl-conforming Ned\'el\'ec finite elements on tetrahedral meshes. Spectral approximation (p-version) is achieved by keeping the mesh fixed and raising the polynomial degree p uniformly in all mesh cells. We prove that the associated subspaces of discretely weakly divergence free piecewise polynomial vector fields enjoy a long conjectured discrete compactness property as p\to\infty. This permits us to conclude asymptotic spectral correctness of spectral Galerkin finite element approximations of Maxwell eigenvalue problems.
