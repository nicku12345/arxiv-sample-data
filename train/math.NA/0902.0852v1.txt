This paper presents a parallel algorithm for finding the smallest eigenvalue of a particular form of ill-conditioned Hankel matrix, which requires the use of extremely high precision arithmetic. Surprisingly, we find that commonly-used approaches that are designed for high efficiency are actually less efficient than a direct approach under these conditions. We then develop a parallel implementation of the algorithm that takes into account the unusually high cost of individual arithmetic operations. Our approach combines message passing and shared memory, achieving near-perfect scalability and high tolerance for network latency. We are thus able to find solutions for much larger matrices than has been previously possible, with the potential for extending this work to systems with greater levels of parallelism.
