In this paper we develop two conforming finite element methods for a fourth order bi-wave equation arising as a simplified Ginzburg-Landau-type model for d-wave superconductors in absence of applied magnetic field. Unlike the biharmonic operator \Delta^2, the bi-wave operator \Box^2 is not an elliptic operator, so the energy space for the bi-wave equation is much larger than the energy space for the biharmonic equation. This then makes it possible to construct low order conforming finite elements for the bi-wave equation. However, the existence and construction of such finite elements strongly depends on the mesh. In the paper, we first characterize mesh conditions which allow and not allow construction of low order conforming finite elements for approximating the bi-wave equation. We then construct a cubic and a quartic conforming finite element. It is proved that both elements have the desired approximation properties, and give optimal order error estimates in the energy norm, suboptimal (and optimal in some cases) order error estimates in the H^1 and L^2 norm. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to guage the efficiency of the proposed finite element methods and to validate the theoretical error bounds.
