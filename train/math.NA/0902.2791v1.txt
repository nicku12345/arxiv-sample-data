Block-to-block interface interpolation operators are constructed for several common high-order finite difference discretizations. In contrast to conventional interpolation operators, these new interpolation operators maintain the strict stability, accuracy and conservation of the base scheme even when nonconforming grids or dissimilar operators are used in adjoining blocks. The stability properties of the new operators are verified using eigenvalue analysis, and the accuracy properties are verified using numerical simulations of the Euler equations in two spatial dimensions.
