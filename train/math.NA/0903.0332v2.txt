This paper presents an analytical model and a geometric numerical integrator for a rigid body connected to an elastic string, acting under a gravitational potential. Since the point where the string is attached to the rigid body is displaced from the center of mass of the rigid body, there exist nonlinear coupling effects between the string deformation and the rigid body dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, refereed to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. These properties are illustrated by a numerical simulation.
