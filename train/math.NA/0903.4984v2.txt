In this article we introduce an asymptotic preserving scheme designed to compute the solution of a two dimensional elliptic equation presenting large anisotropies. We focus on an anisotropy aligned with one direction, the dominant part of the elliptic operator being supplemented with Neumann boundary conditions. A new scheme is introduced which allows an accurate resolution of this elliptic equation for an arbitrary anisotropy ratio.
