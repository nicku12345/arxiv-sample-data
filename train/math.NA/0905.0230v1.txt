Numerical approximations of two classical fluid dynamics systems modelling large structure formation in cosmology are proposed. These systems model nonrelativistic and relativistic fluids submitted to self-gravitation in an expanding background. They are obtained by an adaptation of an extension of the Godunov method, using delta wave projections, which was first introduced in Le Roux & al. for the system of pressureless fluid dynamics and which adapts to various systems of fluid dynamics.
