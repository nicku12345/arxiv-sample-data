In this article we are interested in the derivation of efficient domain decomposition methods for the viscous primitive equations of the ocean. We consider the rotating 3d incompressible hydrostatic Navier-Stokes equations with free surface. Performing an asymptotic analysis of the system with respect to the Rossby number, we compute an approximated Dirichlet to Neumann operator and build an optimized Schwarz waveform relaxation algorithm. We establish the well-posedness of this algorithm and present some numerical results to illustrate the method.
