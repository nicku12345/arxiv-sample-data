In [7], a new iterative method for solving linear system of equations was presented which can be considered as a modification of the Gauss-Seidel method. Then in [4] a different approach, say 2D-DSPM, and more effective one was introduced. In this paper, we improve this method and give a generalization of it. Convergence properties of this kind of generalization are also discussed. We finally give some numerical experiments to show the efficiency of the method and compare with 2D-DSPM.
