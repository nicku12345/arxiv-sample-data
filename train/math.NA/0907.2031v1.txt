We develop an efficient algorithm for Synthetic Aperture Sonar imaging based on the one-way wave equations. The algorithm utilizes the operator-splitting method to integrate the one-way wave equations. The well-posedness of the one-way wave equations and the proposed algorithm is shown. A computational result against real field data is reported and the resulting image is enhanced by the BV-like regularization.
