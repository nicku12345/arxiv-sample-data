First, we derive explicit computable expressions of structured backward errors of approximate eigenelements of structured matrix polynomials including symmetric, skew-symmetric, Hermitian, skew-Hermitian, even and odd polynomials. We also determine minimal structured perturbations for which approximate eigenelements are exact eigenelements of the perturbed polynomials. Next, we analyze the effect of structure preserving linearizations of structured matrix polynomials on the structured backward errors of approximate eigenelements. We identify structure preserving linearizations which have almost no adverse effect on the structured backward errors of approximate eigenelements of the polynomials. Finally, we analyze structured pseudospectra of a structured matrix polynomial and establish a partial equality between unstructured and structured pseudospectra.
