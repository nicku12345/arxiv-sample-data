Given a matrix order n, a restart parameter m (m < n), a decreasing positive sequence f(0) > f(1) > ... > f(q) \geq 0, where q < n/m, it is shown that there exits an n-by-n matrix A and a vector r_0 with \|r_0\|=f(0) such that \|r_k\|=f(k), k=1,...,q, where r_k is the residual at cycle k of restarted GMRES with restart parameter m applied to the linear system Ax=b, with initial residual r_0=b-Ax_0. Moreover, the matrix A can be chosen to have any desired eigenvalues. We can also construct arbitrary cases of stagnation; namely, when f(0) > f(1) > ... > f(i) = f(i+1) \geq 0  for any i <q . The restart parameter can be fixed or variable.
