We consider the variational formulation of the electric field integral equation (EFIE) on bounded polyhedral open or closed surfaces. We employ a conforming Galerkin discretization based on div-conforming Raviart-Thomas boundary elements (BEM) of locally variable polynomial degree on shape-regular surface meshes. We establish asymptotic quasi-optimality of Galerkin solutions on sufficiently fine meshes or for sufficiently high polynomial degree.
