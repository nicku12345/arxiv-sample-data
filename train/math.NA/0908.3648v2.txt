We provide some numerical computations for the soliton dynamics of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an external potential. After computing the ground state solution r of a related elliptic equation we show that, in the semi-classical regime, the center of mass of the solution with initial datum modelled on r is driven by the solution of a Newtonian type law. Finally, we provide some examples and analyze the numerical errors in the two dimensional case when V is an harmonic potential.
