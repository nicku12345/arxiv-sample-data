We consider 3-point numerical schemes for scalar Conservation Laws, that are oscillatory either to their dispersive or anti-diffusive nature. Oscillations are responsible for the increase of the Total Variation (TV); a bound on which is crucial for the stability of the numerical scheme. It has been noticed (\cite{Arvanitis.2001}, \cite{Arvanitis.2004}, \cite{Sfakianakis.2008}) that the use of non-uniform adaptively redefined meshes, that take into account the geometry of the numerical solution itself, is capable of taming oscillations; hence improving the stability properties of the numerical schemes.   In this work we provide a model for studying the evolution of the extremes over non-uniform adaptively redefined meshes. Based on this model we prove that proper mesh reconstruction is able to control the oscillations; we provide bounds for the Total Variation (TV) of the numerical solution. We moreover prove under more strict assumptions that the increase of the TV -due to the oscillatory behaviour of the numerical schemes- decreases with time; hence proving that the overall scheme is TV Increase-Decreasing (TVI-D).
