Maxwell's equations can be solved numerically in space manifold and the time by discrete exterior calculus as a kind of lattice gauge theory.Since the stable conditions of this method is very severe restriction, we combine the implicit scheme of time variable and discrete exterior calculus to derive an unconditional stable scheme. It is an generation of implicit Yee-like scheme, since it can be implemented in space manifold directly. The analysis of its unconditional stability and error is also accomplished.
