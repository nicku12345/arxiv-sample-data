The classical numerical methods play important roles in solving wave equation, e.g. finite difference time domain method. However, their computational domain are limited to flat space and the time. This paper deals with the description of discrete exterior calculus method for numerical simulation of wave equation. The advantage of this method is that it can be used to compute equation on the space manifold and the time. The analysis of its stable condition and error is also accomplished.
