Analytical formulae for the points and weights of two fifth-order quadrature rules for C_3, the 3-cube, are given. The rules, originally formulated by A. H. Stroud in 1967, are discussed in greater detail in terms of both the setup of the basic equations and the method of obtaining their solutions analytically. The primary purpose of this paper is to better document what we feel is a particularly practical quadrature rule (e.g. in finite element calculations) and one for which we felt comprehensive information was scarce.
