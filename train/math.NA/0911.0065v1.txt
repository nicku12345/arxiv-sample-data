The paper is concerned with the adaptive finite element solution of linear elliptic differential equations using equidistributing meshes. A strategy is developed for defining this type of mesh based on residual-based a posteriori error estimates and rigorously analyzing the convergence of a linear finite element approximation using them. The existence and computation of equidistributing meshes and the continuous dependence of the finite element approximation on mesh are also studied. Numerical results are given to verify the theoretical findings.
