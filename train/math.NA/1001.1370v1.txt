In this paper, we examine a number of additive and multiplicative multilevel iterative methods and preconditioners in the setting of two-dimensional local mesh refinement. While standard multilevel methods are effective for uniform refinement-based discretizations of elliptic equations, they tend to be less effective for algebraic systems which arise from discretizations on locally refined meshes, losing their optimal behavior in both storage and computational complexity. Our primary focus here is on BPX-style additive and multiplicative multilevel preconditioners, and on various stabilizations of the additive and multiplicative hierarchical basis method (HB), and their use in the local mesh refinement setting. In this article, we describe in detail the implementation of these types of algorithms, including detailed discussions of the datastructures and traversal algorithms we employ for obtaining optimal storage and computational complexity in our implementations. We show how each of the algorithms can be implemented using standard datatypes available in languages such as C and FORTRAN, so that the resulting algorithms have optimal (linear) storage requirements, and so that the resulting multilevel method or preconditioner can be applied with optimal (linear) computational costs. Our implementations are performed in both C and MATLAB using the Finite Element ToolKit (FETK), an open source finite element software package. We finish the paper with a sequence of numerical experiments illustrating the effectiveness of a number of BPX and stabilized HB variants for several examples requiring local refinement.
