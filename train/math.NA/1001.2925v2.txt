Inertia-gravity mode and Rossby mode dispersion properties are examined for discretisations of the linearized rotating shallow-water equations using the P1_{DG}-P2 finite element pair on arbitrary triangulations in planar geometry. A discrete Helmholtz decomposition of the functions in the velocity space based on potentials taken from the pressure space is used to provide a complete description of the numerical wave propagation for the discretised equations. In the f-plane case, this decomposition is used to obtain decoupled equations for the geostrophic modes, the inertia-gravity modes, and the inertial oscillations. As has been noticed previously, the geostrophic modes are steady. The Helmholtz decomposition is used to show that the resulting inertia-gravity wave equation is third-order accurate in space. In general the \pdgp finite element pair is second-order accurate, so this leads to very accurate wave propagation. It is further shown that the only spurious modes supported by this discretisation are spurious inertial oscillations which have frequency f, and which do not propagate. The Helmholtz decomposition also allows a simple derivation of the quasi-geostrophic limit of the discretised P1_{DG}-P2 equations in the \beta-plane case, resulting in a Rossby wave equation which is also third-order accurate.
