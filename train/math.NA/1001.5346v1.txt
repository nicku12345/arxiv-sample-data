In this paper, we are interested in heuristic parameter choice rules for general convex variational regularization which are based on error estimates. Two such rules are derived and generalize those from quadratic regularization, namely the Hanke-Raus rule and quasi-optimality criterion. A posteriori error estimates are shown for the Hanke-Raus rule, and convergence for both rules is also discussed. Numerical results for both rules are presented to illustrate their applicability.
