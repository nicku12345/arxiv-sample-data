We study in this paper nonlinear subdivision schemes in a multivariate setting allowing arbitrary dilation matrix. We investigate the convergence of such iterative process to some limit function. Our analysis is based on some conditions on the contractivity of the associated scheme for the differences. In particular, we show the regularity of the limit function, in L^p and Sobolev spaces.
