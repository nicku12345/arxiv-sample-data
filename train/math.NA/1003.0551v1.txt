We consider integrated circuits with semiconductors modeled by modified nodal analysis and drift-diffusion equations. The drift-diffusion equations are discretized in space using mixed finite element method. This discretization yields a high dimensional differential-algebraic equation. We show how proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) can be used to reduce the dimension of the model. We compare reduced and fine models and give numerical results for a basic network with one diode. Furthermore we discuss an adaptive approach to construct POD models which are valid over certain parameter ranges. Finally, numerical investigations for the reduction of a 4-diode rectifier network are presented, which clearly indicate that POD model reduction delivers surrogate models for the diodes involved, which depend on the position of the semiconductor in the network.
