For stochastic implicit Taylor methods that use an iterative scheme to compute their numerical solution, stochastic B--series and corresponding growth functions are constructed. From these, convergence results based on the order of the underlying Taylor method, the choice of the iteration method, the predictor and the number of iterations, for It\^o and Stratonovich SDEs, and for weak as well as strong convergence are derived. As special case, also the application of Taylor methods to ODEs is considered. The theory is supported by numerical experiments.
