Quasi-Monte Carlo rules are equal weight quadrature rules defined over the domain [0,1]^s. Here we introduce quasi-Monte Carlo type rules for numerical integration of functions defined on \mathbb{R}^s. These rules are obtained by way of some transformation of digital nets such that locally one obtains qMC rules, but at the same time, globally one also has the required distribution. We prove that these rules are optimal for numerical integration in fractional Besov type spaces. The analysis is based on certain tilings of the Walsh phase plane.
