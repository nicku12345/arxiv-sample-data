We report here on the recent application of a now classical general reduction technique, the Reduced-Basis approach initiated in [C. Prud'homme, D. Rovas, K. Veroy, Y. Maday, A. T. Patera, and G. Turinici. Reliable real-time solution of parametrized partial differential equations: Reduced-basis output bounds methods. Journal of Fluids Engineering, 124(1):7080, 2002.], to the specific context of differential equations with random coefficients. After an elementary presentation of the approach, we review two contributions of the authors: [S. Boyaval, C. Le Bris, Y. Maday, N.C. Nguyen, and A.T. Patera. A reduced basis approach for variational problems with stochastic parameters: Application to heat conduction with variable Robin co-efficient. Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 198(4144):3187-3206, 2009.], which presents the application of the RB approach for the discretization of a simple second order elliptic equation supplied with a random boundary condition, and [S. Boyaval and T. Leli\`evre, A variance reduction method for parametrized stochastic differential equations using the reduced basis paradigm with T. Leli\`evre, Commun. Math. Sci. 8, special Issue "Mathematical Issue on Complex Fluids" P. Zhang ed., to appear, 2010, ARXIV preprint arXiv:0906.3600], which uses a RB type approach to reduce the variance in the Monte-Carlo simulation of a stochastic differential equation. We conclude the review with some general comments and also discuss possible tracks for further research in the direction.
