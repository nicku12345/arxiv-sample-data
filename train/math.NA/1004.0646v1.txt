We outline the basic ideas and techniques underpinning the simulation of stochastic differential equations. In particular we focus on strong simulation and its context. We also provide illustratory examples and sample matlab algorithms for the reader to use and follow. Our target audience is advanced undergraduate and graduate students interested in learning about simulating stochastic differential equations. We try to address the FAQs we have encountered.
