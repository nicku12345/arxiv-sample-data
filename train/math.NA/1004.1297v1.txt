We present an accurate investigation of the algebraic conditions that the symbols of a convergent, univariate, binary, non-stationary subdivision scheme should fulfill in order to reproduce spaces of exponential polynomials. A subdivision scheme is said to possess the property of reproducing exponential polynomials if, for any initial data uniformly sampled from some exponential polynomial function, the scheme yields the same function in the limit. The importance of this property is due to the fact that several functions obtained as combinations of exponential polynomials (such as conic sections, spirals or special trigonometric and hyperbolic functions) are of great interest in graphical and engineering applications. Since the space of exponential polynomials trivially includes standard polynomials, the results in this work extend the recently developed theory on polynomial reproduction to the non-stationary context. A significant application of the derived algebraic conditions on the subdivision symbols is the construction of new non-stationary subdivision schemes with specified reproduction properties.
