We propose a fast algorithm for mode rank truncation of the result of a bilinear operation on 3-tensors given in the Tucker or canonical form. If the arguments and the result have mode sizes n and mode ranks r, the computation costs O(nr^3 + r^4). The algorithm is based on the cross approximation of Gram matrices, and the accuracy of the resulted Tucker approximation is limited by square root of machine precision.
