This paper presents a counterexample to the conjecture that the semi-explicit Lie-Newmark algorithm is variational. As a consequence the Lie-Newmark method is not well-suited for long-time simulation of rigid body-type mechanical systems. The counterexample consists of a single rigid body in a static potential field, and can serve as a test of the variational nature of other rigid-body integrators.
