A mathematical smooth function means that the function has continuous derivatives to a certain degree C(k). We call it a k-smooth function or a smooth function if k can grow infinitively. Based on quantum physics, there is no such smooth surface in the real world on a very small scale. However, we do have a concept of smooth surfaces in practice since we always compare whether one surface is smoother than another one. This paper deals with the possible definitions of "natural" smoothness and their relationship to the original mathematical definition of smooth functions. The motivation of giving the definition of a smooth function is to study smooth extensions for practical applications.   We observe this problem from two directions: From discrete to continuous, we suggest considering both micro smooth, the refinement of a smoothed function, and macro smooth, the best approximation using existing discrete space. (For two-dimensional or higher dimensional cases, we can use Hessian matrices.) From continuous to discrete, we suggest a new definition of natural smooth, it uses a scan from down scaling to up scaling to obtain the a ratio for sign changes by ignoring zero to represent the smoothness. For differentiable functions, mathematical smoothness does not mean a "good looking" smooth for a sampled set in discrete space. Finally, we discuss the Lipschitz continuity for defining the smoothness, which will be called discrete smoothness. This paper gives philosophical consideration of smoothness for practical problems, rather than a mathematical deduction or reduction, even though our inferences are based on solid mathematics.
