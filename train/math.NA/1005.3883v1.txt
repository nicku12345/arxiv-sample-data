Based on the variable Hilbert scale interpolation inequality bounds for the error of regularisation methods are derived under range inclusions. In this context, new formulae for the modulus of continuity of the inverse of bounded operators with non-closed range are given. Even if one can show the equivalence of this approach to the version used previously in the literature, the new formulae and corresponding conditions are simpler than the former ones. Several examples from image processing and spectral enhancement illustrate how the new error bounds can be applied.
