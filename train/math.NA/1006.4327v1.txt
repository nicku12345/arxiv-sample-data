The main goal of the paper is to introduce methods which compute B\'ezier curves faster than Casteljau's method does. These methods are based on the spectral factorization of a n\times n Bernstein matrix, B^e_n(s)= P_nG_n(s)P_n^{-1}, where P_n is the n\times n lower triangular Pascal matrix. So we first calculate the exact optimum positive value t in order to transform P_n in a scaled Toeplitz matrix, which is a problem that was partially solved by X. Wang and J. Zhou (2006). Then fast Pascal matrix-vector multiplications and strategies of polynomial evaluation are put together to compute B\'ezier curves. Nevertheless, when n increases, more precise Pascal matrix-vector multiplications allied to affine transformations of the vectors of coordinates of the control points of the curve are then necessary to stabilize all the computation.
