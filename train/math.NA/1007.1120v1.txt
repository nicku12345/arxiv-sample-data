We elaborate on the interpretation of some mixed finite element spaces in terms of differential forms. First we develop a framework in which we show how tools from algebraic topology can be applied to the study of their cohomological properties. The analysis applies in particular to certain hp finite element spaces, extending results in trivial topology often referred to as the exact sequence property. Then we define regularization operators. Combined with the standard interpolators they enable us to prove discrete Poincar\'e-Friedrichs inequalities and discrete Rellich compactness for finite element spaces of differential forms of arbitrary degree on compact manifolds of arbitrary dimension.
