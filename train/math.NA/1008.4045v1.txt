In this paper, we study the numerical simulations for Euler system with maximal density constraint. This model is developed in [1, 3] with the constraint introduced into the system by a singular pressure law, which causes the transition of different asymptotic dynamics between different regions. To overcome these difficulties, we adapt and implement two asymptotic preserving (AP) schemes originally designed for low Mach number limit [2,4] to our model. These schemes work for the different dynamics and capture the transitions well. Several numerical tests both in one dimensional and two dimensional cases are carried out for our schemes.
