This paper applies meshless method of lines, which uses radial basis functions (RBFs) as a spatial collocation scheme to solve the Coupled Drinfeld's-Sokolov-Wilson System. Runge-Kutta method is used for time integration of the system of ODEs obtained as a result of spatial discretization in contrast to usual RBFs or finite difference methods. Accuracy (L2 and L1) is compared with the existing results from other methods available in the literature.
