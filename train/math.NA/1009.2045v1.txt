In this paper, two stability results regarding exponential frames are compared. The theorems, (one proven herein, and the other in \cite{SZ}), each give a constant such that if \sup_{n \in \mathbb{Z^d}}\| \epsilon_n \|_\infty < C, and (e^{i \langle \cdot , t_n \rangle})_{n \in \mathbb{Z}^d} is a frame for L_2[-\pi,\pi]^d, then (e^{i \langle \cdot , t_n +\epsilon_n \rangle})_{n \in \mathbb{Z}^d} is a frame for L_2[-\pi,\pi]^d. These two constants are shown to be asymptotically equivalent for large values of d.
