In this paper, an equivalence between existence of particular exponential Riesz bases for multivariate bandlimited functions and existence of certain polynomial interpolants for these bandlimited functions is given. For certain classes of unequally spaced data nodes and corresponding \ell_2 data, the existence of these polynomial interpolants allows for a simple recovery formula for multivariate bandlimited functions which demonstrates L_2 and uniform convergence on \mathbb{R}^d. A simpler computational version of this recovery formula is also given, at the cost of replacing L_2 and uniform convergence on \mathbb{R}^d with L_2 and uniform convergence on increasingly large subsets of \mathbb{R}^d. As a special case, the polynomial interpolants of given \ell_2 data converge in the same fashion to the multivariate bandlimited interpolant of that same data. Concrete examples of pertinant Riesz bases and unequally spaced data nodes are also given.
