In this work, we describe, analyze, and implement a pseudospectral quadrature method for a global computer modeling of the incompressible surface Navier-Stokes equations on the rotating unit sphere. Our spectrally accurate numerical error analysis is based on the Gevrey regularity of the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations on the sphere. The scheme is designed for convenient application of fast evaluation techniques such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), and the implementation is based on a stable adaptive time discretization.
