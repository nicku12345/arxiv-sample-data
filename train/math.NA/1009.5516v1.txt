For the solution of full-rank ill-posed linear systems a new approach based on the Arnoldi algorithm is presented. Working with regularized systems, the method theoretically reconstructs the true solution by means of the computation of a suitable function of matrix. In this sense the method can be referred to as an iterative refinement process. Numerical experiments arising from integral equations and interpolation theory are presented. Finally, the method is extended to work in connection with the standard Tikhonov regularization with a right hand side contaminated by noise.
