We address the task of higher-order derivative evaluation of computer programs that contain QR decompositions and real symmetric eigenvalue decompositions. The approach is a combination of univariate Taylor polynomial arithmetic and matrix calculus in the (combined) forward/reverse mode of Algorithmic Differentiation (AD). Explicit algorithms are derived and presented in an accessible form. The approach is illustrated via examples.
