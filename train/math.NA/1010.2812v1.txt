A technique for computing an ILU preconditioner based on the FAPINV algorithm is presented. We show that this algorithm is well-defined for H-matrices. Moreover, when used in conjunction with Krylov-subspace-based iterative solvers such as the GMRES algorithm, results in reliable solvers. Numerical experiments on some test matrices are given to show the efficiency of the new ILU preconditioner.
