A systematic digital-discrete method for obtaining continuous functions with smoothness to a certain order (C^(n)) from sample data is designed. This method is based on gradually varied functions and the classical finite difference method. This new method has been applied to real groundwater data and the results have validated the method. This method is independent from existing popular methods such as the cubic spline method and the finite element method. The new digital-discrete method has considerable advantages for a large number of real data applications. This digital method also differs from other classical discrete methods that usually use triangulations. This method can potentially be used to obtain smooth functions such as polynomials through its derivatives f^(k) and the solution for partial differential equations such as harmonic and other important equations.
