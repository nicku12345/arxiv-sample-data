We consider the inexact Newton methods  x_{n+1}^\d=x_n^\d-g_{\a_n}(F'(x_n^\d)^* F'(x_n^\d)) F'(x_n^\d)^* (F(x_n^\d)-y^\d)  for solving nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems F(x)=y using the only available noise data y^\d satisfying \|y^\d-y\|\le \d with a given small noise level \d>0. We terminate the iteration by the discrepancy principle  \|F(x_{n_\d}^\d)-y^\d\|\le \tau \d<\|F(x_n^\d)-y^\d\|, \qquad 0\le n<n_\d  with a given number \tau>1. Under certain conditions on \{\a_n\} and F, we prove for a large class of spectral filter functions \{g_\a\} the convergence of x_{n_\d}^\d to a true solution as \d\rightarrow 0. Moreover, we derive the order optimal rates of convergence when certain H\"{o}lder source conditions hold. Numerical examples are given to test the theoretical results.
