Two local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods using some non-standard numerical fluxes are developed for the Helmholtz equation with the first order absorbing boundary condition in the high frequency regime. It is shown that the proposed LDG methods are absolutely stable (hence well-posed) with respect to both the wave number and the mesh size. Optimal order (with respect to the mesh size) error estimates are proved for all wave numbers in the preasymptotic regime. To analyze the proposed LDG methods, they are recasted and treated as (non-conforming) mixed finite element methods. The crux of the analysis is to establish a generalized {\em inf-sup} condition, which holds without any mesh constraint, for each LDG method. The generalized {\em inf-sup} conditions then easily infer the desired absolute stability of the proposed LDG methods. In return, the stability results not only guarantee the well-posedness of the LDG methods but also play a crucial role in the derivation of the error estimates. Numerical experiments, which confirm the theoretical results and compare the proposed two LDG methods, are also presented in the paper.
