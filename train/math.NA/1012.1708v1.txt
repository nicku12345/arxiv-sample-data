In this work we consider topology optimization of systems, which are governed by the external Bernoulli free boundary problem. We utilize the so-called pseudo-solid approach to solve the governing free boundary problems during the optimization. To define design domains we utilize a level set representation parameterized by radial basis functions. This design parametrization allows topological changes in the design domain.
