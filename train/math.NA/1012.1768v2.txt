The lowest order nonconforming rectangular element in three dimensions involves 54 degrees of freedom for the stress and 12 degrees of freedom for the displacement. With a modest increase in the number of degrees of freedom (24 for the stress), we obtain a conforming rectangular element for linear elasticity in three dimensions. Moreover, unlike the conforming plane rectangular or simplicial elements, this element does not involve any vertex degrees of freedom. Second, we remark that further low order elements can be constructed by approximating the displacement with rigid body motions. This results in a pair of conforming elements with 72 degrees of freedom for the stress and 6 degrees of freedom for the displacement.
