The Dynamical Systems Method (DSM) is justified for solving operator equations F(u)=f, where F is a nonlinear operator in a Hilbert space H. It is assumed that F is a global homeomorphism of H onto H, that F\in C^1_{loc}, that is, it has a continuous with respect to u Fr\'echet derivative F'(u), that the operator [F'(u)]^{-1} exists for all u\in H and is bounded, ||[F'(u)]^{-1}||\leq m(u), where m(u)>0 is a constant, depending on u, and not necessarily uniformly bounded with respect to u. It is proved under these assumptions that the continuous analog of the Newton's method \dot{u}=-[F'(u)]^{-1}(F(u)-f), \quad u(0)=u_0, \quad (*) converges strongly to the solution of the equation F(u)=f for any f\in H and any u_0\in H. The global (and even local) existence of the solution to the Cauchy problem (*) was not established earlier without assuming that F'(u) is Lipschitz-continuous. The case when F is not a global homeomorphism but a monotone operator in H is also considered.
