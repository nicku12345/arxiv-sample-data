Given a right eigenvector x and a left eigenvector y associated with the same eigenvalue of a matrix A, there is a Hermitian positive definite matrix H for which y=Hx. The matrix H defines an inner product and consequently also a field of values. The new generalized field of values is always the convex hull of the eigenvalues of A. Moreover, it is equal to the standard field of values when A is normal and is a particular case of the field of values associated with non-standard inner products proposed by Givens. As a consequence, in the same way as with Hermitian matrices, the eigenvalues of non-Hermitian matrices with real spectrum can be characterized in terms of extrema of a corresponding generalized Rayleigh Quotient.
