The frozen Gaussian approximation provides a highly efficient computational method for high frequency wave propagation. The derivation of the method is based on asymptotic analysis. In this paper, for general linear strictly hyperbolic system, we establish the rigorous convergence result for frozen Gaussian approximation. As a byproduct, higher order frozen Gaussian approximation is developed.
