This article presents a detailed technical framework for modeling with Bertrand-Nash equilibrium prices under Mixed Logit demand. Two coercive fixed-point equations provide more stable computational methods than those obtained from the literal first-order conditions. Assumptions to justify derivation and use of these equations are provided. A brief discussion of a GMRES-Newton method with hookstep globalization strategy originally due to Viswanath is also given. This article can be considered a supplement to an article by the authors forthcoming in the journal {\em Operations Research}.
