Interpolation by various types of splines is the standard procedure in many applications. In this paper we shall discuss harmonic spline "interpolation" (on the lines of a grid) as an alternative to polynomial spline interpolation (at vertices of a grid). We will discuss some advantages and drawbacks of this approach and present the asymptotics of the L_p-error for adaptive approximation by harmonic splines.
