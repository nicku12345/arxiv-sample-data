The concern of the present work is the introduction of a very efficient Asymptotic Preserving scheme for the resolution of highly anisotropic diffusion equations. The characteristic features of this scheme are the uniform convergence with respect to the anisotropy parameter 0<\eps <<1, the applicability (on cartesian grids) to cases of non-uniform and non-aligned anisotropy fields b and the simple extension to the case of a non-constant anisotropy intensity 1/\eps. The mathematical approach and the numerical scheme are different from those presented in the previous work [Degond et al. (2010), arXiv:1008.3405v1] and its considerable advantages are pointed out.
