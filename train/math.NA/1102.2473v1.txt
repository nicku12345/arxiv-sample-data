In this paper, we focus on a special class of ideal projectors. With the aid of algebraic geometry, we prove that for this special class of ideal projectors, there exist "good" error formulas as defined by C. de Boor. Furthermore, we completely analyze the properties of the interpolation conditions matched by this special class of ideal projectors, and show that the ranges of this special class of ideal projectors are the minimal degree interpolation spaces with regard to their associated interpolation conditions.
