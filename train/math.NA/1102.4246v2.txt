We develop a general notion of orthogonal wavelets `centered' on an irregular knot sequence. We present two families of orthogonal wavelets that are continuous and piecewise polynomial. We develop efficient algorithms to implement these schemes and apply them to a data set extracted from an ocelot image. As another application, we construct continuous, piecewise quadratic, orthogonal wavelet bases on the quasi-crystal lattice consisting of the \tau-integers where \tau is the golden ratio. The resulting spaces then generate a multiresolution analysis of L^2(\mathbf{R}) with scaling factor \tau.
