We revisit the normality preserving augmentation of normal matrices studied by Ikramov and Elsner in 1998 and complement their results by showing how the eigenvalues of the original matrix are perturbed by the augmentation. Moreover, we construct all augmentations that result in normal matrices with eigenvalues on a quadratic curve in the complex plane, using the stratification of normal matrices presented by Huhtanen in 2001. To make this construction feasible, but also for its own sake, we study normality preserving normal perturbations of normal matrices. For 2\times 2 and for rank-1 matrices, the analysis is complete. For higher rank, all essentially Hermitian normality perturbations are described. In all cases, the effect of the perturbation on the eigenvalues of the original matrix is given. The paper is concluded with a number of explicit examples that illustrate the results and constructions.
