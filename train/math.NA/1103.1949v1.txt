Let t_{i}=\frac{i}{n} for i=0,...,n be equally spaces knots in the unit interval [0,1]. Let \mathcal{S}_{n} be the space of piecewise linear continuous functions on [0,1] with knots \pi_{n}=\{t_{i}:0\leq i\leq n\}. Then we have the orthogonal projection P_{n} of L^{2}([0,1]) onto \mathcal{S}_{n}. In Section 1 we collect a few preliminary facts about the solutions of the recurrence f_{k-1}-4f_{k}+f_{k+1}=0 that we need in Section 2 to show that the sequence % a_{n}=\Vert P_{n}\Vert_{1} of L^{1}-norms of these projection operators is strictly increasing.
