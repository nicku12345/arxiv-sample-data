La Budde's method computes the characteristic polynomial of a real matrix A in two stages: first it applies orthogonal similarity transformations to reduce A to upper Hessenberg form H, and second it computes the characteristic polynomial of H from characteristic polynomials of leading principal submatrices of H. If A is symmetric, then H is symmetric tridiagonal, and La Budde's method simplifies to the Sturm sequence method. If A is diagonal then La Budde's method reduces to the Summation Algorithm, a Horner-like scheme used by the MATLAB function POLY to compute characteristic polynomials from eigenvalues. We present recursions to compute the individual coefficients of the characteristic polynomial in the second stage of La Budde's method, and derive running error bounds for symmetric and nonsymmetric matrices. We also show that La Budde's method can be more accurate than POLY, especially for indefinite and nonsymmetric matrices A. Unlike POLY, La Budde's method is not affected by illconditioning of eigenvalues, requires only real arithmetic, and allows the computation of individual coefficients.
