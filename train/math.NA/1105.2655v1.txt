We study the convergence of a class of asymptotic preserving numerical schemes initially proposed by F. Filbet & S. Jin \cite{filb1} and G. Dimarco & L. Pareschi \cite{DimarcoP} in the context of nonlinear and stiff kinetic equations. Here, our analysis is devoted to the approximation of a system of transport equations with a nonlinear source term, for which the asymptotic limit is given by a conservation laws. We investigate the convergence of the approximate solution (\ueps_h,\veps_h) to a nonlinear relaxation system, where \eps>0 is a physical parameter and h represents the discretization parameter. Uniform convergence with respect to \eps and h is proven and error estimates are also obtained. Finally, several numerical tests are performed to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of such a scheme.
