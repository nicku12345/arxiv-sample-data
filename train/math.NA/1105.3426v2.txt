Functions that are smooth but non-periodic on a certain interval possess Fourier series that lack uniform convergence and suffer from the Gibbs phenomenon. However, they can be represented accurately by a Fourier series that is periodic on a larger interval. This is commonly called a Fourier extension. When constructed in a particular manner, Fourier extensions share many of the same features of a standard Fourier series. In particular, one can compute Fourier extensions which converge spectrally fast whenever the function is smooth, and exponentially fast if the function is analytic, much the same as the Fourier series of a smooth/analytic and periodic function.   With this in mind, the purpose of this paper is to describe, analyze and explain the observation that Fourier extensions, much like classical Fourier series, also have excellent resolution properties for representing oscillatory functions. The resolution power, or required number of degrees of freedom per wavelength, depends on a user-controlled parameter and, as we show, it varies between 2 and \pi. The former value is optimal and is achieved by classical Fourier series for periodic functions, for example. The latter value is the resolution power of algebraic polynomial approximations. Thus, Fourier extensions with an appropriate choice of parameter are eminently suitable for problems with moderate to high degrees of oscillation.
