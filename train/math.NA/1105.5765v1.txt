This paper is devoted to the numerical approximation of a nonlinear temperature balance equation, which describes the heat evolution of a magnetically confined plasma in the edge region of a tokamak. The nonlinearity implies some numerical difficulties, in particular long time behavior, when solved with standard methods. An efficient numerical scheme is presented in this paper, based on a combination of a directional splitting scheme and the IMEX scheme introduced in [Filbet and Jin]
