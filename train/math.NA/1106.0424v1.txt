In this paper, we analyze the convergence of the preconditioned GMRES method for the first order finite element discretizations of the Helmholtz equation in media with losses. We consider a Laplace preconditioner, an inexact Laplace preconditioner and a two-level preconditioner. Our analysis is based on bounding the field of values of the preconditioned system matrix in the complex plane. The analysis takes the non-normal nature of the linear system naturally into account and allows us to easily consider certain type of inexact Laplace preconditioners via a perturbation argument. For the two-level preconditioner, our convergence analysis takes into account a media, which has not been considered in previous works.
