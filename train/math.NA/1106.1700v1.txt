We propose a multi-moment method for one-dimensional hyperbolic equations with smooth coefficient and piecewise constant coefficient. The method is entirely based on the backward characteristic method and uses the solution and its derivative as unknowns and cubic Hermite interpolation for each computational cell. The exact update formula for solution and its derivative is derived and used for an efficient time integration. At points of discontinuity of wave speed we define a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation based on immersed interface method. The method is extended to the one-dimensional Maxwell's equations with variable material properties.
