Several preconditioned AOR methods have been proposed to solve system of linear equations Ax=b, where A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} is a unit Z-matrix. The aim of this paper is to give a comparison result for a class of preconditioners P, where P\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n} is nonsingular, nonnegative and has unit diagonal entries. Numerical results for corresponding preconditioned GMRES methods are given to illustrate the theoretical results.
