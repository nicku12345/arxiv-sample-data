A semi-discretization in time, according to a full implicit Euler scheme, for a 2D dissipative quasi geostrophic equation, is studied. We prove existence, uniqueness and regularity results of the solution to the predicted discretization, in the subcritical case for any initial data in \dot{L}^2. Hence, we define an infinite semi-discrete dynamical system, then we prove the existence and the regularity of the corresponding global attractor, for a source term f in \dot{L}^{p_{\alpha}}, for a fixed p_{\alpha} = \frac{2}{1-\alpha} .
