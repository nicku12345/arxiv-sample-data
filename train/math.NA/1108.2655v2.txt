EXPODE is a MATLAB toolbox for exponential time integration. It supports exponential Runge-Kutta- and Rosenbrock-methods, linearized and non-linearized multistep-methods and the EXP4. We support evaluation of the arising matrix functions either directly or by a Krylov method. We also have adaptive step width control for some of the methods. This document contains the documentation of the software package. The software itself is available from http://www.am.uni-duesseldorf.de/en/Research/03_Software.php .
