Positive cubature rules of degree 4 and 5 on the d-dimensional simplex are constructed and used to construct cubature rules of index 8 or degree 9 on the unit sphere. The latter ones lead to explicit isometric embedding among the classical Banach spaces. Among other things, our results include several explicit representations of (x_1^2+...+ x_d^2)^t in terms of linear forms of degree 2t with rational coefficients for t=4 and 5.
