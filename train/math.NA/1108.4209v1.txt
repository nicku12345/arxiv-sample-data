A new reorthogonalized block classical Gram--Schmidt algorithm is proposed that factorizes a full column rank matrix A into A=QR where Q is left orthogonal (has orthonormal columns) and R is upper triangular and nonsingular.   With appropriate assumptions on the diagonal blocks of R, the algorithm, when implemented in floating point arithmetic with machine unit \macheps, produces Q and R such that \| I- Q^{T} Q \|_2 =O(\macheps) and \| A-QR \|_2 =O(\macheps \| A \|_2). The resulting bounds also improve a previous bound by Giraud et al. [Num. Math., 101(1):87-100,\ 2005] on the CGS2 algorithm originally developed by Abdelmalek [BIT, 11(4):354--367,\ 1971].   \medskip Keywords: Block matrices, Q--R factorization, Gram-Schmidt process, Condition numbers, Rounding error analysis.
