In a previous article about the homogenization of the classical problem of diff usion in a bounded domain with su ciently smooth boundary we proved that the error is of order \epsilon^{1/2}. Now, for an open set with su ciently smooth boundary C^{1,1} and homogeneous Dirichlet or Neuman limits conditions we show that in any open set strongly included in the error is of order \epsilon. If the open set \Omega\subset R^n is of polygonal (n=2) or polyhedral (n=3) boundary we also give the global and interrior error estimates.
