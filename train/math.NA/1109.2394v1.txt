This paper deals with the introduction of a decomposition of the deformations of curved thin beams, with section of order \delta, which takes into account the specific geometry of such beams. A deformation v is split into an elementary deformation and a warping. The elementary deformation is the analog of a Bernoulli-Navier's displacement for linearized deformations replacing the infinitesimal rotation by a rotation in SO(3) in each cross section of the rod. Each part of the decomposition is estimated with respect to the L^2 norm of the distance from gradient v to SO(3). This result relies on revisiting the rigidity theorem of Friesecke-James-M\"uller in which we estimate the constant for a bounded open set star-shaped with respect to a ball. Then we use the decomposition of the deformations to derive a few asymptotic geometrical behavior: large deformations of extensional type, inextensional deformations and linearized deformations. To illustrate the use of our decomposition in nonlinear elasticity, we consider a St Venant-Kirchhoff material and upon various scaling on the applied forces we obtain the \Gamma-limit of the rescaled elastic energy. We first analyze the case of bending forces of order \delta^2 which leads to a nonlinear inextensional model. Smaller pure bending forces give the classical linearized model. A coupled extensional-bending model is obtained for a class of forces of order \delta^2 in traction and of order \delta^3 in bending.
