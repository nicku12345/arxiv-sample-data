In this work we show that the convergence rate of Orthomin(k) applied to systems of the form (I+\rho U) x = b, where U is a unitary operator and 0<\rho<1, is less than or equal to \rho. Moreover, we give examples of operators U and \rho>0 for which the asymptotic convergence rate of Orthomin(k) is exactly \rho, thus showing that the estimate is sharp. While the systems under scrutiny may not be of great interest in themselves, their existence shows that, in general, Orthomin(k) does not converge faster than Orthomin(1). Furthermore, we give examples of systems for which Orthomin(k) has the same asymptotic convergence rate as Orthomin(2) for k\ge 2, but smaller than that of Orthomin(1). The latter systems are related to the numerical solution of certain partial differential equations.
