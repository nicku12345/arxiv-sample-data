A new parametrization (one-to-one onto map) of compact wavelet matrices of rank m and of order and degree N is proposed in terms of coordinates in the Euclidian space R^{(m-1)N}. The developed method depends on Wiener-Hopf factorization of corresponding unitary matrix functions and allows to construct compact wavelet matrices efficiently. Some applications of the proposed method are discussed.
