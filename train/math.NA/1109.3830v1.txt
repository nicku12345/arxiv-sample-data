Higher order tensor inversion is possible for even order. We have shown that a tensor group endowed with the Einstein (contracted) product is isomorphic to the general linear group of degree n. With the isomorphic group structures, we derived new tensor decompositions which we have shown to be related to the well-known canonical polyadic decomposition and multilinear SVD. Moreover, within this group structure framework, multilinear systems are derived, specifically, for solving high dimensional PDEs and large discrete quantum models. We also address multilinear systems which do not fit the framework in the least-squares sense, that is, when the tensor has an odd number of modes or when the tensor has distinct dimensions in each modes. With the notion of tensor inversion, multilinear systems are solvable. Numerically we solve multilinear systems using iterative techniques, namely biconjugate gradient and Jacobi methods in tensor format.
