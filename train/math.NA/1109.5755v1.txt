We introduce a vector differential operator \mathbf{P} and a vector boundary operator \mathbf{B} to derive a reproducing kernel along with its associated Hilbert space which is shown to be embedded in a classical Sobolev space. This reproducing kernel is a Green kernel of differential operator L:=\mathbf{P}^{\ast T}\mathbf{P} with homogeneous or nonhomogeneous boundary conditions given by \mathbf{B}, where we ensure that the distributional adjoint operator \mathbf{P}^{\ast} of \mathbf{P} is well-defined in the distributional sense. We represent the inner product of the reproducing-kernel Hilbert space in terms of the operators \mathbf{P} and \mathbf{B}. In addition, we find relationships for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the reproducing kernel and the operators with homogeneous or nonhomogeneous boundary conditions. These eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are used to compute a series expansion of the reproducing kernel and an orthonormal basis of the reproducing-kernel Hilbert space. Our theoretical results provide perhaps a more intuitive way of understanding what kind of functions are well approximated by the reproducing kernel-based interpolant to a given multivariate data sample.
