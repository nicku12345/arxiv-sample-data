The penalization method is used to take account of obstacles in a tokamak, such as the limiter. We study a non linear hyperbolic system modelling the plasma transport in the area close to the wall. A penalization which cuts the transport term of the momentum is studied. We show numerically that this penalization creates a Dirac measure at the plasma-limiter interface which prevents us from defining the transport term in the usual sense. Hence, a new penalty method is proposed for this hyperbolic system and numerical tests reveal an optimal convergence rate without any spurious boundary layer.
