In this paper we describe a method to compute Generalized Polarization Tensors. These tensors are the coefficients appearing in the multipolar expansion of the steady state voltage perturbation caused by an inhomogeneity of constant conductivity. As an alternative to the integral equation approach, we propose an approximate semi-algebraic method which is easy to implement. This method has been integrated in a Myriapole, a matlab routine with a graphical interface which makes such computations available to non-numerical analysts.
