Motivated by some questions arising in the study of quasistatic growth in brittle fracture, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the energy of the solution u of a Neumann problem near a crack in dimension 2. We consider non smooth cracks K that are merely closed and connected. At any point of density 1/2 in K, we show that the blow-up limit of u is the usual "cracktip" function \sqrt{r}\sin(\theta/2), with a well-defined coefficient (the "stress intensity factor" or SIF). The method relies on Bonnet's monotonicity formula \cite{b} together with \Gamma-convergence techniques.
