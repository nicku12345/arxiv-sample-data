In this paper upper bounds are given for the successive differences A_{n+1}-A_{n} and B_{n}-B_{n-1} where A_{n}=1/(n-1) \tsum_{r=1}^{n-1}f(r/n), B_{n}=1/(n+1) \tsum_{r=0}^{n}f(r/n) and f is superquadratic function. We obtain bounds for the successive differences of the more general sequence 1/c_{n}\tsum_{r=1}^{n}f(a_{r}/b_{n}) when f is superquadratic, which refine known results for convex functions. We also obtain bounds for various successive differences when f is an increasing subquadratic function.
