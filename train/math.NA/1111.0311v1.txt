In this article I present a fast and direct method for solving several types of linear finite difference equations (FDE) with constant coefficients. The method is based on a polynomial form of the translation operator and its inverse, and can be used to find the particular solution of the FDE. This work raises the possibility of developing new ways to expand the scope of the operational methods.
