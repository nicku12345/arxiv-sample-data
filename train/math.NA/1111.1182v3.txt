We propose an error analysis in weak norms of a shock capturing finite element method for the Burgers' equation. The estimates can be related to estimates of certain filtered quantities and are robust in the inviscid limit. Using a total variation apriori bound on the discrete solution and an interpolation inequality error estimates in L^p-norms can are obtained using interpolation.
