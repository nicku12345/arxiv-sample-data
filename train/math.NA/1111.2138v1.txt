In this paper, we introduce a new class of nonnegative tensors --- strictly nonnegative tensors. A weakly irreducible nonnegative tensor is a strictly nonnegative tensor but not vice versa. We show that the spectral radius of a strictly nonnegative tensor is always positive. We give some sufficient and necessary conditions for the six well-conditional classes of nonnegative tensors, introduced in the literature, and a full relationship picture about strictly nonnegative tensors with these six classes of nonnegative tensors. We then establish global R-linear convergence of a power method for finding the spectral radius of a nonnegative tensor under the condition of weak irreducibility. We show that for a nonnegative tensor T, there always exists a partition of the index set such that every tensor induced by the partition is weakly irreducible; and the spectral radius of T can be obtained from those spectral radii of the induced tensors. In this way, we develop a convergent algorithm for finding the spectral radius of a general nonnegative tensor without any additional assumption. The preliminary numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
