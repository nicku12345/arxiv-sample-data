We show that the generalized Bernstein bases in Muntz spaces defined by Hirschman and Widder [7] and extended by Gelfond [6] can be obtained as limits of the Chebyshev-Bernstein bases in Muntz spaces with respect to an interval [a,1] as the real number, a, converges to zero. Such a realization allows for concepts of curve design such as de Casteljau algorithm, blossom, dimension elevation to be translated from the general theory of Chebyshev blossom in Muntz spaces to these generalized Bernstein bases that we termed here as Gelfond-Bernstein bases. The advantage of working with Gelfond-Bernstein bases lies in the simplicity of the obtained concepts and algorithms as compared to their Chebyshev-Bernstein bases counterparts.
