This article is devoted to the study of multivalued semigroups and their asymptotic behavior, with particular attention to iterations of set-valued mappings. After developing a general abstract framework, we present an application to a time discretization of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. More precisely, we prove that the fully implicit Euler scheme generates a family of discrete multivalued dynamical systems, whose global attractors converge to the global attractor of the continuous system as the time-step parameter approaches zero.
