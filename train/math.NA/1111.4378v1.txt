Pursuing our work in [18], [17], [20], [5], we consider in this article the two-dimensional thermohydraulics equations. We discretize these equations in time using the implicit Euler scheme and we prove that the global attractors generated by the numerical scheme converge to the global attractor of the continuous system as the time-step approaches zero.
