Although QR iterations dominate in eigenvalue computations, there are several important cases when alternative LR-type algorithms may be preferable. In particular, in the symmetric tridiagonal case where differential qd algorithm with shifts (dqds) proposed by Fernando and Parlett enjoys often faster convergence while preserving high relative accuracy (that is not guaranteed in QR algorithm). In eigenvalue computations for rank-structured matrices QR algorithm is also a popular choice since, in the symmetric case, the rank structure is preserved. In the unsymmetric case, however, QR algorithm destroys the rank structure and, hence, LR-type algorithms come to play once again. In the current paper we discover several variants of qd algorithms for quasiseparable matrices. Remarkably, one of them, when applied to Hessenberg matrices becomes a direct generalization of dqds algorithm for tridiagonal matrices. Therefore, it can be applied to such important matrices as companion and confederate, and provides an alternative algorithm for finding roots of a polynomial represented in the basis of orthogonal polynomials. Results of preliminary numerical experiments are presented.
