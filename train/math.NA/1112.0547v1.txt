Geometric integration theory can be employed when numerically solving ODEs or PDEs with constraints. In this paper, we present several one-step algorithms of various orders for ODEs on a collection of spheres. To demonstrate the versatility of these algorithms, we present representative calculations for reduced free rigid body motion (a conservative ODE) and a discretization of micromagnetics (a dissipative PDE). We emphasize the role of isotropy in geometric integration and link numerical integration schemes to modern differential geometry through the use of partial connection forms; this theoretical framework generalizes moving frames and connections on principal bundles to manifolds with nonfree actions.
