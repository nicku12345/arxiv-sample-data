Methods of Pad\'e approximation are used to analyse a multivariate Markov transform which has been recently introduced by the authors, and which is generalizing the well-known in Spectral theory Stieltjes transform (Markov function) of one-dimensional measure. The first main result is a characterization of the rationality of the Markov transform via Hankel determinants. The second main result is a cubature formula for a special class of measures.
