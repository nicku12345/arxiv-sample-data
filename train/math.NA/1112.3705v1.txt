By the standard theory, the stable Q_{k+1,k}-Q_{k,k+1}/Q_{k}^{dc'} divergence-free element converges with the optimal order of approximation for the Stokes equations, but only order k for the velocity in H^1-norm and the pressure in L^2-norm. This is due to one polynomial degree less in y direction for the first component of velocity, a Q_{k+1,k} polynomial. In this manuscript, we will show a superconvergence of the divergence free element that the order of convergence is truly k+1, for both velocity and pressure. Numerical tests are provided confirming the sharpness of the theory.
