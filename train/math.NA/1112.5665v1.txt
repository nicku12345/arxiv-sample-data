We present a new algorithm for numerical computation of large eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet Laplacian in a smooth, star-shaped domain in \mathbb{R}^d, d\ge 2. Conventional boundary-based methods require a root-search in eigenfrequency k, hence take O(N^3) effort per eigenpair found, using dense linear algebra, where N=O(k^{d-1}) is the number of unknowns required to discretize the boundary. Our method is O(N) faster, achieved by linearizing with respect to k the spectrum of a weighted interior Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) operator for the Helmholtz equation. Approximations \hat{k}_j to the square-roots k_j of all O(N) eigenvalues lying in [k - \epsilon, k], where \epsilon=O(1), are found with O(N^3) effort. We prove an error estimate  |\hat k_j - k_j| \leq C \Big(\frac{\epsilon^2}{k} + \epsilon^3 \Big),  with C independent of k. We present a higher-order variant with eigenvalue error scaling empirically as O(\epsilon^5) and eigenfunction error as O(\epsilon^3), the former improving upon the 'scaling method' of Vergini--Saraceno. For planar domains (d=2), with an assumption of absence of spectral concentration, we also prove rigorous error bounds that are close to those numerically observed. For d=2 we compute robustly the spectrum of the NtD operator via potential theory, Nystr\"{o}m discretization, and the Cayley transform. At high frequencies (400 wavelengths across), with eigenfrequency relative error 10^{-10}, we show that the method is 10^3 times faster than standard ones based upon a root-search.
