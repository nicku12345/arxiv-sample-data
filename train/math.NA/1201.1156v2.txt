In this paper, a fully discrete local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) finite element method is considered for solving the time-fractional KdV-Burgers-Kuramoto (KBK) equation. The scheme is based on a finite difference method in time and local discontinuous Galerkin methods in space. We prove that our scheme is unconditional stable and L^2 error estimate for the linear case with the convergence rate O(h^{k+1}+(\Delta t)^2+(\Delta t)^\frac{\alpha}{2}h^{k+1/2}). Numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency and accuracy of our scheme.
