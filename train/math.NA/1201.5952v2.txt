We present a novel numerical method, called {\tt Jacobi-predictor-corrector approach}, for the numerical solution of fractional ordinary differential equations based on the polynomial interpolation and the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature w.r.t. the Jacobi-weight function \omega(s)=(1-s)^{\alpha-1}(1+s)^0. This method has the computational cost O(N) and the convergent order IN, where N and IN are, respectively, the total computational steps and the number of used interpolating points. The detailed error analysis is performed, and the extensive numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and show the robustness of this method.
