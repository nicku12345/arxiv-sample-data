In order to approximate the integral I(f)=\int_a^b f(x) dx, where f is a sufficiently smooth function, models for quadrature rules are developed using a given {\it panel} of n (n\geq 2) equally spaced points. These models arise from the undetermined coefficients method, using a Newton's basis for polynomials. Although part of the final product is algebraically equivalent to the well known closed Newton-Cotes rules, the algorithms obtained are not the classical ones.   In the basic model the most simple quadrature rule Q_n is adopted (the so-called left rectangle rule) and a correction \tilde E_n is constructed, so that the final rule S_n=Q_n+\tilde E_n is interpolatory. The correction \tilde E_n, depending on the divided differences of the data, might be considered a {\em realistic correction} for Q_n, in the sense that \tilde E_n should be close to the magnitude of the true error of Q_n, having also the correct sign. The analysis of the theoretical error of the rule S_n as well as some classical properties for divided differences suggest the inclusion of one or two new points in the given panel. When n is even it is included one point and two points otherwise. In both cases this approach enables the computation of a {\em realistic error} \bar E_{S_n} for the {\it extended or corrected} rule S_n. The respective output (Q_n,\tilde E_n, S_n, \bar E_{S_n}) contains reliable information on the quality of the approximations Q_n and S_n, provided certain conditions involving ratios for the derivatives of the function f are fulfilled. These simple rules are easily converted into {\it composite} ones. Numerical examples are presented showing that these quadrature rules are useful as a computational alternative to the classical Newton-Cotes formulas.
