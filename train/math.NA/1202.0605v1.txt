Here a semi-implicit formulation of the gradient augmented level set method is presented. By tracking both the level set and it's gradient accurate subgrid information is provided,leading to highly accurate descriptions of a moving interface. The result is a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian method that may be easily applied in two or three dimensions. The new approach allows for the investigation of interfaces evolving by mean curvature and by the intrinsic Laplacian of the curvature. In this work the algorithm, convergence and accuracy results are presented. Several numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions demonstrate the stability of the scheme.
