The generalized sequence of numbers is defined by W_{n}=pW_{n-1}+qW_{n-2} with initial conditions W_{0}=a and W_{1}=b for a,b,p,q\inZ and n\geq2, respectively. Let W_{n}=circ(W_{1},W_{2},...,W_{n}). The aim of this paper is to establish some useful formulas for the determinants and inverses of W_{n} using the nice properties of the number sequences. Matrix decompositions are derived for W_{n} in order to obtain the results.
