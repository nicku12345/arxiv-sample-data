A new weak Galerkin (WG) method is introduced and analyzed for the second order elliptic equation formulated as a system of two first order linear equations. This method, called WG-MFEM, is designed by using discontinuous piecewise polynomials on finite element partitions with arbitrary shape of polygons/polyhedra. The WG-MFEM is capable of providing very accurate numerical approximations for both the primary and flux variables. Allowing the use of discontinuous approximating functions on arbitrary shape of polygons/polyhedra makes the method highly flexible in practical computation. Optimal order error estimates in both discrete H^1 and L^2 norms are established for the corresponding weak Galerkin mixed finite element solutions.
