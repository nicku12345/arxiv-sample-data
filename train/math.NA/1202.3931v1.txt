A stationary subdivision scheme generates the full space of polynomials of degree up to k if and only if its mask satisfies sum rules of order k+1, or its symbol satisfies zero conditions of order k+1. This property is often called the polynomial reproduction property of the subdivision scheme. It is a well-known fact that this property is, in general, only necessary for the associated refinable function to have approximation order k+1.   In this paper we study a different polynomial reproduction property of multivariate scalar subdivision scheme with dilation matrix mI, |m| \ge 2. Namely, we are interested in capability of a subdivision scheme to reproduce in the limit exactly the same polynomials from which the data is sampled. The motivation for this paper are the results by Adi Levin that state that such a reproduction property of degree k of the subdivision scheme is sufficient for having approximation order k+1.   Our main result yields simple algebraic conditions on the subdivision symbol for computing the exact degree of such polynomial reproduction and also for determining the associated parametrization. The parametrization determines the grid points to which the newly computed values are attached at each subdivision iteration to ensure the higher degree of polynomial reproduction. We illustrate our results with several examples.
