A new technique for calculating the normal forms associated with the map restricted to the center manifold of a class of parameterized maps near the fixed point is given first. Then we show the Takens-Bogdanov point of delay differential equations is inherited by the forward Euler method without any shift and turns into a 1:1 resonance point. The normal form near the 1:1 resonance point for the numerical discretization is calculated next by applying the new technique to the map defined by the forward Euler method. The local dynamical behaviors are analyzed in detail through the normal form. It shows the Hopf point branch and the homoclinic branch emanating from the Takens-Bogdanov point are O(\varepsilon) shifted by the forward Euler method, where \varepsilon is step size. At last, a numerical experiment is carried to show the results.
