We prove several discrete Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev and Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequalities for some approximations with arbitrary boundary values on finite volume meshes. The keypoint of our approach is to use the continuous embedding of the space BV(\Omega) into L^{N/(N-1)}(\Omega) for a Lipschitz domain  \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}, with N \geq 2. Finally, we give several applications to discrete duality finite volume (DDFV) schemes which are used for the approximation of nonlinear and non isotropic elliptic and parabolic problems.
