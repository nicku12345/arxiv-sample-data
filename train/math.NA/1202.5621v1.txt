In this paper, we introduce a new adaptive data analysis method to study trend and instantaneous frequency of nonlinear and non-stationary data. This method is inspired by the Empirical Mode Decomposition method (EMD) and the recently developed compressed (compressive) sensing theory. The main idea is to look for the sparsest representation of multiscale data within the largest possible dictionary consisting of intrinsic mode functions of the form \{a(t) \cos(\theta(t))\}, where a \in V(\theta), V(\theta) consists of the functions smoother than \cos(\theta(t)) and \theta'\ge 0. This problem can be formulated as a nonlinear L^0 optimization problem. In order to solve this optimization problem, we propose a nonlinear matching pursuit method by generalizing the classical matching pursuit for the L^0 optimization problem. One important advantage of this nonlinear matching pursuit method is it can be implemented very efficiently and is very stable to noise. Further, we provide a convergence analysis of our nonlinear matching pursuit method under certain scale separation assumptions. Extensive numerical examples will be given to demonstrate the robustness of our method and comparison will be made with the EMD/EEMD method. We also apply our method to study data without scale separation, data with intra-wave frequency modulation, and data with incomplete or under-sampled data.
