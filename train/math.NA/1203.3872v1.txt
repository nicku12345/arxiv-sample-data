In this paper, the axial vibration of cracked beams, the free flexural vibrations of nanobeams and plates based on Timoshenko beam theory and first-order shear deformable plate theory, respectively, using Eringen's nonlocal elasticity theory is numerically studied. The field variable is approximated by Lagrange polynomials and non-uniform rational B-splines. The influence of the nonlocal parameter, the beam and the plate aspect ratio and the boundary conditions on the natural frequency is numerically studied. The influence of a crack on axial vibration is also studied. The results obtained from this study are found to be in good agreement with those reported in the literature.
