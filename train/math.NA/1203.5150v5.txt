Let n be a positive integer and m be a positive even integer. Let {\mathcal A} be an m^{th} order n-dimensional real weakly symmetric tensor and {\mathcal B} be a real weakly symmetric positive definite tensor of the same size. \lambda \in R is called a {\mathcal B}_r-eigenvalue of {\mathcal A} if {\mathcal A} x^{m-1} = \lambda {\mathcal B} x^{m-1} for some x \in R^n \backslash \{0\}. In this paper, we introduce two unconstrained optimization problems and obtain some variational characterizations for the minimum and maximum {\mathcal B}_r--eigenvalues of {\mathcal A}. Our results extend Auchmuty's unconstrained variational principles for eigenvalues of real symmetric matrices. This unconstrained optimization approach can be used to find a Z-, H-, or D-eigenvalue of an even order weakly symmetric tensor. We provide some numerical results to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach for finding a Z-eigenvalue and for determining the positive semidefiniteness of an even order symmetric tensor.
