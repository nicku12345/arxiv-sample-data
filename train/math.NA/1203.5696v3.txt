The Wendland functions are a class of compactly supported radial basis functions with a user-specified smoothness parameter. We prove that with a linear change of variables, both the original and the "missing" Wendland functions converge uniformly to a Gaussian as the smoothness parameter approaches infinity. We also give numerical experiments with Wendland functions of different smoothness.
