We develop the analysis of finite element approximations of implicit power-law-like models for viscous incompressible fluids. The Cauchy stress and the symmetric part of the velocity gradient in the class of models under consideration are related by a, possibly multi--valued, maximal monotone r-graph, with 1<r<\infty. Using a variety of weak compactness techniques, including Chacon's biting lemma and Young measures, we show that a subsequence of the sequence of finite element solutions converges to a weak solution of the problem as the finite element discretization parameter h tends to 0. A key new technical tool in our analysis is a finite element counterpart of the Acerbi--Fusco Lipschitz truncation of Sobolev functions.
