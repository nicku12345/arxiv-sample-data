We apply successfully the Compressive Sensing approach for Image Analysis using the new family of Polyharmonic Subdivision wavelets. We show that this approach provides a very efficient recovery of the images based on fewer samples than the traditional Shannon-Nyquist paradigm. We provide the results of experiments with PHSD wavelets and Daubechies wavelets, for the Lena image and astronomical images.
