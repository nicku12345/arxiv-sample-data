The discrete Fourier analysis on the 30^{\degree}-60^{\degree}-90^{\degree} triangle is deduced from the corresponding results on the regular hexagon by considering functions invariant under the group G_2, which leads to the definition of four families generalized Chebyshev polynomials. The study of these polynomials leads to a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem that contains two parameters, whose solutions are analogues of the Jacobi polynomials. Under a concept of m-degree and by introducing a new ordering among monomials, these polynomials are shown to share properties of the ordinary orthogonal polynomials. In particular, their common zeros generate cubature rules of Gauss type.
