We develop a numerical method for realizing mean curvature motion of interfaces separating multiple phases, whose areas are preserved throughout time. The foundation of the method is a thresholding algorithm of the Bence-Merriman-Osher type. The original algorithm is reformulated in a vector setting, which allows for a natural inclusion of constraints, even in the multiphase case. Moreover, a new method for overcoming the inaccuracy of thresholding methods on non-adaptive grids is designed, since this inaccuracy becomes especially prominent in area-preserving motions. Formal analysis of the method and numerical tests are presented.
