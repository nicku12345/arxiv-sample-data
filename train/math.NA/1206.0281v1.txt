The vector of weights of an interpolatory quadrature rule with n preassigned nodes is shown to be the least-squares solution \omega of an overdetermined linear system here called {\em the fundamental system} of the rule. It is established the relation between \omega and the minimax solution \stackrel{\ast}{z} of the fundamental system, and shown the constancy of the \infty-norms of the respective residual vectors which are equal to the {\em principal moment} of the rule. Associated to \omega and \stackrel{\ast}{z} we define several parameters, such as the angle of a rule, in order to assess the main properties of a rule or to compare distinct rules. These parameters are tested for some Newton-Cotes, Fej\'er, Clenshaw-Curtis and Gauss-Legendre rules.
