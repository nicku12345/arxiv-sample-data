We discuss the application of multilevel Monte Carlo methods to elliptic partial differential equations with random coefficients. Such problems arise, for example, in uncertainty quantification in subsurface flow modeling. We give a brief review of recent advances in the numerical analysis of the multilevel algorithm under minimal assumptions on the random coefficient, and extend the analysis to cover also tensor--valued coefficients, as well as point evaluations. Our analysis includes as an example log--normal random coefficients, which are frequently used in applications.
