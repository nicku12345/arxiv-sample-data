We present and analyze a discontinuous variant of the hp-version of the boundary element Galerkin method with quasi-uniform meshes. The model problem is that of the hypersingular integral operator on an (open or closed) polyhedral surface. We prove a quasi-optimal error estimate and conclude convergence orders which are quasi-optimal for the h-version with arbitrary degree and almost quasi-optimal for the p-version. Numerical results underline the theory.
