We present and analyze a finite volume scheme of arbitrary order for elliptic equations in the one-dimensional setting. In this scheme, the control volumes are constructed by using the Gauss points in subintervals of the underlying mesh. We provide a unified proof for the inf-sup condition, and show that our finite volume scheme has optimal convergence rate under the energy and L^2 norms of the approximate error. Furthermore, we prove that the derivative error is superconvergent at all Gauss points and in some special case, the convergence rate can reach h^{2r}, where r is the polynomial degree of the trial space. All theoretical results are justified by numerical tests.
