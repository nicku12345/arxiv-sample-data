In this paper we propose and analyse composite Filon-Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules for integrals of the form I_{k}^{[a,b]}(f,g) := \int_a^b f(x) \exp(\mathrm{i}kg(x)) \rd x , where k \geq 0, f may have integrable singularities and g may have stationary points. Our composite rule is defined on a mesh with M subintervals and requires MN+1 evaluations of f. It satisfies an error estimate of the form C_N k^{-r} M^{-N-1 + r}, where r is determined by the strength of any singularity in f and the order of any stationary points in g and C_N is a constant which is independent of k and M, but depends on N. The regularity requirements on f and g are explicit in the error estimates. For fixed k, the rate of convergence of the rule as M \rightarrow \infty is the same as would be obtained if f was smooth. Moreover, the quadrature error decays at least as fast as k \rightarrow \infty as does the original integral I_{k}^{[a,b]}(f,g). For the case of nonlinear oscillators g, the algorithm requires the evaluation of g^{-1} at non-stationary points. Numerical results demonstrate the sharpness of the theory. An application to the implementation of boundary integral methods for the high-frequency Helmholtz equation is given.
