Let x_1,...,x_{n} be real numbers, P(x)=p_n(x-x_1)...(x-x_n), and Q(x) be a polynomial of degree less than or equal to n. Denote by \Delta(Q) the matrix of generalized divided differences of Q(x) with nodes x_1,...,x_n and by B(P,Q) the Bezout matrix (Bezoutiant) of P and Q. A relationship between the corresponding principal minors, counted from the right-hand lower corner, of the matrices B(P,Q) and \Delta(Q) is established. It implies that if the principal minors of the matrix of divided differences of a function g(x) are positive or have alternating signs then the roots of the Newton's interpolation polynomial of g are real and separated by the nodes of interpolation.
