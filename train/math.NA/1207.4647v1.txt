We design consistent discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes for the approximation of the Euler-Korteweg and the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg systems. We show that the scheme for the Euler-Korteweg system is energy and mass conservative and that the scheme for the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system is mass conservative and monotonically energy dissipative. In this case the dissipation is isolated to viscous effects, that is, there is no numerical dissipation. In this sense the methods is consistent with the energy dissipation of the continuous PDE systems.
