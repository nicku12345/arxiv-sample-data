We analyse the dynamics of expectation values of quantum observables for the time-dependent semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation. To benefit from the positivity of Husimi functions, we switch between observables obtained from Weyl and Anti-Wick quantization. We develop and prove a second order Egorov type propagation theorem with Husimi functions by establishing transition and commutator rules for Weyl and Anti-Wick operators. We provide a discretized version of our theorem and present numerical experiments for Schr\"odinger equations in dimensions two and six that validate our results.
