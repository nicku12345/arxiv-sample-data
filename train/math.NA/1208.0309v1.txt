A finite volume scheme for the (Patlak-) Keller-Segel model in two space dimensions with an additional cross-diffusion term in the elliptic equation for the chemical signal is analyzed. The main feature of the model is that there exists a new entropy functional yielding gradient estimates for the cell density and chemical concentration. The main features of the numerical scheme are positivity preservation, mass conservation, entropy stability, and - under additional assumptions - entropy dissipation. The existence of a discrete solution and its numerical convergence to the continuous solution is proved. Furthermore, temporal decay rates for convergence of the discrete solution to the homogeneous steady state is shown using a new discrete logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Numerical examples point out that the solutions exhibit intermediate states and that there exist nonhomogeneous stationary solutions with a finite cell density peak at the domain boundary.
