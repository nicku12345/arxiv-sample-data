The ideas of instantaneous amplitude and phase are well understood for signals with real-valued samples, based on the analytic signal which is a complex signal with one-sided Fourier transform. We extend these ideas to signals with complex-valued samples, using a quaternion-valued equivalent of the analytic signal obtained from a one-sided quaternion Fourier transform which we refer to as the hypercomplex representation of the complex signal. We present the necessary properties of the quaternion Fourier transform, particularly its symmetries in the frequency domain and formulae for convolution and the quaternion Fourier transform of the Hilbert transform. The hypercomplex representation may be interpreted as an ordered pair of complex signals or as a quaternion signal. We discuss its derivation and properties and show that its quaternion Fourier transform is one-sided. It is shown how to derive from the hypercomplex representation a complex envelope and a phase.   A classical result in the case of real signals is that an amplitude modulated signal may be analysed into its envelope and carrier using the analytic signal provided that the modulating signal has frequency content not overlapping with that of the carrier. We show that this idea extends to the complex case, provided that the complex signal modulates an orthonormal complex exponential. Orthonormal complex modulation can be represented mathematically by a polar representation of quaternions previously derived by the authors. As in the classical case, there is a restriction of non-overlapping frequency content between the modulating complex signal and the orthonormal complex exponential. We show that, under these conditions, modulation in the time domain is equivalent to a frequency shift in the quaternion Fourier domain. Examples are presented to demonstrate these concepts.
