In this paper we use a splitting technique to develop new multiscale basis functions for the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM). The multiscale basis functions are iteratively generated using a Green's kernel. The Green's kernel is based on the first differential operator of the splitting. The proposed MsFEM is applied to deterministic elliptic equations and stochastic elliptic equations, and we show that the proposed MsFEM can considerably reduce the dimension of the random parameter space for stochastic problems. By combining the method with sparse grid collocation methods, the need for a prohibitive number of deterministic solves is alleviated. We rigorously analyze the convergence of the proposed method for both the deterministic and stochastic elliptic equations. Computational complexity discussions are also offered to supplement the convergence analysis. A number of numerical results are presented to confirm the theoretical findings.
