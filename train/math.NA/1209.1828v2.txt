We consider the numerical approximation of a general second order semi--linear parabolic partial differential equation. Equations of this type arise in many contexts, such as transport in porous media which is fundamental in many geo-engineering applications, including oil and gas recovery from subsurface. Using the finite volume with two-point flux approximation on regular mesh combined with exponential time differencing of order one (ETD1) for temporal discretization, we derive the L^{2} estimate under the assumption that the non linear term is locally Lipschitz. Numerical simulations to sustain the theoretical results are provided.
