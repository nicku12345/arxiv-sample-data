Newest vertex bisection (NVB) is a popular local mesh-refinement strategy for regular triangulations which consist of simplices. For the 2D case, we prove that the mesh-closure step of NVB, which preserves regularity of the triangulation, is quasi-optimal and that the corresponding L2-projection onto lowest-order Courant finite elements (P1-FEM) is always H1-stable. Throughout, no additional assumptions on the initial triangulation are imposed. Our analysis thus improves results of Binev, Dahmen & DeVore (Numer. Math. 97, 2004), Carstensen (Constr. Approx. 20, 2004), and Stevenson (Math. Comp. 77, 2008) in the sense that all assumptions of their theorems are removed. Consequently, our results relax the requirements under which adaptive finite element schemes can be mathematically guaranteed to convergence with quasi-optimal rates.
