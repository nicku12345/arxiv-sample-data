In this paper an inverse preconditioner for the numerical solution of an elliptic Laplace prob- lem of a global circulation ocean model is presented. The inverse preconditiong technique is adopted in order to efficiently compute the numerical solution of the elliptic kernel by using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method. We show how the performance and the rate of conver- gence of the solver are linked to the discretized grid resolution and to the Laplace coefficients of the oceanic model. Finally, we describe an easy-to-implement version of the solver on the Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) by means of scientific computing libraries and we discuss its performance.
