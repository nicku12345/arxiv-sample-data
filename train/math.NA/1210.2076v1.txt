In this paper we prove a priori and a posteriori error estimates for a multiscale numerical method for computing equilibria of multilattices under an external force. The error estimates are derived in a W^{1,\infty} norm in one space dimension. One of the features of our analysis is that we establish an equivalent way of formulating the coarse-grained problem which greatly simplifies derivation of the error bounds (both, a priori and a posteriori). We illustrate our error estimates with numerical experiments.
