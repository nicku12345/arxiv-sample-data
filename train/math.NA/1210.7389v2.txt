We develop a variational multiscale proper orthogonal decomposition reduced-order model for turbulent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The error analysis of the full discretization of the model is presented. All error contributions are considered: the spatial discretization error (due to the finite element discretization), the temporal discretization error (due to the backward Euler method), and the proper orthogonal decomposition truncation error. Numerical tests for a three-dimensional turbulent flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re=1000 show the improved physical accuracy of the new model over the standard Galerkin and mixing-length proper orthogonal decomposition reduced-order models. The high computational efficiency of the new model is also showcased. Finally, the theoretical error estimates are confirmed by numerical simulations of a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes problem.
