The Landau-Kolmogorov problem consists of finding the upper bound M_k for the norm of intermediate derivative |f^{(k)}|, when the bounds |f| \le M_0 and |f^{(n)}| \le M_n, for the norms of the function and of its higher derivative, are given.   Here, we consider the case of a finite interval, and when all the norms are the max-norms. Our interest to that particular case is motivated by the fact that there are good chances to add this case to a short list of Landau--Kolmogorov inequalities where a complete solution exists, i.e., a solution that covers all values of n,k\in\N (and, for a finite interval, all values of \sigma = M_n/M_0).   The main guideline here is Karlin's conjecture that says that, for all n,k\in\N and all \sigma>0, the maximum of |f^{(k)}| is attained by a certain Chebyshev or Zolotarev spline. So far, it has been proved only for small n \ge 4 with all \sigma, and for all n with particular \sigma = \sigma_n. Here, we prove Karlin's conjecture in several further subcases:   1) all n,k\in\N and all 0 < \sigma \le \sigma_n   2) all n \in \N, all \sigma > 0, with k=1,2   3) all \sigma > 0, with n < 10 and 0 < k < n.
