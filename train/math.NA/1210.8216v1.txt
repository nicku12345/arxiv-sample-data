For linear elastic problems, it is well-known that mesh generation dominates the total analysis time. Different types of methods have been proposed to directly or indirectly alleviate this burden associated with mesh generation. We review in this paper a subset of such methods centred on tighter coupling between computer aided design (CAD) and analysis (finite element or boundary element methods). We focus specifically on frameworks which rely on constructing a discretisation directly from the functions used to describe the geometry of the object in CAD. Examples include B-spline subdivision surfaces, isogeometric analysis, NURBS-enhanced FEM and parametric-based implicit boundary definitions. We review recent advances in these methods and compare them to other paradigms which also aim at alleviating the burden of mesh generation in computational mechanics.
