We analyze adaptive mesh-refining algorithms for conforming finite element discretizations of certain non-linear second-order partial differential equations. We allow continuous polynomials of arbitrary, but fixed polynomial order. The adaptivity is driven by the residual error estimator. We prove convergence even with optimal algebraic convergence rates. In particular, our analysis covers general linear second-order elliptic operators. Unlike prior works for linear non-symmetric operators, our analysis avoids the interior node property for the refinement, and the differential operator has to satisfy a G\r{a}rding inequality only. If the differential operator is uniformly elliptic, no additional assumption on the initial mesh is posed.
