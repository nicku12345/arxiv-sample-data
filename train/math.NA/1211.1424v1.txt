This paper addresses the properties of Continuous Interior Penalty (CIP) finite element solutions for the Helmholtz equation. The h-version of the CIP finite element method with piecewise linear approximation is applied to a one-dimensional model problem. We first show discrete well posedness and convergence results, using the imaginary part of the stabilization operator, for the complex Helmholtz equation. Then we consider a method with real valued penalty parameter and prove an error estimate of the discrete solution in the H^1-norm, as the sum of best approximation plus a pollution term that is the order of the phase difference. It is proved that the pollution can be eliminated by selecting the penalty parameter appropriately. As a result of this analysis, thorough and rigorous understanding of the error behavior throughout the range of convergence is gained. Numerical results are presented that show sharpness of the error estimates and highlight some phenomena of the discrete solution behavior.
