The aim of this work is to consider multiscale algorithms for solving PDEs with Galerkin methods on bounded domains. We provide results on convergence and condition numbers. We show how to handle PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We also investigate convergence in terms of the mesh norms and the angles between subspaces to better understand the differences between the algorithms and the observed results. We also consider the issue of the supports of the RBFs overlapping the boundary in our stability analysis, which has not been considered in the literature, to the best of our knowledge.
