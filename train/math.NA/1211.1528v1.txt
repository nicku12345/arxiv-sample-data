These pages contain a short overview on the state of the art of efficient numerical analysis methods that solve systems of multivariate polynomial equations. We focus on the work of Steve Smale who initiated this research framework, and on the collaboration between Stephen Smale and Michael Shub, which set the foundations of this approach to polynomial system--solving, culminating in the more recent advances of Carlos Beltran, Luis Miguel Pardo, Peter Buergisser and Felipe Cucker.
