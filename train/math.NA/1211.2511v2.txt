The inverse of the star-discrepancy N^*(d,\ve) denotes the smallest possible cardinality of a set of points in [0,1]^d achieving a star-discrepancy of at most \ve. By a result of Heinrich, Novak, Wasilkowski and Wo{\'z}niakowski,  N^*(d,\ve) \leq c_{\textup{abs}} d \ve^{-2}.  Here the dependence on the dimension d is optimal, while the precise dependence on \ve is an open problem. In the present paper we prove that  N^*(d,\ve) \leq c_{\textup{abs}} d \ve^{-3/2} (\log (\ve^{-1}))^{1/2}.  This is a surprising result, which disproves a conjecture of Novak and Wo{\'z}niakowski.
