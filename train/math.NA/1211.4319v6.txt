Let X_n = \{x^j\}_{j=1}^n be a set of n points in the d-cube [0,1]^d, and \Phi_n = \{\varphi_j\}_{j =1}^n a family of n functions on [0,1]^d. We consider the approximate recovery functions f on [0,1]^d from the sampled values f(x^1), ..., f(x^n), by the linear sampling algorithm \begin{equation} \nonumber L_n(X_n,\Phi_n,f) \ := \ \sum_{j=1}^n f(x^j)\varphi_j. \end{equation} The error of sampling recovery is measured in the norm of the space L_q([0,1]^d)-norm or the energy norm of the isotropic Sobolev sapce W^\gamma_q([0,1]^d) for 0 < q \le \infty and \gamma > 0. Functions f to be recovered are from the unit ball in Besov type spaces of an anisotropic smoothness, in particular, spaces B^a_{p,\theta} of a nonuniform mixed smoothness a \in {\mathbb R}^d_+, and spaces B^{\alpha,\beta}_{p,\theta} of a "hybrid" of mixed smoothness \alpha > 0 and isotropic smoothness \beta \in \mathbb R. We constructed optimal linear sampling algorithms L_n(X_n^*,\Phi_n^*,\cdot) on special sparse grids X_n^* and a family \Phi_n^* of linear combinations of integer or half integer translated dilations of tensor products of B-splines. We computed the asymptotic of the error of the optimal recovery. This construction is based on a B-spline quasi-interpolation representations of functions in B^a_{p,\theta} and B^{\alpha,\beta}_{p,\theta}. As consequences we obtained the asymptotic of optimal cubature formulas for numerical integration of functions from the unit ball of these Besov type spaces.
