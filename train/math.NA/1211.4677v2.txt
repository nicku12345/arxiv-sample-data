This paper is devoted to the L^2 norm error estimate of the Adini element for the biharmonic equation. Surprisingly, a lower bound is established which proves that the  L^2 norm convergence rate can not be higher than that in the energy norm. This proves the conjecture of [Lascaux and Lesaint, Some nonconforming finite elements for the plate bending problem, RAIRO Anal. Numer. 9 (1975), pp. 9--53.] that the convergence rates in both L^2 and H^1 norms can not be higher than that in the energy norm for this element.
