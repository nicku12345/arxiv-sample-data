A C^0-weak Galerkin (WG) method is introduced and analyzed for solving the biharmonic equation in 2D and 3D. A weak Laplacian is defined for C^0 functions in the new weak formulation. This WG finite element formulation is symmetric, positive definite and parameter free. Optimal order error estimates are established in both a discrete H^2 norm and the L^2 norm, for the weak Galerkin finite element solution. Numerical results are presented to confirm the theory. As a technical tool, a refined Scott-Zhang interpolation operator is constructed to assist the corresponding error estimate. This refined interpolation preserves the volume mass of order (k+1-d) and the surface mass of order (k+2-d) for the P_{k+2} finite element functions in d-dimensional space.
