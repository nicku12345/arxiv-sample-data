In this paper we propose and analyze a new coupling procedure for the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Method with Galerkin Boundary Element Methods based on a double layer potential representation of the exterior component of the solution of a transmission problem. We show a discrete uniform coercivity estimate for the non-symmetric bilinear form and prove optimal convergence estimates for all the variables, as well as superconvergence for some of the discrete fields. Some numerical experiments support the theoretical findings.
