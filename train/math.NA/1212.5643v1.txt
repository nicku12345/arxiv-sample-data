A multiresolution analysis is a nested chain of related approximation spaces.This nesting in turn implies relationships among interpolation bases in the approximation spaces and their derived wavelet spaces. Using these relationships, a necessary and sufficient condition is given for existence of interpolation wavelets, via analysis of the corresponding scaling functions. It is also shown that any interpolation function for an approximation space plays the role of a special type of scaling function (an interpolation scaling function) when the corresponding family of approximation spaces forms a multiresolution analysis. Based on these interpolation scaling functions, a new algorithm is proposed for constructing corresponding interpolation wavelets (when they exist in a multiresolution analysis). In simulations, our theorems are tested for several typical wavelet spaces, demonstrating our theorems for existence of interpolation wavelets and for constructing them in a general multiresolution analysis.
