In this paper we propose and analyze a fully discrete method for a direct boundary integral formulation of the scattering of a transient acoustic wave by a sound-soft obstacle. The method uses Galerkin-BEM in the space variables and three different choices of time-stepping strategies based on Convolution Quadrature. The numerical analysis of the method is carried out directly in the time domain, not reverting to Laplace transform techniques.
