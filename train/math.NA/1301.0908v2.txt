This paper extends the Method of Particular Solutions (MPS) to the computation of eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of plates. Specific approximation schemes are developed, with plane waves (MPS-PW) or Fourier-Bessel functions (MPS-FB). This framework also requires a suitable formulation of the boundary conditions. Numerical tests, on two plates with various boundary conditions, demonstrate that the proposed approach provides competitive results with standard numerical schemes such as the Finite Element Method, at reduced complexity, and with large flexibility in the implementation choices.
