A new class of nonparametric nonconforming quadrilateral finite elements is introduced which has the midpoint continuity and the mean value continuity at the interfaces of elements simultaneously as the rectangular DSSY element [J.Douglas, Jr., J. E. Santos, D. Sheen, and X. Ye. Nonconforming {G}alerkin methods based on quadrilateral elements for second order elliptic problems. ESAIM--Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 33(4):747--770, 1999]. The parametric DSSY element for general quadrilaterals requires five degrees of freedom to have an optimal order of convergence [Z. Cai, J. Douglas, Jr., J. E. Santos, D. Sheen, and X. Ye. Nonconforming quadrilateral finite elements: A correction. Calcolo, 37(4):253--254, 2000], while the new nonparametric DSSY elements require only four degrees of freedom. The design of new elements is based on the decomposition of a bilinear transform into a simple bilinear map followed by a suitable affine map. Numerical results are presented to compare the new elements with the parametric DSSY element.
