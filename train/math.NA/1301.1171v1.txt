In the present paper we study high-order cubature formulas for the computation of advection-diffusion potentials over boxes. By using the basis functions introduced in the theory of approximate approximations, the cubature of a potential is reduced to the quadrature of one dimensional integrals. For densities with separated approximation, we derive a tensor product representation of the integral operator which admits efficient cubature procedures in very high dimensions. Numerical tests show that these formulas are accurate and provide approximation of order O(h^6) up to dimension 10^8.
