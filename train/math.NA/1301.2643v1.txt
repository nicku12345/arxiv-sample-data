We propose a locally one dimensional (LOD) finite difference method for multidimensional Riesz fractional diffusion equation with variable coefficients on a finite domain. The numerical method is second-order convergent in both space and time directions, and its unconditional stability is strictly proved. Comparing with the popular first-order finite difference method for fractional operator, the form of obtained matrix algebraic equation is changed from (I-A)u^{k+1}=u^k+b^{k+1} to (I-{\widetilde A})u^{k+1}=(I+{\widetilde B})u^k+{\tilde b}^{k+1/2}; the three matrices A, {\widetilde A} and {\widetilde B} are all Toeplitz-like, i.e., they have completely same structure and the computational count for matrix vector multiplication is \mathcal{O}(N {log} N); and the computational costs for solving the two matrix algebraic equations are almost the same. The LOD-multigrid method is used to solve the resulting matrix algebraic equation, and the computational count is \mathcal{O}(N {log} N) and the required storage is \mathcal{O}(N), where N is the number of grid points. Finally, the extensive numerical experiments are performed to show the powerfulness of the second-order scheme and the LOD-multigrid method.
