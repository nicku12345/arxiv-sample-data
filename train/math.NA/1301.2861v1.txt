In this paper, we design a semi-implicit scheme for the scalar time fractional reaction-diffusion equation. We theoretically prove that the numerical scheme is stable without the restriction on the ratio of the time and space stepsizes, and numerically show that the convergent orders are 1 %2-\alpha in time and 2 in space. As a concrete model, the subdiffusive predator-prey system is discussed in detail. First, we prove that the analytical solution of the system is positive and bounded. Then we use the provided numerical scheme to solve the subdiffusive predator-prey system, and theoretically prove and numerically verify that the numerical scheme preserves the positivity and boundedness.
