A recently developed Eulerian finite element method is applied to solve advection-diffusion equations posed on hypersurfaces. When transport processes on a surface dominate over diffusion, finite element methods tend to be unstable unless the mesh is sufficiently fine. The paper introduces a stabilized finite element formulation based on the SUPG technique. An error analysis of the method is given. Results of numerical experiments are presented that illustrate the performance of the stabilized method.
