We introduce a new discretization scheme for Anisotropic Diffusion, AD-LBR, on two and three dimensional cartesian grids. The main features of this scheme is that it is non-negative, and has a stencil cardinality bounded by 6 in 2D, by 14 in 3D, despite allowing diffusion tensors of arbitrary anisotropy. Our scheme also has good spectral properties, which permits larger time steps and avoids e.g. chessboard artifacts.   AD-LBR relies on Lattice Basis Reduction, a tool from discrete mathematics which has recently shown its relevance for the discretization on grids of strongly anisotropic Partial Differential Equations. We prove that AD-LBR is in 2D asymptotically equivalent to a finite element discretization on an anisotropic Delaunay triangulation, a procedure more involved and computationally expensive. Our scheme thus benefits from the theoretical guarantees of this procedure, for a fraction of its cost. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D illustrate our results.
