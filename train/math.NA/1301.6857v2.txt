In this paper we study the singularity of multivariate Hermite interpolation of type total degree. We present a method to judge the singularity of the interpolation scheme considered and by the method to be developed, we show that all Hermite interpolation of type total degree on m=d+k points in \R^d is singular if d\geq 2k. And then we solve the Hermite interpolation problem on m\leq d+3 nodes completely. Precisely, all Hermite interpolations of type total degree on m\leq d+1 points with d\geq 2 are singular; for m=d+2 and m=d+3, only three cases and one case can produce regular Hermite interpolation schemes, respectively. Besides, we also present a method to compute the interpolation space for Hermite interpolation of type total degree.
