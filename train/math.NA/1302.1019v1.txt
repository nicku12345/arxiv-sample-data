In this paper we demonstrate that the numerical method of steepest descent fails when applied in a straight forward fashion to the most commonly occurring highly oscillatory integrals in scattering theory. Through a polar change of variables, however, the integral can be brought on a form that can be solved efficiently using a mix of oscillatory integration techniques and classical quadrature. The approach is described in detail and demonstrated numerically on integration problems taken from applications.
