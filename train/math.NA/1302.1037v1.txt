In this paper we define an efficient implementation of Runge-Kutta methods of Radau IIA type, which are commonly used when solving stiff ODE-IVPs problems. The proposed implementation relies on an alternative low-rank formulation of the methods, for which a splitting procedure is easily defined. The linear convergence analysis of this splitting procedure exhibits excellent properties, which are confirmed by its performance on a few numerical tests.
