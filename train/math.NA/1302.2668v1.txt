A general approach was proposed in this article to develop high-order exponentially fitted basis functions for finite element approximations of multi-dimensional drift-diffusion equations for modeling biomolecular electrodiffusion processes. Such methods are highly desirable for achieving numerical stability and efficiency. We found that by utilizing the one-one correspondence between continuous piecewise polynomial space of degree k+1 and the divergence-free vector space of degree k, one can construct high-order 2-D exponentially fitted basis functions that are strictly interpolative at a selected node set but are discontinuous on edges in general, spanning nonconforming finite element spaces. First order convergence was proved for the methods constructed from divergence-free Raviart-Thomas space RT_0^0 at two different node sets
