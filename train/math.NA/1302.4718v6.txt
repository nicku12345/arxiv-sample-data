We show that any compact subset of \R^d which is the closure of a bounded star-shaped Lipschitz domain \Omega, such that \complement \Omega has positive reach in the sense of Federer, admits an \emph{optimal AM} (admissible mesh), that is a sequence of polynomial norming sets with optimal cardinality. This extends a recent result of A. Kro\'o on \mathscr C^ 2 star-shaped domains.   Moreover, we prove constructively the existence of an optimal AM for any K := \overline\Omega \subset \R^ d where \Omega is a bounded \mathscr C^{ 1,1} domain. This is done by a particular multivariate sharp version of the Bernstein Inequality via the distance function.
