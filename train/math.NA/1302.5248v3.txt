Given interpolation points P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n in the plane, it is known that there does not exist an interpolating curve with minimal bending energy, unless the given points lie sequentially along a line. We say than an interpolating curve is {\it admissable} if each piece, connecting two consecutive points P_i and P_{i+1}, is an s-curve, where an {\it s-curve} is a planar curve which first turns at most 180^\circ in one direction and then turns at most 180^\circ in the opposite direction. Our main result is that among all admissable interpolating curves there exists a curve with minimal bending energy. We also prove, in a very constructive manner, the existence of an s-curve, with minimal bending energy, which connects two given unit tangent vectors.
