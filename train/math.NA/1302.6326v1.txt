The inversion of cosh-Hilbert transform (CHT) is one of the most crucial steps for single-photon emission computed tomography with uniform attenuation from truncated projection data. Although the uniqueness of the CHT inversion had been proved \cite{Noo2007}, there is no exact and analytic inverse formula so far. Several approximated inversion algorithms of the CHT had been developed \cite{Noo2007}\cite{You2007}. In this paper, we proposed a new numerical moment-based inversion algorithm.
