We propose a new way for speeding up the search of the maximal solution X_+ of X + A^\top X^{-1} A = Q. It is known that the speed of convergence of traditional approaches for solving this problem depends highly on the spectral radius \rho(X_+^{-1}A). If \rho(X_+^{-1}A) is close to one or equal to one, the iterations of traditional approaches converges very slowly or does not converge. Our goal is to come up with a shifting tactic to remove the singularities embedded in \rho(X_+^{-1}A). Finally, an example is used to demonstrate the capacity of our method.
