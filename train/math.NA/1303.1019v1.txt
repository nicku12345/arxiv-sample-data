In this paper, we describe some recent results obtained in the context of vector subdivision schemes which possess the so-called full rank property. Such kind of schemes, in particular those which have an interpolatory nature, are connected to matrix refinable functions generating orthogonal multiresolution analyses for the space of vector-valued signals. Corresponding multichannel (matrix) wavelets can be defined and their construction in terms of a very efficient scheme is given. Some examples illustrate the nature of these matrix scaling functions/wavelets.
