We study scalar multivariate non-stationary subdivision schemes with a general dilation matrix. We characterize the capability of such schemes to reproduce exponential polynomials in terms of simple algebraic conditions on their symbols. These algebraic conditions provide a useful theoretical tool for checking the reproduction properties of existing schemes and for constructing new schemes with desired reproduction capabilities and other enhanced properties. We illustrate our results with several examples.
