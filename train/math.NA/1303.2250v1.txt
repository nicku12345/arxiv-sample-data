A hyperbolic integro-differential equation is considered, as a model problem, where the convolution kernel is assumed to be either smooth or no worse than weakly singular. Well-posedness of the problem is studied in the context of semigroup of linear operators, and regularity of any order is proved for smooth kernels. Energy method is used to prove optimal order a priori error estimates for the finite element spatial semidiscrete problem. A continuous space-time finite element method of order one is formulated for the problem. Stability of the discrete dual problem is proved, that is used to obtain optimal order a priori estimates via duality arguments. The theory is illustrated by an example.
