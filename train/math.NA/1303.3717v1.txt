We consider Monte-Carlo discretizations of partial differential equations based on a combination of semi-lagrangian schemes and probabilistic representations of the solutions. We study the Monte-Carlo error in a simple case, and show that under an anti-CFL condition on the time-step \delta t and on the mesh size \delta x and for N - the number of realizations - reasonably large, we control this error by a term of order \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\delta t /N}). We also provide some numerical experiments to confirm the error estimate, and to expose some examples of equations which can be treated by the numerical method.
