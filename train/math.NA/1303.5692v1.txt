In this paper we present deflation and augmentation techniques that have been designed to accelerate the convergence of Krylov subspace methods for the solution of linear systems of equations. We review numerical approaches both for linear systems with a non-Hermitian coefficient matrix, mainly within the Arnoldi framework, and for Hermitian positive definite problems with the conjugate gradient method.
