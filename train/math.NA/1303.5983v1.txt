We address the study of a class of 1D nonlocal conservation laws from a numerical point of view. First, we present an algorithm to numerically integrate them and prove its convergence. Then, we use this algorithm to investigate various analytical properties, obtaining evidence that usual properties of standard conservation laws fail in the nonlocal setting. Moreover, on the basis of our numerical integrations, we are lead to conjecture the convergence of the nonlocal equation to the local ones, although no analytical results are, to our knowledge, available in this context.
