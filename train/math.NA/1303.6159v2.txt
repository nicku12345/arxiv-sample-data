The infinite upper triangular Pascal matrix is T = [\binom{j}{i}] for 0\leq i,j. It is easy to see that any leading principle square submatrix is triangular with determinant 1, hence invertible. In this paper, we investigate the invertibility of arbitrary square submatrices T_{r,c} comprised of rows r=[r_0,\ldots,r_m] and columns c=[c_0,\ldots,c_m] of T. We show that T_{r,c} is invertible iff r \leq c (i.e., r_i \leq c_i for i=0, \ldots, m), or equivalently, iff all diagonal entries are nonzero. To prove this result we establish a connection between the invertibility of these submatrices and polynomial interpolation. In particular, we apply the theory of Birkhoff interpolation and \polya{} systems.
