The paper focuses on unconditionally optimal error analysis of the fully discrete Galerkin finite element methods for a general nonlinear parabolic system in \R^d with d=2,3. In terms of a corresponding time-discrete system of PDEs as proposed in \cite{LS1}, we split the error function into two parts, one from the temporal discretization and one the spatial discretization. We prove that the latter is \tau-independent and the numerical solution is bounded in the L^{\infty} and W^{1,\infty} norms by the inverse inequalities. With the boundedness of the numerical solution, optimal error estimates can be obtained unconditionally in a routine way. Several numerical examples in two and three dimensional spaces are given to support our theoretical analysis.
