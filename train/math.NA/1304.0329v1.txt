In this paper we give explicit constructions of point sets in the s dimensional unit cube yielding quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms which achieve the optimal rate of convergence of the worst-case error for numerically integrating high dimensional periodic functions. In the classical measure P_{\alpha} of the worst-case error introduced by Korobov the convergence is of \landau(N^{-\min(\alpha,d)} (\log N)^{s\alpha-2}) for every even integer \alpha \ge 1, where d is a parameter of the construction which can be chosen arbitrarily large and N is the number of quadrature points. This convergence rate is known to be best possible up to some \log N factors. We prove the result for the deterministic and also a randomized setting. The construction is based on a suitable extension of digital (t,m,s)-nets over the finite field \integer_b.
