We present algebraic multilevel iteration (AMLI) methods for isogeometric discretization of scalar second order elliptic problems. The construction of coarse grid operators and hierarchical complementary operators are given. Moreover, for a uniform mesh on a unit interval, the explicit representation of B-spline basis functions for a fixed mesh size h is given for p=2,3,4 and for C^{0}- and C^{p-1}-continuity. The presented methods show h- and (almost) p-independent convergence rates. Supporting numerical results for convergence factor and iterations count for AMLI cycles (V-, linear W-, nonlinear W-) are provided. Numerical tests are performed, in two-dimensions on square domain and quarter annulus, and in three-dimensions on quarter thick ring.
