Space fractional convection diffusion equation describes physical phenomena where particles or energy (or other physical quantities) are transferred inside a physical system due to two processes: convection and superdiffusion. In this paper, we discuss the practical alternating directions implicit method to solve the two-dimensional two-sided space fractional convection diffusion equation on a finite domain. We theoretically prove and numerically verify that the presented finite difference scheme is unconditionally von Neumann stable and second order convergent in both space and time directions.
