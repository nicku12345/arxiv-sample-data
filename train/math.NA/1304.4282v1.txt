We describe the Greedy Sparse Subspace Clustering (GSSC) algorithm providing an efficient method for clustering data belonging to a few low-dimensional linear or affine subspaces from incomplete corrupted and noisy data. We provide numerical evidences that, even in the simplest implementation, the greedy approach increases the subspace clustering capability of the existing state-of-the art SSC algorithm significantly.
