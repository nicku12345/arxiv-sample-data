We established a new eighth-order iterative method, consisting of three steps, for solving nonlinear equations. Per iteration the method requires four evaluations (three function evaluations and one evaluation of the first derivative). Convergence analysis shows that this method is eighth-order convergent which is also substantiated through the numerical works.Computational results ascertain that our method is efficient and demonstrate almost better performance as compared to the other well known eighth-order methods.
