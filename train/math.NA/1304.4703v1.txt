In the present paper, by approximating the derivatives in the Kou et al. \cite{Kou} fourth-order method by central difference quotient, we obtain new modification of this method free from derivatives. We prove the important fact that the method obtained preserve their order of convergence, without calculating any derivative. Finally, numerical tests confirm that our method give the better performance as compare to other well known Steffensen type methods.
