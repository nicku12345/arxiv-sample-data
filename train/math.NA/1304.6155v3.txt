In this paper, we study numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations on evolving surfaces. The evolving hypersurface in \Bbb{R}^d defines a d-dimensional space-time manifold in the space-time continuum \Bbb{R}^{d+1}. We derive and analyze a variational formulation for a class of diffusion problems on the space-time manifold. For this variational formulation new well-posedness and stability results are derived. The analysis is based on an inf-sup condition and involves some natural, but non-standard, (anisotropic) function spaces. Based on this formulation a discrete in time variational formulation is introduced that is very suitable as a starting point for a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) space-time finite element discretization. This DG space-time method is explained and results of numerical experiments are presented that illustrate its properties.
