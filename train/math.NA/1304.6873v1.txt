In this paper we extend Newton-Steffenssen method for solving nonlinear equations, introduced by Sharma [J.R. Sharma, A composite third order Newton-Steffenssen method for solving nonlinear equations, Appl. Math. Comput. 169 (2005), 242-246] by using the Gejji-Jafari decomposition technique. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency and performance of this new method.
