A gradient recovery operator based on projecting the discrete gradient onto the standard finite element space is considered. We use an oblique projection, where the test and trial spaces are different, and the bases of these two spaces form a biorthogonal system. Biorthogonality allows efficient computation of the recovery operator.We analyse the approximation properties of the gradient recovery operator.
