An explicit formula for the resistance between two nodes in a network with a non-symmetric Laplacian matrix L is obtained. This is of great advantage e.g. in electronic circuit fault analysis, where non-linear systems have to be solved repeatedly. Analysis time can be greatly reduced by utilization of the obtained formula. The presented approach is based on the "mutual orthogonality" of the full system of left and right-hand eigenvectors of a diagonalizable matrix L. Some examples are given that demonstrate the accuracy of the approach on circuit networks.
