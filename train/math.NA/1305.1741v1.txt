We discuss Cahn's time cone method modeling phase transformation kinetics. The model equation by the time cone method is an integral equation in the space-time region. First we reduce it to a system of hyperbolic equations, and in the case of odd spatial dimensions, the reduced system is a multiple hyperbolic equation. Next we propose a numerical method for such a hyperbolic system. By means of alternating direction implicit methods, numerical simulations for practical forward problems are implemented with satisfactory accuracy and efficiency. In particular, in the three dimensional case, our numerical method on basis of reduced multiple hyperbolic equation, is fast.
