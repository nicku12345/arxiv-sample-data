We present a methodology for numerically integrating ordinary differential equations containing rapidly oscillatory terms. This challenge is distinct from that for differential equations which have rapidly oscillatory solutions: here the differential equation itself has the oscillatory terms. Our method generalises Filon quadrature for integrals, and is analogous to integral techniques designed to solve stochastic differential equations and, as such, is applicable to a wide variety of ordinary differential equations with rapidly oscillating factors. The proposed method flexibly achieves varying levels of accuracy depending upon the truncation of the expansion of certain integrals. Users will choose the level of truncation to suit the parameter regime of interest in their numerical integration.
