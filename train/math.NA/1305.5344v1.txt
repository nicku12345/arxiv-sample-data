Nonnegative tensor factorization has applications in statistics, computer vision, exploratory multiway data analysis and blind source separation. A symmetric nonnegative tensor, which has a symmetric nonnegative factorization, is called a completely positive (CP) tensor. The H-eigenvalues of a CP tensor are always nonnegative. When the order is even, the Z-eigenvalue of a CP tensor are all nonnegative. When the order is odd, a Z-eigenvector associated with a positive (negative) Z-eigenvalue of a CP tensor is always nonnegative (nonpositive). The entries of a CP tensor obey some dominance properties. The CP tensor cone and the copositive tensor cone of the same order are dual to each other. We introduce strongly symmetric tensors and show that a symmetric tensor has a symmetric binary decomposition if and only if it is strongly symmetric. Then we show that a strongly symmetric, hierarchically dominated nonnegative tensor is a CP tensor, and present a hierarchical elimination algorithm for checking this. Numerical examples are also given.
