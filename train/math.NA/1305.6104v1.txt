A scaled Chebyshev node distribution is studied in this paper. It is proved that the node distribution is optimal for interpolation in C_M^{s+1}[-1,1], the set of (s+1)-time differentiable functions whose (s+1)-th derivatives are bounded by a constant M>0. Node distributions for computing spectral differentiation matrices are proposed and studied. Numerical experiments show that the proposed node distributions yield results with higher accuracy than the most commonly used Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto node distribution.
