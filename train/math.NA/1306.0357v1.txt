In this paper, we study numerically quantized vortex dynamics and their interaction in the two-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) with a dimensionless parameter \vep>0 on bounded domains under either Dirichlet or homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. We begin with a review of the reduced dynamical laws (RDLs) for time evolution of quantized vortex centers in CGLE and show how to solve these nonlinear ordinary differential equations numerically. Then we present efficient and accurate numerical methods for solving the CGLE on either a rectangular or a disk domain under either Dirichlet or homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. Based on these efficient and accurate numerical methods for CGLE and the RDLs, we explore rich and complicated quantized vortex dynamics and interaction of CGLE with different \vep and under different initial physical setups, including single vortex, vortex pair, vortex dipole and vortex lattice, compare them with those obtained from the corresponding RDLs, and identify the cases where the RDLs agree qualitatively and/or quantitatively as well as fail to agree with those from CGLE on vortex interaction. Finally, we also obtain numerically different patterns of the steady states for quantized vortex lattices in the CGLE dynamics on bounded domains.
