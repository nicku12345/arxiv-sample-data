In this paper, we prove that the standard adaptive finite element method with a (modified) `maximum marking strategy' is `instance optimal' for the `total error', being the sum of the energy error and the oscillation. This result will be derived in the model setting of Poisson's equation on a polygon, linear finite elements, and conforming triangulations created by newest vertex bisection.
