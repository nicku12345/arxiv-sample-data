In the framework of a Particle-In-Cell scheme for some 1D Vlasov-Poisson system depending on a small parameter, we propose a time-stepping method which is numerically uniformly accurate when the parameter goes to zero. Based on an exponential time differencing approach, the scheme is able to use large time steps with respect to the typical size of the fast oscillations of the solution.
