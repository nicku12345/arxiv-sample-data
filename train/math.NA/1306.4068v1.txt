Sobol' indices measure the dependence of a high dimensional function on groups of variables defined on the unit cube [0,1]^d. They are based on the ANOVA decomposition of functions, which is an L^2 decomposition. In this paper we discuss generalizations of Sobol' indices which yield L^p measures of the dependence of f on subsets of variables. Our interest is in values p>2 because then variable importance becomes more about reaching the extremes of f. We introduce two methods. One based on higher order moments of the ANOVA terms and another based on higher order norms of a spectral decomposition of f, including Fourier and Haar variants. Both of our generalizations have representations as integrals over [0,1]^{kd} for k\ge 1, allowing direct Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo estimation. We find that they are sensitive to different aspects of f, and thus quantify different notions of variable importance.
