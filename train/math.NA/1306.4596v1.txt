We design the first parallel scheme based on Schwarz waveform relaxation methods for the Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation. We introduce a new convergence proof for the algorithms. We also provide results about the existence and uniqueness of a solution for this equation with several boundary conditions, in order to prove that our algorithms are well-posed. Numerical tests are also provided.
