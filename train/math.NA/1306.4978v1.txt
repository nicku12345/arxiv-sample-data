In this paper, a cell-based smoothed finite element method with discrete shear gap technique for triangular ele- ments is employed to study the linear flutter characteristics of functionally graded material (FGM) flat panels. The influence of thermal environment, the presence of a centrally located circular cutout and the aerodynamic damping on the supersonic flutter characteristics of flat FGM panels is also investigated. The structural for- mulation is based on the first-order shear deformation theory and the material properties are assumed to be temperature dependent and graded only in the thickness direction according to power law distribution in terms of the volume fraction of its constituent materials. The aerodynamic force is evaluated by considering the first order high mach number approximation to linear potential flow theory. The formulation includes transverse shear deformation and in-plane and rotary inertia effects. The influence of the plate thickness, aspect ratio, boundary conditions, material gradient index, temperature dependent material properties, damping, cutout size, skewness of the plate and boundary conditions on the critical aerodynamic pressure is numerically studied.
