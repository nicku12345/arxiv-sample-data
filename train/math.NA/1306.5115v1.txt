We consider the solution of second order elliptic PDEs in \R^d with inhomogeneous Dirichlet data by means of an h-adaptive FEM with fixed polynomial order p\in\N. As model example serves the Poisson equation with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions, where the inhomogeneous Dirichlet data are discretized by use of an H^{1/2}-stable projection, for instance, the L^2-projection for p=1 or the Scott-Zhang projection for general p\ge1. For error estimation, we use a residual error estimator which includes the Dirichlet data oscillations. We prove that each H^{1/2}-stable projection yields convergence of the adaptive algorithm even with quasi-optimal convergence rate. Numerical experiments with the L^2- and Scott-Zhang projection conclude the work.
