We develop a representation of reverse-time migration in terms of Fourier integral operators the canonical relations of which are graphs. Through the dyadic parabolic decomposition of phase space, we obtain the solution of the wave equation with a boundary source and homogeneous initial conditions using wave packets. On this basis, we develop a numerical procedure for the reverse time continuation from the boundary of scattering data and for RTM migration. The algorithms are derived from those we recently developed for the discrete approximate evaluation of the action of Fourier integral operators and inherit from their conceptual and numerical properties.
