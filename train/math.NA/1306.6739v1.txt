We deal with interval linear systems of equations. We present a new operator, which generalizes the interval Gauss-Seidel method. Also, based on the new operator and properties of the well-known methods, we propose a new algorithm, called the magnitude method. We illustrate by numerical examples that our approach overcomes some classical methods with respect to both time and sharpness of enclosures.
