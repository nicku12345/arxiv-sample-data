In this work we are interested in numerical simulations for bedload erosion processes. We present a relaxation solver that we apply to moving dunes test cases in one and two dimensions. In particular we retrieve the so-called anti-dune process that is well described in the experiments. In order to be able to run 2D test cases with reasonable CPU time, we also describe and apply a parallelization procedure by using domain decomposition based on the classical MPI library.
