We provide conditions for exact reconstruction of a bandlimited function from irregular polar samples of its Radon transform. First, we prove that the Radon transform is a continuous L2-operator for certain classes of bandlimited signals. We then show that the Beurling-Malliavin condition for the radial sampling density ensures existence and uniqueness of a solution. Moreover, Jaffard's density condition is sufficient for stable reconstruction.
