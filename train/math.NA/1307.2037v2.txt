A new computational method for reconstructing a potential from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map at positive energy is developed. The method is based on D-bar techniques and it works in absence of exceptional points -- in particular, if the potential is small enough compared to the energy. Numerical tests reveal exceptional points for perturbed, radial potentials. Reconstructions for several potentials are computed using simulated Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps with and without added noise. The new reconstruction method is shown to work well for energy values between 10^{-5} and 5, smaller values giving better results.
