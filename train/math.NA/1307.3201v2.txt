Quantitative Photoacoustic tomography (QPAT) is an emerging medical imaging modality which offers the possibility of combining the high resolution of the acoustic waves and large contrast of optical waves by quantifying the molecular concentration in biological tissue.   In this paper, we prove properties of the forward operator that associate optical parameters from measurements of a reconstructed Photoacoustic image. This is often referred to as the optical inverse problem, that is nonlinear and ill-posed. The proved properties of the forward operator provide sufficient conditions to show regularized properties of approximated solutions obtained by Tikhonov-type approaches. The proposed Tikhonov- type approaches analyzed in this contribution are concerned with physical and numerical issues as well as with \textit{a priori} information on the smoothness of the optical coefficients for with (PAT) is particularly a well-suited imaging modality.
