We consider an initial-boundary value problem for a 2D time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation on a semi-infinite strip. For the Numerov-Crank-Nicolson finite-difference scheme with discrete transparent boundary conditions, the Strang-type splitting with respect to the potential is applied. For the resulting method, the uniqueness of a solution and the uniform in time L^2-stability (in particular, L^2-conservativeness) are proved. Due to the splitting, an effective direct algorithm using FFT in the direction perpendicular to the strip is developed to implement the splitting method for general potential. Numerical results on the tunnel effect for smooth and rectangular barriers together with the practical error analysis on refining meshes are included as well.
