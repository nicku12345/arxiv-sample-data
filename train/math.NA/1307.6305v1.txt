This paper develops an algebraic multigrid preconditioner for the graph Laplacian. The proposed approach uses aggressive coarsening based on the aggregation framework in the setup phase and a polynomial smoother with sufficiently large degree within a (nonlinear) Algebraic Multilevel Iteration as a preconditioner to the flexible Conjugate Gradient iteration in the solve phase. We show that by combining these techniques it is possible to design a simple and scalable algorithm. Results of the algorithm applied to graph Laplacian systems arising from the standard linear finite element discretization of the scalar Poisson problem are reported.
