In this paper the complex dynamical analysis of the parametric fourth-order Kim's iterative family is made on quadratic polynomials, showing the Matlab codes generated to draw the fractal images necessary to complete the study. The parameter spaces associated to the free critical points have been analyzed, showing the stable (and unstable) regions where the selection of the parameter will provide us excellent schemes (or dreadful ones).
