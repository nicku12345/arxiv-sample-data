In this paper we study the numerical error arising in the space-time approximation of unsteady generalized Newtonian fluids which possess a stress-tensor with (p,\delta)-structure. A semi-implicit time-discretization scheme coupled with conforming inf-sup stable finite element space discretization is analyzed. The main result, which improves previous suboptimal estimates as those in [A. Prohl, and M. Ruzicka, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 39 (2001), pp. 214--249] is the optimal O(k+h) error-estimate valid in the range p\in (3/2,2], where k and h are the time-step and the mesh-size, respectively. Our results hold in three-dimensional domains (with periodic boundary conditions) and are uniform with respect to the degeneracy parameter \in [0,\delta_0] of the extra stress tensor.
