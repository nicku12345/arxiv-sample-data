A Nitche's method is presented to couple non-conforming two and three dimensional NURBS (Non Uniform Rational B-splines) patches in the context of isogeometric analysis (IGA). We present results for elastic stress analyses under the static condition of two and three dimensional NURBS geometries. The contribution fills the gap in the literature and enlarges the applicability of NURBS-based isogeometric analysis.
