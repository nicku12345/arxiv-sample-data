This paper deals with a splitting method applied to a conservation law model of manufacturing system incorporating yield loss. A splitting scheme has been proposed. The yield loss term is treated by solving implicitly an ordinary differential equation and the hyperbolic part is approximated by a finite volume scheme. Bounded variation stability has been studied. Due to yield loss, proposed scheme is total variation bounded. The convergence of the numerical solution towards entropy solution (in the Kruzkov sense) is proved. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the scheme.
