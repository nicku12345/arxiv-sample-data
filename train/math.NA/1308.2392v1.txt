In [21] the evolution of hypersurfaces in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} with normal speed equal to a power k>1 of the mean curvature is considered and the levelset solution u of the flow is obtained as the C^0-limit of a sequence u^{\epsilon} of smooth functions solving the regularized levelset equations.   We prove a rate for this convergence.   Then we triangulate the domain by using a tetraeder mesh and consider continuous finite elements, which are polynomials of degree \le 2 on each tetraeder of the triangulation. We show in the case n=1 (i.e. the evolving hypersurfaces are curves), that there are solutions u^{\epsilon}_h of the above regularized equations in the finite element sense, and estimate the approximation error between u^{\epsilon}_h and u.   Our method can be extended to the case n>1, if one uses higher order finite elements.
