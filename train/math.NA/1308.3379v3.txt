In this paper we propose a Local Orthogonal Decomposition method (LOD) for elliptic partial differential equations with inhomogeneous Dirichlet- and Neumann boundary conditions. For this purpose, we present new boundary correctors which preserve the common convergence rates of the LOD, even if the boundary condition has a rapidly oscillating fine scale structure. We prove a corresponding a-priori error estimate and present numerical experiments. We also demonstrate numerically that the method is reliable with respect to thin conductivity channels in the diffusion matrix. Accurate results are obtained without resolving these channels by the coarse grid and without using patches that contain the channels.
