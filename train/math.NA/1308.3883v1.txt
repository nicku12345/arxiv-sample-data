In this paper, we show that efficient separated sum-of-exponentials approximations can be constructed for the heat kernel in any dimension. In one space dimension, the heat kernel admits an approximation involving a number of terms that is of the order O(\log(\frac{T}{\delta}) (\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon})+\log\log(\frac{T}{\delta}))) for any x\in\bbR and \delta \leq t \leq T, where \epsilon is the desired precision. In all higher dimensions, the corresponding heat kernel admits an approximation involving only O(\log^2(\frac{T}{\delta})) terms for fixed accuracy \epsilon. These approximations can be used to accelerate integral equation-based methods for boundary value problems governed by the heat equation in complex geometry. The resulting algorithms are nearly optimal. For N_S points in the spatial discretization and N_T time steps, the cost is O(N_S N_T \log^2 \frac{T}{\delta}) in terms of both memory and CPU time for fixed accuracy \epsilon. The algorithms can be parallelized in a straightforward manner. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy and stability of these approximations.
