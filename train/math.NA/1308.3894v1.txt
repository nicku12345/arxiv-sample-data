We study the stability of ghost force-free energy-based atomistic-to-continuum coupling methods. In 1D we essentially complete the theory by introducing a universally stable a/c coupling as well as a stabilisation mechanism for unstable coupling schemes.   We then present a comprehensive study of a two-dimensional scalar planar interface setting, as a step towards a general 2D/3D vectorial analysis. Our results point out various new challenges. For example, we find that none of the ghost force-free methods known to us are universally stable (i.e., stable under general interaction and general loads). We then explore to what extent our 1D stabilisation mechanism can be extended.
