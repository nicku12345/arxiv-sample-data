We answer Totik's question on weighted Bernstein's inequalities showing that  \|T_n'\|_{L_p(\omega)} \le C(p,\omega)\, {n}\,\|T_n\|_{L_p(\omega)},\qquad 0<p\le \infty,  holds for all trigonometric polynomials T_n and certain nondoubling weights \omega. Moreover, we find necessary conditions on \omega for Bernstein's inequality to hold. We also prove weighted Bernstein-Markov, Remez, and Nikolskii inequalities for trigonometric and algebraic polynomials.
