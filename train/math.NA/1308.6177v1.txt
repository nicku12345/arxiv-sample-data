We present an all speed scheme for the Euler-Korteweg model. We study a semi-implicit time-discretisation which treats the terms, which are stiff for low Mach numbers, implicitly and thereby avoids a dependence of the timestep restriction on the Mach number. Based on this we present a fully discrete finite difference scheme. In particular, the scheme is asymptotic preserving, i.e., it converges to a stable discretisation of the incompressible limit of the Euler-Korteweg model when the Mach number tends to zero.
