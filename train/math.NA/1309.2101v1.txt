We shall establish the convergence of an adaptive conforming finite element method for the reconstruction of the distributed flux in a diffusion system. The adaptive method is based on a posteriori error estimators for the distributed flux, state and costate variables. The sequence of discrete solutions produced by the adaptive algorithm is proved to converge to the true triplet satisfying the optimality conditions in the energy norm and the corresponding error estimator converges to zero asymptotically.
