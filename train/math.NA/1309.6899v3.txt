A general theory for obtaining anisotropic interpolation error estimates for macro-element interpolation is developed revealing general construction principles. We apply this theory to interpolation operators on a macro type of biquadratic C^1 finite elements on rectangle grids which can be viewed as a rectangular version of the C^1 Powell-Sabin element. This theory also shows how interpolation on the Bogner-Fox-Schmidt finite element space (or higher order generalizations) can be analyzed in a unified framework. Moreover we discuss a modification of Scott-Zhang type giving optimal error estimates under the regularity required without imposing quasi uniformity on the family of macro-element meshes used. We introduce and analyze an anisotropic macro-element interpolation operator, which is the tensor product of one-dimensional C^1-P_2 macro interpolation and P_2 Lagrange interpolation. These results are used to approximate the solution of a singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problem on a Shishkin mesh that features highly anisotropic elements. Hereby we obtain an approximation whose normal derivative is continuous along certain edges of the mesh, enabling a more sophisticated analysis of a continuous interior penalty method in another paper.
