In this paper, we are interested in scalable Domain Decomposition Methods (DDM). To this end, we introduce and study a new Coarse Space Correction algorithm for Optimized Schwarz Methods(OSM) : the DCS-DGLC algorithm. The main idea is to use a Discontinuous Galerkin like formulation to compute a discontinuous coarse space correction. While the local spaces remain continuous, the coarse space should be discontinuous to compensate the discontinuities introduced by the OSM at the interface between neighboring subdomains. The discontinuous coarse correction algorithm can not only be used with OSM but also be used with any one-level DDM that produce discontinuous iterates. While ideas from Discontinuous Galerkin(DG) are used in the computation of the coarse correction, the final aim of the DCS-DGLC algorithm is to compute in parallel the discrete solution to the classical non-DG finite element problem.
