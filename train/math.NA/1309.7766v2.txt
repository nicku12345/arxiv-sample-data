We analyze inexact fixed point iterations where the generating function contains an inexact solve of an equation system to answer the question of how tolerances for the inner solves influence the iteration error of the outer fixed point iteration. Important applications are the Picard iteration and partitioned fluid structure interaction. We prove that the iteration converges irrespective of how accurate the inner systems are solved, provided that a specific relative termination criterion is employed, whereas standard relative and absolute criteria do not have this property. For the analysis, the iteration is modelled as a perturbed fixed point iteration and existing analysis is extended to the nested case x=F(S(x)).
