Inversion of Radon transforms is the mathematical foundation of many modern tomographic imaging modalities. In this paper we study a conical Radon transform, which is important for computed tomography taking Compton scattering into account. The conical Radon transform we study integrates a function in \R^d over all conical surfaces having vertices on a hyperplane and symmetry axis orthogonal to this plane. As the main result we derive exact reconstruction formulas of the filtered back-projection type for inverting this transform.
