We study three quasicontinuum approximations of a lattice model for crack propagation. The influence of the approximation on the bifurcation patterns is investigated. The estimate of the modeling error is applicable to near and beyond bifurcation points, which enables us to evaluate the approximation over a finite range of loading and multiple mechanical equilibria.
