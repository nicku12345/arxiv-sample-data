An accurate assessment for fatigue damage as a function of activation and deactivation cycles is vital for the design of many engineering parts. In this paper we extend the probabilistic and local approach to this problem proposed in [1,2] and [3] to the case of non-constant temperature fields and thermomechanical loading. The method has been implemented as a finite element postprocessor and applied to an example case of a gas-turbine blade which is made of a conventionally cast nickel base superalloy.
