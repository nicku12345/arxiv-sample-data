We explain that, like the usual Pad\'e approximants, the barycentric Pad\'e approximants proposed recently by Brezinski and Redivo-Zaglia can diverge. More precisely, we show that for every polynomial P there exists a power series S, with arbitrarily small coefficients, such that the sequence of barycentric Pad\'e approximants of P + S do not converge uniformly in any subset of the complex plane with a non-empty interior.
