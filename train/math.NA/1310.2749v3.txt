In this paper we consider the Benjamin equation, a partial differential equation that models one-way propagation of long internal waves of small amplitude along the interface of two fluid layers under the effects of gravity and surface tension. We solve the periodic initial-value problem for the Benjamin equation numerically by a new fully discrete hybrid finite-element / spectral scheme, which we first validate by pinning down its accuracy and stability properties. After testing the evolution properties of the scheme in a study of propagation of single - and multi-pulse solitary waves of the Benjamin equation, we use it in an exploratory mode to illuminate phenomena such as overtaking collisions of solitary waves, and the stability of single-, multi-pulse and 'depression' solitary waves.
