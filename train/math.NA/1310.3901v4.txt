Recently-derived high-order splitting schemes with complex coefficients are shown to exhibit reduced convergence rates for certain parabolic evolution equations. When applied to semilinear reaction-diffusion equations with periodic boundary conditions, these splitting schemes are most efficient when the diffusion terms are much less stiff than the reaction terms. An explanation for this is given in a simple setting.
