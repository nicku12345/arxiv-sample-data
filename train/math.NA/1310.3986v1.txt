In this paper, the author presents a new tool, called The Convergence Plane, that allows to study the real dynamics of iterative methods whose iterations depends on one parameter in an easy and compact way. This tool can be used, inter alia, to find the elements of a family that have good convergence properties and discard the bad ones or to see how the basins of attraction changes along the elements of the family. To show the applicability of the tool an example of the dynamics of the Damped Newton's method applied to a cubic polynomial is presented.
