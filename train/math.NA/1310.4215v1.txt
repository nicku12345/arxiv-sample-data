This paper is concerned with moving mesh finite difference solution of partial differential equations. It is known that mesh movement introduces an extra convection term and its numerical treatment has a significant impact on the stability of numerical schemes. Moreover, many implicit second and higher order schemes, such as the Crank-Nicolson scheme, will loss their unconditional stability. A strategy is presented for developing temporally high order, unconditionally stable finite difference schemes for solving linear convection-diffusion equations using moving meshes. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the theoretical findings.
