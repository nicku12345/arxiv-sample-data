We propose a new variational formulation of the elliptic Monge-Ampere equation and show how classical Lagrange elements can be used for the numerical resolution of classical solutions of the equation. Error estimates are given for Lagrange elements of degree d >= 2 in dimensions 2 and 3. No jump term is used in the variational formulation. We propose to solve the discrete nonlinear system of equations by a time marching method and numerical evidence is given which indicates that one approximates weak solutions in two dimensions.
