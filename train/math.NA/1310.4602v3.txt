We derive guaranteed bounds of distance to the exact solution of the evolutionary reaction-diffusion problem with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition. It is shown that two-sided error estimates are directly computable and equivalent to the error. Numerical experiments confirm that estimates provide accurate two-sided bounds of the overall error and generate efficient indicators of local error distribution.
