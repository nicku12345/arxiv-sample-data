An optimization scheme using the Cell-based Smoothed Finite Element Method (CS-FEM) combined with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) framework is proposed in this paper to design shape adaptive laminated composite marine propellers. The proposed scheme utilise the bend-twist coupling characteristics of the composites to achieve the required performance. An iterative procedure to evaluate the unloaded shape of the propeller blade is proposed, confirming the manufacturing requirements at the initial stage. The optimization algorithm and codes developed in this work were implemented under a variety of parameter settings and compared against the requirement to achieve an ideally passive pitch varying propeller. Recommendations for the required thickness of the propeller blade to achieve optimum bend-twist coupling performance without resulting large rake deformations are also presented.
