This paper introduces the synchrosqueezed curvelet transform as an optimal tool for 2D mode decomposition of wavefronts or banded wave-like components. The synchrosqueezed curvelet transform consists of a generalized curvelet transform with application dependent geometric scaling parameters, and a synchrosqueezing technique for a sharpened phase space representation. In the case of a superposition of banded wave-like components with well-separated wave-vectors, it is proved that the synchrosqueezed curvelet transform is capable of recognizing each component and precisely estimating local wave-vectors. A discrete analogue of the continuous transform and several clustering models for decomposition are proposed in detail. Some numerical examples with synthetic and real data are provided to demonstrate the above properties of the proposed transform.
