Adaptive stepsize control is a critical feature for the robust and efficient numerical solution of initial-value problems in ordinary differential equations. In this paper, we show that adaptive stepsize control can be incorporated within a family of parallel time integrators known as Revisionist Integral Deferred Correction (RIDC) methods. The RIDC framework allows for various strategies to implement stepsize control, and we report results from exploring a few of them.
