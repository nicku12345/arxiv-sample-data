We analyze the efficiency of the Wang-Landau algorithm to sample a multimodal distribution on a prototypical simple test case. We show that the exit time from a metastable state is much smaller for the Wang Landau dynamics than for the original standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, in some asymptotic regime. Our results are confirmed by numerical experiments on a more realistic test case.
