A family of fixed-point iterations is proposed for the numerical computation of traveling waves and localized ground states. The methods are extended versions of Petviashvili type, and they are applicable when the nonlinear term of the system contains homogeneous functions of different degree. The methods are described and applied to several examples of interest, that calibrate their efficiency.
