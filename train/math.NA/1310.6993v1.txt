In this article we consider the implicit Euler scheme for a homogeneous two-phase flow model in a two-dimensional domain and with the aid of the discrete Gronwall lemma and of the discrete uniform Gronwall lemma we prove that the global attractors generated by the numerical scheme converge to the global attractor of the continuous system as the time-step approaches zero.
