We propose a numerical method, based upon matrix-pencils, for the identification of parameters and coefficients of a monomial-exponential sum. We note that this method can be considered an extension of the numerical methods for the parameter estimation of exponential sums. The application of the method is applied to several examples, some already present in the literature and others, to our knowledge, never considered before.
