The second order weighted and shifted Gr\"{u}nwald difference (WSGD) operators are developed in [Tian et al., arXiv:1201.5949] to solve space fractional partial differential equations. Along this direction, we further design a new family of second order WSGD operators; by properly choosing the weighted parameters, they can be effectively used to discretize space (Riemann-Liouville) fractional derivatives. Based on the new second order WSGD operators, we derive a family of difference schemes for the space fractional advection diffusion equation. By von Neumann stability analysis, it is proved that the obtained schemes are unconditionally stable. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the performance of the schemes and confirm the convergent orders.
