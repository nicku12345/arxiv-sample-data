We consider the problem of recovering a compactly-supported function from a finite collection of pointwise samples of its Fourier transform taking nonuniformly. First, we show that under suitable conditions on the sampling frequencies - specifically, their density and bandwidth - it is possible to recover any such function f in a stable and accurate manner in any given finite-dimensional subspace; in particular, one which is well suited for approximating f. In practice, this is carried out using so-called nonuniform generalized sampling (NUGS). Second, we consider approximation spaces in one dimension consisting of compactly supported wavelets. We prove that a linear scaling of the dimension of the space with the sampling bandwidth is both necessary and sufficient for stable and accurate recovery. Thus wavelets are up to constant factors optimal spaces for reconstruction.
