We introduce quasi-Monte Carlo rules for the numerical integration of functions f defined on [0,1]^s, s \ge 1, which satisfy the following properties: the Fourier-, Fourier cosine- or Walsh coefficients of f are absolutely summable and f satisfies a H\"older condition of order \alpha, for some 0 < \alpha \le 1. We show a convergent rate of the integration error of order \max((s-1) N^{-1/2}, s^{\alpha/2} N^{-\alpha} ). The construction of the quadrature points is explicit and is based on Weil sums.
