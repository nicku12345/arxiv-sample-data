We present a finite element analysis of electrical impedance tomography for reconstructing the conductivity distribution from electrode voltage measurements by means of Tikhonov regularization. Two popular choices of the penalty term, i.e., H^1(\Omega)-norm smoothness penalty and total variation seminorm penalty, are considered. A piecewise linear finite element method is employed for discretizing the forward model, i.e., the complete electrode model, the conductivity, and the penalty functional. The convergence of the finite element approximations for the Tikhonov model on both polyhedral and smooth curved domains is established. This provides rigorous justifications for the ad hoc discretization procedures in the literature.
