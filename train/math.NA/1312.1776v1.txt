We consider the question when the so--called spectral condition} for Hermite subdivision schemes extends to spaces generated by polynomials and exponential functions. The main tool are convolution operators that annihilate the space in question which apparently is a general concept in the study of various types of subdivision operators. Based on these annihilators, we characterize the spectral condition in terms of factorization of the subdivision operator.
