In this paper, we define new unfitted finite element methods for numerically approximating the solution of surface partial differential equations using bulk finite elements. The key idea is that the n-dimensional hypersurface, \Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}, is embedded in a polyhedral domain in \mathbb R^{n+1} consisting of a union, \mathcal{T}_h, of (n+1)-simplices. The finite element approximating space is based on continuous piece-wise linear finite element functions on \mathcal{T}_h. Our first method is a sharp interface method, \emph{SIF}, which uses the bulk finite element space in an approximating weak formulation obtained from integration on a polygonal approximation, \Gamma_{h}, of \Gamma. The full gradient is used rather than the projected tangential gradient and it is this which distinguishes \emph{SIF} from the method of [42]. The second method, \emph{NBM}, is a narrow band method in which the region of integration is a narrow band of width O(h). \emph{NBM} is similar to the method of [13]. but again the full gradient is used in the discrete weak formulation. The a priori error analysis in this paper shows that the methods are of optimal order in the surface L^{2} and H^{1} norms and have the advantage that the normal derivative of the discrete solution is small and converges to zero. Our third method combines bulk finite elements, discrete sharp interfaces and narrow bands in order to give an unfitted finite element method for parabolic equations on evolving surfaces. We show that our method is conservative so that it preserves mass in the case of an advection diffusion conservation law. Numerical results are given which illustrate the rates of convergence.
