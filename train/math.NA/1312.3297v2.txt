In this contribution, a new class of lattice Boltzmann schemes is introduced and studied. These schemes are presented in a framework that generalizes the multiple relaxation times method of d'Humi\`eres. They extend also the Geier's cascaded method. The relaxation phase takes place in a moving frame involving a set of moments depending on a given relative velocity field. We establish with the Taylor expansion method that the equivalent partial differential equations are identical to the ones obtained with the multiple relaxation times method up to the second order accuracy. The method is then performed to derive the equivalent equations up to third order accuracy.
