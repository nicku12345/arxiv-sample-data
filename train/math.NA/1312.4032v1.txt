This paper presents an effective formulation to study the response of laminated composites based on isogeometric approach (IGA) and Carrera unified formulation (CUF). The IGA utilizes the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) functions which allows to construct higher order smooth functions with less computational effort. The static bending and the free vibration of thin and moderately thick laminates plates are studied. The present approach also suffers from shear locking when lower order functions are employed and the shear locking is suppressed by introducing a modification factor. The combination of the IGA with the CUF allows a very accurate prediction of the field variables. The effectiveness of the formulation is demonstrated through numerical examples.
