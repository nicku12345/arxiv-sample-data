This paper provides error analyses of the algorithms most commonly used for the evaluation of the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind T_N(x). Some of these algorithms are shown to be backward stable. This means that the computed value of T_N(x) in floating point arithmetic by these algorithms can be interpreted as a slightly perturbed value of polynomial T_N, for slightly perturbed value of x.
