In this paper we investigate quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration using digital nets over \mathbb{Z}_b in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The tent transformation, or the baker's transformation, was originally used for lattice rules by Hickernell (2002) to achieve higher order convergence of the integration error for smooth non-periodic integrands, and later, has been successfully applied to digital nets over \mathbb{Z}_2 by Cristea et al. (2007) and Goda (2014). The aim of this paper is to generalize the latter two results to digital nets over \mathbb{Z}_b for an arbitrary prime b. For this purpose, we introduce the {\em b-adic tent transformation} for an arbitrary positive integer b greater than 1, which is a generalization of the original (dyadic) tent transformation. Further, again for an arbitrary positive integer b greater than 1, we analyze the mean square worst-case error of QMC rules using digital nets over \mathbb{Z}_b which are randomly digitally shifted and then folded using the b-adic tent transformation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Using this result, for a prime b, we prove the existence of good higher order polynomial lattice rules over \mathbb{Z}_b among the smaller number of candidates as compared to the result by Dick and Pillichshammer (2007), which achieve almost the optimal convergence rate of the mean square worst-case error in unanchored Sobolev spaces of smoothness of arbitrary high order.
