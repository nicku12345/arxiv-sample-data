This paper presents a method for the approximation of harmonic potentials that combines downward continuation of globally available data on a sphere \Omega_R of radius R (e.g., a satellite's orbit) with locally available data on a sphere \Omega_r of radius r<R (e.g., the spherical Earth's surface). The approximation is based on a two-step algorithm motivated by spherical multiscale expansions: First, a convolution with a scaling kernel \Phi_N deals with the downward continuation from \Omega_R to \Omega_r, while in a second step, the result is locally refined by a convolution on \Omega_r with a wavelet kernel \tilde{\Psi}_N. Different from earlier multiscale approaches, it is not the primary goal to obtain an adaptive spatial localization but to simultaneously optimize the related kernels \Phi_N, \tilde{\Psi}_N in such a way that the former behaves well for the downward continuation while the latter shows a good localization on \Omega_r in the region where data is available. The concept is indicated for scalar as well as vector potentials.
