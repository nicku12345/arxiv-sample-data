The eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is an approach for solving problems with non-smooth solutions. In the XFEM, the approximate solution is locally enriched to capture discontinuities without requiring a mesh which conforms to the geometric features. One drawback of the XFEM is that an ill-conditioned system of equations results when the ratio of volumes on either side of the interface in an element is small. In this paper, to avoid this ill-conditioning, a simple and efficient scheme based on a geometric preconditioner and constraining degrees of freedom to zero for small intersections is proposed. This geometric preconditioner is computed from the nodal basis functions, and therefore may be constructed prior to building the system of equations. This feature and the low-cost of constructing the preconditioning matrix makes it well suited for nonlinear problems with fixed and moving interfaces.
