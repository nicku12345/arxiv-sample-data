We investigate the approximation of d-variate periodic functions in Sobolev spaces of dominating mixed (fractional) smoothness s>0 on the d-dimensional torus, where the approximation error is measured in the L_2-norm. In other words, we study the approximation numbers of the Sobolev embeddings H^s_{\rm mix}(\mathbb{T}^d)\hookrightarrow L_2(\mathbb{T}^d), with particular emphasis on the dependence on the dimension d. For any fixed smoothness s>0, we find the exact asymptotic behavior of the constants as d\to\infty. We observe super-exponential decay of the constants in d, if n, the number of linear samples of f, is large. In addition, motivated by numerical implementation issues, we also focus on the error decay that can be achieved by low rank approximations. We present some surprising results for the so-called ``preasymptotic'' decay and point out connections to the recently introduced notion of quasi-polynomial tractability of approximation problems.
