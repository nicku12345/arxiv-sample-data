Work presented in this paper describes a general algorithm and its finite element implementation for performing concurrent multiple sub-domain simulations in linear structural dynamics. Using this approach one can solve problems in which the domain under analysis can be selectively discretized spatially and temporally, hence allowing the user to obtain a desired level of accuracy in critical regions while improving computational efficiency globally. The mathematical background for this approach is largely based upon the fundamental principles of domain decomposition methods (DDM) and Lagrange multipliers, used to obtain coupled equations of motion for distinct regions of a continuous domain. These methods when combined together systematically yield constraint forces that not only ensure conservation of energy but also enforce continuity of velocities across sub-domain interfaces. Multiple grid (MG) connections between non-conforming sub-domains are modeled using mortar elements whereas coupled multiple time-scale (MT) equations are derived for the classical Newmark integration algorithm (and its constituents). Fully discretized equations of motion for component sub-domains, augmented with an interface condition are then solved using block elimination method and Crout factorization.   A proof of stability is provided using Energy method and overall efficiency, accuracy and stability of multiple sub-domain coupling is evaluated using a series of numerical examples. Primary observations are made for the evolution and distribution of kinematic quantities and structural wave propagation across connecting sub-domain. Numerical stability is verified by ensuring energy balance at global as well as component sub-domain level. Discussed examples highlight the greatest advantage of MGMT method; which is high simulation speedups (at the cost of reasonably small errors).
