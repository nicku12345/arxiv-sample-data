Based on the superconvergent approximation at some point (depending on the fractional order \alpha, but not belonging to the mesh points) for Gr\"{u}nwald discretization to fractional derivative, we develop a series of high order quasi-compact schemes for space fractional diffusion equations. Because of the quasi-compactness of the derived schemes, no points beyond the domain are used for all the high order schemes including second order, third order, fourth order, and even higher order schemes; moreover, the algebraic equations for all the high order schemes have the completely same matrix structure. The stability and convergence analysis for some typical schemes are made; the techniques of treating the nonhomogeneous boundary conditions are introduced; and extensive numerical experiments are performed to confirm the theoretical analysis or verify the convergence orders.
