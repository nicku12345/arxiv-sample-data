We study the symmetric outer product decomposition which decomposes a fully (partially) symmetric tensor into a sum of rank-one fully (partially) symmetric tensors. We present iterative algorithms for the third-order partially symmetric tensor and fourth-order fully symmetric tensor. The numerical examples indicate a faster convergence rate for the new algorithms than the standard method of alternating least squares.
