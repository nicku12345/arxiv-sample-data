A family of interior penalty hp-discontinuous Galerkin methods is developed and analyzed for the numerical solution of the quasilinear elliptic equation -\nabla{} \cdot (\mathbf{A}(\nabla{u}) \nabla{u} = f posed on the open bounded domain \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d, d \geq 2. Subject to the assumption that the map \mathbf{v} \mapsto \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{v}) \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d, is Lipschitz continuous and strongly monotone, it is proved that the proposed method is well-posed. \emph{A priori} error estimates are presented of the error in the broken H^1(\Omega)-norm, exhibiting precisely the same h-optimal and mildly p-suboptimal convergence rates as obtained for the interior penalty approximation of linear elliptic problems. \emph{A priori} estimates for linear functionals of the error and the L^2(\Omega)-norm of the error are also established and shown to be h-optimal for a particular member of the proposed family of methods. The analysis is completed under fairly weak conditions on the approximation space, allowing for non-affine and curved elements with multilevel hanging nodes. The theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments.
