This paper has two purposes. First we present a new definition of the multivariate Pad\'e approximation, a new fast numerical method. Then numerical solution of the one-dimensional (1D) time-dependent nonlinear Sine-Gordon equation (SGE) is considered by this method. Numerical results are obtained for various cases involving undamped SGE. The results of numerical experiments are presented and are compared with analytical solutions to confirm the good accuracy of the presented scheme. It is shown that the technique is easy to apply for multidimensional problems.
