In this paper, we introduce a new coarse space algorithm, the "Discontinuous Coarse Space Robin Jump Minimizer" (DCS-RJMin), to be used in conjunction with one-level domain decomposition methods (DDM). This new algorithm makes use of Discontinuous Coarse Spaces(DCS), and is designed for DDM that naturally produce discontinuous iterates such as Optimized Schwarz Methods(OSM). This algorithm is suitable both at the continuous level and for cell-centered finite volume discretizations. At the continuous level, we prove, under some conditions on the parameters of the algorithm, that the difference between two consecutive iterates goes to 0. We also provide numerical results illustrating the convergence behavior of the DCS-RJMin algorithm.
