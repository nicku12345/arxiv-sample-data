We consider the nonstationary iterated Tikhonov regularization in Banach spaces which defines the iterates via minimization problems with uniformly convex penalty term. The penalty term is allowed to be non-smooth to include L^1 and total variation (TV) like penalty functionals, which are significant in reconstructing special features of solutions such as sparsity and discontinuities in practical applications. We present the detailed convergence analysis and obtain the regularization property when the method is terminated by the discrepancy principle. In particular we establish the strong convergence and the convergence in Bregman distance which sharply contrast with the known results that only provide weak convergence for a subsequence of the iterative solutions. Some numerical experiments on linear integral equations of first kind and parameter identification in differential equations are reported.
