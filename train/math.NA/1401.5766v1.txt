Balancing a matrix is a preprocessing step while solving the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem. Balancing a matrix reduces the norm of the matrix and hopefully this will improve the accuracy of the computation. Experiments have shown that balancing can improve the accuracy of the computed eigenval- ues. However, there exists examples where balancing increases the eigenvalue condition number (potential loss in accuracy), deteriorates eigenvector accuracy, and deteriorates the backward error of the eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper we propose a change to the stopping criteria of the LAPACK balancing al- gorithm, GEBAL. The new stopping criteria is better at determining when a matrix is nearly balanced. Our experiments show that the new algorithm is able to maintain good backward error, while improving the eigenvalue accuracy when possible. We present stability analysis, numerical experiments, and a case study to demonstrate the benefit of the new stopping criteria.
