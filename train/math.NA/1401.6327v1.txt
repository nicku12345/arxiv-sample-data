In this paper, we discuss the nonlinear stability and convergence of a fully discrete Fourier pseudospectral method coupled with a specially designed second order time-stepping for the numerical solution of the "good" Boussinesq equation. Our analysis improves the existing results presented in earlier literature in two ways. First, an l_\infty(0, T^*; H2) convergence for the solution and l_\infty(0, T^*; l_2) convergence for the time-derivative of the solution are obtained in this paper, instead of the l_\infty(0, T^*; l_2) convergence for the solution and the l_\infty(0, T^*; H^{-2}) convergence for the time-derivative, given in [17]. In addition, the stability and convergence of this method is shown to be unconditional for the time step in terms of the spatial grid size, compared with a severe restriction time step restriction \Delta t \leq Ch^2 reported in [17].
