We study a second order hyperbolic initial-boundary value partial differential equation with memory, that results in an integro-differential equation with a convolution kernel. The kernel is assumed to be either smooth or no worse than weakly singular, that arise, e.g. in linear and fractional order viscoelasticity. Existence and uniqueness of the spatial local and global Galerkin approximation of the problem is proved by means of Picard iteration. Then spatial finite element approximation of the problem is formulated, and optimal order a priori error estimates are proved by energy method. The required regularity of the solution, for optimal order convergence, is the same as minimum regularity of the solution for second order hyperbolic partial differential equations.
