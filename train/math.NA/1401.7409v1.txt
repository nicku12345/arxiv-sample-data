We present a simple finite element method for the discretization of Reissner--Mindlin plate equations. The finite element method is based on using the nonconforming Crouzeix-Raviart finite element space for the transverse displacement, and the standard linear finite element space for the rotation of the transverse normal vector. We also present two examples for the discrete Lagrange multiplier space for the proposed formulation.
