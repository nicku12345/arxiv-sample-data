The paper studies a method for solving elliptic partial differential equations posed on hypersurfaces in \mathbb{R}^N, N=2,3. The method allows a surface to be given implicitly as a zero level of a level set function. A surface equation is extended to a narrow-band neighborhood of the surface. The resulting extended equation is a non-degenerate PDE and it is solved on a bulk mesh that is unaligned to the surface. An unfitted finite element method is used to discretize extended equations. Error estimates are proved for finite element solutions in the bulk domain and restricted to the surface. The analysis admits finite elements of a higher order and gives sufficient conditions for archiving the optimal convergence order in the energy norm. Several numerical examples illustrate the properties of the method.
