Spectral deferred correction (SDC) methods are an attractive approach to iteratively computing collocation solutions to an ODE by performing so-called sweeps with a low-order time stepping method. SDC allows to easily construct high order split methods where e.g. stiff terms of the ODE are treated implicitly. This requires the solution to full accuracy of multiple linear systems of equations during each sweep, e.g. with a multigrid method. In this paper, we present an inexact variant of SDC, where each solve of a linear system is replaced by a single multigrid V-cycle and thus significantly reduces the cost for each sweep. For the investigated examples, this strategy results only in a small increase of the number of required sweeps and we demonstrate that "inexact spectral deferred corrections" can provide a dramatic reduction of the overall number of multigrid V-cycles required to complete an SDC time step.
