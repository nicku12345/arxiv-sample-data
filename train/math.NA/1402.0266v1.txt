We use a time-relaxed linear grid generator of Winslow type to propose a new deterministic-stochastic domain decomposition approach to the generation of adaptive moving meshes. The method uses the probabilistic form of the exact solution of the linear mesh generator to provide the sub-domain interface values that serve as boundary conditions for the domain decomposition. The meshes over the single sub-domains can then be obtained independently of each other in an entirely parallel fashion. We demonstrate numerically the capability of the method to yield smooth, time-evolving meshes.
