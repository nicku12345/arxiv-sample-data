The safety and condition of transportation infrastructure has been at the forefront of national debates in recent times due to catastrophic bridge failures, but the issue has been a longstanding challenge for transportation agencies for many years as resources continue to diminish. The performance of this infrastructure has a direct influence on the lives of most of citizens in developed regions by providing a critical lifeline between communities and the transportation of goods and services, and as a critical component of the transportation network, bridges have received a lot of attention regarding condition assessment and maintenance practices. Despite successful implementation of advanced evaluation techniques, what is still lacking is a fundamental understanding of the system behavior in the presence of deteriorating conditions that can be used for preservation decision-making. This paper aims to present a performance-based framework that can be used to characterize the behavior of in-service bridge superstructures. In order to measure the bridge system performance with deteriorating conditions, system-level behavior of a representative composite steel girder bridge, degraded with three common damage scenarios was investigated in this study. Results obtained from validated numerical analysis demonstrated significant impact of integrated damage mechanisms on the ultimate capacity, redundancy and system ductility of the simulated bridge superstructure. It is expected that the proposed framework for evaluating system behavior will provide a first step for establishing a critical linkage between design, maintenance, and rehabilitation of highway bridges, which are uncoupled in current infrastructure decision-making processes.
