This paper presents three new computational methods for calculating design sensitivities of statistical moments and reliability of high-dimensional complex systems subject to random input. The first method represents a novel integration of polynomial dimensional decomposition (PDD) of a multivariate stochastic response function and score functions. Applied to the statistical moments, the method provides mean-square convergent analytical expressions of design sensitivities of the first two moments of a stochastic response. The second and third methods, relevant to probability distribution or reliability analysis, exploit two distinct combinations built on PDD: the PDD-SPA method, entailing the saddlepoint approximation (SPA) and score functions; and the PDD-MCS method, utilizing the embedded Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) of the PDD approximation and score functions. For all three methods developed, the statistical moments or failure probabilities and their design sensitivities are both determined concurrently from a single stochastic analysis or simulation. Numerical examples, including a 100-dimensional mathematical problem, indicate that the new methods developed provide not only theoretically convergent or accurate design sensitivities, but also computationally efficient solutions. A practical example involving robust design optimization of a three-hole bracket illustrates the usefulness of the proposed methods.
