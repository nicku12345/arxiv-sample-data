This paper outlines an energy-minimization finite-element approach to the computational modeling of equilibrium configurations for nematic liquid crystals under free elastic effects. The method targets minimization of the system free energy based on the Frank-Oseen free-energy model. Solutions to the intermediate discretized free elastic linearizations are shown to exist generally and are unique under certain assumptions. This requires proving continuity, coercivity, and weak coercivity for the accompanying appropriate bilinear forms within a mixed finite-element framework. Error analysis demonstrates that the method constitutes a convergent scheme. Numerical experiments are performed for problems with a range of physical parameters as well as simple and patterned boundary conditions. The resulting algorithm accurately handles heterogeneous constant coefficients and effectively resolves configurations resulting from complicated boundary conditions relevant in ongoing research.
