We derive and analyze high order discontinuous Galerkin methods for second-order elliptic problems on implicitely defined surfaces in \mathbb{R}^{3}. This is done by carefully adapting the unified discontinuous Galerkin framework of Arnold et al. [2002] on a triangulated surface approximating the smooth surface. We prove optimal error estimates in both a (mesh dependent) energy norm and the L^2 norm.
