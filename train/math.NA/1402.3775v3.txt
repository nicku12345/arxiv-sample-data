In this paper, we propose new spectral viscosity methods based on the generalized Hermite functions for the solution of nonlinear scalar conservation laws in the whole line. It is shown rigorously that these schemes converge to the unique entropy solution by using compensated compactness arguments, under some conditions. The numerical experiments of the inviscid Burger's equation support our result, and it verifies the reasonableness of the conditions.
