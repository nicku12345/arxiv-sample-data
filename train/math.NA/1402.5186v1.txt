This paper presents a technique for stress and fracture analysis by using the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) with quadtree mesh of high-order elements. The cells of the quadtree mesh are modelled as scaled boundary polygons that can have any number of edges, be of any high orders and represent the stress singularity around a crack tip accurately without asymptotic enrichment or other special techniques. Owing to these features, a simple and automatic meshing algorithm is devised. No special treatment is required for the hanging nodes and no displacement incompatibility occurs. Curved boundaries and cracks are modelled without excessive local refinement. Five numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the simplicity and applicability of the proposed technique.
