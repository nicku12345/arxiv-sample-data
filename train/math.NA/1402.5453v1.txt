Many adaptive mesh methods explicitly or implicitly use equidistribution and alignment. These principles can be considered central to mesh adaption. A Metric Tensor is the tool by which one describes the desired level of mesh anisotropy. In contrast a mesh redistribution method based on the Monge-Ampere equation, which combines equidistribution with optimal transport, does not require the explicit construction of a Metric Tensor, although one always exists. An interesting question is whether such a method produces an anisotropic mesh. To answer this question we consider the general metric to which an optimally transported mesh aligns. We derive the exact metric, involving expressions for its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, for a model linear feature. The eigenvectors of are shown to be orthogonal and tangential to the feature, and the ratio of the eigenvalues is shown to depend, both locally and globally, on the value of the scalar density function. We thereby demonstrate how an optimal transport method produces an anisotropic mesh along a given feature while equidistributing a suitably chosen scalar density function. Numerical results for a Parabolic Monge-Ampere moving mesh method are included to verify these results, and a number of additional questions are raised.
