In this paper, we construct a hierarchy of hybrid numerical methods for multi-scale kinetic equations based on moment realizability matrices, a concept introduced by Levermore, Morokoff and Nadiga. Following such a criterion, one can consider hybrid scheme where the hydrodynamic part is given either by the compressible Euler or Navier-Stokes equations, or even with more general models, such as the Burnett or super-Burnett systems.
