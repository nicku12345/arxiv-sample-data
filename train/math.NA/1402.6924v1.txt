Alfeld introduced a subdivision AS(n) of an n-simplex, generalizing the Clough-Tocher split of a triangle. A formula for the dimension of the spline space C^r_k(AS(n)) was conjectured recently by Foucart-Sorokina. We prove that the graded module of C^r-splines on the cone over AS(n) is isomorphic to the module D^{r+1}(A_n) of multiderivations on the type A_n Coxeter arrangement. A theorem of Terao shows that the module of multiderivations of a Coxeter arrangement is free and gives an explicit basis. As a consequence the conjectured formula holds.
