We derive optimal order a posteriori error estimates for fully discrete approximations of the initial-boundary value problem for the heat equation. For the discretization in time we apply the fractional-step \vartheta-scheme and for the discretization in space the finite element method with finite element spaces that are allowed to change with time. The first optimal order a posteriori error estimates in L^\infty(0, T ; L^2({\varOmega})) are derived by applying the reconstruction technique.
