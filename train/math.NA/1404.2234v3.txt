We present a fast algorithm that constructs a data-sparse approximation of matrices arising in the context of integral equation methods for elliptic partial differential equations.   The new algorithm uses Green's representation formula in combination with quadrature to obtain a first approximation of the kernel function and then applies nested cross approximation to obtain a more efficient representation.   The resulting \mathcal{H}^2-matrix representation requires \mathcal{O}(n k) units of storage for an n\times n matrix, where k depends on the prescribed accuracy.
