We consider the symmetric FEM-BEM coupling that connects two linear elliptic second order partial differential equations posed in a bounded domain \Omega and its complement, where the exterior problem is restated by an integral equation on the coupling boundary \Gamma=\partial\Omega. We assume that the corresponding transmission problem admits a shift theorem for data in H^{-1+s}, s \in [-1,-1+s_0], s_0 > 1/2. We analyze the discretization by piecewise polynomials of degree k for the domain variable and piecewise polynomials of degree k-1 for the flux variable on the coupling boundary. Given sufficient regularity we show that (up to logarithmic factors) the optimal convergence O(h^{k+1/2}) in the H^{-1/2}(\Gamma)-norm is obtained for the flux variable, while classical arguments by C\'ea-type quasi-optimality and standard approximation results provide only O(h^k) for the overall error in the natural product norm on H^1(\Omega)\times H^{-1/2}(\Gamma).
