In this paper, the fractional differential matrices based on the Jacobi-Gauss points are derived with respect to the Caputo and Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative operators. The spectral radii of the fractional differential matrices are investigated numerically. The spectral collocation schemes are illustrated to solve the fractional ordinary differential equations and fractional partial differential equations. Numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the derived methods, which show better performances over some existing methods.
