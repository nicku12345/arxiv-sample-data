In this paper we study a fully discrete Semi-Lagrangian approximation of a second order Mean Field Game system, which can be degenerate. We prove that the resulting scheme is well posed and, if the state dimension is equals to one, we prove a convergence result. Some numerical simulations are provided, evidencing the convergence of the approximation and also the difference between the numerical results for the degenerate and non-degenerate cases.
