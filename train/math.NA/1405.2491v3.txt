In this paper, we propose a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin(HDG) method with reduced stabilization for the Poisson equation. The reduce stabilization proposed here enables us to use piecewise polynomials of degree k and k-1 for the approximations of element and inter-element unknowns, respectively, unlike the standard HDG methods. We provide the error estimates in the energy and L^2 norms under the chunkiness condition. In the case of k=1, it can be shown that the proposed method is closely related to the Crouzeix-Raviart nonconforming finite element method. Numerical results are presented to verify the validity of the proposed method.
