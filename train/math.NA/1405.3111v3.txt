In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering a compactly supported multivariate function from a collection of pointwise samples of its Fourier transform taken nonuniformly. We do this by using the concept of weighted Fourier frames. A seminal result of Beurling shows that sample points give rise to a classical Fourier frame provided they are relatively separated and of sufficient density. However, this result does not allow for arbitrary clustering of sample points, as is often the case in practice. Whilst keeping the density condition sharp and dimension independent, our first result removes the separation condition and shows that density alone suffices. However, this result does not lead to estimates for the frame bounds. A known result of Groechenig provides explicit estimates, but only subject to a density condition that deteriorates linearly with dimension. In our second result we improve these bounds by reducing the dimension dependence. In particular, we provide explicit frame bounds which are dimensionless for functions having compact support contained in a sphere. Next, we demonstrate how our two main results give new insight into a reconstruction algorithm---based on the existing generalized sampling framework---that allows for stable and quasi-optimal reconstruction in any particular basis from a finite collection of samples. Finally, we construct sufficiently dense sampling schemes that are often used in practice---jittered, radial and spiral sampling schemes---and provide several examples illustrating the effectiveness of our approach when tested on these schemes.
