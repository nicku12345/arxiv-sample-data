We study multivariate integration of functions that are invariant under permutations (of subsets) of their arguments. We find an upper bound for the nth minimal worst case error and show that under certain conditions, it can be bounded independent of the number of dimensions. In particular, we study the application of unshifted and randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rules in such a problem setting. We derive conditions under which multivariate integration is polynomially or strongly polynomially tractable with the Monte Carlo rate of convergence O(n^{-1/2}). Furthermore, we prove that those tractability results can be achieved with shifted lattice rules and that the shifts are indeed necessary. Finally, we show the existence of rank-1 lattice rules whose worst case error on the permutation- and shift-invariant spaces converge with (almost) optimal rate. That is, we derive error bounds of the form O(n^{-\lambda/2}) for all 1 \leq \lambda < 2 \alpha, where \alpha denotes the smoothness of the spaces.
