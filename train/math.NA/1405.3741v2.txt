We introduce the nonconforming Virtual Element Method (VEM) for the approximation of second order elliptic problems.   We present the construction of the new element in two and three dimensions, highlighting the main differences with the conforming VEM and the classical nonconforming finite element methods.   We provide the error analysis and establish the equivalence with a family of mimetic finite difference methods.
