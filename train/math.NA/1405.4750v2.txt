We give an a priori analysis of a semi-discrete discontinuous Galerkin scheme approximating solutions to a model of multiphase elastodynamics which involves an energy density depending not only on the strain but also the strain gradient. A key component in the analysis is the reduced relative entropy stability framework developed in [Gie14]. We prove optimal bounds for the strain in an appropriate norm and suboptimal bounds for the velocity.
