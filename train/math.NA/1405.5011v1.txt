In this paper we consider the numerical solution of Fractional Differential Equations by means of m-step recursions. The construction of such formulas can be obtained in many ways. Here we study a technique based on the rational approximation of the generating functions of Fractional Backward Differentiation Formulas (FBDFs). Accurate approximations allow to define methods which simulate the theoretical properties of the underlying FBDF with important computational advantages. Numerical experiments are presented.
