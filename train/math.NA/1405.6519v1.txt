We study a class of time evolution models that contain dissipation mech- anisms exhibited by geophysical materials during deformation: plasticity, viscous dissipation and fracture. We formally prove that they satisfy a Clausius-Duhem type inequality. We describe a semi-discrete time evolu- tion associated with these models, and report numerical 1D and 2D traction experiments, that illustrate that several dissipation regimes can indeed take place during the deformation. Finally, we report 2D numerical simulation of an experiment by Peltzer and Tapponnier, who studied the indentation of a layer of plasticine as an analogue model for geological materials.
