We consider linear systems of equations and inequalities with coefficients varying inside given intervals. We define their solutions (so called AE solutions) and solvability (so called AE solvability) by using forall-exists quantification of interval parameters. We present an explicit description of the AE solutions, and discuss complexity issues as well. For AE solvability, we propose a sufficient condition only, but for a specific sub-class of problems, a complete characterization is developed. Moreover, we investigate inequality systems for which AE solvability is equivalent to existence of an AE solution.
