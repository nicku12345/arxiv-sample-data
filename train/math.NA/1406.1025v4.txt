A new class of linearizations and \ell-ifications for m\times m matrix polynomials P(x) of degree n is proposed. The \ell-ifications in this class have the form A(x) = D(x) + (e\otimes I_m) W(x) where D is a block diagonal matrix polynomial with blocks B_i(x) of size m, W is an m\times qm matrix polynomial and e=(1,\ldots,1)^t\in\mathbb C^q, for a suitable integer q. The blocks B_i(x) can be chosen a priori, subjected to some restrictions. Under additional assumptions on the blocks B_i(x) the matrix polynomial A(x) is a strong \ell-ification, i.e., the reversed polynomial of A(x) defined by A^\#(x) := x^{\mathrm{deg} A(x)} A(x^{-1}) is an \ell-ification of P^\#(x). The eigenvectors of the matrix polynomials P(x) and A(x) are related by means of explicit formulas. Some practical examples of \ell-ifications are provided. A strategy for choosing B_i(x) in such a way that A(x) is a well conditioned linearization of P(x) is proposed. Some numerical experiments that validate the theoretical results are reported
