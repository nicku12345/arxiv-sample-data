In order to determine the stationary distribution for discrete time quasi-birth-death Markov chains, it is necessary to find the minimal nonnegative solution of a quadratic matrix equation. We apply the Newton-Shamanskii method for solving the equation. We show that the sequence of matrices generated by the Newton-Shamanskii method is monotonically increasing and converges to the minimal nonnegative solution of the equation. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of our method.
