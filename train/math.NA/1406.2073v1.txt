We apply the finite element cell-centered (FECC) scheme [2] to the solution of the nearly incompressible elasticity problem. By applying a technique of dual mesh, such a low-order finite element scheme can be constructed from any given mesh and it is proved to satisfy the "macroelement condition" [5], meaning that the stability condition is fulfilled. Numerical results show that the method, which is simple to implement, is effective in terms of accuracy and computational cost compared with other methods.
