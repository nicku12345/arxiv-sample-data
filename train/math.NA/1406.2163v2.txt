We propose a robust a posteriori error estimator for the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for convection-diffusion equations with dominant convection. The reliability and efficiency of the estimator are established for the error measured in an energy norm. The energy norm is uniformly bounded even when the diffusion coefficient tends to zero. The estimators are robust in the sense that the upper and lower bounds of error are uniformly bounded with respect to the diffusion coefficient. A weighted test function technique and the Oswald interpolation are key ingredients in the analysis. Numerical results verify the robustness of the proposed a posteriori error estimator. In numerical experiments, optimal convergence is observed.
