We propose and analyse a fully-discrete discontinuous Galerkin time-stepping method for parabolic Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations with Cordes coefficients. The method is consistent and unconditionally stable on rather general unstructured meshes and time-partitions. Error bounds are obtained for both rough and regular solutions, and it is shown that for sufficiently smooth solutions, the method is arbitrarily high-order with optimal convergence rates with respect to the mesh size, time-interval length and temporal polynomial degree, and possibly suboptimal by an order and a half in the spatial polynomial degree. Numerical experiments on problems with strongly anisotropic diffusion coefficients and early-time singularities demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the method, with exponential convergence rates under combined hp- and \tau q-refinement.
