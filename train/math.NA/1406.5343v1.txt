In this paper we present an efficient iterative method of order six for the inclusion of the inverse of a given regular matrix. To provide the upper error bound of the outer matrix for the inverse matrix, we combine point and interval iterations. The new method is relied on a suitable matrix identity and a modification of a hyper-power method. This method is also feasible in the case of a full-rank m\times n matrix, producing the interval sequence which converges to the Moore-Penrose inverse. It is shown that computational efficiency of the proposed method is equal or higher than the methods of hyper-power's type.
