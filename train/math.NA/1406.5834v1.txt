In this paper, reduced differential transform method (RDTM) is employed to approximate the solutions of (2+1) dimensional type of the Zakharov-Kuznetsov partial differential equations. We apply these method to two examples. Thus, we have obtained numerical solution partial differential equations of Zakharov-Kuznetsov. These examples are prepared to show the efficiency and simplicity of the method.
