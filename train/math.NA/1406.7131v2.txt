In this paper, we study scalar multivariate non-stationary subdivision schemes with integer dilation matrix M=mI, m >=2, and present a general approach for checking their convergence and for determining their H\"older regularity. The combination of the concepts of asymptotic similarity and approximate sum rules allows us to link stationary and non-stationary settings and to employ recent advances in methods for exact computation of the joint spectral radius. As an application, we prove a recent conjecture on the H\"older regularity of the generalized Daubechies wavelets. We illustrate our results with several examples.
