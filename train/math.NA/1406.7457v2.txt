This paper presents a family of mixed finite elements on triangular grids for solving the classical Hellinger-Reissner mixed problem of the elasticity equations. In these elements, the matrix-valued stress field is approximated by the full C^0-P_k space enriched by (k-1) H(\d) edge bubble functions on each internal edge, while the displacement field by the full discontinuous P_{k-1} vector-valued space, for the polynomial degree k\ge 3. The main challenge is to find the correct stress finite element space matching the full C^{-1}-P_{k-1} displacement space. The discrete stability analysis for the inf-sup condition does not rely on the usual Fortin operator, which is difficult to construct. It is done by characterizing the divergence of local stress space which covers the P_{k-1} space of displacement orthogonal to the local rigid-motion. The well-posedness condition and the optimal a priori error estimate are proved for this family of finite elements. Numerical tests are presented to confirm the theoretical results.
