We investigate a domain decomposed multigrid technique, segmental refinement, for solving general nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems. Brandt and Diskin first proposed this method in 1994; we continue this work by analytically and experimentally investigating its complexity. We confirm that communication of traditional parallel multigrid can be eliminated on fine grids with modest amounts of extra work and storage while maintaining the asymptotic exactness of full multigrid, although we observe a dependence on an additional parameter not considered in the original analysis. We present a communication complexity analysis that quantifies the communication costs ameliorated by segmental refinement and report performance results with up to 64K cores of a Cray XC30.
