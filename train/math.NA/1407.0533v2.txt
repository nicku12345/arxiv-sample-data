A new sampling methodology based on incomplete cosine expansion series is presented as an alternative to the traditional sinc function approach. Numerical integration shows that this methodology is efficient and practical. Applying the incomplete cosine expansion we obtain a rational approximation of the complex error function that with the same number of the summation terms provides an accuracy exceeding the Weideman\text{'}s approximation accuracy by several orders of the magnitude. Application of the expansion results in an integration consisting of elementary function terms only. Consequently, this approach can be advantageous for accurate and rapid computation.
