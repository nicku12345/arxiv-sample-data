In this paper, a new two-parameter family of regularized kernels is introduced, suitable for applying high-order time stepping to N-body systems. These high-order kernels are derived by truncating a Taylor expansion of the non-regularized kernel about (r^2+\epsilon^2), generating a sequence of increasingly more accurate kernels. This paper proves the validity of this two-parameter family of regularized kernels, constructs error estimates, and illustrates the benefits of using high-order kernels through numerical experiments.
