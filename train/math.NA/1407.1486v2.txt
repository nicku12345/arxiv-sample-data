Both the mean square polynomial stability and exponential stability of \theta Euler-Maruyama approximation solutions of stochastic differential equations will be investigated for each 0\le\theta\le 1 by using an auxiliary function F (see the following definition (2.3)). Sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the polynomial and exponential stability of the numerical approximations. The results in Liu et al [12] will be improved and generalized to more general cases. Several examples and non stability results are presented to support our conclusions.
