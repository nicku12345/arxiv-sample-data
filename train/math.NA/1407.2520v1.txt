We consider the large scale nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equation arising in transport theory, where the n\times n coefficient matrices B, C are symmetric and low-ranked and A, E are rank one updates of nonsingular diagonal matrices. By introducing a balancing strategy and setting appropriate initial matrices carefully, we can simplify the large-scale structure-preserving doubling algorithm (SDA\_ls) for this special equation. We give modified large-scale structure-preserving doubling algorithm, which can reduce the flop operations of original SDA\_ls by half. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our method.
