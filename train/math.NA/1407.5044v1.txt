The Classic Howard's algorithm, a technique of resolution for discrete Hamilton-Jacobi equations, is of large use in applications for its high efficiency and good performances. A special beneficial characteristic of the method is the superlinear convergence which, in presence of a finite number of controls, is reached in finite time. Performances of the method can be significantly improved by using parallel computing; how to build a parallel version of method is not a trivial point, the difficulties come from the strict relation between various values of the solution, even related to distant points of the domain. In this contribution we propose a parallel version of the Howard's algorithm driven by an idea of domain decomposition. This permits to derive some important properties and to prove the convergence under quite standard assumptions. The good features of the algorithm will be shown through some tests and examples.
