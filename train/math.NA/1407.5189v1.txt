In this paper we investigate an adaptive discretization strategy for ill-posed linear prob- lems combined with a regularization from a class of semiiterative methods. We show that such a discretization approach in combination with a stopping criterion as the discrepancy principle or the balancing principle yields an order optimal regularization scheme and allows to reduce the computational costs.
