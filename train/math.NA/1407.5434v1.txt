The cubic Trigonometric B-spline(CTB) functions are used to set up the collocation method for finding solutions of the Burgers' equation. The effect of the CTB in the collocation method is sought by studying two text problems. The Burgers' equation is fully-discretized using the Crank-Nicholson method for the time discretizion and CTB function for discretizion of spatial variable. Numerical examples are performed to show the convenience of the method for solutions of Burgers equation
