We consider continuous and discontinuous Galerkin time stepping methods of arbitrary order as applied to nonlinear initial value problems in real Hilbert spaces. Our only assumption is that the nonlinearities are continuous; in particular, we include the case of unbounded nonlinear operators. Specifically, we develop new techniques to prove general Peano-type existence results for discrete solutions. In particular, our results show that the existence of solutions is independent of the local approximation order, and only requires the local time steps to be sufficiently small (independent of the polynomial degree). The uniqueness of (local) solutions is addressed as well. In addition, our theory is applied to finite time blow-up problems with nonlinearities of algebraic growth. For such problems we develop a time step selection algorithm for the purpose of numerically computing the blow-up time, and provide a convergence result.
