A family of weak Galerkin finite element discretization is developed for solving the coupled Darcy-Stokes equation. The equation in consideration admits the Beaver-Joseph-Saffman condition on the interface. By using the weak Galerkin approach, in the discrete space we are able to impose the normal continuity of velocity explicitly. Or in other words, strong coupling is achieved in the discrete space. Different choices of weak Galerkin finite element spaces are discussed, and error estimates are given.
