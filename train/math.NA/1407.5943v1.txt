Motion by weighted mean curvature is a geometric evolution law for surfaces and represents steepest descent with respect to anisotropic surface energy. It has been proposed that this motion could be computed numerically by using a "crystalline" approximation to the surface energy in the evolution law. In this paper we prove the convergence of this numerical method for the case of simple closed convex curves in the plane.
