We study the classical first-kind boundary integral equation reformulations of time-harmonic acoustic scattering by planar sound-soft (Dirichlet) and sound-hard (Neumann) screens. We prove continuity and coercivity of the relevant boundary integral operators (the acoustic single-layer and hypersingular operators respectively) in appropriate fractional Sobolev spaces, with wavenumber-explicit bounds on the continuity and coercivity constants. Our analysis is based on spectral representations for the boundary integral operators, and builds on results of Ha-Duong (Jpn J Ind Appl Math 7:489--513 (1990) and Integr Equat Oper Th 15:427--453 (1992)).
