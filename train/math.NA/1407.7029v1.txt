In this study, approximate solution of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation, by the reduced differential transform method, are presented. We apply this method to an example. Thus, we have obtained numerical solution Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Comparisons are made between the exact solution and the reduced differential transform method. The results show that this method is very effective and simple.
