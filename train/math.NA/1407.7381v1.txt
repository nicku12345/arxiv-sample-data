We demonstrate the equivalence of two classes of D-invariant polynomial subspaces introduced in [8] and [9], i.e., these two classes of subspaces are different representations of the breadth-one D-invariant subspace. Moreover, we solve the discrete approximation problem in ideal interpolation for the breadth-one D-invariant subspace. Namely, we find the points, such that the limiting space of the evaluation functionals at these points is the functional space induced by the given D-invariant subspace, as the evaluation points all coalesce at one point.
