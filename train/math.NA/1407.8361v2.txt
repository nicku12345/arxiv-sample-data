Subdivision schemes have become an important tool for approximation of manifold-valued functions. In this paper, we describe a construction of manifold-valued subdivision schemes for geodesically complete manifolds. Our construction is based upon the adaptation of linear subdivision schemes using the notion of repeated binary averaging, where as a repeated binary average we propose to use the geodesic inductive mean. We derive conditions on the adapted schemes which guarantee convergence from any initial manifold-valued sequence. The definition and analysis of convergence are intrinsic to the manifold. The adaptation technique and the convergence analysis are demonstrated by several important examples.
