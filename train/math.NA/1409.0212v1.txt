We construct a high-order adaptive time stepping scheme for vesicle suspensions with viscosity contrast. The high-order accuracy is achieved using a spectral deferred correction (SDC) method, and adaptivity is achieved by estimating the local truncation error with the numerical error of physically constant values. Numerical examples demonstrate that our method can handle suspensions with vesicles that are tumbling, tank-treading, or both. Moreover, we demonstrate that a user-prescribed tolerance can be automatically achieved for simulations with long time horizons.
