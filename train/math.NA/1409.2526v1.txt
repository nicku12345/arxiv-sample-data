We discuss a recursive family of iterative methods for the numerical approximation of roots of nonlinear functions in one variable. These methods are based on Newton-Cotes closed quadrature rules. We prove that when a quadrature rule with n+1 nodes is used the resulting iterative method has convergence order at least n+2, starting with the case n=0 (which corresponds to the Newton's method).
