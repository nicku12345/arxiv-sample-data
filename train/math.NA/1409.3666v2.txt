We give an explicit construction of two-dimensional point sets whose L_p discrepancy is of best possible order for all 1\le p\le \infty. It is provided by folding Hammersley point sets in base b by means of the b-adic baker's transformation which has been introduced by Hickernell (2002) for b=2 and Goda, Suzuki and Yoshiki (2013) for arbitrary b\in \mathbb{N}, b\ge 2. We prove that both the minimum Niederreiter-Rosenbloom-Tsfasman weight and the minimum Dick weight of folded Hammersley point sets are large enough to achieve the best possible order of L_p discrepancy for all 1\le p\le \infty.
