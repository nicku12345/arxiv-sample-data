We investigate quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration of bivariate periodic functions with dominating mixed smoothness of order one. While there exist several QMC constructions which asymptotically yield the optimal rate of convergence of \mathcal{O}(N^{-1}\log(N)^{\frac{1}{2}}), it is yet unknown which point set is optimal in the sense that it is a global minimizer of the worst case integration error. We will present a computer-assisted proof by exhaustion that the Fibonacci lattice is the unique minimizer of the QMC worst case error in periodic H^1_\text{mix} for small N. Moreover, we investigate the situation for pointsets whose cardinality N is not a Fibonacci number. It turns out that for N=1,2,3,5,7,8,12,13 the optimal point sets are integration lattices.
