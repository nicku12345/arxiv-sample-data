We study semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin (SLDG) and Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) schemes for some front propagation problems in the presence of an obstacle term, modeled by a nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the form \min(u_t + c u_x, u - g(x))=0, in one space dimension. New convergence results and error bounds are obtained for Lipschitz regular data. These "low regularity" assumptions are the natural ones for the solutions of the studied equations.
