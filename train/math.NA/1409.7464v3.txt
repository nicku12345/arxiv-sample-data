Numerical methods for fractional calculus attract increasing interests due to its wide applications in various fields such as physics, mechanics, etc. In this paper, we focus on constructing high-order algorithms for Riesz derivatives, where the convergence orders cover from the second order to the sixth order. Then we apply the established schemes to the Riesz space fractional turbulent diffusion equation. Numerical experiments are displayed which support the theoretical analysis.
