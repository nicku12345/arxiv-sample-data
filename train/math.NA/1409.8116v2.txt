A fast Poisson solver software package PoisFFT is presented. It is available as a free software licensed under the GNU GPL license version 3. The package uses the fast Fourier transform to directly solve the Poisson equation on a uniform orthogonal grid. It can solve the pseudo-spectral approximation and the second order finite difference approximation of the continuous solution. The paper reviews the mathematical methods for the fast Poisson solver and discusses the software implementation and parallelization. The use of PoisFFT in an incompressible flow solver is also demonstrated.
