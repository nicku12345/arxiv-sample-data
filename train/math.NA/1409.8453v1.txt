The aim of this paper is the numerical study of a class of nonlinear nonlocal degenerate parabolic equations. The convergence and error bounds of the solutions are proved for a linearized Crank-Nicolson-Galerkin finite element method with polynomial approximations of degree k\geq 1. Some explicit solutions are obtained and used to test the implementation of the method in Matlab environment.
