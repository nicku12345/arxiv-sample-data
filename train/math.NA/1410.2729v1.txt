A new equivalence notion between non-stationary subdivision schemes, termed asymptotical similarity, which is weaker than asymptotical equivalence, is introduced and studied. It is known that asymptotical equivalence between a non-stationary subdivision scheme and a convergent stationary scheme guarantees the convergence of the non-stationary scheme. We show that for non-stationary schemes reproducing constants, the condition of asymptotical equivalence can be relaxed to asymptotical similarity. This result applies to a wide class of non-stationary schemes of importance in theory and applications.
