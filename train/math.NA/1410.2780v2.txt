In this paper we address the numerical solution of nonlinear ill-posed systems by iterative regularization methods in the classes of Levenberg-Marquardt, trust-region and adaptive quadratic regularization procedures. Both with exact and noisy data, our focus is on the potential to approach a solution of the unperturbed systems without assumptions on its vicinity to the initial guess. Regularizing properties of the methods proposed are shown theoretically and validated numerically along with enhanced convergence.
