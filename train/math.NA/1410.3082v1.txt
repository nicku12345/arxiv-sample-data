Consider an n \times n matrix polynomial P(\lambda). An upper bound for a spectral norm distance from P(\lambda) to the set of n \times n matrix polynomials that have a given scalar \mu\in\mathbb{C} as a multiple eigenvalue was recently obtained by Papathanasiou and Psarrakos (2008). This paper concerns a refinement of this result for the case of weakly normal matrix polynomials. A modification method is implemented and its efficiency is verified by an illustrative example.
