It is well known that as a famous type of iterative methods in numerical linear algebra, Gauss-Seidel iterative methods are convergent for linear systems with strictly or irreducibly diagonally dominant matrices, invertible H-matrices (generalized strictly diagonally dominant matrices) and Hermitian positive definite matrices. But, the same is not necessarily true for linear systems with nonstrictly diagonally dominant matrices and general H-matrices. This paper firstly proposes some necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence on Gauss-Seidel iterative methods to establish several new theoretical results on linear systems with nonstrictly diagonally dominant matrices and general H-matrices. Then, the convergence results on preconditioned Gauss-Seidel (PGS) iterative methods for general H-matrices are presented. Finally, some numerical examples are given to demonstrate the results obtained in this paper.
