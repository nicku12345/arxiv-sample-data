We propose a new method for the approximate solution of the Lyapunov equation with rank-1 right-hand side, which is based on extended rational Krylov subspace approximation with adaptively computed shifts. The shift selection is obtained from the connection between the Lyapunov equation, solution of systems of linear ODEs and alternating least squares method for low-rank approximation. The numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach.
