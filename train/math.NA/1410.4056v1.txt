This note covers two parts. The first one provides an errata to the paper "Numerical and analytical modeling of busbar systems". We mainly give the correction for three equations affected by a typographical mistake. Despite the corrections that we are providing with this note, we think that the implementation of these equations can be quite onerous. Hence, in the second part of this document we provide the download link to our implementation of the equations (developed in MATLAB environment). Moreover, to help in using these functions, we explain their behavior by means of some examples.
