In the present paper, using S.L. Sobolev's method, interpolation spline that minimizes the expression \int_0^1(\varphi^{(m)}(x)+\omega^2\varphi^{(m-2)}(x))^2dx in the K_2(P_m) space are constructed. Explicit formulas for the coefficients of the interpolation splines are obtained. The obtained interpolation spline is exact for monomials 1,x,x^2,..., x^{m-3} and for trigonometric functions \sin\omega x and \cos\omega x.
