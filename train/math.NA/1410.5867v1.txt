In this paper, we present an iterative three-point method with memory based on the family of King's methods to solve nonlinear equations. This proposed method has eighth order convergence and costs only four function evaluations per iteration which supports the Kung-Traub conjecture on the optimal order of convergence. An acceleration of the convergence speed is achieved by an appropriate variation of a free parameter in each step. This self accelerator parameter is estimated using Newton's interpolation polynomial of fourth degree. The order of convergence is increased from 8 to 12 without any extra function evaluation. Consequently, this method, possesses a high computational efficiency. Finally, a numerical comparison of the proposed method with related methods shows its effectiveness and performance in high precision computations.
