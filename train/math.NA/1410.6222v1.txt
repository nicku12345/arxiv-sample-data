We address the classical issue of appropriate choice of the regularization and discretization level for the Tikhonov regularization of an inverse problem with imperfectly measured data. We focus on the fact that the proper choice of the discretization level in the domain together with the regularization parameter is a key feature in adequate regularization. We propose a discrepancy-based choice for these quantities by applying a relaxed version of Morozov's discrepancy principle. Indeed, we prove the existence of the discretization level and the regularization parameter satisfying such discrepancy. We also prove associated regularizing properties concerning the Tikhonov minimizers.
