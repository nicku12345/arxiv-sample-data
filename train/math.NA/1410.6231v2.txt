We propose a \theta-scheme to discretize the d-dimensional stochastic cubic Schr\"odinger equation in Stratono\-vich sense. A uniform bound for the Hamiltonian of the discrete problem is obtained, which is a crucial property to verify the convergence in probability towards a mild solution.   Furthermore, based on the uniform bounds of iterates in {\mathbb H}^2(\mathcal{O}) for \mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^{1}, the optimal convergence order 1 in strong local sense is obtained.
