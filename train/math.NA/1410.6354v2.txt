Complexes of discrete distributional differential forms are introduced into finite element exterior calculus. Thus we generalize a notion of Braess and Sch\"oberl, originally studied for a posteriori error estimation. We construct isomorphisms between the simplicial homology groups of the triangulation, the discrete harmonic forms of the finite element complex, and the harmonic forms of the distributional finite element complexes. As an application, we prove that the complexes of finite element exterior calculus have cohomology groups isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology, including the case of partial boundary conditions. Poincar\'e-Friedrichs-type inequalities will be studied in a subsequent contribution.
