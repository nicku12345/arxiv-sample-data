We study the construction of a non-standard finite differences numerical scheme for a general class of two dimensional differential equations including several models in population dynamics using the idea of non-local approximation introduced by R. Mickens. We prove the convergence of the scheme, the unconditional, with respect to the discretisation parameter, preservation of the fixed points of the continuous system and the preservation of their stability nature. Several numerical examples are given and comparison with usual numerical scheme (Euler, Runge-Kutta of order 2 or 4) are detailed.
