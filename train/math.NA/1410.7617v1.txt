In this work, we discuss kinetic descriptions of flocking models, of the so-called Cucker-Smale and Motsch-Tadmor types. These models are given by Vlasov-type equations where the interactions taken into account are only given long-range bi-particles interaction potential. We introduce a new exact rescaling velocity method, inspired by a recent work of Filbet and Rey, allowing to observe numerically the flocking behavior of the solutions to these equations, without a need of remeshing or taking a very fine grid in the velocity space. To stabilize the exact method, we also introduce a modification of the classical upwind finite volume scheme which preserves the physical properties of the solution, such as momentum conservation.
