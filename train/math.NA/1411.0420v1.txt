Let {\mathbb F} be a field with characteristic not 2, and A_i\in{\mathbb F}^{m\times n},B_i\in{\mathbb F}^{n\times m},C_i\in{\mathbb F}^{m\times m}, for i=1,...,k. In this short note, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency of the system of \star-Sylvester equations A_iX-X^\star B_i=C_i, for i=1,...,k, where \star denotes either the transpose or, when {\mathbb F}={\mathbb C}, the conjugate transpose.
