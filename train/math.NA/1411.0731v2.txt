Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for high dimensional integrals over unit cubes and products of spheres are well-studied in literature. We study QMC tractability of integrals of functions defined over the product of m copies of the simplex T^d \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}. The domain is a tensor product of m reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces defined by `weights' \gamma_{m,j}, for j = 1,2, \ldots, m. Similar to the results on the unit cube in m dimensions, and the product of m copies of the d-dimensional sphere, we prove that strong polynomial tractability holds iff \limsup_{m \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{j=1}^m \gamma_{m,j} < \infty and polynomial tractability holds iff \limsup_{m \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sum_{j=1}^m \gamma_{m,j}}{\log(m + 1 )} < \infty. We also show that weak tractability holds iff \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sum_{j=1}^m \gamma_{m,j}}{m} = 0. The proofs employ Sobolev space techniques and weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert space techniques for the simplex and products of simplices as domain. Properties of orthogonal polynomials on a simplex are also used extensively.
