In this paper we present two efficient approximations for the complex error function w \left( {z} \right) with small imaginary argument \operatorname{Im}{\left[ { z } \right]} < < 1 over the range 0 \le \operatorname{Re}{\left[ { z } \right]} \le 15 that is commonly considered difficult for highly accurate and rapid computation. These approximations are expressed in terms of the Dawson's integral F\left( x \right) of real argument x that enables their efficient implementation in a rapid algorithm. The error analysis we performed using the random input numbers x and y reveals that in the real and imaginary parts the average accuracy of the first approximation exceeds {10^{ - 9}} and {10^{ - 14}}, while the average accuracy of the second approximation exceeds {10^{ - 13}} and {10^{ - 14}}, respectively. The first approximation is slightly faster in computation. However, the second approximation provides excellent high-accuracy coverage over the required domain.
