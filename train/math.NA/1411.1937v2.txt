A thin plate spline surface for interpolation of smooth transfinite data prescribed along concentric circles was recently proposed by Bejancu, using Kounchev's polyspline method. The construction of the new `Beppo Levi polyspline' surface reduces, via separation of variables, to that of a countable family of univariate L-splines, indexed by the frequency integer k. This paper establishes the existence, uniqueness and variational properties of the `Beppo Levi L-spline' schemes corresponding to non-zero frequencies k. In this case, the resulting L-spline end conditions are formulated in terms of \emph{adjoint} differential operators, unlike the usual `natural' L-spline end conditions, which employ identical operators at both ends. Our L-spline error analysis leads to an L^{2}-error bound for transfinite surface interpolation with Beppo Levi polysplines.
