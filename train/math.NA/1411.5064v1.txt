We combine the spectral (viscosity) method and ensemble averaging to propose an algorithm that computes admissible measure valued solutions of the incompressible Euler equations. The resulting approximate young measures are proved to converge (with increasing numerical resolution) to a measure valued solution. We present numerical experiments demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, as well as the appropriateness of measure valued solutions as a solution framework for the Euler equations. Furthermore, we report an extensive computational study of the two dimensional vortex sheet, which indicates that the computed measure valued solution is non-atomic and implies possible non-uniqueness of weak solutions constructed by Delort.
