We develop a regularization operator based on smoothing on a locally defined length scale. This operator is defined on L_1 and has approximation properties that are given by the local regularity of the function it is applied to and the local length scale. Additionally, the regularized function satisfies inverse estimates commensurate with the approximation orders. By combining this operator with a classical hp-interpolation operator, we obtain an hp-Cl\'ement type quasi-interpolation operator, i.e., an operator that requires minimal smoothness of the function to be approximated but has the expected approximation properties in terms of the local mesh size and polynomial degree. As a second application, we consider residual error estimates in hp-boundary element methods that are explicit in the local mesh size and the local approximation order.
