The decomposition of polynomial spaces on unions of Grassmannians \mathcal G_{{k_1},d}\cup\ldots\cup \mathcal G_{{k_r},d} into irreducible orthogonally invariant subspaces and their reproducing kernels are investigated. We also generalize the concepts of cubature points and t-designs from single Grassmannians to unions. We derive their characterization as minimizers of a suitable energy potential to enable t-design constructions by numerical optimization. We also present new analytic families of t-designs for t=1,2,3.
