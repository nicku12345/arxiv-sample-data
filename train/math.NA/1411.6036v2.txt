We design a two-scale finite element method (FEM) for linear elliptic PDEs in non-divergence form A(x) : D^2 u(x) = f(x) in a bounded but not necessarily convex domain \Omega and study it in the max norm. The fine scale is given by the meshsize h whereas the coarse scale \epsilon is dictated by an integro-differential approximation of the PDE. We show that the FEM satisfies the discrete maximum principle (DMP) for any uniformly positive definite matrix A provided that the mesh is face weakly acute. We establish a discrete Alexandroff-Bakelman-Pucci (ABP) estimate which is suitable for finite element analysis. Its proof relies on a discrete Alexandroff estimate which expresses the min of a convex piecewise linear function in terms of the measure of its sub-differential, and thus of jumps of its gradient. The discrete ABP estimate leads, under suitable regularity assumptions on A and u, to pointwise error estimates of the form \begin{equation*} \| u - u^{\epsilon}_h \|_{L_\infty(\Omega)} \leq \, C(A,u) \, h^{2\alpha /(2 + \alpha)} \big| \ln h \big| \qquad 0< \alpha \leq 2, \end{equation*} provided \epsilon \approx h^{2/(2+\alpha)}. Such a convergence rate is at best of order  h \big| \ln h \big|, which turns out to be quasi-optimal.
