We consider second order explicit and implicit two-step time-discrete schemes for wave-type equations. We derive optimal order aposteriori estimates controlling the time discretization error. Our analysis, has been motivated by the need to provide aposteriori estimates for the popular leap-frog method (also known as Verlet's method in molecular dynamics literature); it is extended, however, to general cosine-type second order methods. The estimators are based on a novel reconstruction of the time-dependent component of the approximation. Numerical experiments confirm similarity of convergence rates of the proposed estimators and of the theoretical convergence rate of the true error.
