Kernel-based methods in Numerical Analysis have the advantage of yielding optimal recovery processes in the "native" Hilbert space \calh in which they are reproducing. Continuous kernels on compact domains have an expansion into eigenfunctions that are both L_2-orthonormal and orthogonal in \calh (Mercer expansion). This paper examines the corresponding eigenspaces and proves that they have optimality properties among all other subspaces of \calh. These results have strong connections to n-widths in Approximation Theory, and they establish that errors of optimal approximations are closely related to the decay of the eigenvalues.   Though the eigenspaces and eigenvalues are not readily available, they can be well approximated using the standard n-dimensional subspaces spanned by translates of the kernel with respect to n nodes or centers. We give error bounds for the numerical approximation of the eigensystem via such subspaces. A series of examples shows that our numerical technique via a greedy point selection strategy allows to calculate the eigensystems with good accuracy.
