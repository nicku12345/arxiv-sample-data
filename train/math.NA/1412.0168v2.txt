Fix an integer s. Let f:[0,1)^s \to \mathbb R be an integrable function. Let P\subset [0,1]^s be a finite point set. Quasi-Monte Carlo integration of f by P is the average value of f over P that approximates the integration of f over the s-dimensional cube. Koksma-Hlawka inequality tells that, by a smart choice of P, one may expect that the error decreases roughly O(N^{-1}(\log N)^s). For any \alpha \geq 1, J.\ Dick gave a construction of point sets such that for \alpha-smooth f, convergence rate O(N^{-\alpha}(\log N)^{s\alpha}) is assured. As a coarse version of his theory, M-Saito-Matoba introduced Walsh figure of Merit (WAFOM), which gives the convergence rate O(N^{-C\log N/s}). WAFOM is efficiently computable. By a brute-force search of low WAFOM point sets, we observe a convergence rate of order N^{-\alpha} with \alpha>1, for several test integrands for s=4 and 8.
