Many applications in applied mathematics and control theory give rise to the unique solution of a Sylvester-like matrix equation associated with an underlying structured matrix operator f. In this paper, we will discuss the solvability of the Sylvester-like matrix equation through an auxiliary standard (or generalized) Sylvester matrix equation. We also show that when this Sylvester-like matrix equation is uniquely solvable, the closed-form solutions can be found by using previous result. In addition, with the aid of the Kronecker product some useful results of the solvability of this matrix equation are provided.
