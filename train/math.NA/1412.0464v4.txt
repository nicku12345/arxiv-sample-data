In this paper we generalize and improve a recently developed domain decomposition preconditioner for the iterative solution of discretized Helmholtz equations. We introduce an improved method for transmission at the internal boundaries using perfectly matched layers. Simultaneous forward and backward sweeps are introduced, thereby improving the possibilities for parallellization. Finally, the method is combined with an outer two-grid iteration. The method is studied theoretically and with numerical examples. It is shown that the modifications lead to substantial decreases in computation time and memory use, so that computation times become comparable to that of the fastests methods currently in the literature for problems with up to 10^8 degrees of freedom.
