In this paper, we study randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration using digitally shifted digital nets. We express the mean square QMC error of the n-th discrete approximation f_n of a function f\colon[0,1)^s\to \mathbb{R} for digitally shifted digital nets in terms of the Walsh coefficients of f. We then apply a bound on the Walsh coefficients for sufficiently smooth integrands to obtain a quality measure called Walsh figure of merit for root mean square error, which satisfies a Koksma-Hlawka type inequality on the root mean square error. Through two types of experiments, we confirm that our quality measure is of use for finding digital nets which show good convergence behaviors of the root mean square error for smooth integrands.
