For a 3-tensor of dimensions I_1\times I_2\times I_3, we show that the nuclear norm of its every matrix flattening is a lower bound of the tensor nuclear norm, and which in turn is upper bounded by \sqrt{\min\{I_i : i\neq j\}} times the nuclear norm of the matrix flattening in mode j for all j=1,2,3. The results can be generalized to N-tensors with any N\geq 3. Both the lower and upper bounds for the tensor nuclear norm are sharp in the case N=3. A computable criterion for the lower bound being tight is given as well.
