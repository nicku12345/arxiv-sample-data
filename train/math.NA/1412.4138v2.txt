The use of pyramid elements is crucial to the construction of efficient hex-dominant meshes. For conforming nodal finite element methods with mixed element types, it is advantageous for nodal distributions on the faces of the pyramid to match those on the faces and edges of hexahedra and tetrahedra. We adapt existing procedures for constructing optimized tetrahedral nodal sets for high order interpolation to the pyramid with constrained face nodes, including two generalizations of the explicit Warp and Blend construction of nodes on the tetrahedron.
