In the past decades, the finite difference methods for space fractional operators develop rapidly; to the best of our knowledge, all the existing finite difference schemes, including the first and high order ones, just work on uniform meshes. The nonlocal property of space fractional operator makes it difficult to design the finite difference scheme on non-uniform meshes. This paper provides a basic strategy to derive the first and high order discretization schemes on non-uniform meshes for fractional operators. And the obtained first and second schemes on non-uniform meshes are used to solve space fractional diffusion equations. The error estimates and stability analysis are detailedly performed; and extensive numerical experiments confirm the theoretical analysis or verify the convergence orders.
