We prove the convergence of greedy and randomized versions of Schwarz iterative methods for solving linear elliptic variational problems based on infinite space splittings of a Hilbert space. For the greedy case, we show a squared error decay rate of O((m+1)^{-1}) for elements of an approximation space \mathcal{A}_1 related to the underlying splitting. For the randomized case, we show an expected squared error decay rate of O((m+1)^{-1}) on a class \mathcal{A}_{\infty}^{\pi}\subset \mathcal{A}_1 depending on the probability distribution.
