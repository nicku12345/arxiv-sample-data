We present a review of recent works on the mathematical analysis of algorithms which have been proposed by A.F. Voter and co-workers in the late nineties in order to efficiently generate long trajectories of metastable processes. These techniques have been successfully applied in many contexts, in particular in the field of materials science. The mathematical analysis we propose relies on the notion of quasi stationary distribution.
