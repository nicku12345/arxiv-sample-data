We derived a number of numerical methods to treat biomolecular systems with multiple time scales. Based on the splitting of the operators associated with the slow-varying and fast-varying forces, new multiple time-stepping (MTS) methods are obtained by eliminating the dominant terms in the error. These new methods can be viewed as a generalization of the impulse method. In the implementation of these methods, the long-range forces only need to be computed on the slow time scale, which reduces the computational cost considerably. Preliminary analysis for the energy conservation property is provided.
