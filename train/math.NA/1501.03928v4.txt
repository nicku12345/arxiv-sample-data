In this paper, we consider the higher order Boussinesq (HBq) equation which models the bi-directional propagation of longitudinal waves in various continuous media. The equation contains the higher order effects of frequency dispersion. The present study is devoted to the numerical investigation of the HBq equation. For this aim a numerical scheme combining the Fourier pseudo-spectral method in space and a Runge Kutta method in time is constructed. The convergence of semi-discrete scheme is proved in an appropriate Sobolev space. To investigate the higher order dispersive effects and nonlinear effects on the solutions of HBq equation, propagation of single solitary wave, head-on collision of solitary waves and blow-up solutions are considered.
