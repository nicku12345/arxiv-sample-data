In this paper we propose and analyze a Discontinuous Galerkin method for a linear parabolic problem with dynamic boundary conditions. We present the formulation and prove stability and optimal a priori error estimates for the fully discrete scheme. More precisely, using polynomials of degree p\geq 1 on meshes with granularity h along with a backward Euler time-stepping scheme with time-step \Delta t, we prove that the fully-discrete solution is bounded by the data and it converges, in a suitable (mesh-dependent) energy norm, to the exact solution with optimal order h^p + \Delta t. The sharpness of the theoretical estimates are verified through several numerical experiments.
