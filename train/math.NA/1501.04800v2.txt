A fully discrete Lagrangian scheme for solving a family of fourth order equations numerically is presented. The discretization is based on the equation's underlying gradient flow structure w.r.t. the L^2-Wasserstein distance, and adapts numerous of its most important structural properties by construction, as conservation of mass and entropy-dissipation.   In this paper, the long-time behaviour of our discretization is analyzed: We show that discrete solutions decay exponentially to equilibrium at the same rate as smooth solutions of the origin problem. Moreover, we give a proof of convergence of discrete entropy minimizers towards Barenblatt-profiles or Gaussians, respectively, using \Gamma-convergence.
