We further develop the \emph{Multivariate Decomposition Method} (MDM) for the Lebesgue integration of functions of infinitely many variables x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots with respect to a corresponding product of a one dimensional probability measure.   Although a number of concepts of infinite-dimensional integrals have been used in the literature, questions of uniqueness and compatibility have mostly not been studied. We show that, under appropriate convergence conditions, the Lebesgue integral equals the `anchored' integral, independently of the anchor.   The MDM assumes that point values of f_{\mathfrak{u}} are available for important subsets {\mathfrak{u}}, at some known cost. In this paper we introduce a new setting, in which it is assumed that each f_{\mathfrak{u}} belongs to a normed space F_{\mathfrak{u}}, and that bounds B_{\mathfrak{u}} on \|f_{\mathfrak{u}}\|_{F_{\mathfrak{u}}} are known. This contrasts with the assumption in many papers that weights \gamma_{\mathfrak{u}}, appearing in the norm of the infinite-dimensional function space, are somehow known. Often such weights \gamma_{\mathfrak{u}} were determined by minimizing an error bound depending on the B_{\mathfrak{u}}, the \gamma_{\mathfrak{u}} \emph{and} the chosen algorithm, resulting in weights that depend on the algorithm. In contrast, in this paper only the bounds B_{\mathfrak{u}} are assumed known.   We give two examples in which we specialize the MDM: in the first case F_{\mathfrak{u}} is the |{\mathfrak{u}}|-fold tensor product of an anchored reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and in the second case it is a particular non-Hilbert space for integration over an unbounded domain.
