We define a non-iterative transformation method for Blasius equation with moving wall or surface gasification. The defined method allows us to deal with classes of problems in boundary layer theory that, depending on a parameter, admit multiple or no solutions. This approach is particularly convenient when the main interest is on the behaviour of the considered models with respect to the involved parameter. The obtained numerical results are found to be in good agreement with those available in literature.
