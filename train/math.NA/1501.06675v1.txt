First we present the general equation form of a thermal explosion in a vessel with boundary values, later use central difference method and Newton iteration method to solve the relevant partial differential equations in one-dimensional and two-dimensional forms, finally we use numerical experiments to verify the order of convergence of the central difference scheme and provide the experiment results.
