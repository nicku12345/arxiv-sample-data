In this paper, we propose an improvement of the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method, by projecting the estimated mean force onto a gradient. The associated stochastic process satisfies a non linear stochastic differential equation. Using entropy techniques, we prove exponential convergence to the stationary state of this stochastic process. We finally show on some numerical examples that the variance of the approximated mean force is reduced using this technique, which makes the algorithm more efficient than the standard ABF method.
