The paper is concerned with Galerkin finite element solutions for parabolic equations in a convex polygon or polyhehron with a diffusion coefficient in W^{1,N+\epsilon} for some \epsilon>0, where N denotes the dimension of the domain. We prove the analyticity of the semigroup generated by the discrete elliptic operator, the discrete maximal L^p regularity and the optimal L^p error estimate of the finite element solution for the parabolic equation.
