We present decay bounds for a broad class of Hermitian matrix functions where the matrix argument is banded or a Kronecker sum of banded matrices. Besides being significantly tighter than previous estimates, the new bounds closely capture the actual (non-monotonic) decay behavior of the entries of functions of matrices with Kronecker sum structure. We also discuss extensions to more general sparse matrices.
