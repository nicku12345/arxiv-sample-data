ESFEM is a method introduced in order to solve a linear advection-diffusion equation on an evolving two-dimensional surface with finite elements by using a moving grid with nodes sitting on and evolving with the surface. The evolution of the surface is assumed to be given as a smooth one-parameter family of embeddings of a fixed initial surface into \mathbb{R}^3 satisfying uniform C^4 bounds. We calculate an equivalent transformed equation which is defined on the fixed initial surface and can hence be solved numerically on a fixed grid. We present numerical examples which indicate that both approaches are essentially of the same accuracy.
