Stationary iterative methods with a symmetric splitting matrix are performed as inner-iteration preconditioning for Krylov subspace methods. We give conditions such that the inner-iteration preconditioning matrix is definite, and show that conjugate gradient (CG) method preconditioned by the inner iterations determines a solution of symmetric and positive semidefinite linear systems, and the minimal residual (MINRES) method preconditioned by the inner iterations determines a solution of symmetric linear systems including the singular case. These results are applied to the CG and MINRES-type methods such as the CGLS, LSMR, and CGNE methods preconditioned by inner iterations, and thus justify using these methods for solving least squares and minimum-norm solution problems whose coefficient matrices are not necessarily of full rank. Thus, we complement the convergence theories of these methods presented in [K. Morikuni and K. Hayami, SIAM J. Matrix Appl. Anal., 34 (2013), pp.1-22], [K. Morikuni and K. Hayami, SIAM J. Matrix Appl. Anal., 36 (2015), pp. 225-250], and give bounds for these methods.
