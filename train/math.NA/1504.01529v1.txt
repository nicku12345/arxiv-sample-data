In this work, we consider the numerical solution of an initial boundary value problem for the distributed order time fractional diffusion equation. The model arises in the mathematical modeling of ultra-slow diffusion processes observed in some physical problems, whose solution decays only logarithmically as the time t tends to infinity. We develop a space semidiscrete scheme based on the standard Galerkin finite element method, and establish error estimates optimal with respect to data regularity in L^2(D) and H^1(D) norms for both smooth and nonsmooth initial data. Further, we propose two fully discrete schemes, based on the Laplace transform and convolution quadrature generated by the backward Euler method, respectively, and provide optimal convergence rates in the L^2(D) norm, which exhibits exponential convergence and first-order convergence in time, respectively. Extensive numerical experiments are provided to verify the error estimates for both smooth and nonsmooth initial data, and to examine the asymptotic behavior of the solution.
