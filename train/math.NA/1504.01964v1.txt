The function y = g(x) = \mathrm{log}\big(W(e^x)\big), where W() denotes the Lambert W function, is the solution to the equation y + e^y = x. It appears in various problem situations, for instance the calculation of current-voltage curves for solar cells. A direct calculation of g(x) may be inaccurate because of arithmetic underflow or overflow. We present a simple algorithm for calculating g(x) that is robust, in that it will work for almost all x values which are representable in the arithmetic of one's chosen computer language. The algorithm does not assume that the chosen computer language implements the Lambert W function.
