We consider the variational formulation of the electric field integral equation on a Lipschitz polyhedral surface \Gamma. We study the Galerkin boundary element discretisations based on the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas surface elements on a sequence of anisotropic meshes algebraically graded towards the edges of \Gamma. We establish quasi-optimal convergence of Galerkin solutions under a mild restriction on the strength of grading. The key ingredient of our convergence analysis are new componentwise stability properties of the Raviart-Thomas interpolant on anisotropic elements.
