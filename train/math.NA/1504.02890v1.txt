We present here a general method based on the investigation of the relative energy of the system, that provides an unconditional error estimate for the approximate solution of the barotropic Navier Stokes equations obtained by time and space discretization. We use this methodology to derive an error estimate for a specific DG/finite element scheme for which the convergence was proved in [27]. This is an extended version of the paper submitted to IMAJNA.
