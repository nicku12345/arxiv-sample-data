In this paper we give a new Koksma-Hlawka type inequality for Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration. QMC integration of a function f\colon[0,1)^s\rightarrow \mathbb{R} by a finite point set \mathcal{P}\subset [0,1)^s is the approximation of the integral I(f):=\int_{[0,1)^s}f(\mathbf{x})\,d\mathbf{x} by the average I_{\mathcal{P}}(f):=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{P}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{P}}f(\mathbf{x}). We treat a certain class of point sets \mathcal{P} called digital nets. A Koksma-Hlawka type inequality is an inequality bounding the integration error \text{Err}(f;\mathcal{P}):=I(f)-I_{\mathcal{P}}(f) by a bound of the form |\text{Err}(f;\mathcal{P})|\le C\cdot \|f\|\cdot D(\mathcal{P}). We can obtain a Koksma-Hlawka type inequality by estimating bounds on |\hat{f}(\mathbf{k})|, where \hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) is a generalized Fourier coefficient with respect to the Walsh system. In this paper we prove bounds on Walsh coefficients \hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) by introducing an operator called `dyadic difference' \partial_{i,n}. By converting dyadic differences \partial_{i,n} to derivatives \frac{\partial }{\partial x_i}, we get a new bound on |\hat{f}(\mathbf{k})| for a function f whose mixed partial derivatives up to order \alpha in each variable are continuous. This new bound is smaller than the known bound on |\hat{f}(\mathbf{k})| under some condition. The new Koksma-Hlawka inequality is derived using this new bound on the Walsh coefficients.
