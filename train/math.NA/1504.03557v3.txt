We propose a novel approach to the problem of polynomial approximation of rational B\'ezier triangular patches with prescribed boundary control points. The method is very efficient thanks to using recursive properties of the bivariate dual Bernstein polynomials and applying a smart algorithm for evaluating a collection of two-dimensional integrals. Some illustrative examples are given.
