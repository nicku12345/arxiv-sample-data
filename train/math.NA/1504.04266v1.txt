We derive new explicit expressions for the components of Moore-Penrose inverses of symmetric difference matrices. These generalized inverses are applied in a new regularization approach for scattered data interpolation based on partial differential equations. The columns of the Moore-Penrose inverse then serve as elements of a dictionary that allow a sparse signal approximation. In order to find a set of suitable data points for signal representation we apply the orthogonal patching pursuit (OMP) method.
