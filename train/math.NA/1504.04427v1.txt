We present a variant of the solver in Zepeda-N\'u\~nez and Demanet (2014), for the 2D high-frequency Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous acoustic media. By changing the domain decomposition from a layered to a grid-like partition, this variant yields improved asymptotic online and offline runtimes and a lower memory footprint. The solver has online parallel complexity that scales \emph{sub linearly} as \mathcal{O} \left( \frac{N}{P} \right), where N is the number of volume unknowns, and P is the number of processors, provided that P = \mathcal{O}(N^{1/5}). The variant in Zepeda-N\'u\~nez and Demanet (2014) only afforded P = \mathcal{O}(N^{1/8}). Algorithmic scalability is a prime requirement for wave simulation in regimes of interest for geophysical imaging.
