We introduce a new class of arbitrary-order exponential time differencing methods based on spectral deferred correction (ETDSDC) and describe a simple procedure for initializing the requisite matrix functions. We compare the stability and accuracy properties of our ETDSDC meth- ods to those of an existing implicit-explicit spectral deferred correction scheme (IMEXSDC). We find that ETDSDC methods have larger accuracy regions and comparable stability regions. We conduct numerical experiments to compare ETD and IMEX spectral deferred correction schemes against a competing fourth-order ETD Runge-Kutta scheme. We find that high-order ETDSDC schemes are the most efficient in terms of function evaluations and overall speed when solving partial differential equations to high accuracy. Our results suggest that high-order ETDSDC schemes are well-suited to work in conjunction with spectral spatial methods or other high-order spatial discritizations. Addi- tionally, ETDSDC schemes appear to be immune to severe order reduction, a problem which affects other ETD and IMEX schemes, including IMEXSDC.
