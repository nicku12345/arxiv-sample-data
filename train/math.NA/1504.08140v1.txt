We use the local orthogonal decomposition technique to derive a generalized finite element method for linear and semilinear parabolic equations with spatial multiscale diffusion coefficient. We consider nonsmooth initial data and a backward Euler scheme for the temporal discretization. Optimal order convergence rate, depending only on the contrast, but not on the variations in the diffusion coefficient, is proven in the L_\infty(L_2)-norm. We present numerical examples, which confirm our theoretical findings.
