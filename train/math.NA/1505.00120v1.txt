We describe and analyse a space-time Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin method for the wave equation. The method is defined for unstructured meshes whose internal faces need not be aligned to the space-time axes. We show that the scheme is well-posed and dissipative, and we prove a priori error bounds for general Trefftz discrete spaces. A concrete discretisation can be obtained using piecewise polynomials that satisfy the wave equation elementwise.
