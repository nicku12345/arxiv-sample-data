An \mathcal{O}(N(\log N)^2/\log\!\log N) algorithm for computing the discrete Legendre transform and its inverse is described. The algorithm combines a recently developed fast transform for converting between Legendre and Chebyshev coefficients with a Taylor series expansion for Chebyshev polynomials about equally-spaced points in the frequency domain. Both components are based on the FFT, and as an intermediate step we obtain an \mathcal{O}(N\log N) algorithm for evaluating a degree N-1 Chebyshev expansion at an N-point Legendre grid. Numerical results are given to demonstrate performance and accuracy.
