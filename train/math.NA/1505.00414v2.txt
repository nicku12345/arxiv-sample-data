The very weak solution of the Poisson equation with L^2 boundary data is defined by the method of transposition. The finite element solution with regularized boundary data converges with order 1/2 in convex domains but has a reduced convergence order in non-convex domains. As a remedy, a dual variant of the singular complement method is proposed. The error order of the convex case is retained. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.
