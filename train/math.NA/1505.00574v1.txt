An n-independent set in two dimensions is a set of nodes admitting (not necessarily unique) bivariate interpolation with polynomials of total degree at most n. For an arbitrary n-independent node set \mathcal X we are interested with the property that each node possesses an n-fundamental polynomial in form of product of linear or quadratic factors. In the present paper we show that each node of \mathcal X has an n-fundamental polynomial, which is a product of lines, if \#\mathcal X\le 2n+1. Next we prove that each node of \mathcal X has an n-fundamental polynomial, which is a product of lines or conics, if \#\mathcal X\le 2n+[n/2]+1. We have a counterexample in each case to show that the results are not valid in general if \#\mathcal X\ge 2n+2 and \#\mathcal X\ge 2n+[n/2]+2, respectively.
