This work proposes and analyzes a generalized acceleration technique for decreasing the computational complexity of using stochastic collocation (SC) methods to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with random input data. The SC approaches considered in this effort consist of sequentially constructed multi-dimensional Lagrange interpolant in the random parametric domain, formulated by collocating on a set of points so that the resulting approximation is defined in a hierarchical sequence of polynomial spaces of increasing fidelity. Our acceleration approach exploits the construction of the SC interpolant to accelerate the underlying ensemble of deterministic solutions. Specifically, we predict the solution of the parametrized PDE at each collocation point on the current level of the SC approximation by evaluating each sample with a previously assembled lower fidelity interpolant, and then use such predictions to provide deterministic (linear or nonlinear) iterative solvers with improved initial approximations. As a concrete example, we develop our approach in the context of SC approaches that employ sparse tensor products of globally defined Lagrange polynomials on nested one-dimensional Clenshaw-Curtis abscissas. This work also provides a rigorous computational complexity analysis of the resulting fully discrete sparse grid SC approximation, with and without acceleration, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methodology in reducing the total number of iterations of a conjugate gradient solution of the finite element systems at each collocation point. Numerical examples include both linear and nonlinear parametrized PDEs, which are used to illustrate the theoretical results and the improved efficiency of this technique compared with several others.
