A method for including a priori information in the 2-D D-bar algorithm is presented. Two methods of assigning conductivity values to the prior are presented, each corresponding to a different scenario on applications. The method is tested on several numerical examples with and without noise and is demonstrated to be highly effective in improving the spatial resolution of the D-bar method.
