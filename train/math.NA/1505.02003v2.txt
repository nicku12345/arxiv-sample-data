We investigate multivariate integration for a space of infinitely times differentiable functions \mathcal{F}_{s, \boldsymbol{u}} := \{f \in C^\infty [0,1]^s \mid \| f \|_{\mathcal{F}_{s, \boldsymbol{u}}} < \infty \}, where \| f \|_{\mathcal{F}_{s, \boldsymbol{u}}} := \sup_{\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_s) \in \mathbb{N}_0^s} \|f^{(\boldsymbol{\alpha})}\|_{L^1}/\prod_{j=1}^s u_j^{\alpha_j}, f^{(\boldsymbol{\alpha})} := \frac{\partial^{|\boldsymbol{\alpha}|}}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots \partial x_s^{\alpha_s}}f and \boldsymbol{u} = \{u_j\}_{j \geq 1} is a sequence of positive decreasing weights. Let e(n,s) be the minimal worst-case error of all algorithms that use n function values in the s-variate case. We prove that for any \boldsymbol{u} and s considered e(n,s) \leq C(s) \exp(-c(s)(\log{n})^2) holds for all n, where C(s) and c(s) are constants which may depend on s. Further we show that if the weights \boldsymbol{u} decay sufficiently fast then there exist some 1 < p < 2 and absolute constants C and c such that e(n,s) \leq C \exp(-c(\log{n})^p) holds for all s and n. These bounds are attained by quasi-Monte Carlo integration using digital nets. These convergence and tractability results come from those for the Walsh space into which \mathcal{F}_{s, \boldsymbol{u}} is embedded.
