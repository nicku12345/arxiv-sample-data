This paper generalizes the non-conforming FEM of Crouzeix and Raviart and its fundamental projection property by a novel mixed formulation for the Poisson problem based on the Helmholtz decomposition. The new formulation allows for ansatz spaces of arbitrary polynomial degree and its discretization coincides with the mentioned non-conforming FEM for the lowest polynomial degree. The discretization directly approximates the gradient of the solution instead of the solution itself. Besides the a priori and medius analysis, this paper proves optimal convergence rates for an adaptive algorithm for the new discretization. These are also demonstrated in numerical experiments. Furthermore, this paper focuses on extensions of this new scheme to quadrilateral meshes, mixed FEMs, and three space dimensions.
