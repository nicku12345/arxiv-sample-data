Our aim in this paper is two-fold: First, for computing zeros of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system \Sigma in {\em state-space form}, we introduce a "trimmed structured linearization", which we refer to as {\em Rosenbrock linearization}, of the Rosenbrock system polynomial \mathcal{S}(\lam) associated with \Sigma. We also introduce Fiedler-like matrices for \mathcal{S}(\lam) and describe constructions of Fiedler-like pencils for \mathcal{S}(\lam). We show that the Fiedler-like pencils of \mathcal{S}(\lam) are Rosenbrock linearizations of the system polynomial \mathcal{S}(\lam). Second, with a view to developing a direct method for solving rational eigenproblems, we introduce "linearization" of a rational matrix function. We describe a state-space framework for converting a rational matrix function G(\lam) to an "equivalent" matrix pencil \mathbb{L}(\lam) of smallest dimension such that G(\lam) and \mathbb{L}(\lam) have the same "eigenstructure" and we refer to such a pencil \mathbb{L}(\lam) as a "linearization" of G(\lam). Indeed, by treating G(\lam) as the transfer function of an LTI system \Sigma_G in state-space form via state-space realization, we show that the Fiedler-like pencils of the Rosenbrock system polynomial associated with \Sigma_G are "linearizations" of G(\lam) when the system \Sigma_G is both controllable and observable.
