In this tutorial paper, we formulate a two-dimensional integral-equation based method of moments approach for numerically computing the electromagnetic fields scattered from an azimuthally-rough dielectric cylinder or an axially-rough perfectly conducting cylinder. The electric field integral equation is discretized in both the cases to yield a system of linear equations, and a detailed evaluation of the matrix elements involved in this system of equations is presented. Numerical computation of important quantities such as the scattering cross-section or the scattered electric fields is also discussed. The primary purpose of this numerical scheme is to validate perturbative solutions that arise in the context of rough cylinder scattering problems.
