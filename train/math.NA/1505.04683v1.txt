We present a rational approximation for the Dawson's integral of real argument and show how it can be implemented for accurate and rapid computation of the Voigt function at small y < < 1. The algorithm based on this approach enables computation with accuracy exceeding {10^{ - 10}} within the domain 0 \le x \le 15 and 0 \le y \le {10^{ - 6}}. Due to rapid performance the proposed rational approximation runs the algorithm without deceleration.
