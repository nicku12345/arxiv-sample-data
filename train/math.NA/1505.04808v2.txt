The main goal of the paper is to establish time semidiscrete and space-time fully discrete maximal parabolic regularity for the time discontinuous Galerkin solution of linear parabolic equations. Such estimates have many applications. They are essential, for example, for establishing optimal a priori error estimates in non- Hilbertian norms without unnatural coupling of spatial mesh sizes with time steps.
