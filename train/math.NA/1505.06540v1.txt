We consider the P1/P1 or P1b/P1 finite element approximations to the Stokes equations in a bounded smooth domain subject to the slip boundary condition. A penalty method is applied to address the essential boundary condition u\cdot n = g on \partial\Omega, which avoids a variational crime and simultaneously facilitates the numerical implementation. We give O(h^{1/2} + \epsilon^{1/2} + h/\epsilon^{1/2})-error estimate for velocity and pressure in the energy norm, where h and \epsilon denote the discretization parameter and the penalty parameter, respectively. In the two-dimensional case, it is improved to O(h + \epsilon^{1/2} + h^2/\epsilon^{1/2}) by applying reduced-order numerical integration to the penalty term. The theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments.
