This paper introduces a quasi-interpolation operator for scalar- and vector-valued finite element spaces constructed on affine, shape-regular meshes with some continuity across mesh interfaces.This operator gives optimal estimates of the best approximation error in any L^p-norm assuming regularity in the fractional Sobolev spaces W^{r,p}, where p\in [1,\infty] and the smoothness index r can be arbitrarily close to zero. The operator is stable in L^1, leaves the corresponding finite element space point-wise invariant whether homogeneous boundary conditions are imposed or not. The theory is illustrated on H^1-, \mathbf{H}(\text{curl})- and \mathbf{H}(\text{div})-conforming spaces.
