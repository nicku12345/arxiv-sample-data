This work deals with the integration of nonsmooth flexible multibody systems with impacts and dry friction. We develop a framework which improves a non-impulsive trajectory of state variables by impulsive correction after each time-step if necessary. This correction is automatic and is evaluated on the same kinematic level as the piecewise non-impulsive trajectory. The resulting overall mixed timestepping scheme is consistent with respect to impacts and friction as well as benefits from advantages of the base integration schemes used to calculate the approximation inside the time-step. Therefore, we compare the generalized-\alpha method, the Bathe method and the ED-\alpha method.
