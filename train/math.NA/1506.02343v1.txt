Recently, Shi and Sun proposed Point Integral method (PIM) to discretize Laplace-Beltrami operator on point cloud. In PIM, Neumann boundary is nature, but Dirichlet boundary needs some special treatment. In our previous work, we use Robin boundary to approximate Dirichlet boundary. In this paper, we introduce another approach to deal with the Dirichlet boundary condition in point integral method using the volume constraint proposed by Du et.al.
