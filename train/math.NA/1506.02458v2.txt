We consider the problem of numerical integration for weighted anchored and ANOVA Sobolev spaces of s-variate functions. Here s is large including s=\infty. Under the assumption of sufficiently fast decaying weights, we prove in a constructive way that such integrals can be approximated by quadratures for functions f_k with only k variables, where k=k(\varepsilon) depends solely on the error demand \varepsilon and is surprisingly small when s is sufficiently large relative to \varepsilon. This holds, in particular, for s=\infty and arbitrary \varepsilon since then k(\varepsilon)<\infty for all \varepsilon. Moreover k(\varepsilon) does not depend on the function being integrated, i.e., is the same for all functions from the unit ball of the space.
