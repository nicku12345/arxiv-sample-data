An explicit C++ library is provided which deals with Zernike Functions over the unit circle as the main subject. The implementation includes basic means to evaluate the functions at points inside the unit circle and to convert the radial and azimuthal parameters to Noll's index and vice versa. Advanced methods allow to expand products of Zernike Functions into sums of Zernike Functions, and to convert Zernike Functions to polynomials over the two Cartesian coordinates and vice versa.
