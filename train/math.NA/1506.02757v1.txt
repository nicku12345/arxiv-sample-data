We present the numerical dispersion effects in solving the convected Helmholtz equation by the conforming and nonconforming quadrilateral finite elements. Particularly, we evaluate the dispersion relations for the numerical schemes. The dispersive behaviors are analyzed by focusing on the Mach number and the angular frequency. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the relations between the numerical dispersions and the computational errors.
