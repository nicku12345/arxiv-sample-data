We study the weak finite element method solving convection-diffusion equations. A weak finite element scheme is presented based on a spacial variational form. We established a weak embedding inequality that is very useful in the weak finite element analysis. The optimal order error estimates are derived in the discrete H^1-norm, the L_2-norm and the L_\infty-norm, respectively. In particular, the H^1-superconvergence of order k+2 is given under certain condition. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate our theoretical analysis
