A fluid-structure interaction technique for the simulation of inflatable structures is introduced. The presented finite-element/boundary-element (FEBE) technique couples an isogeometric finite element discretization of a flexible shell structure with an isogeometric boundary element discretization of a Stokes fluid. This technique was introduced in [Comput. Mech., 2012, 50(6):779-788] for planar problems and extended to 3D in [Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg., 2014, 284:637-663]. One of the marked advantages of this approach is the contact mechanism, lubrication, which is an inherent attribute of the flow model. Its role in preventing contact was theoretically substantiated, but only demonstrated in the planar setting. In the present work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the contact mechanism in the isogeometric and three-dimensional setting, discussing various aspects pertaining to the accurate resolution of the traction responsible for contact prevention.
