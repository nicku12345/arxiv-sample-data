A fast explicit operator splitting (FEOS) method for the molecular beam epitaxy model has been presented in [Cheng, et al., Fast and stable explicit operator splitting methods for phase-field models, J. Comput. Phys., submitted]. The original problem is split into linear and nonlinear subproblems. For the linear part, the pseudo-spectral method is adopted; for the nonlinear part, a 33-point difference scheme is constructed. Here, we give a compact center-difference scheme involving fewer points for the nonlinear subproblem. Besides, we analyze the convergence rate of the algorithm. The global error order \mathcal{O}(\tau^2+h^4) in discrete L^2-norm is proved theoretically and verified numerically. Some numerical experiments show the robustness of the algorithm for small coefficients of the fourth-order term for the one-dimensional case. Besides, coarsening dynamics are simulated in large domains and the 1/3 power laws are observed for the two-dimensional case.
