In this paper, using the linearization technique we write the Helmholtz transmission eigenvalue problem as an equivalent nonselfadjoint linear eigenvalue problem whose left-hand side term is a selfadjoint, continuous and coercive sesquilinear form. To solve the resulting nonselfadjoint eigenvalue problem, we give an H^{2} conforming finite element discretization and establish a two grid discretization scheme. We present a complete error analysis for both discretization schemes, and theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the methods presented in this paper can efficiently compute real and complex transmission eigenvalues.
