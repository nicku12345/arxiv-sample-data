The author in [7] was proved the generalized remainder and quotient theorems of polynomial in one indeterminate where the divisor is complete factorization to linear factors. In this paper we give the formula for the generalized remainder theorem and the generalized quotient theorem of polynomials when the divisor is not factorization to linear factors.
