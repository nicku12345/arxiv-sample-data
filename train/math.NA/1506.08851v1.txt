In this article we investigate a finite element formulation of strongly monotone quasi-linear elliptic PDEs in the context of fixed-point iterations. As opposed to Newton's method, which requires information from the previous iteration in order to linearise the iteration matrix (and thereby to recompute it) in each step, the alternative method used in this article exploits the monotonicity properties of the problem, and only needs the iteration matrix calculated once for all iterations of the fixed-point method. We outline the a priori and a posteriori error estimates for iteratively obtained solutions, and show both theoretically as well as numerically how the number of iterations of the fixed-point method can be restricted in dependence of the mesh size, or of the polynomial degree, to obtain optimal convergence.
