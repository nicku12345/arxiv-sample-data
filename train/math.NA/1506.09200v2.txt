The focus is on a model reduction framework for parameterized elliptic eigenvalue problems by a reduced basis method. In contrast to the standard single output case, one is interested in approximating several outputs simultaneously, namely a certain number of the smallest eigenvalues. For a fast and reliable evaluation of these input-output relations, we analyze a posteriori error estimators for eigenvalues. Moreover, we present different greedy strategies and study systematically their performance. Special attention needs to be paid to multiple eigenvalues whose appearance is parameter-dependent. Our methods are of particular interest for applications in vibro-acoustics.
