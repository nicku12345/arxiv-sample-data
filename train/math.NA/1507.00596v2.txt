We develop a spectral method for solving univariate singular integral equations over unions of intervals by utilizing Chebyshev and ultraspherical polynomials to reformulate the equations as almost-banded infinite-dimensional systems. This is accomplished by utilizing low rank approximations for sparse representations of the bivariate kernels. The resulting system can be solved in {\cal O}(m^2n) operations using an adaptive QR factorization, where m is the bandwidth and n is the optimal number of unknowns needed to resolve the true solution. The complexity is reduced to {\cal O}(m n) operations by pre-caching the QR factorization when the same operator is used for multiple right-hand sides. Stability is proved by showing that the resulting linear operator can be diagonally preconditioned to be a compact perturbation of the identity. Applications considered include the Faraday cage, and acoustic scattering for the Helmholtz and gravity Helmholtz equations, including spectrally accurate numerical evaluation of the far- and near-field solution. The Julia software package SingularIntegralEquations.jl implements our method with a convenient, user-friendly interface.
