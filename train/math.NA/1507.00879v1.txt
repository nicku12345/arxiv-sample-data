The main purpose of the present paper is to study from a numerical analysis point of view some robust methods designed to cope with stiff (highly anisotropic) elliptic problems. The so-called asymptotic-preserving schemes studied in this paper are very efficient in dealing with a wide range of \varepsilon-values, where 0 < \varepsilon \ll 1 is the stiffness parameter, responsible for the high anisotropy of the problem. In particular, these schemes are even able to capture the macroscopic properties of the system, as \varepsilon tends towards zero, while the discretization parameters remain fixed. The objective of this work shall be to prove some \varepsilon-independent convergence results for these numerical schemes and put hence some more rigor in the construction of such AP-methods.
