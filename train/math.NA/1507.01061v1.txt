We study W^{1,p} Lagrange interpolation error estimates for general quadrilateral \mathcal{Q}_{k} finite elements with k\ge 2. For the most standard case of p=2 it turns out that the constant C involved in the error estimate can be bounded in terms of the minimal interior angle of the quadrilateral. Moreover, the same holds for any p in the range 1\le p<3. On the other hand, for 3\le p we show that C also depends on the maximal interior angle. We provide some counterexamples showing that our results are sharp.
