We present a high-order shifted Gegenbauer pseudospectral method (SGPM) to solve numerically the second-order one-dimensional hyperbolic telegraph equation provided with some initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The framework of the numerical scheme involves the recast of the problem into its integral formulation followed by its discretization into a system of well-conditioned linear algebraic equations. The integral operators are numerically approximated using some novel shifted Gegenbauer operational matrices of integration. We derive the error formula of the associated numerical quadratures. We also present a method to optimize the constructed operational matrix of integration by minimizing the associated quadrature error in some optimality sense. We study the error bounds and convergence of the optimal shifted Gegenbauer operational matrix of integration. Moreover, we construct the relation between the operational matrices of integration of the shifted Gegenbauer polynomials and standard Gegenbauer polynomials. We derive the global collocation matrix of the SGPM, and construct an efficient computational algorithm for the solution of the collocation equations. We present a study on the computational cost of the developed computational algorithm, and a rigorous convergence and error analysis of the introduced method. Four numerical test examples have been carried out in order to verify the effectiveness, the accuracy, and the exponential convergence of the method. The SGPM is a robust technique, which can be extended to solve a wide range of problems arising in numerous applications.
