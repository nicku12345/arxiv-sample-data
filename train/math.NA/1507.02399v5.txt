We consider finite element approximations for a one dimensional second order stochastic differential equation of boundary value type driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index H\le 1/2. We make use of a sequence of approximate solutions with the fractional noise replaced by its piecewise con- stant approximations to construct the finite element approximations for the equation. The error estimate of the approximations is derived through rigorous convergence analysis.
