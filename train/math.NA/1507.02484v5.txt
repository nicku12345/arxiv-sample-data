A method for constructing first integral preserving numerical schemes for time-dependent partial differential equations on non-uniform grids is presented. The method can be used with both finite difference and partition of unity approaches, thereby also including finite element approaches. The schemes are then extended to accommodate r-, h- and p-adaptivity. The method is applied to the Korteweg-de Vries equation and the Sine-Gordon equation and results from numerical experiments are presented.
