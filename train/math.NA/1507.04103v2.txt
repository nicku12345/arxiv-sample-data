We propose and rigourously analyze a multiscale time integrator Fourier pseudospectral (MTI-FP) method for the Dirac equation with a dimensionless parameter \varepsilon\in(0,1] which is inversely proportional to the speed of light. In the nonrelativistic limit regime, i.e. 0<\varepsilon\ll 1, the solution exhibits highly oscillatory propagating waves with wavelength O(\varepsilon^2) and O(1) in time and space, respectively. Due to the rapid temporal oscillation, it is quite challenging in designing and analyzing numerical methods with uniform error bounds in \varepsilon\in(0,1]. We present the MTI-FP method based on properly adopting a multiscale decomposition of the solution of the Dirac equation and applying the exponential wave integrator with appropriate numerical quadratures. By a careful study of the error propagation and using the energy method, we establish two independent error estimates via two different mathematical approaches as h^{m_0}+\frac{\tau^2}{\varepsilon^2} and h^{m_0}+\tau^2+\varepsilon^2, where h is the mesh size, \tau is the time step and m_0 depends on the regularity of the solution. These two error bounds immediately imply that the MTI-FP method converges uniformly and optimally in space with exponential convergence rate if the solution is smooth, and uniformly in time with linear convergence rate at O(\tau) for all \varepsilon\in(0,1] and optimally with quadratic convergence rate at O(\tau^2) in the regimes when either \varepsilon=O(1) or 0<\varepsilon\lesssim \tau. Numerical results are reported to demonstrate that our error estimates are optimal and sharp. Finally, the MTI-FP method is applied to study numerically the convergence rates of the solution of the Dirac equation to those of its limiting models when \varepsilon\to0^+.
