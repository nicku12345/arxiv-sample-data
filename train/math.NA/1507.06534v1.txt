We study the local approximation properties in hierarchical spline spaces through multiscale quasi-interpolation operators. This construction suggests the analysis of a subspace of the classical hierarchical spline space (Vuong et al., 2011) which still satisfies the essential properties of the full space. The B-spline basis of such a subspace can be constructed using parent-children relations only, making it well adapted to local refinement algorithms.
