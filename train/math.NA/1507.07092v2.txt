In this paper we propose a method to couple two or more explicit numerical schemes approximating the same time-dependent PDE, aiming at creating new schemes which inherit advantages of the original ones. We consider both advection equations and nonlinear conservation laws. By coupling a macroscopic (Eulerian) scheme with a microscopic (Lagrangian) scheme, we get a new kind of multiscale numerical method.
