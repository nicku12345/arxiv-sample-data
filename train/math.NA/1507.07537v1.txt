Surface incompressibility, also called inextensibility, imposes a zero-surface-divergence constraint on the velocity of a closed deformable material surface. The well-posedness of the mechanical problem under such constraint depends on an inf-sup or stability condition for which an elementary proof is provided. The result is also shown to hold in combination with the additional constraint of preserving the enclosed volume, or isochoricity. These continuous results are then applied to prove a modified discrete inf-sup condition that is crucial for the convergence of stabilized finite element methods.
