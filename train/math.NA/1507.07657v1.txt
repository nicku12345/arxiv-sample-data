In this paper a finite difference/local discontinuous Galerkin method for the fractional diffusion-wave equation is presented and analyzed. We first propose a new finite difference method to approximate the time fractional derivatives, and give a semidiscrete scheme in time with the truncation error O((\Delta t)^2), where \Delta t is the time step size. Further we develop a fully discrete scheme for the fractional diffusion-wave equation, and prove that the method is unconditionally stable and convergent with order O(h^{k+1}+(\Delta t)^{2}), where k is the degree of piecewise polynomial. Extensive numerical examples are carried out to confirm the theoretical convergence rates.
