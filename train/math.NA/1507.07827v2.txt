We present an iterative algorithm to compute numerical approximations of the potential for the Schr\"odinger operator from scattering data. Four different types of scattering data are used as follows: fixed energy, fixed incident angle, backscattering and full data. In the case of fixed energy, the algorithm coincides basically with the one recently introduced by Novikov in [Novikov, R. G., "An iterative approach to non-overdetermined inverse scattering at fixed energy", Sbornik: Mathematics 206 (1), 120-134 (2015)], where some estimates are obtained for large energy scattering data. The numerical results that we present here are consistent with these estimates.
