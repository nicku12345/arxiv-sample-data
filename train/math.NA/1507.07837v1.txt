This work concerns linearization methods for efficiently solving the Richards` equation,a degenerate elliptic-parabolic equation which models flow in saturated/unsaturated porous media.The discretization of Richards` equation is based on backward Euler in time and Galerkin finite el-ements in space. The most valuable linearization schemes for Richards` equation, i.e. the Newtonmethod, the Picard method, the Picard/Newton method and theLscheme are presented and theirperformance is comparatively studied. The convergence, the computational time and the conditionnumbers for the underlying linear systems are recorded. The convergence of theLscheme is theo-retically proved and the convergence of the other methods is discussed. A new scheme is proposed,theLscheme/Newton method which is more robust and quadratically convergent. The linearizationmethods are tested on illustrative numerical examples.
