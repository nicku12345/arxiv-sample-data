We study approximation error bounds of isogeometric function spaces on a specific type of singularly parameterized domains. In this context an isogeometric function is the composition of a piecewise rational function with the inverse of a piecewise rational geometry parameterization. We consider domains where one edge of the parameter domain is mapped onto one point in physical space. To be more precise, in our configuration the singular patch is derived from a reparameterization of a regular triangular patch. On such a domain one can define an isogeometric function space fulfilling certain regularity criteria that guarantee optimal convergence. The main contribution of this paper is to prove approximation error bounds for the previously defined class of isogeometric discretizations.
