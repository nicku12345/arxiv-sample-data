We consider Poisson's equation with a finite number of weighted Dirac masses as a source term, together with its discretization by means of conforming finite elements. For the error in fractional Sobolev spaces, we propose residual-type a posteriori estimators with a specifically tailored oscillation and show that, on two-dimensional polygonal domains, they are reliable and locally efficient. In numerical tests, their use in an adaptive algorithm leads to optimal error decay rates.
