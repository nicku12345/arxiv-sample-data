The numerical integration of the Benjamin and Benjamin--Ono equations are considered. They are non-local partial differential equations involving the Hilbert transform, and due to this, so far quite few structure-preserving integrators have been proposed. In this paper, a new reformulation of the equations is stated, and new structure-preserving discretizations are proposed based on it. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed integrators.
