In \cite{CaZh:09}, we introduced and analyzed an improved Zienkiewicz-Zhu (ZZ) estimator for the conforming linear finite element approximation to elliptic interface problems. The estimator is based on the piecewise "constant" flux recovery in the H(div;\Omega) conforming finite element space. This paper extends the results of \cite{CaZh:09} to diffusion problems with full diffusion tensor and to the flux recovery both in piecewise constant and piecewise linear H(div) space.
