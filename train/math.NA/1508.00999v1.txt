In this paper, we introduce generalized Baskakov Kantorovich Stancu type operators and investigate direct result, local approximation and weighted approximation properties of these operators. Modulus of continuity, second modulus of continuity, Peeters K-functional, weighted modulus of continuity and Lipschitz class are considered to prove our results.
