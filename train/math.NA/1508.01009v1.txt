In the present paper, we introduce Stancu-variant of generalized Baskakov operators and study the rate of convergence using modulus of continuity, order of approximation for the derivative of function f . Direct estimate is proved using K-functional and Ditzian-Totik modulus of smoothness. In the last, we have proved Voronovskaya type theorem.
