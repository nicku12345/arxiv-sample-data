The main challenge in the analysis of numerical schemes for the Zakharov system originates from the presence of derivatives in the nonlinearity. In this paper a new trigonometric time-integration scheme for the Zakharov system is constructed and convergence is proved. The time-step restriction is independent from a spatial discretization. Numerical experiments confirm the findings.
