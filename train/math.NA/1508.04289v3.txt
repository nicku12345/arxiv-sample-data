A V-cycle multigrid method for the Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson (HHJ) discretization of the Kirchhoff plate bending problems is developed in this paper. It is shown that the contraction number of the V-cycle multigrid HHJ mixed method is bounded away from one uniformly with respect to the mesh size. The uniform convergence is achieved for the V-cycle multigrid method with only one smoothing step and without full elliptic regularity. The key is a stable decomposition of the kernel space which is derived from an exact sequence of the HHJ mixed method, and the strengthened Cauchy Schwarz inequality. Some numerical experiments are provided to confirm the proposed V-cycle multigrid method. The exact sequences of the HHJ mixed method and the corresponding commutative diagram is of some interest independent of the current context.
