Fractional diffusion has become a fundamental tool for the modeling of multiscale and heterogeneous phenomena. However, due to its nonlocal nature, its accurate numerical approximation is delicate. We survey our research program on the design and analysis of efficient solution techniques for problems involving fractional powers of elliptic operators. Starting from a localization PDE result for these operators, we develop local techniques for their solution: a priori and a posteriori error analyses, adaptivity and multilevel methods. We show the flexibility of our approach by proposing and analyzing local solution techniques for a space-time fractional parabolic equation.
