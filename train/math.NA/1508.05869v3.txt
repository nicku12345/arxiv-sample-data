We study the numerical approximation of fractional powers of accretive operators in this paper. Namely, if A is the accretive operator associated with an accretive sesquilinear form A(\cdot,\cdot) defined on a Hilbert space \mathbb V contained in L^2(\Omega), we approximate A^{-\beta} for \beta\in (0,1). The fractional powers are defined in terms of the so-called Balakrishnan integral formula. Given a finite element approximation space \mathbb V_h\subset \mathbb V, A^{-\beta} is approximated by A_h^{-\beta}\pi_h where A_h is the operator associated with the form A(\cdot,\cdot) restricted to \mathbb V_h and \pi_h is the L^2(\Omega)-projection onto \mathbb V_h. We first provide error estimates for (A^\beta-A_h^{\beta}\pi_h)f in Sobolev norms with index in [0,1] for appropriate f. These results depend on elliptic regularity properties of variational solutions involving the form A(\cdot,\cdot) and are valid for the case of less than full elliptic regularity. We also construct and analyze an exponentially convergent sinc quadrature approximation to the Balakrishnan integral defining A_h^{\beta}\pi_h f. Finally, the results of numerical computations illustrating the proposed method are given.
