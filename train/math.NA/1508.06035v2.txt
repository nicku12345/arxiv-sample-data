We approximate the solution of the equation  -\Delta_S u+u = f  on a two-dimensional, embedded, orientable, closed surface S where -\Delta_S denotes the Laplace Beltrami operator on S by using continuous, piecewise linear finite elements on a triangulation of S with flat triangles. We show that the L^{\infty}-error is of order O(h^2|\log h|) as in the corresponding situation in an Euclidean setting.
