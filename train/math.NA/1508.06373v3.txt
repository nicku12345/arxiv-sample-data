We investigate quasi-Monte Carlo integration using higher order digital nets in weighted Sobolev spaces of arbitrary fixed smoothness \alpha \in \mathbb{N}, \alpha \ge 2, defined over the s-dimensional unit cube. We prove that randomly digitally shifted order \beta digital nets can achieve the convergence of the root mean square worst-case error of order N^{-\alpha}(\log N)^{(s-1)/2} when \beta \ge 2\alpha. The exponent of the logarithmic term, i.e., (s-1)/2, is improved compared to the known result by Baldeaux and Dick, in which the exponent is s\alpha /2. Our result implies the existence of a digitally shifted order \beta digital net achieving the convergence of the worst-case error of order N^{-\alpha}(\log N)^{(s-1)/2}, which matches a lower bound on the convergence rate of the worst-case error for any cubature rule using N function evaluations and thus is best possible.
