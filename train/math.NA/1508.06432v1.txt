We derive an a priori error estimate for the numerical solution obtained by time and space discretization by the finite volume/finite element method of the barotropic Navier--Stokes equations. The numerical solution on a convenient polyhedral domain approximating a sufficiently smooth bounded domain is compared with an exact solution of the barotropic Navier--Stokes equations with a bounded density. The result is unconditional in the sense that there are no assumed bounds on the numerical solution.
