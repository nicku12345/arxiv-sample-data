We describe a procedure based on the Krawczyk method to compute a verified enclosure for the stabilizing solution of a continuous-time algebraic Riccati equation A^*X+XA+Q=XGX building on the work of [B.~Hashemi, \emph{SCAN} 2012] and adding several modifications to the Krawczyk procedure. We show that after these improvements the Krawczyk method reaches results comparable with the current state-of-the-art algorithm [Miyajima, \emph{Jpn. J. Ind. Appl. Math} 2015], and surpasses it in some examples. Moreover, we introduce a new direct method for verification which has a cubic complexity in term of the dimension of X, employing a fixed-point formulation of the equation inspired by the ADI procedure. The resulting methods are tested on a number of standard benchmark examples.
