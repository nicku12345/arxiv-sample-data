Although the numerical results suggest the optimal convergence order of the two-grid finite element decoupled scheme for mixed Stokes-Darcy model with Beaver-Joseph-Saffman interface condition in literatures, the numerical analysis only get the optimal error order for porous media flow and a non-optimal error order that is half order lower than the optimal one in fluid flow. The purpose of this paper is to fill in the gap between the numerical results and the theoretical analysis. By introducing an H^1- orthogonal decomposition of a specific vector valued space, we obtain the optimal error estimates of the velocity and pressure in fluid flow region.
