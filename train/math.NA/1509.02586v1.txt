We propose the generalized quadrature methods for numerical solution of singular integral equation of Abel type. We overcome the singularity using the analytical calculation of the singular integral expression. The problem of solution of singular integral equation is reduced to nonsingular system of linear algebraic equations without shift meshes techniques employment. We also propose generalized quadrature method for solution of Abel equation using the singular integral. Relaxed errors bounds are derived. In order to improve the accuracy we use Tikhonov regularization method. We demonstrate the efficiency of proposed techniques on infrared tomography problem. Numerical experiments show that it make sense to apply regularization in case of highly noisy sources only. That is due to the fact that singular integral equations enjoy selfregularization property.
