A hierarchical quasi-Helmholtz decomposition, originally developed to address the low-frequency and dense-discretization breakdowns for the EFIE, is applied together with an algebraic preconditioner to improve the convergence of the CFIE in multiscale problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is studied first on some simple examples; next, test on real-life cases up to several hundreds wavelengths show its good performance.
