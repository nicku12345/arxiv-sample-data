It is shown in this paper that non-conforming finite elements on the triangle using P^{1}-nonconforming polynomials and P^{2} -conforming polynomials can be easily built and used.They appear as an 'enriched' version of the standard piecewise quadratic six-node element.This work is divided into two parts.In the first we present the basic- property of the element,namely how it can be built and basic error estimates.We have observed that this new element behaves like P^{1} non-conforming element.In the second part we have applied our element to the elliptic problem and the theoretical estimate has been guaranteed by numerical result.
