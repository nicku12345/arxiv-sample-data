In this paper, we have applied the Meshless method based compactly supported radial basis function collocation for obtaining the numerical solution of unsteady gas equation. The unsteady gas equation is a second order non-linear two-point boundary value ordinary differential equation on the semi-infinite domain, with a boundary condition in the infinite. The compactly supported radial basis function collocation method reduces the solution of the equation to the solution of a system of algebraic equation. also, we compare the results of this work with some results. It is found that our results agree well with those by the numerical method, which verifies the validity of the present work
