Signal-processing on graphs has developed into a very active field of research during the last decade. In particular, the number of applications using frames constructed from graphs, like wavelets on graphs, has substantially increased. To attain scalability for large graphs, fast graph-signal filtering techniques are needed. In this contribution, we propose an accelerated algorithm based on the Lanczos method that adapts to the Laplacian spectrum without explicitly computing it. The result is an accurate, robust, scalable and efficient algorithm. Compared to existing methods based on Chebyshev polynomials, our solution achieves higher accuracy without increasing the overall complexity significantly. Furthermore, it is particularly well suited for graphs with large spectral gaps.
