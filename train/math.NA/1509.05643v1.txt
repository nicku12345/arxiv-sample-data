In this paper we develop two goal-oriented adaptive strategies for a posteriori error estimation within the generalized multiscale finite element framework. In this methodology, one seeks to determine the number of multiscale basis functions adaptively for each coarse region to efficiently reduce the error in the goal functional. Our first error estimator uses a residual based strategy where local indicators on each coarse neighborhood are the product of local indicators for the primal and dual problems, respectively. In the second approach, viewed as the multiscale extension of the dual weighted residual method (DWR), the error indicators are computed as the pairing of the local H^{-1} residual of the primal problem weighed by a projection into the primal space of the H_0^1 dual solution from an enriched space, over each coarse neighborhood. In both of these strategies, the goal-oriented indicators are then used in place of a standard residual-based indicator to mark coarse neighborhoods of the mesh for further enrichment in the form of additional multiscale basis functions. The method is demonstrated on high-contrast problems with heterogeneous multiscale coefficients, and is seen to outperform the standard residual based strategy with respect to efficient reduction of error in the goal function.
