We propose a new algorithm for computing validated bounds for the solutions to the first order variational equations associated to ODEs. These validated solutions are the kernel of numerics computer-assisted proofs in dynamical systems literature. The method uses a high-order Taylor method as a predictor step and an implicit method based on the Hermite-Obreshkov interpolation as a corrector step. The proposed algorithm is an improvement of the C^1-Lohner algorithm proposed by Zgliczy\'nski and it provides sharper bounds.   As an application of the algorithm, we give a computer-assisted proof of the existence of an attractor set in the R\"ossler system, and we show that the attractor contains an invariant and uniformly hyperbolic subset on which the dynamics is chaotic, that is, conjugated to subshift of finite type with positive topological entropy.
