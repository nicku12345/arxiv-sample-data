A bilinear quadrature numerically evaluates a continuous bilinear map, such as the L^2 inner product, on continuous f and g belonging to known finite-dimensional function spaces. Such maps arise in Galerkin methods for differential and integral equations. The construction of bilinear quadratures over arbitrary domains in \mathbb{R}^d is presented. In one dimension, integration rules of this type include Gaussian quadrature for polynomials and the trapezoidal rule for trigonometric polynomials as special cases. A numerical procedure for constructing bilinear quadratures is developed and validated.
