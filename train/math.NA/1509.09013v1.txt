In this article, interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin methods using immersed finite element functions are employed to solve parabolic interface problems. Typical semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes are presented and analyzed. Optimal convergence for both semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes are proved. Some numerical experiments are provided to validate our theoretical results.
