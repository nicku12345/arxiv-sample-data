In order to inherit numerically the ergodicity of the damped stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with additive noise, we propose a fully discrete scheme, whose spatial direction is based on spectral Galerkin method and temporal direction is based on a modification of the implicit Euler scheme. We not only prove the unique ergodicity of the numerical solutions of both spatial semi-discretization and full discretization, but also present error estimations on invariant measures, which gives order 2 in spatial direction and order {\frac12} in temporal direction.
