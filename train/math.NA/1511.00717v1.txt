In the present paper we are concerned with a numerical algorithm for the approximation of the two-dimensional neural field equation with delay. We consider three numerical examples that have been analysed before by other authors and are directly connected with real world applications. The main purposes are 1) to test the performance of the mentioned algorithm, by comparing the numerical results with those obtained by other authors; 2) to analyse with more detail the properties of the solutions and take conclusions about their physical meaning.
