Optimal error estimates of stable and stabilized Lagrange-Galerkin (LG) schemes for natural convection problems are proved under a mild condition on time increment and mesh size. The schemes maintain the common advantages of the LG method, i.e., robustness for convection-dominated problems and symmetry of the coefficient matrix of the system of linear equations. We simply consider typical two sets of finite elements for the velocity, pressure and temperature, P2/P1/P2 and P1/P1/P1, which are employed by the stable and stabilized LG schemes, respectively. The stabilized LG scheme has an additional advantage, a small number of degrees of freedom especially for three-dimensional problems. The proof of the optimal error estimates is done by extending the arguments of the proofs of error estimates of stable and stabilized LG schemes for the Navier-Stokes equations in previous literature.
