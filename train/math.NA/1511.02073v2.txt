In this paper we introduce a new hierarchical model reduction framework for the Fokker-Planck equation. We reduce the dimension of the equation by a truncated basis expansion in the velocity variable, obtaining a hyperbolic system of equations in space and time. Unlike former methods like the Legendre moment models, the new framework generates a suitable problem-dependent basis of the reduced velocity space that mimics the shape of the solution in the velocity variable. To that end, we adapt the framework of [M. Ohlberger and K. Smetana. A dimensional reduction approach based on the application of reduced basis methods in the framework of hierarchical model reduction. SIAM J. Sci.

Then, we apply ideas of the Reduced Basis method to develop a greedy-algorithm that selects the basis from solutions of the parametrized PDE. Numerical experiments demonstrate the potential of this new method.
