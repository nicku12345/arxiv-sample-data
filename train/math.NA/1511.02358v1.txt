In the present paper a numerical method is developed to approximate the solution of two-dimensional NLS equation in the presence of a singular potential. The method leads to Lyapunov-Syslvester algebraic operators that are shown to be invertible using original topological and differential calculus issued methods. The numerical scheme is proved to be consistent, convergent and stable using the based on Lyapunov criterion, lax equivalence theorem and the properties of the Lyapunov-Syslvester operators.
