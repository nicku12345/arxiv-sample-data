A numerical method is developed leading to algebraic systems based on generalized Lyapunov-Sylvester operators to approximate the solution of two-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. It consists of an order reduction method and a finite difference discretization which is proved to be uniquely solvable, stable and convergent by using Lyapunov criterion and manipulating generalized Lyapunov-Sylvester operators. Some numerical implementations are provided at the end to validate the theoretical results.
