The aim of this paper is to introduce a new incremental procedure that can be used for numerical evaluation of the limit load. Existing incremental type methods are based on parametrization of the energy by the loading parameter \zeta\in[0,\zeta_{lim}), where \zeta_{lim} is generally unknown. In the new method, the incremental procedure is operated in terms of an inverse mapping and the respective parameter \alpha is changing in the interval (0,+\infty). Theoretically, in each step of this algorithm, we obtain a guaranteed lower bound of \zeta_{lim}. Reduction of the problem to a finite element subspace associated with a mesh \mathcal T_h generates computable bound \zeta_{lim,h}. Under certain assumptions, we prove that \zeta_{lim,h} tends to \zeta_{lim} as h\rightarrow0_+. Numerical tests confirm practical efficiency of the suggested method.
