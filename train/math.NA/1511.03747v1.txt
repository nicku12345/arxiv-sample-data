We consider a stabilized finite element method for the Darcy problem on a surface based on the Masud-Hughes formulation. A special feature of the method is that the tangential condition of the velocity field is weakly enforced through the bilinear form and that standard parametric continuous polynomial spaces on triangulations can be used. We prove optimal order a priori estimates that take the approximation of the geometry and the solution into account.
