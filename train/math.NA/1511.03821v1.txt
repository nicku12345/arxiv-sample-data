In this paper, we establish a general semilocal convergence theorem (with computationally verifiable initial conditions and error estimates) for iterative methods for simultaneous approximation of polynomial zeros. As application of this theorem, we provide new semilocal convergence results for Ehrlich's and Dochev-Byrnev's root-finding methods. These results improve the results of Petkovi\'c, Herceg and Ili\'c [Numer. Algorithms 17 (1998) 313--331] and Proinov [C.~R. Acad. Bulg. Sci. 59 (2006) 705--712]. We also prove that Dochev-Byrnev's method (1964) is identical to Pre{\v s}i\'c-Tanabe's method (1972).
