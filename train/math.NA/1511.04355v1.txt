The frequency-domain approach (FDA) to transient analysis of the boundary element method, although is appealing for engineering applications, is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel adaptive frequency sampling (AFS) algorithm to reduce the computational time of the FDA by effectively reducing the number Nc of sampling frequencies. The AFS starts with a few initial frequencies and automatically determines the subsequent sampling frequencies. It can reduce Nc by more than 2 times while still preserving good accuracy. In a porous solid model with around 0.3 million unknowns, 4 times reduction of Nc and the total computational time is successfully achieved.
