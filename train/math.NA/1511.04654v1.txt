In this work, we propose a method combining the Sinc collocation method with the double exponential transformation for computing the eigenvalues of the anharmonic Coulombic potential. We introduce a scaling factor that improves the convergence speed and the stability of the method. Further, we apply this method to Coulombic potentials leading to a highly efficient and accurate computation of the eigenvalues.
