We provide lower bounds for the norms of embeddings between \boldsymbol{\gamma}-weighted Anchored and ANOVA spaces of s-variate functions with mixed partial derivatives of order one bounded in L_p norm (p\in[1,\infty]). In particular we show that the norms behave polynomially in s for Finite Order Weights and Finite Diameter Weights if p>1, and increase faster than any polynomial in s for Product Order-Dependent Weights and any p.
