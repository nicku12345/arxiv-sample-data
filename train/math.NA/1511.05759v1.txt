This article proposes modifications to standard low order finite element approximations of the Stokes system with the goal of improving both the approximation quality and the parallel algebraic solution process. Different from standard finite element techniques, we do not modify or enrich the approximation spaces but modify the operator itself to ensure fundamental physical properties such as mass and energy conservation. Special local a~priori correction techniques at re-entrant corners lead to an improved representation of the energy in the discrete system and can suppress the global pollution effect. Local mass conservation can be achieved by an a~posteriori correction to the finite element flux. This avoids artifacts in coupled multi-physics transport problems. Finally, hardware failures in large supercomputers may lead to a loss of data in solution subdomains. Within parallel multigrid, this can be compensated by the accelerated solution of local subproblems. These resilient algorithms will gain importance on future extreme scale computing systems.
