Abstract continued Thiele type fraction has been constructed, which is an interpolation one for nonlinear operator acting from linear topological space X to algebra Y with a unit. In particular cases it changes into both a classic Thiele faction and a matrix-valued Thiele-type fraction from multiple variables.
