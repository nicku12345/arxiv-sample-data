The dual-primal isogeometric tearing and interconnecting (IETI-DP) method is the adaption of the dual-primal finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI-DP) method to isogeometric analysis of scalar elliptic boundary value problems like, e.g., diffusion problems with heterogeneous diffusion coefficients. The purpose of this paper is to extent the already existing results on condition number estimates to multi-patch domains, which consist of different geometrical mappings for each patch. Another purpose is to prove a polylogarithmic condition number bound for the preconditioned system with stiffness scaling in case of C^0 smoothness across patch interfaces. Numerical experiments validate the presented theory.
