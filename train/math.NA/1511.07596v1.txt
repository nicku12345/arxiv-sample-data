We compare two high order finite-difference methods that solve the elastic wave equation in two dimensional domains with curved boundaries and material discontinuities. Two numerical experiments are designed with focus on wave boundary interaction, the response of a pressure wave impinging on a circular cavity and the wave field generated by an explosive impact on the wall an underground tunnel. Qualitative comparisons of the results are made where similarities and differences are pointed out.
