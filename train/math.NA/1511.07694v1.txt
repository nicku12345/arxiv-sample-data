We focus on inverse preconditioners based on minimizing F(X) = 1-\cos(XA,I), where XA is the preconditioned matrix   and A is symmetric and positive definite. We present and analyze gradient-type methods to minimize F(X)   on a suitable compact set. For that we use the geometrical properties of the non-polyhedral   cone of symmetric and positive definite matrices, and also the special properties of F(X) on the feasible set.   Preliminary and encouraging numerical results are also presented   in which dense and sparse approximations are included.
