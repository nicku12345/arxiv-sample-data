Two simple predicates are adopted and certain real-valued piecewise continuous functions are constructed from them. This type of maps will be called quasi-step maps and aim to separate the fixed points of an iteration map in an interval. The main properties of these maps are studied. Several worked examples are given where appropriate quasi-step maps for Newton and Halley iteration maps illustrate the main features of quasi-step maps as tools for global separation of roots.
