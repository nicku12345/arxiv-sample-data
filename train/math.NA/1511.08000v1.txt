In this paper, we present a new pseudo-spectral method to solve the initial value problem associated to a non-local KdV-Burgers equation involving a Caputo-type fractional derivative. The basic idea is, using an algebraic map, to transform the whole real line into a bounded interval where we can apply a Fourier expansion. Special attention is given to the correct computation of the fractional derivative in this setting.
