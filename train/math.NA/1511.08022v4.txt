This work studies the usage of well-known smoothed total variation regularization for solving an atmospheric tomography problem named as {\em GPS-tomography} in some quasi-Newton methods. That is we solve an unconstrained, convex, smooth minimization problem associated with a general type Tikhonov functional containing smoothed type total variation penalty term by quasi-Newton methods. As a result of the conducted experiments, it is concluded that limited memory BFGS algorithm with trust region is the effective algorithm in terms obtaining a reasonably optimum solution.
