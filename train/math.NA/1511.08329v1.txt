We design and analyze multigrid methods for the saddle point problems resulting from Raviart-Thomas-N\'ed\'elec mixed finite element methods (of order at least 1) for the Darcy system in porous media flow. Uniform convergence of the W-cycle algorithm in a nonstandard energy norm is established. Extensions to general second order elliptic problems are also addressed.
