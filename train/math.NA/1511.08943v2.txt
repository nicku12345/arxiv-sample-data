Approximation theory for Lyapunov and Sacker-Sell spectra based upon QR techniques is used to analyze the stability of a one-step method solving a time-dependent, linear, ordinary differential equation (ODE) initial value problem in terms of the local error. Integral separation is used to characterize the conditioning of stability spectra calculations. In an approximate sense the stability of the numerical solution by a one-step method of a time-dependent linear ODE using real-valued, scalar, time-dependent, linear test equations is justified. This analysis is used to approximate exponential growth/decay rates on finite and infinite time intervals and establish global error bounds for one-step methods approximating uniformly stable trajectories of nonautonomous and nonlinear ODEs. A time-dependent stiffness indicator and a one-step method that switches between explicit and implicit Runge-Kutta methods based upon time-dependent stiffness are developed based upon the theoretical results.
