The purpose of this work is to study a finite element method for finding solutions to the eigenvalue problem for the fractional Laplacian. We prove that the discrete eigenvalue problem converges to the continuous one and we show the order of such convergence. Finally, we perform some numerical experiments and compare our results with previous work by other authors.
