We proved direct and inverse theorems on B-spline quasi-interpolation sampling representation with a Littlewood-Paley-type norm equivalence in Sobolev spaces W^r_p of mixed smoothness r, established estimates of the approximation error of recovery in L_q-norm of functions from the unit ball U^r_p in the spaces W^r_p by linear sampling algorithms based on this representation, the asymptotic optimality of these sampling algorithms in terms of Smolyak sampling width r^s_n(U^r_p, L_q) and sampling width r_n(U^r_p, L_q).
