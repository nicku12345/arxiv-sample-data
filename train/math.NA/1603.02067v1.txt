An algorithm for the numerical solution of a nonlinear integro-differential equation arising in the single-species annihilation reaction A + A \rightarrow\varnothing modeling is discussed. Finite difference method together with the linear approximation of the unknown function is considered. For divergent integrals presented in the equation for dimension d=2 a regularization is used. Some numerical results are presented.
