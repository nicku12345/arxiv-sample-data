The Helmholtz transmission eigenvalue problem has received much concern in materials science, so it's significant to explore the efficient calculational method of the problem to mathematics and mechanics community. In this paper, based on a variational formulation proposed by Cakon, Monk and Sun, we introduce a mixed-element two-grid discretization and prove error estimates for this method theoretically. Some numerical results are presented to confirm the theoretical analysis and show that the method here is efficient.
