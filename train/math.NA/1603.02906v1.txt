We present a Ritz-Galerkin discretization on sparse grids using pre-wavelets, which allows to solve elliptic differential equations with variable coefficients for dimension d=2,3 and higher dimensions d>3. The method applies multilinear finite elements. We introduce an efficient algorithm for matrix vector multiplication using a Ritz-Galerkin discretization and semi-orthogonality.   This algorithm is based on standard 1-dimensional restrictions and prolongations, a simple pre-wavelet stencil, and the classical operator dependent stencil for multilinear finite elements. Numerical simulation results are presented for a 3-dimensional problem on a curvilinear bounded domain and for a 6-dimensional problem with variable coefficients.   Simulation results show a convergence of the discretization according to the approximation properties of the finite element space. The condition number of the stiffness matrix can be bounded below 10 using a standard diagonal preconditioner.
