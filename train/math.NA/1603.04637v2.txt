We are concerned with the numerical integration of functions from the Sobolev space H^{r,\text{mix}}([0,1]^d) of dominating mixed smoothness r\in\mathbb{N} over the d-dimensional unit cube.   In 1976, K. K. Frolov introduced a deterministic quadrature rule whose worst case error has the order n^{-r} \, (\log n)^{(d-1)/2} with respect to the number n of function evaluations. This is known to be optimal. 39 years later, Erich Novak and me introduced a randomized version of this algorithm using d random dilations. We showed that its error is bounded above by a constant multiple of n^{-r-1/2} \, (\log n)^{(d-1)/2} in expectation and by n^{-r} \, (\log n)^{(d-1)/2} almost surely. The main term n^{-r-1/2} is again optimal and it turns out that the very same algorithm is also optimal for the isotropic Sobolev space H^s([0,1]^d) of smoothness s>d/2. We also added a random shift to this algorithm to make it unbiased. Just recently, Mario Ullrich proved that the expected error of the resulting algorithm on H^{r,\text{mix}}([0,1]^d) is even bounded above by n^{-r-1/2}. This thesis is a review of the mentioned upper bounds and their proofs.
