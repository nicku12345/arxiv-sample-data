We consider singularly perturbed boundary value problems with a simple interior turning point whose solutions exhibit an interior layer. These problems are discretised using higher order finite elements on layer-adapted graded meshes proposed by Liseikin. We prove \epsilon-uniform error estimates in the energy norm. Furthermore, for linear elements we are able to prove optimal order \epsilon-uniform convergence in the L^2-norm on these graded meshes.
