In this paper we consider the L_q-approximation of multivariate periodic functions f with L_p-bounded mixed derivative (difference). The (possibly non-linear) reconstruction algorithm is supposed to recover the function from function values, sampled on a discrete set of n sampling nodes. The general performance is measured in terms of (non-)linear sampling widths \varrho_n. We conduct a systematic analysis of Smolyak type interpolation algorithms in the framework of Besov-Lizorkin-Triebel spaces of dominating mixed smoothness based on specifically tailored discrete Littlewood-Paley type characterizations. As a consequence, we provide sharp upper bounds for the asymptotic order of the (non-)linear sampling widths in various situations and close some gaps in the existing literature. For example, in case 2\leq p<q<\infty and r>1/p the linear sampling widths \varrho_n^{\text{lin}}(S^r_pW(\mathbb{T}^d),L_q(\mathbb{T}^d)) and \varrho^{\text{lin}}_n(S^r_{p,\infty}B(\mathbb{T}^d),L_q(\mathbb{T}^d)) show the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding Gelfand n-widths, whereas in case 1 < p < q \leq 2 and r>1/p the linear sampling widths match the corresponding linear widths. In the mentioned cases linear Smolyak interpolation based on univariate classical trigonometric interpolation turns out to be optimal.
