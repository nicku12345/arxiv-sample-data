We present explicit algorithms for computing structured matrix-vector products that are optimal in the sense of Strassen, i.e., using a provably minimum number of multiplications. These structures include Toeplitz/Hankel/circulant, symmetric, Toeplitz-plus-Hankel, sparse, and multilevel structures. The last category include \textsc{bttb}, \textsc{bhhb}, \textsc{bccb} but also any arbitrarily complicated nested structures built out of other structures.
