Let \Omega\in\mathbb{R}^n be the region occupied by a body and let \mathbf{x}_0 be a flaw point in \Omega. Let E(\cdot) be an energy functional (defined on some appropriate admissible set of deformations of \Omega). For V>0 fixed, we let \mathbf{u}_V be a minimizer of E(\cdot) among the set of deformations constrained to form a hole of volume V at \mathbf{x}_0. In this paper we describe a regularized penalty--multiplier method and its convergence properties for the computation of both \mathbf{u}_V and E(\mathbf{u}_V). In particular, we show that as the regularization parameter goes to zero, the regularized constrained minimizers converge weakly in W^{1,p}(\Omega\setminus\overline{\mathcal{B}_{\delta}(\mathbf{x}_0)}) to \mathbf{u}_{V} for any \delta>0. We describe as well the main features of a numerical scheme for approximating \mathbf{u}_V and E(\mathbf{u}_V) and give a numerical example for the case of a stored energy for an elastic fluid.
