In this paper, we present new a posteriori and a priori error bounds for the Krylov subspace methods for computing e^{-\tau A}v for a given \tau>0 and v \in C^n, where A is a large sparse non-Hermitian matrix. The {\em a priori} error bounds relate the convergence to \lambda_{\min}\left(\frac{A+A^*}{2}\right), \lambda_{\max}\left(\frac{A+A^*}{2}\right) (the smallest and the largest eigenvalue of the Hermitian part of A) and |\lambda_{\max}\left(\frac{A-A^*}{2}\right)| (the largest eigenvalue in absolute value of the skew-Hermitian part of A), which define a rectangular region enclosing the field of values of A. In particular, our bounds explain an observed superlinear convergence behavior where the error may first stagnate for certain iterations before it starts to converge. The special case that A is skew-Hermitian is also considered. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the theoretical bounds.
