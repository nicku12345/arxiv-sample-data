We present the Finite Element Method (FEM) for the numerical solution of the multidimensional coefficient inverse problem (MCIP) in two dimensions. This method is used for explicit reconstruction of the coefficient in the hyperbolic equation using data resulted from a single measurement. To solve our MCIP we use approximate globally convergent method and then apply FEM for the resulted equation. Our numerical examples show quantitative reconstruction of the sound speed in small tumor-like inclusions.
