Periodic surface structures are nowadays standard building blocks of optical devices. If such structures are illuminated by aperiodic time-harmonic incident waves as, e.g., Gaussian beams, the resulting surface scattering problem must be formulated in an unbounded layer including the periodic surface structure. An obvious recipe to avoid the need to discretize this problem in an unbounded domain is to set up an equivalent system of quasiperiodic scattering problems in a single (bounded) periodicity cell via the Floquet-Bloch transform. The solution to the original surface scattering problem then equals the inverse Floquet-Bloch transform applied to the family of solutions to the quasiperiodic problems, which simply requires to integrate these solutions in the quasiperiodicity parameter. A numerical scheme derived from this representation hence completely avoids the need to tackle differential equations on unbounded domains. In this paper, we provide rigorous convergence analysis and error bounds for such a scheme when applied to a two-dimensional model problem, relying upon a quadrature-based approximation to the inverse Floquet-Bloch transform and finite element approximations to quasiperiodic scattering problems. Our analysis essentially relies upon regularity results for the family of solutions to the quasiperiodic scattering problems in suitable mixed Sobolev spaces. We illustrate our error bounds as well as efficiency of the numerical scheme via several numerical examples.
