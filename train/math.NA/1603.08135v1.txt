Current wind turbine simulations successfully use turbulence generating tools for modeling behavior. However, they lack the ability to reproduce variabilities in wind dynamics and inherent stochastic structures (like temporal and spatial coherences, sporadic bursts, high shear regions). This necessitates a more realistic parameterization of the wind that encodes location-, topography-, diurnal-, seasonal and stochastic affects. In this work, we develop a hierarchical temporal and spatial decomposition (TSD) of large-scale meteorology data to construct a low-dimensional yet realistic stochastic wind flow model. Starting from a large data set (Crop Wind-energy EXperiment), a low dimensional stochastic parameterization is constructed. The resulting time-resolved stochastic model encodes the statistical behavior exhibited by the actual wind flow. Moreover, the temporal modes encode the variation of wind speed in the mean sense and resolve diurnal variations and temporal correlation while the spatial modes provide deeper insight into spatial coherence of the wind field - which is a key aspect in current wind turbine sizing, design and classification. Comparison of several important turbulent properties between the simulated wind flow and the original dataset show the utility of the framework. We envision this framework as a useful complement to existing wind simulation codes.
