In this paper, the normwise condition number of a linear function of the equality constrained linear least squares solution called the partial condition number is considered. Its expression and closed formulae are first presented when the data space and the solution space are measured by the weighted Frobenius norm and the Euclidean norm, respectively. Then, we investigate the corresponding structured partial condition number when the problem is structured. To estimate these condition numbers with high reliability, the probabilistic spectral norm estimator and the small-sample statistical condition estimation method are applied and two algorithms are devised. The obtained results are illustrated by numerical examples.
