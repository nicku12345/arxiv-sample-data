This paper develops and analyzes an efficient numerical method for solving elliptic partial differential equations, where the diffusion coefficients are random perturbations of deterministic diffusion coefficients. The method is based upon a multi-modes representation of the solution as a power series of the perturbation parameter, and the Monte Carlo technique for sampling the probability space. One key feature of the proposed method is that the governing equations for all the expanded mode functions share the same deterministic diffusion coefficients, thus an efficient direct solver by repeated use of the LU decomposition matrices can be employed for solving the finite element discretized linear systems. It is shown that the computational complexity of the whole algorithm is comparable to that of solving a few deterministic elliptic partial differential equations using the LU director solver. Error estimates are derived for the method, and numerical experiments are provided to test the efficiency of the algorithm and validate the theoretical results.
