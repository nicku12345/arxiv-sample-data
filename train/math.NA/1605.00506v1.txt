In this paper we consider the problem of working with rational functions in a numeric environment. A particular problem when modeling with such functions is the existence of Froissart doublets, where a zero is close to a pole. We discuss three different parameters which allow one to monitor the absence of Froissart doublets for a given general rational function. These include the euclidean condition number of an underlying Sylvester-type matrix, a parameter for determing coprimeness of two numerical polynomials and bounds on the spherical derivative. We show that our parameters sharpen those found in a previous paper by two of the autours.
