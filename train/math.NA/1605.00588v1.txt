The Herman--Kluk propagator is a popular semi-classical approximation of the unitary evolution operator in quantum molecular dynamics. In this paper we formulate the Herman--Kluk propagator as a phase space integral and discretise it by Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature. Then, we investigate the accuracy of a symplectic time discretisation by combining backward error analysis with Fourier integral operator calculus. Numerical experiments for two- and six-dimensional model systems support our theoretical results.
