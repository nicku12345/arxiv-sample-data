We derive a priori residual-type bounds for the Arnoldi approximation of a matrix function and a strategy for setting the iteration accuracies in the inexact Arnoldi approximation of matrix functions. Such results are based on the decay behavior of the entries of functions of banded matrices. Specifically, we will use a priori decay bounds for the entries of functions of banded non-Hermitian matrices by using Faber polynomial series. Numerical experiments illustrate the quality of the results.
