We compare two approaches to the predictive modeling of dynamical systems from partial observations at discrete times. The first is continuous in time, where one uses data to infer a model in the form of stochastic differential equations, which are then discretized for numerical solution. The second is discrete in time, where one directly infers a discrete-time model in the form of a nonlinear autoregression moving average model. The comparison is performed in a special case where the observations are known to have been obtained from a hypoelliptic stochastic differential equation. We show that the discrete-time approach has better predictive skills, especially when the data are relatively sparse in time. We discuss open questions as well as the broader significance of the results.
