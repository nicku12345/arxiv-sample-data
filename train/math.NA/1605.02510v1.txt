We construct several sequences of asymptotically optimal definite quadrature formulae of fourth order and evaluate their error constants. Besides the asymptotical optimality, an advantage of our quadrature formulae is the explicit form of their weights and nodes. For the remainders of our quadrature formulae monotonicity properties are established when the integrand is a 4-convex function, and a-posteriori error estimates are proven.
