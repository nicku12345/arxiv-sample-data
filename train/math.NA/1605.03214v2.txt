This paper is concerned with the accurate, conservative, and stable imposition of boundary conditions and inter-element coupling for multi-dimensional summation-by-parts (SBP) finite-difference operators. More precisely, the focus is on diagonal-norm SBP operators that are not based on tensor products and are applicable to unstructured grids composed of arbitrary elements. We show how penalty terms --- simultaneous approximation terms (SATs) --- can be adapted to discretizations based on multi-dimensional SBP operators to enforce boundary and interface conditions. A general SAT framework is presented that leads to conservative and stable discretizations of the variable-coefficient advection equation. This framework includes the case where there are no nodes on the boundary of the SBP element at which to apply penalties directly. This is an important generalization, because elements analogous to Legendre-Gauss collocation, \ie without boundary nodes, typically have higher accuracy for the same number of degrees of freedom. Symmetric and upwind examples of the general SAT framework are created using a decomposition of the symmetric part of an SBP operator; these particular SATs enable the pointwise imposition of boundary and inter-element conditions. We illustrate the proposed SATs using triangular-element SBP operators with and without nodes that lie on the boundary. The accuracy, conservation, and stability properties of the resulting SBP-SAT discretizations are verified using linear advection problems with spatially varying divergence-free velocity fields.
