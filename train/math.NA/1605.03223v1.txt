In this paper we introduce the Diagonal Dominant Pole Spectrum Eigensolver (DDPSE), which is a fixed-point method that computes several eigenvalues of a matrix at a time. DDPSE is a slight modification of the Dominant Pole Spectrum Eigensolver (DPSE), that has being used in power system stability studies. We show that both methods have local quadratic convergence. Moreover, we present practical results obtained by both methods, from which we can see that those methods really compute dominant poles of a transfer function of the type c^T(A-sI)^{-1}b, where b and c are vectors, besides being also effective in finding low damped modes of a large scale power system.
