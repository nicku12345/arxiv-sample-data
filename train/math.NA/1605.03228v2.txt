We present a scalable iterative solver for high-order hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) discretizations of linear partial differential equations. It is an interplay between domain decomposition methods and HDG discretizations, and hence inheriting advances from both sides. In particular, the method can be viewed as a Gauss-Seidel approach that requires only independent element-by-element and face-by-face local solves in each iteration. As such, it is well-suited for current and future computing systems with massive concurrencies. Unlike conventional Gauss-Seidel schemes which are purely algebraic, the convergence of iHDG, thanks to the built-in HDG numerical flux, does not depend on the ordering of unknowns. We rigorously show the convergence of the proposed method for the transport equation, the linearized shallow water equation and the convection-diffusion equation. For the transport equation, the method is convergent regardless of mesh size h and solution order p, and furthermore the convergence rate is independent of the solution order. For the linearized shallow water and the convection-diffusion equations we show that the convergence is conditional on both h and p. Extensive steady and time-dependent numerical results for the 2D and 3D transport equations, the linearized shallow water equation, and the convection-diffusion equation are presented to verify the theoretical findings.
