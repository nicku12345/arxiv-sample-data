We consider structure-preserving methods for conservative systems, which rigorously replicate the conservation property yielding better numerical solutions. There, corresponding to the skew-symmetry of the differential operator, that of difference operators is essential to the discrete conservation law. Unfortunately, however, when we employ the standard central difference operator, the simplest one, the numerical solutions often suffer from undesirable spatial oscillations. In this letter, we propose a novel "average-difference method," which is tougher against such oscillations, and combine it with an existing conservative method. Theoretical and numerical analysis in the linear case show the superiority of the proposed method.
