In this paper, we consider the Euler method for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations. First, we approximate the original equation by a family of backward stochastic equations (BSDEs, for short).   Then we solve the BSDEs by the Euler method. Finally, by virtue of the numerical solutions to BSDEs, we get the numerical solution to original equation and obtain the global 1/2 order convergence speed in L^2 norm.
