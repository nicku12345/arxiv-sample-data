In this paper a mixed spectral element formulation is presented for planar, linear elasticity. The degrees of freedom for the stress are integrated traction components, i.e. surface force components. As a result the tractions between elements are continuous. The formulation is based on minimization of the complementary energy subject to the constraints that the stress field should satisfy equilibrium of forces and moments. The Lagrange multiplier which enforces equilibrium of forces is the displacement field and the Lagrange multiplier which enforces equilibrium of moments is the rotation. The formulation satisfies equilibrium of forces pointwise if the body forces are piecewise polynomial. Equilibrium of moments is weakly satisfied. Results of the method are given on orthogonal and curvilinear domains and an example with a point singularity is given.
