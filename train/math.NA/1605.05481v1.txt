Recently, nonlocal models attract the wide interests of scientist. They mainly come from two applied scientific fields: peridyanmics and anomalous diffusion. Even though the matrices of the algebraic equation corresponding the nonlocal models are usually Toeplitz (denote a0 as the principal diagonal element, a1 as the trailing diagonal element, etc). There are still some differences for the models in these two fields. For the model of anomalous diffusion, a0/a1 is uniformly bounded; most of the time, a0/a1 of the model for peridyanmics is unbounded as the stepsize h tends to zero. Based on the uniform boundedness of a0/a1, the convergence of the two-grid method is well established [Chan, Chang, and Sun, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 19 (1998), pp. 516--529; Pang and Sun, J. Comput. Phys., 231 (2012), pp. 693--703; Chen, Wang, Cheng, and Deng, BIT, 54 (2014), pp. 623--647]. This paper provides the detailed proof of the convergence of the two-grid method for the nonlocal model of peridynamics. Some special cases of the full multigrid and the V-cycle multigrid are also discussed. The numerical experiments are performed to verify the convergence.
