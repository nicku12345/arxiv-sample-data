This paper proposes a new numerical method based on the Chebyshev wavelets (CWs) to solve the variable-order time fractional mobile-immobile advection-dispersion equation. To do this, a new operational matrix of variable-order fractional derivative in the Caputo sense for the CWs is derived and is used to obtain an approximate solution for the problem under study. Along the way a new family of piecewise functions is introduced and employed to derive a general method to compute this matrix. The main advantage behind the proposed approach is that the problem under consideration is transformed into a linear system of algebraic equations. So, it can be solved simply to obtain an approximate solution. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are shown for some concrete examples. These results show that the proposed method is very efficient and accurate.
