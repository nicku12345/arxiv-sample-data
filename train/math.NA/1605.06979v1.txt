We consider linear dynamical systems of ordinary differential equations or differential algebraic equations. Physical parameters are substituted by random variables for an uncertainty quantification. We expand the state variables as well as a quantity of interest into an orthogonal system of basis functions, which depend on the random variables. For example, polynomial chaos expansions are applicable. The stochastic Galerkin method yields a larger linear dynamical system, whose solution approximates the unknown coefficients in the expansions. The Hardy norms of the transfer function provide information about the input-output behaviour of the Galerkin system. We investigate two approaches to construct a sparse representation of the quantity of interest, where just a low number of coefficients is non-zero. Firstly, a standard basis is reduced by the omission of basis functions, whose accompanying Hardy norms are relatively small. Secondly, a projection-based model order reduction is applied to the Galerkin system and allows for the definition of new basis functions as a sparse representation. In both cases, we prove error bounds on the sparse approximation with respect to Hardy norms. Numerical experiments are demonstrated for a test example modelling a linear electric circuit.
