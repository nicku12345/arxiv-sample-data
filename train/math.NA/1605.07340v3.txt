We propose a numerical scheme to solve the time dependent linear Schr\"odinger equation. The discretization is carried out by combining a Runge-Kutta time-stepping scheme with a finite element discretization in space. Since the Schr\"odinger equation is posed on the whole space \R^d we combine the interior finite element discretization with a convolution quadrature based boundary element discretization. In this paper we analyze the resulting fully discrete scheme in terms of stability and convergence rate. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings.
