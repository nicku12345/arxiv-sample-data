Let F be a compact set of a Banach space \mathcal{X}. This paper analyses the "Generalized Empirical Interpolation Method" (GEIM) which, given a function f\in F, builds an interpolant \mathcal{J}_n[f] in an n-dimensional subspace X_n \subset \mathcal{X} with the knowledge of n outputs (\sigma_i(f))_{i=1}^n, where \sigma_i\in \mathcal{X}' and \mathcal{X}' is the dual space of \mathcal{X}. The space X_n is built with a greedy algorithm that is adapted to F in the sense that it is generated by elements of F itself. The algorithm also selects the linear functionals (\sigma_i)_{i=1}^n from a dictionary \Sigma\subset \mathcal{X}'. In this paper, we study the interpolation error \max_{f\in F} \Vert f-\mathcal{J}_n[f]\Vert_{\mathcal{X}} by comparing it with the best possible performance on an n-dimensional space, i.e., the Kolmogorov n-width of F in \mathcal{X}, d_n(F,\mathcal{X}). For polynomial or exponential decay rates of d_n(F,\mathcal{X}), we prove that the interpolation error has the same behavior modulo the norm of the interpolation operator. Sharper results are obtained in the case where \mathcal X is a Hilbert space.
