Numerical solution of nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NEPs) is frequently encountered in computational science and engineering. The applicability of most existing methods is limited by matrix structures, property of eigen-solutions, size of the problem, etc. This paper aims to break those limitations and to develop robust and universal NEP solvers for large-scale engineering applications. The novelty lies in two aspects. First, a rational interpolation approach (RIA) is proposed based on the Keldysh theorem for holomorphic matrix functions. Comparing with the existing contour integral approach (CIA), the RIA provides the possibility to select sampling points in more general regions and has advantages in improving accuracy and reducing computational cost. Second, a resolvent sampling scheme using the RIA is proposed for constructing reliable search spaces for the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, based on which a robust eigen-solver, denoted by RSRR, is developed for solving general NEPs. RSRR can be easily implemented and parallelized. The advantages of the RIA and the performance of RSRR are demonstrated by a variety of benchmark and practical problems.
