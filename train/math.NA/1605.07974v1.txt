A ridge function is a function of several variables that is constant along certain directions in its domain. Using classical dimensional analysis, we show that many physical laws are ridge functions; this fact yields insight into the structure of physical laws and motivates further study into ridge functions and their properties. We also connect dimensional analysis to modern subspace-based techniques for dimension reduction, including active subspaces in deterministic approximation and sufficient dimension reduction in statistical regression.
