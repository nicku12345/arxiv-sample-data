A novel approach for selecting appropriate reconstructions is implemented to the hyperbolic conservation laws in the high-order local polynomial-based framework, e.g., the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and flux reconstruction (FR) schemes. The high-order polynomial approximation generally fails to correctly capture a strong discontinuity inside a cell due to the Runge phenomenon, which is replaced by more stable approximation on the basis of a troubled-cell indicator such as that used in the total variation bounded (TVB) limiter. This paper examines the applicability of a new algorithm, so-called boundary variation diminishing (BVD) reconstruction, to the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methodology in the FR framework including the nodal type DG method. The BVD reconstruction adaptively chooses a proper approximation for the solution function so as to minimize the jump between values at the left- and right-side of cell boundaries without any ad hoc constant such as the TVB parameter. Several numerical tests are conducted for a linear advection equation as well as the selection of an appropriate reconstruction, where the results of the BVD algorithm are comparable to those using the conventional TVB limiter. Note that the present work is limited to third or lower order polynomials, leaving the implementations for higher-order schemes a future work.
