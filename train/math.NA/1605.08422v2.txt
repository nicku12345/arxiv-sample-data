We propose a new algorithm for calculation of vibrational spectra of molecules using tensor train decomposition. Under the assumption that eigenfunctions lie on a low-parametric manifold of low-rank tensors we suggest using well-known iterative methods that utilize matrix inversion (LOBPCG, inverse iteration) and solve corresponding linear systems inexactly along this manifold. As an application, we accurately compute vibrational spectra (84 states) of acetonitrile molecule CH_3CN on a laptop in one hour using only 100 MB of memory to represent all computed eigenfunctions.
