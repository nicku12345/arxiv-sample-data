In this paper, we consider the Clenshaw-Curtis-Filon method for the highly oscillatory Bessel transform \int_0^1x^\alpha (1-x)^\beta f(x) J_{\nu}(\omega x)dx, where f is a smooth function on [0, 1], and \nu\geq0. The method is based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and fast computation of the modified moments. We give a recurrence relation for the modified moments and present an efficient method for the evaluation of modified moments by using recurrence relation. Moreover, the corresponding error bound in inverse powers of N for this method for the integral is presented. Numerical examples are provided to support our analysis and show the efficiency and accuracy of the method.
