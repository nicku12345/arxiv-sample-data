An exact conservative remapping scheme requires overlaps between two meshes and a reconstruction scheme on the old cells (Lagrangian mesh). While the are intensive discussion on reconstruction schemes, there are relative sparse discussion on how to calculate overlaps of two grids. Computing the exact overlaps was believed complicated and often be avoided. This paper introduces the mathematical formulation of such a problem and tools to solve the problem. We propose methods to calculate the overlaps of two dismissable general quadrilateral mesh of the same logically structure in a planar domain. The quadrilateral polygon intersection problem is reduced to as a problem that how an edge in a new mesh intersects with a local frame which consists at most 7 connected edges in the old mesh. As such, locality of the method is persevered. The alternative direction technique is applied to reduce the dimension of the searching space. It reduces more than 256 possible intersections between a new cell with the old tessellation to 34 (17 when considering symmetry) programmable intersections between an edge and an local frame whenever the intersection between the old and new cell does not degenerate. At the same time, we shall how the computational amount of the overlaps depends on the underlying problem in terms of singular intersection points. A simple and detailed classification on the type of overlaps is presented, according to classification, degeneracy of an overlap can be easily identified.
