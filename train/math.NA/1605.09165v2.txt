Numerical integration and function approximation on compact Riemannian manifolds based on eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator have been widely studied in the recent literature. The standard example in numerical experiments is the Euclidean sphere. Here, we derive numerically feasible expressions for the approximation schemes on the Grassmannian manifold, and we present the associated numerical experiments on the Grassmannian. Indeed, our experiments illustrate and match the corresponding theoretical results in the literature.
