Floating point arithmetic allows us to use a finite machine, the digital computer, to reach conclusions about models based on continuous mathematics. In this article we work in the other direction, that is, we present examples in which continuous mathematics leads to sharp, simple and new results about the evaluation of sums, square roots and dot products in floating point arithmetic.
