Given \beta>0 and \delta>0, the function t^{-\beta} may be approximated for t in a compact interval [\delta,T] by a sum of terms of the form we^{-at}, with parameters w>0 and a>0. One such an approximation, studied by Beylkin and Monz\'on, is obtained by applying the trapezoidal rule to an integral representation of t^{-\beta}, after which Prony's method is applied to reduce the number of terms in the sum with essentially no loss of accuracy. We review this method, and then describe a similar approach based on an alternative integral representation. The main difference is that the new approach achieves much better results before the application of Prony's method; after applying Prony's method the performance of both is much the same.
