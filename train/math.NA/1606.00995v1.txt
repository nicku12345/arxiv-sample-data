The correction procedure via reconstruction (CPR, also known as flux reconstruction) is a framework of high order semidiscretisations used for the numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws. Using a reformulation of these schemes relying on summation-by-parts (SBP) operators and simultaneous approximation terms (SATs), artificial dissipation / spectral viscosity operators are investigated in this first part of a series. Semidiscrete stability results for linear advection and Burgers' equation as model problems are extended to fully discrete stability by an explicit Euler method. As second part of this series, Glaubitz, Ranocha, \"Offner, and Sonar (Enhancing stability of correction procedure via reconstruction using summation-by-parts operators II: Modal filtering, 2016) investigate connections to modal filters and their application instead of artificial dissipation.
