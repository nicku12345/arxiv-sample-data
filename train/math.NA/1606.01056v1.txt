A recently introduced framework of semidiscretisations for hyperbolic conservation laws known as correction procedure via reconstruction (CPR, also known as flux reconstruction) is considered in the extended setting of summation-by-parts (SBP) operators using simultaneous approximation terms (SATs). This reformulation can yield stable semidiscretisations for linear advection and Burgers' equation as model problems. In order to enhance these properties, modal filters are introduced to this framework. As a second part of a series, the results of Ranocha, Glaubitz, \"Offner, and Sonar ("Enhancing stability of correction procedure via reconstruction using summation-by-parts operators I: Artificial dissipation", 2016) concerning artificial dissipation / spectral viscosity are extended, yielding fully discrete stable schemes. Additionally, a new adaptive strategy to compute the filter strength is introduced and different possible applications of modal filters are compared both theoretically and numerically.
