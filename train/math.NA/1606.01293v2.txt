The Fast Aerosol Spectrometer (FASP) is a device for spectral aerosol measurements. Its purpose is to safely monitor the atmosphere inside a reactor containment. First we describe the FASP and explain its basic physical laws. Then we introduce our reconstruction methods for aerosol particle size distributions designed for the FASP. We extend known existence results for constrained Tikhonov regularization by uniqueness criteria and use those to generate reasonable models for the size distributions. We apply a Bayesian model-selection framework on these pre-generated models. We compare our algorithm with classical inversion methods using simulated measurements. We then extend our reconstruction algorithm for two-component aerosols, so that we can simultaneously retrieve their particle-size distributions and unknown volume fractions of their two components. Finally we present the results of a numerical study for the extended algorithm.
