We establish optimal order a priori error estimates for implicit-explicit BDF methods for abstract semilinear parabolic equations with time-dependent operators in a complex Banach space settings, under a sharp condition on the non-self-adjointness of the linear operator. Our approach relies on the discrete maximal parabolic regularity of implicit BDF schemes for autonomous linear parabolic equations, recently established in [20], and on ideas from [7]. We illustrate the applicability of our results to four initial and boundary value problems, namely two for second order, one for fractional order, and one for fourth order, namely the Cahn-Hilliard, parabolic equations.
