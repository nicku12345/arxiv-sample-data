We consider the problem of the construction of the nanophotonic structures of arbitrary geometry with prescribed desired properties. We reformulate this problem as an optimization problem for the Tikhonov functional which is minimized on adaptively locally refined meshes. These meshes are refined only in places where the nanophotonic structure should be designed. Our special symmetric mesh refinement procedure allows the construction of different nanophotonic structures. We illustrate efficiency of our adaptive optimization algorithm on the construction of nanophotonic structure in two dimensions.
