Mixed finite element methods with flux errors in H(div)-norms and div-least-squares finite element methods require a separate marking strategy in obligatory adaptive mesh-refining. The refinement indicator \sigma^2(\mathcal T,K)=\eta^2(\mathcal T,K)+\mu^2(K) of a finite element domain K in an admissible triangulation \mathcal T consists of some residual-based error estimator \eta(\mathcal T,K) with some reduction property under local mesh-refining and some data approximation error \mu(K). Separate marking means either D\"orfler marking if \mu^2(\mathcal T) \leq \kappa \eta^2(\mathcal T) or otherwise an optimal data approximation algorithm runs with controlled accuracy as established in [Carstensen, Rabus, Math.Comp. 2011; Rabus, J.Numer.Math. 2015].   The axioms are abstract and sufficient conditions on the estimators \eta(\mathcal T,K) and data approximation errors \mu(K) for optimal asymptotic convergence rates. The enfolded set of axioms simplifies \cite{CFP14} for collective marking, treats separate marking established for the first time in an abstract framework, generalizes [Carstensen, Park, SIAM J.Numer.Anal. 2015] for least-squares schemes, and extends [Carstensen, Rabus, Math.Comp. 2011] to the mixed FEM with flux error control in H(div).
