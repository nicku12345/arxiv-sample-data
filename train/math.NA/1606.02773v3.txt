We find estimates for the error in replacing an integral \int f d\mu with respect to a fractal measure \mu with a discrete sum \sum_{x \in E} w(x) f(x) over a given sample set E with weights w. Our model is the classical Koksma-Hlawka theorem for integrals over rectangles, where the error is estimated by a product of a discrepancy that depends only on the geometry of the sample set and weights, and variance that depends only on the smoothness of f. We deal with p.c.f self-similar fractals, on which Kigami has constructed notions of energy and Laplacian. We develop generic results where we take the variance to be either the energy of f or the L^1 norm of \Delta f, and we show how to find the corresponding discrepancies for each variance. We work out the details for a number of interesting examples of sample sets for the Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket, both for the standard self-similar measure and energy measures, and for other fractals.
