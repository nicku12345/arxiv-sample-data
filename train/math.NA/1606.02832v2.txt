In this work we prove optimal W^{s,p}-approximation estimates (with p\in[1,+\infty]) for elliptic projectors on local polynomial spaces. The proof hinges on the classical Dupont--Scott approximation theory together with two novel abstract lemmas: An approximation result for bounded projectors, and an L^p-boundedness result for L^2-orthogonal projectors on polynomial subspaces. The W^{s,p}-approximation results have general applicability to (standard or polytopal) numerical methods based on local polynomial spaces. As an illustration, we use these W^{s,p}-estimates to derive novel error estimates for a Hybrid High-Order discretization of Leray--Lions elliptic problems whose weak formulation is classically set in W^{1,p}(\Omega) for some p\in(1,+\infty). This kind of problems appears, e.g., in the modelling of glacier motion, of incompressible turbulent flows, and in airfoil design. Denoting by h the meshsize, we prove that the approximation error measured in a W^{1,p}-like discrete norm scales as h^{\frac{k+1}{p-1}} when p\ge 2 and as h^{(k+1)(p-1)} when p<2.
