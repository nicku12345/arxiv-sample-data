Recently, the butterfly approximation scheme and hierarchical approximations have been proposed for the efficient computation of integral transforms with oscillatory and with asymptotically smooth kernels. Combining both approaches, we propose a certain fast Fourier-Laplace transform, which in particular allows for the fast evaluation of polynomials at nodes in the complex unit disk. All theoretical results are illustrated by numerical experiments.
