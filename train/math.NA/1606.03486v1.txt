Recovering a function from its integrals over circular cones recently gained significance because of its relevance to novel medical imaging technologies such emission tomography using Compton cameras. In this paper we investigate the case where the vertices of the cones of integration are restricted to a sphere in n-dimensional space and symmetry axes are orthogonal to the sphere. We show invertibility of the considered transform and develop an inversion method based on series expansion and reduction to a system of one-dimensional integral equations of generalized Abel type. Because the arising kernels do not satisfy standard assumptions, we also develop a uniqueness result for generalized Abel equations where the kernel has zeros on the diagonal. Finally, we demonstrate how to numerically implement our inversion method and present numerical results.
