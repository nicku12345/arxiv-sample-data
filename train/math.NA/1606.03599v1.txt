Scattering from large, open cavity structures is of importance in a variety of electromagnetic applications. In this paper, we propose a new well conditioned integral equation for scattering from general open cavities embedded in an infinite, perfectly conducting half-space. The integral representation permits the stable evaluation of both the electric and magnetic field, even in the low-frequency regime, using the continuity equation in a post-processing step. We establish existence and uniqueness results, and demonstrate the performance of the scheme in the cavity-of-revolution case. High-order accuracy is obtained using a Nystrom discretization with generalized Gaussian quadratures.
