In this article, stabilization result for the viscoelastic fluid flow problem governed by Kelvin-Voigt model, that is, convergence of the unsteady solution to a steady state solution is proved under the assumption that linearized self-adjoint steady state eigenvalue problem has a minimal positive eigenvalue. Both power and exponential convergence results are derived under various conditions on the forcing function. It is shown that results are valid uniformly in the time relaxation or some times called regularization parameter \kappa as \kappa\to 0, which in turn, establishes results for the Navier-Stokes system.
