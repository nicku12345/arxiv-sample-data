We analyze fully implicit and linearly implicit backward difference formula (BDF) methods for quasilinear parabolic equations, without making any assumptions on the growth or decay of the coefficient functions. We combine maximal parabolic regularity and energy estimates to derive optimal-order error bounds for the time-discrete approximation to the solution and its gradient in the maximum norm and energy norm.
