For a large class of fully nonlinear parabolic equations, which include gradient flows for energy functionals that depend on the solution gradient, the semidiscretization in time by implicit Runge-Kutta methods such as the Radau IIA methods of arbitrary order is studied. Error bounds are obtained in the W^{1,\infty} norm uniformly on bounded time intervals and, with an improved approximation order, in the parabolic energy norm. The proofs rely on discrete maximal parabolic regularity. This is used to obtain W^{1,\infty} estimates, which are the key to the numerical analysis of these problems.
