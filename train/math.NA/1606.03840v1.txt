This paper concerns some inverse eigenvalue problems of the quadratic \star-(anti)-palindromic system Q(\lambda)=\lambda^2 A_1^{\star}+\lambda A_0 + \epsilon A_1, where \epsilon=\pm 1, A_1, A_0 \in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}, A_0^{\star}=\epsilon A_0, A_1 is nonsingular, and the symbol \star is used as an abbreviation for transpose for real matrices and either transpose or conjugate transpose for complex matrices. By using the spectral decomposition of the quadratic \star-(anti)-palindromic system, the inverse eigenvalue problems with entire/partial eigenpairs given, and the model updating problems with no-spillover are considered. Some conditions on the solvabilities of these problems are given, and algorithms are proposed to find these solutions. These algorithms are illustrated by some numerical examples.
