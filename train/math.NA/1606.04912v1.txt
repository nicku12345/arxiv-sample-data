We study the Dirichlet boundary-value problem of steady-state two-sided variable-coefficient conservative space-fractional diffusion equations. We show that the Galerkin weak formulation, which was proved to be coercive and continuous for a constant-coefficient analogue of the problem, loses its coercivity. We characterize the solution to the variable-coefficient problem in terms of the solutions of second-order diffusion equations along with a two-sided fractional integral equation. We then derive a Petrov-Galerkin formulation for this problem and prove that the weak formulation is weakly coercive and so the problem is well posed. We then prove high-order regularity estimates of the true solution in a properly chosen norm of Riemann-Liouville derivatives.
