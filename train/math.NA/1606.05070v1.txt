In this contribution we present first results towards localized model order reduction for spatially resolved, three-dimensional lithium-ionbattery models. We introduce a localized reduced basis scheme based on non-conforming local approximation spaces stemming from a finite volume discretizationof the analytical model and localized empirical operator interpolation for the approximation of the model's nonlinearities. Numerical examples are provided indicating the feasibility of our approach.
