We derive a priori error estimates for the standard Galerkin and streamline diffusion finite element methods for the Fermi pencil-beam equation obtained from a fully three dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in space {\mathbf x}=(x,y,z) and velocity \tilde {\mathbf v}=(\mu, \eta, \xi) variables. The Fokker-Planck term appears as a Laplace-Beltrami operator in the unit sphere. The diffusion term in the Fermi equation is obtained as a projection of the FP operator onto the tangent plane to the unit sphere at the pole (1,0,0) and in the direction of  {\mathbf v}_0=(1,\eta, \xi). Hence the Fermi equation, stated in three dimensional spatial domain {\mathbf x}=(x,y,z), depends only on two velocity variables {\mathbf v}=(\eta, \xi). Since, for a certain number of cross-sections, there is a closed form analytic solution available for the Fermi equation, hence an a posteriori error estimate procedure is unnecessary and in our adaptive algorithm for local mesh refinements we employ the a priori approach. Different numerical examples, in two space dimensions are justifying the theoretical results. Implementations show significant reduction of the computational error by using our adaptive algorithm.
