We present a computational approach for solving reaction-diffusion equations on evolving surfaces which have been obtained from cell image data. It is based on finite element spaces defined on surface triangulations extracted from time series of 3D images. A model for the transport of material between the subsequent surfaces is required where we postulate a velocity in normal direction. We apply the technique to image data obtained from a spreading neutrophil cell. By simulating FRAP experiments we investigate the impact of the evolving geometry on the recovery. We find that for idealised FRAP conditions, changes in membrane geometry, easily account for differences of \times 10 in recovery half-times, which shows that experimentalists must take great care when interpreting membrane photobleaching results. We also numerically solve an activator -- depleted substrate system and report on the effect of the membrane movement on the pattern evolution.
