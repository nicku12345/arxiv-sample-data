In this paper, we discuss approximating the eigenvalue problem of biharmonic equation. We first present an equivalent mixed formulation which admits amiable nested discretization. Then, we construct multi-level finite element schemes by implementing the algorithm as in [33] to the nested discretizations on series of nested grids. The multi-level mixed scheme for biharmonic eigenvalue problem possesses optimal convergence rate and optimal computational cost. Both theoretical analysis and numerical verifications are presented.
