In this paper, we analyze the supercloseness property of the streamline diffusion finite element method (SDFEM) on Shishkin triangular meshes, which is different from one in the case of rectangular meshes. The analysis depends on integral inequalities for the part related to the diffusion in the bilinear form. Moreover, our result allows the construction of a simple postprocessing that yields a more accurate solution. Finally, numerical experiments support these theoretical results.
