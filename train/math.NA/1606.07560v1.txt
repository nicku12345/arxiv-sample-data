BDDC and FETI-DP algorithms are developed for three-dimensional elliptic problems with adaptively enriched coarse components. It is known that these enriched components are necessary in the development of robust preconditioners. To form the adaptive coarse components, carefully designed generalized eigenvalue problems are introduced for each faces and edges, and the coarse components are formed by using eigenvectors with their corresponding eigenvalues larger than a given tolerance \lambda_{TOL}. Upper bounds for condition numbers of the preconditioned systems are shown to be C \lambda_{TOL}, with the constant C depending only on the maximum number of edges and faces per subdomain, and the maximum number of subdomains sharing an edge. Numerical results are presented to test the robustness of the proposed approach.
