In this work, we establish the maximal \ell^p-regularity for several time stepping schemes for a fractional evolution model, which involves a fractional derivative of order \alpha\in(0,2), \alpha\neq 1, in time. These schemes include convolution quadratures generated by backward Euler method and second-order backward difference formula, the L1 scheme, explicit Euler method and a fractional variant of the Crank-Nicolson method. The main tools for the analysis include operator-valued Fourier multiplier theorem due to Weis [48] and its discrete analogue due to Blunck [10]. These results generalize the corresponding results for parabolic problems.
