We introduce and analyze the new range-separated (RS) canonical/Tucker tensor format which aims for numerical modeling of the 3D long-range interaction potentials in multi-particle systems. The main idea of the RS tensor format is the independent grid-based low-rank representation of the localized and global parts in the target tensor which allows the efficient numerical approximation of N-particle interaction potentials. The single-particle reference potential like 1/\|x\| is split into a sum of localized and long-range low-rank canonical tensors represented on a fine 3D n\times n\times n Cartesian grid. The smoothed long-range contribution to the total potential sum is represented on the 3D grid in O(n) storage via the low-rank canonical/Tucker tensor. We prove that the Tucker rank parameters depend only logarithmically on the number of particles N and the grid-size n. Agglomeration of the short range part in the sum is reduced to an independent treatment of N localized terms with almost disjoint effective supports, calculated in O(N) operations. Thus, the cumulated sum of short range clusters is parametrized by a single low-rank canonical reference tensor with a local support, accomplished by a list of particle coordinates and their charges. The RS canonical/Tucker tensor representations reduce the cost of multi-linear algebraic operations on the 3D potential sums arising in modeling of multi-dimensional data by radial basis functions, say, in computation of the electrostatic potential of a protein, in 3D integration and convolution transforms, computation of gradients, forces and the interaction energy of a many-particle systems, and in low parametric fitting of multi-dimensional scattered data by reducing all of them to 1D calculations.
