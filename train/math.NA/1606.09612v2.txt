We present an algorithm (CoDeFi) which overcomes the curse of dimensionality (CoD) in scientific computations and, especially, in mathematical finance (Fi). Our method applies a broad class of partial differential equations such as Kolmogorov-type equations and, for instance, the Black and Scholes equation. As a main feature, our algorithm allows one to solve partial differential equations in large dimensions and provides a general framework for stochastic problems. In insurance or finance applications, the number of dimensions corresponds to the number of risk sources and it is crucial to have a numerical method that remains robust and reliable in large dimensions.
