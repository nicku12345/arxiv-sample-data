Recently, ParaExp was proposed for the time integration of hyperbolic problems. It splits the time interval of interest into sub-intervals and computes the solution on each sub-interval in parallel. The overall solution is decomposed into a particular solution defined on each sub-interval with zero initial conditions and a homogeneous solution propagated by the matrix exponential applied to the initial conditions. The efficiency of the method results from fast approximations of this matrix exponential using tools from linear algebra. This paper deals with the application of ParaExp to electromagnetic wave problems in time-domain. Numerical tests are carried out for an electric circuit and an electromagnetic wave problem discretized by the Finite Integration Technique.
