We present a generalized optimal transport model in which the mass-preserving constraint for the L^2-Wasserstein distance is relaxed by introducing a source term in the continuity equation. The source term is also incorporated in the path energy by means of its squared L^2-norm in time of a functional with linear growth in space. This extension of the original transport model enables local density modulation, which is a desirable feature in applications such as image warping and blending. A key advantage of the use of a functional with linear growth in space is that it allows for singular sources and sinks, which can be supported on points or lines. On a technical level, the L^2-norm in time ensures a disintegration of the source in time, which we use to obtain the well-posedness of the model and the existence of geodesic paths. Furthermore, a numerical scheme based on the proximal splitting approach (Papadakis et al., 2014) is presented. We compare our model with the corresponding model involving the L^2(L^2)-norm of the source, which merges the metamorphosis approach and the optimal transport approaches in imaging. Selected numerical test cases show strikingly different behaviour.
