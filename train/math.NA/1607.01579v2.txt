Let X\in\mathbb{C}^{m\times m} and Y\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n} be nonsingular matrices, and let N\in\mathbb{C}^{m\times n}. Explicit expressions for the Moore-Penrose inverses of M=XNY and a two-by-two block matrix, under appropriate conditions, have been established by Castro-Gonz\'{a}lez et al. [Linear Algebra Appl. 471 (2015) 353-368]. Based on these results, we derive a novel expression for the Moore-Penrose inverse of A+UV^{\ast} under suitable conditions, where A\in \mathbb{C}^{m\times n}, U\in \mathbb{C}^{m\times r}, and V\in \mathbb{C}^{n\times r}. In particular, if both A and I+V^{\ast}A^{-1}U are nonsingular matrices, our expression reduces to the celebrated Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. Moreover, we extend our results to the bounded linear operators case.
