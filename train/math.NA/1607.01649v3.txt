The purpose of this text is to provide an accessible introduction to a set of recently developed algorithms for factorizing matrices. These new algorithms attain high practical speed by reducing the dimensionality of intermediate computations using randomized projections. The algorithms are particularly powerful for computing low-rank approximations to very large matrices, but they can also be used to accelerate algorithms for computing full factorizations of matrices. A key competitive advantage of the algorithms described is that they require less communication than traditional deterministic methods.
