In this paper, we obtain the preasymptotic and asymptotic behavior and strong equivalences of the approximation numbers of the embeddings from the anisotropic Sobolev spaces W_2^{\bf R}(\Bbb T^d) to L_2(\Bbb T^d). We also get the preasymptotic behavior of the approximation numbers of the embeddings from the limit spaces W_2^{\infty}(\Bbb T^d) of the anisotropic Sobolev spaces W_2^{\bf R}(\Bbb T^d) to L_2(\Bbb T^d). We show that both the above embedding problems are intractable and do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality.
