Recently, Bai and Benzi proposed a class of regularized Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting methods (RHSS) iteration methods for solving the nonsingular saddle point problem. In this paper, we apply this method to solve the singular saddle point problem from the Stokes equations. In the process of the semi-convergence analysis, we get that the RHSS method and the HSS method are unconditionally semi-convergent, which weaken the previous results. Then some spectral properties of the corresponding preconditioned matrix and a class of improved preconditioned matrix are analyzed. Finally, some numerical experiments on linear systems arising from the discretization of the Stokes equations are presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this method and preconditioners.
