We derive a new algorithm for computing the action f(A)V of the cosine, sine, hyperbolic cosine, and hyperbolic sine of a matrix A on a matrix V, without first computing f(A). The algorithm can compute \cos(A)V and \sin(A)V simultaneously, and likewise for \cosh(A)V and \sinh(A)V, and it uses only real arithmetic when A is real. The algorithm exploits an existing algorithm \texttt{expmv} of Al-Mohy and Higham for \mathrm{e}^AV and its underlying backward error analysis. Our experiments show that the new algorithm performs in a forward stable manner and is generally significantly faster than alternatives based on multiple invocations of \texttt{expmv} through formulas such as \cos(A)V = (\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}A}V + \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{-i}A}V)/2.
