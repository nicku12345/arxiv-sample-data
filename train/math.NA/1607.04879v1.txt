This paper deals with Lavrentiev regularization for solving linear ill-posed problems, mostly with respect to accretive operators on Hilbert spaces. We present converse and saturation results which are an important part in regularization theory. As a byproduct we obtain a new result on the quasi-optimality of a posteriori parameter choices. Results in this paper are formulated in Banach spaces whenever possible.
