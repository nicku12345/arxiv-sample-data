In this paper, amiable mixed schemes are presented for two variants of fourth order curl equations. Specifically, mixed formulations for the problems are constructed, which are well-posed in Babuska-Brezzi's sense and admit stable discretizations by finite element spaces of low smoothness and of low degree. The regularities of the mixed formulations and thus equivalently the primal problems are established, and some finite elements examples are given which can exploit the regularity of the solutions to an optimal extent.
