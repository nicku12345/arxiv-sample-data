In this paper, we propose a novel gradient recovery method for elliptic interface problem using body-fitted mesh in two dimension. Due to the lack of regularity of solution at interface, standard gradient recovery methods fail to give superconvergent results, and thus will lead to overrefinement when served as a posteriori error estimator. This drawback is overcome by designing an immersed gradient recovery operator in our method. We prove the superconvergence of this method for both mildly unstructured mesh and adaptive mesh, and present several numerical examples to verify the superconvergence and its robustness as a posteriori error estimator.
