We provide and analyze the high order algorithms for the model describing the functional distributions of particles performing anomalous motion with power-law jump length and tempered power-law waiting time. The model is derived in [Wu, Deng, and Barkai, Phys. Rev. E., 84 (2016), 032151], being called the time-tempered fractional Feynman-Kac equation. The key step of designing the algorithms is to discretize the time tempered fractional substantial derivative, being defined as {^S\!}D_t^{\gamma,\widetilde{\lambda}} G(x,p,t)\!=\!D_t^{\gamma,\widetilde{\lambda}} G(x,p,t)\!-\!\lambda^\gamma G(x,p,t) ~{\rm with}~\widetilde{\lambda}=\lambda+ pU(x),\, p=\rho+J\eta,\, J=\sqrt{-1}, where D_t^{\gamma,\widetilde{\lambda}} G(x,p,t) =\frac{1}{\Gamma(1-\gamma)} \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+\widetilde{\lambda} \right] \int_{0}^t{\left(t-z\right)^{-\gamma}}e^{-\widetilde{\lambda}\cdot(t-z)}{G(x,p,z)}dz, and \lambda \ge 0, 0<\gamma<1, \rho>0, and \eta is a real number. The designed schemes are unconditionally stable and have the global truncation error \mathcal{O}(\tau^2+h^2), being theoretically proved and numerically verified in {\em complex} space. Moreover, some simulations for the distributions of the first passage time are performed, and the second order convergence is also obtained for solving the `physical' equation (without artificial source term).
