Given a finite set of points on the Euclidean sphere, the worst case quadrature error in Sobolev spaces has recently been shown to provide upper bounds on the covering radius of the point set. Moreover, quasi-Monte Carlo integration points on the sphere achieve the asymptotically optimal covering radius. Here, we extend these results to points on compact smooth Riemannian manifolds and provide numerical experiments illustrating our findings for the Grassmannian manifold.
