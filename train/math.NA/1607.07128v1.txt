The Candecomp/Parafac (CP) decomposition of the tensor whose maximal dimension is greater than its rank is considered. We derive the upper bound of rank under which the generic uniqueness of CP decomposition is guaranteed. The bound only depends on the dimension of the tensor and the proof is constructive. Under these conditions, an algorithm applying homotopy continuation method is developed for computing the CP decomposition of tensors.
