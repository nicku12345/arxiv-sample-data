An error analysis of a splitting method applied to the Zakharov system is given. The numerical method is a Lie-Trotter splitting in time that is combined with a Fourier collocation in space to a fully discrete method. First-order convergence in time and high-order convergence in space depending on the regularity of the exact solution are shown for this method. The main challenge in the analysis is to exclude a loss of spatial regularity in the numerical solution. This is done by transforming the numerical method to new variables and by imposing a natural CFL-type restriction on the discretization parameters.
