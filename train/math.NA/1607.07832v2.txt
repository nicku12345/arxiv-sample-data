We study the numerical approximation of a time dependent equation involving fractional powers of an elliptic operator L defined to be the unbounded operator associated with a Hermitian, coercive and bounded sesquilinear form on H^1_0(\Omega). The time dependent solution u(x,t) is represented as a Dunford Taylor integral along a contour in the complex plane.   The contour integrals are approximated using sinc quadratures. In the case of homogeneous right-hand-sides and initial value v, the approximation results in a linear combination of functions (z_qI-L)^{-1}v\in H^1_0(\Omega) for a finite number of quadrature points z_q lying along the contour. In turn, these quantities are approximated using complex valued continuous piecewise linear finite elements.   Our main result provides L^2(\Omega) error estimates between the solution u(\cdot,t) and its final approximation. Numerical results illustrating the behavior of the algorithms are provided.
