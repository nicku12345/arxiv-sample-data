In this study, perturbation-iteration algorithm, namely PIA, is applied to solve some types of system of fractional differential equations (FDEs) for the first time. To illustrate the efficiency of the method, numerical solutions are compared with the results published in the literature by considering some FDEs. The results confirm that the PIA is powerful, simple and reliable method for solving system of nonlinear fractional differential equations.
