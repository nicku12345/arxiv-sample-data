We propose a new method for computing the \varphi-functions of large sparse matrices with low rank or fast decaying singular values. The key is to reduce the computation of \varphi_{\ell}-functions of a large matrix to \varphi_{\ell+1}-functions of some r-by-r matrices, where r is the numerical rank of the large matrix in question. Some error analysis on the new method is given. Furthermore, we propose two novel strategies for estimating 2-norm condition numbers of the \varphi-functions. Numerical experiments illustrate the numerical behavior of the new algorithms and show the effectiveness of our theoretical results.
