In this article we introduce a finite difference approximation for integro-differential operators of L\'evy type. We approximate solutions of integro-differential equations, where the second order operator is allowed to degenerate. In the existing literature, the L\'evy operator is treated as a zero/first order operator outside of a centered ball of radius \delta, leading to error estimates of order \xi (\delta)+N(\delta)(h+\sqrt{\tau}), where h and \tau are the spatial and temporal discretization parameters respectively. In these estimates \xi (\delta) \downarrow 0, but N(\delta )\uparrow \infty as \delta \downarrow 0. In contrast, we treat the integro-differential operator as a second order operator on the whole unit ball. By this method we obtain error estimates of order (h+\tau^k) for k\in \{1/2,1\}, eliminating the additional errors and the blowing up constants. Moreover, we do not pose any conditions on the L\'evy measure.
