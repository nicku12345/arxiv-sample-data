In this paper, optimal control problems governed by diffusion equations with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are investigated in the framework of the gradient discretisation method. Gradient schemes are defined for the optimality system of the control problem. Error estimates for state, adjoint and control variables are derived. Superconvergence results for gradient schemes under realistic regularity assumptions on the exact solution is discussed. These super-convergence results are shown to apply to non-conforming \mathbb{P}_1 finite elements, and to the mixed/hybrid mimetic finite differences. Results of numerical experiments are demonstrated for the conforming, nonconforming and mixed/hybrid mimetic finite difference schemes.
