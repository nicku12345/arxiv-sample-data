In this paper, we present an adaptive hybridizable C^0 discontinuous Galerkin (HCDG) method for Kirchhoff plates. A reliable and efficient a posteriori error estimator is produced for this HCDG method. Quasi-orthogonality and discrete reliability are established with the help of a postprocessed bending moment and the discrete Helmholtz decomposition. Based on these, the contraction property between two consecutive loops and complexity of the adaptive HCDG method are studied thoroughly. The key points in our analysis are a postprocessed normal-normal continuous bending moment from the HCDG method solution and a lifting of jump residuals from inter-element boundaries to element interiors.
