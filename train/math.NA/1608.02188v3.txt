In this work we prove convergence of the finite difference scheme for equations of stationary states of a general class of the spatial segregation of reaction-diffusion systems with m\geq 2 components. More precisely, we show that the numerical solution u_h^l, given by the difference scheme, converges to the l^{th} component u_l, when the mesh size h tends to zero, provided u_l\in C^2(\Omega), for every l=1,2,\dots,m. In particular, our proof provides convergence of a difference scheme for the multi-phase obstacle problem.
