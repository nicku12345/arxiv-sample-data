In this paper, we carry out the error analysis for the structure-preserving discretization of the incompressible MHD system. This system, as a coupled system of Navier-Stokes equations and Maxwell's equations, is nonlinear. We use its energy estimate and the underlying physical structure to facilitate the error analysis. Under certain CFL conditions, we prove the optimal order of convergence. To support the theoretical results, we also present numerical tests.
