An hp-version error analysis is developed for the general DG method in mixed formulation for solving the linear elastic problem. First of all, we give the hp-version error estimates of two L^2 projection operators. Then incorporated with the techniques in [11], we obtain the hp-version error estimates in energy norm and L^2 norm. Some numerical experiments are provided for demonstrating the theoretical results.
