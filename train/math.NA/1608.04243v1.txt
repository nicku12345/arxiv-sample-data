The simulation of the elastodynamics equations at high-frequency suffers from the well known pollution effect. The results of this work are two-fold. We present a Petrov--Galerkin multiscale sub-grid correction method that remains pollution free in natural resolution and oversampling regimes. This is accomplished by generating corrections to coarse-grid spaces with supports determined by oversampling lengths related to the \log(k), k being the wavenumber. Key to this method are polynomial-in-k bounds for stability constants and related inf-sup constants. The second, and principle accomplishment of this paper, is establishing polynomial-in-k bounds for the elastodynamics stability constants in general Lipschitz domains with radiation boundary conditions in \mathbb{R}^3. Previous methods relied on variational techniques, Rellich identities, and geometric constraints. In the context of elastodynamics, these suffer from the need to hypothesize a Korn's inequality on the boundary. The methods in this work are based on boundary integral operators and estimation of Green's function's derivatives dependence on k and do not require this extra hypothesis. We also implemented numerical examples in two and three dimensions to show the method eliminates pollution in the natural resolution and oversampling regimes, as well as performs well when compared to standard Lagrange finite elements.
