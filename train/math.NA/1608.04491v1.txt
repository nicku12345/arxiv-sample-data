We derive iterative methods for computing the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of the map which sends a full-rank matrix A to the factor U in its polar decomposition A=UH, where U has orthonormal columns and H is Hermitian positive definite. The methods apply to square matrices as well as rectangular matrices having more rows than columns. Our derivation relies on a novel identity that relates the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of the polar decomposition to the matrix sign function \mathrm{sign}(X) = X (X^2)^{-1/2} applied to a certain block matrix X.
