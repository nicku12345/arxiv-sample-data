We study the numerical approximation of integrals over \mathbb{R}^s with respect to the standard Gaussian measure for integrands which lie in certain Hermite spaces of functions. The decay rate of the associated sequence is specified by a single integer parameter which determines the smoothness classes and the inner product can be expressed via L_2 norms of the derivatives of the function.   We map higher order digital nets from the unit cube to a suitable subcube of \mathbb{R}^s via a linear transformation and show that such rules achieve, apart from powers of \log N, the optimal rate of convergence of the integration error.
