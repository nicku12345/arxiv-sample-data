In this paper we discuss the efficient implementation of RKN-type Fourier collocation methods, which are used when solving second-order differential equations. The proposed implementation relies on an alternative formulation of the methods and the blended formulation. The features and effectiveness of the implementation are confirmed by the performance of the methods on two numerical tests.
