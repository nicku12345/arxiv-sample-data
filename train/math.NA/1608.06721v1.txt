The paper develops a Newton multigrid (MG) method for one- and two-dimensional steady-state shallow water equations (SWEs) with topography and dry areas.It solves the nonlinear system arising from the well-balanced finite volume discretization of the steady-state SWEs by using Newton's method as the outer iteration and a geometric MG method with the block symmetric Gauss-Seidel smoother as the inner iteration. The proposed Newton MG method makes use of the local residual to regularize the Jacobian matrix of the Newton iteration, and can handle the steady-state problem with wet/dry transitions. Several numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and well-balanced property of the proposed method. The relation between the convergence behavior of the Newton MG method and the distribution of the eigenvalues of the iteration matrix is detailedly discussed.
