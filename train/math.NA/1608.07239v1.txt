Most large engineering structures are described as assemblies of plates and shells and they are computed as such using adhoc Finite Element packages. In fact their computation in 3D would be much too costly. In this framework, the connections between the parts are often modeled by means of simplified tying models. In order to improve the reliability of such simulations, we propose to apply a non-intrusive technique so as to virtually substitute the simplified connectors by a precise 3D nonlinear model, without modifying the global plate model. Moreover each computation can be conducted on independent optimized software. After a description of the method, examples are used to analyze its performance, and to draw some conclusions on the validity and limitation of both the modeling of junction by rigid connectors and the use of submodeling techniques for the estimation of the carrying capacity of bolted plates.
