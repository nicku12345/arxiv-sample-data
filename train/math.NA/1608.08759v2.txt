This paper is concerned with a Galerkin boundary element method solving the two dimensional exterior elastic wave scattering problem. The original problem is first reduced to the so-called Burton-Miller (\cite{BM71}) boundary integral formulation, and essential mathematical features of its variational form are discussed. In numerical implementations, a newly-derived and analytically accurate regularization formula (\cite{YHX}) is employed for the numerical evaluation of hyper-singular boundary integral operator. A new computational approach is employed based on the series expansions of Hankel functions for the computation of weakly-singular boundary integral operators during the reduction of corresponding Galerkin equations into a discrete linear system. The effectiveness of proposed numerical methods is demonstrated using several numerical examples.
