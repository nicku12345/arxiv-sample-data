We present an algorithm for the numerical solution of the equations governing combustion in porous inert media. The discretization of the flow problem is performed by the mixed finite element method, the transport problems are discretized by a cell-centered finite volume method. The resulting nonlinear equations are lineararized with Newton's method, the linearized systems are solved with a multigrid algorithm. Both subsystems are recoupled again in a Picard iteration. Numerical simulations based on a simplified model show how regions with different porosity stabilize the reaction zone inside the porous burner.
