The numerical solution of a nonlinear and space-fractional anti-diffusive equation used to model dune morphodynamics is considered. Spatial discretization is effected using a finite element method whereas the Crank-Nicolson scheme is used for temporal discretization. The fully discrete scheme is analyzed to determine stability condition and also to obtain error estimates for the approximate solution. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate convergence results.
