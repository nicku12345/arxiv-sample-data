The finite volume methods are frequently employed in the discretization of diffusion problems with interface. In this paper, we firstly present a vertex-centered MACH-like finite volume method for solving stationary diffusion problems with strong discontinuity and multiple material cells on the Eulerian grids. This method is motivated by Frese [No. AMRC-R-874, Mission Research Corp., Albuquerque, NM, 1987]. Then, the local truncation error and global error estimates of the degenerate five-point MACH-like scheme are derived by introducing some new techniques. Especially under some assumptions, we prove that this scheme can reach the asymptotic optimal error estimate O(h^2 |\ln h|) in the maximum norm. Finally, numerical experiments verify theoretical results.
