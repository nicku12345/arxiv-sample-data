In this paper we investigate numerically the order of convergence of an isogeometric collocation method that builds upon the least-squares collocation method presented in [1] and the variational collocation method presented in [2]. The focus is on smoothest B-splines/NURBS approximations, i.e, having global C^{p-1} continuity for polynomial degree p. Within the framework of [2], we select as collocation points a subset of those considered in [1], which are related to the Galerkin superconvergence theory. With our choice, that features local symmetry of the collocation stencil, we improve the convergence behaviour with respect to [2], achieving optimal L^2-convergence for odd degree B-splines/NURBS approximations. The same optimal order of convergence is seen in [1], where, however a least-squares formulation is adopted. Further careful study is needed, since the robustness of the method and its mathematical foundation are still unclear.
