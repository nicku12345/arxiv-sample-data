We construct a consistent multiplier free method for the finite element solution of the obstacle problem. The method is based on an augmented Lagrangian formulation in which we eliminate the multiplier by use of its definition in a discrete setting. We prove existence and uniqueness of discrete solutions and optimal order a priori error estimates for smooth exact solutions. Using a saturation assumption we also prove an a posteriori error estimate. Numerical examples show the performance of the method and of an adaptive algorithm for the control of the discretization error.
