A design problem of finding an optimally stiff membrane structure by selecting one-dimensional fiber reinforcements is formulated and solved. The membrane model is derived in a novel manner from a particular three-dimensional linear elastic orthotropic model by appropriate assumptions. The design problem is given in the form of two minimization statements, reminiscent of a Nash game. After finite element discretization, the separate treatment of each of the two minimization statements follows from classical results and methods of structural optimization: the stiffest orientation of reinforcing fibers coincides with principal stresses and the separate selection of density of fibers is a convex problem that can be solved by optimality criteria iterations. Numerical solutions are shown for two particular configurations. The first for a statically determined structure and the second for a statically undetermined one. The latter shows related but non-unique solutions.
