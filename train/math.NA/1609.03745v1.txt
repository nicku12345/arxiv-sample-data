We design and analyse a Nitsche method for contact problems. Compared to the seminal work of Chouly and Hild (A Nitsche-based method for unilateral contact problems: numerical analysis. SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 51 (2013), no. 2) our method is constructed by expressing the contact conditions in a nonlinear function for the displacement variable instead of the lateral forces. The contact condition is then imposed using the nonsymmetric variant of Nitsche's method that does not require a penalty term for stability. Nonconforming piecewise affine elements are considered for the bulk discretization. We prove optimal error estimates in the energy norm.
