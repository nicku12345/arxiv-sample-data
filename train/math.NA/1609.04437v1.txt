In this paper, we investigate adaptive streamline upwind/Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) methods for singularly perturbed convection-diffusion-reaction equations in a new dual norm presented in [Du and Zhang, J. Sci. Comput. (2015)]. The flux is recovered by either local averaging in conforming H({\rm div}) spaces or weighted global L^2 projection onto conforming H({\rm div}) spaces. We further introduce a recovery stabilization procedure, and develop completely robust a posteriori error estimators with respect to the singular perturbation parameter \varepsilon. Numerical experiments are reported to support the theoretical results and to show that the estimated errors depend on the degrees of freedom uniformly in \varepsilon.
