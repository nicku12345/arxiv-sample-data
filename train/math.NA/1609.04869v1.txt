This paper considers optimization problems on Riemannian manifolds and analyzes iteration-complexity for gradient and subgradient methods on manifolds with non-negative curvature. By using tools from the Riemannian convex analysis and exploring directly the tangent space of the manifold, we obtain different iteration-complexity bounds for the aforementioned methods, complementing and improving related results. Moreover, we also establish iteration-complexity bound for the proximal point method on Hadamard manifolds.
