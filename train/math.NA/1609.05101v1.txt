Tikhonov regularization is one of the most commonly used methods of regularization of ill-posed problems. In the setting of finite element solutions of elliptic partial differential control problems, Tikhonov regularization amounts to adding suitably weighted least squares terms of the control variable, or derivatives thereof, to the Lagrangian determining the optimality system. In this note we show that stabilization methods for discretely ill--posed problems developed in the setting of convection--dominated convection--diffusion problems, can be highly suitable for stabilizing optimal control problems, and that Tikhonov regularization will lead to less accurate discrete solutions. We consider data assimilation problems for Poisson's equation as illustration and derive new error estimates both for the the reconstruction of the solution from measured data and reconstruction of the source term from measured data. These estimates include both the effect of discretization error and error in measurements.
