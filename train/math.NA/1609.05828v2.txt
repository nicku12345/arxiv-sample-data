Recently, the P_1-nonconforming finite element space over square meshes has been proved stable to solve Stokes equations with the piecewise constant space for velocity and pressure, respectively. In this paper, we will introduce its locally divergence-free subspace to solve the elliptic problem for the velocity only decoupled from the Stokes equation. The concerning system of linear equations is much smaller compared to the Stokes equations. Furthermore, it is split into two smaller ones. After solving the velocity first, the pressure in the Stokes problem can be obtained by an explicit method very rapidly.
