We propose a non grid-based interpolation scheme based on the information from the data collected from the vicinity of the query point. As a non-grid-based interpolation, the data points can be distributed randomly in a small region, and the interpolation is constructed so that it naturally makes use of the information not only on the function value but also on its higher order derivatives. The main advantage of the present approach is that the precision of the interpolation can be adjusted in accordance to the quantity of the data, in other words, a balance between the precision and the computational cost can be achieved by properly choosing the size of the neighborhood where the data points are collected. The method is applicable to univariate as well as multivariate functions. We show that the proposed scheme is efficient and precise. The present approach is then employed to study the eigenvalue problem.
