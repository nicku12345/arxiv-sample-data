In this thesis we develop a stabilised finite element method for solving the equations of poroelasticity to enable solving complex models of biological tissues such as the human lungs. For the proposed numerical scheme, we use the lowest possible approximation order: piecewise constant approximation for the pressure, and piecewise linear continuous elements for the displacements and fluid flux. Due to the discontinuous pressure approximation, sharp pressure gradients due to changes in material coefficients or boundary layer solutions can be captured reliably. We begin by developing theoretical results for approximating the linear poroelastic equations valid in small deformations. In particular, we prove existence and uniqueness, an energy estimate and an optimal a-priori error estimate for the discretised problem. We then extend this work and construct a stabilised finite element method to solve the poroelastic equations valid in large deformations. We present the linearisation and discretisation for this nonlinear problem, and give a detailed account of the implementation. We rigorously test both the linear and nonlinear finite element method using numerous test problems to verify theoretical stability and convergence results, and the method's ability to reliably capture steep pressure gradients. Finally, we derive a poroelastic model for lung parenchyma coupled to an airway fluid network model, and develop a stable method to solve the coupled model. Numerical simulations, on a realistic lung geometry, illustrate the coupling between the poroelastic medium and the network flow model, and simulations of tidal breathing are shown to reproduce global physiologically realistic measurements. We also investigate the effect of airway constriction and tissue weakening on the ventilation, tissue stress and alveolar pressure distribution.
