The paper deals with the a posteriori error analysis of a virtual element method for the Steklov eigenvalue problem. The virtual element method has the advantage of using general polygonal meshes, which allows implementing very efficiently mesh refinement strategies. We introduce a residual type a posteriori error estimator and prove its reliability and efficiency. We use the corresponding error estimator to drive an adaptive scheme. Finally, we report the results of a couple of numerical tests, that allow us to assess the performance of this approach.
