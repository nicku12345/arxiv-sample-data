This paper deals with a new fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme improving the WENO-NS and WENO-P methods which are introduced in Ha et al. J. Comput. Phys. (2013) and Kim et al., J. Sci. Comput. (2016) respectively. These two schemes provide the fifth-order accuracy at the critical points where the first derivatives vanish but the second derivatives are non-zero. In this paper, we have presented a scheme by defining a new global-smoothness indicator which shows an improved behavior over the solution to the WENO-NS and WENO-P schemes and the proposed scheme attains optimal approximation order, even at the critical points where the first and second derivatives vanish but the third derivatives are non-zero.
