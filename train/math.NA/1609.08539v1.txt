In this paper, an efficient method is presented for solving three dimensional Volterra integral equations of the second kind with continuous kernel. Shifted Chebyshev polynomial is applied to approximate a solution for these integral equations. This method transforms the integral equation to algebraic equations with unknown Chebyshev coefficients. Numerical results are calculated and the estimated error in each example is computed using Maple 17.
