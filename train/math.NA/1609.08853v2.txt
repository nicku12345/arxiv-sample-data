In this paper, we propose a conservative local discontinuous Galerkin method for one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. By using special upwind-biased numerical fluxes, we establish the optimal rate of convergence \mathcal O(h^{k+1}), with polynomial of degree k and grid size h. Meanwhile, we show that this method preserves the charge conservation law and thus we call it a conservative local discontinuous Galerkin method. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical result.
