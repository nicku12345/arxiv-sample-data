In this paper we prove the convergence of a Crank-Nicolson type Galerkin finite element scheme for the initial value problem associated to the Benjamin-Ono equation. The proof is based on a recent result for a similar discrete scheme for the Korteweg-de Vries equation and utilizes a local smoothing effect to bound the H^{1/2}-norm of the approximations locally. This enables us to show that the scheme converges strongly in L^{2}(0,T;L^{2}_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R})) to a weak solution of the equation for initial data in L^{2}(\mathbb{R}) and some T > 0. Finally we illustrate the method with some numerical examples.
