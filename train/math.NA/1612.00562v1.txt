This paper is concerned with numerical solutions of time-fractional nonlinear parabolic problems by a class of L1-Galerkin finite element methods. The analysis of L1 methods for time-fractional nonlinear problems is limited mainly due to the lack of a fundamental Gronwall type inequality. In this paper, we establish such a fundamental inequality for the L1 approximation to the Caputo fractional derivative. In terms of the Gronwall type inequality, we provide optimal error estimates of several fully discrete linearized Galerkin finite element methods for nonlinear problems. The theoretical results are illustrated by applying our proposed methods to three examples: linear Fokker-Planck equation, nonlinear Huxley equation and Fisher equation.
