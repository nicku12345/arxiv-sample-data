In this paper, we present a Galerkin method for Abel-type integral equation with a general class of kernel. Stability and quasi-optimal convergence estimates are derived in ractional-order Sobolev norms. The fully-discrete Galerkin method is defined by employing simple tensor-Gauss quadrature. We develop a corresponding perturbation analysis which allows to keep the number of quadrature points small. Numerical experiments have been performed which illustrate the sharpness of the theoretical estimates and the sensitivity of the solution with respect to some parameters in the equation.
