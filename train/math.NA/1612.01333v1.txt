In this article, we discuss several classes of Uzawa smoothers for the application in multigrid methods in the context of saddle point problems. Beside commonly used variants, such as the inexact and block factorization version, we also introduce a new symmetric method, belonging to the class of Uzawa smoothers. For these variants we unify the analysis of the smoothing properties, which is an important part in the multigrid convergence theory. These methods are applied to the Stokes problem for which all smoothers are implemented as pointwise relaxation methods. Several numerical examples illustrate the theoretical results.
