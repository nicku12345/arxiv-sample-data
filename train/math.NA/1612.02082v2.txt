In this study, a Galerkin finite element method is presented for time-fractional stochastic heat equation driven by multiplicative noise, which arises from the consideration of heat transport in porous media with thermal memory with random effects. The spatial and temporal regularity properties of mild solution to the given problem under certain sufficient conditions are obtained. Numerical techniques are developed by the standard Galerkin finite element method in spatial direction, and Gorenflo-Mainardi-Moretti-Paradisi scheme is applied in temporal direction. The convergence error estimates for both semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes are established. Finally, numerical example is provided to verify the theoretical results.
