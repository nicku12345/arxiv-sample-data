An important question in the theory of approximate integration is to study the conditions on the nodes x_{k,n} and weights w_{k,n} that allow an estimate of the form  \sup_{f\in \mathcal{B}_\gamma}|\sum_k w_{k,n}f(x_{k,n})-\int_\mathbb{X} fd\mu^*| \le cn^{-\gamma}, \qquad n=1,2,\cdots,  where \mathbb{X} is often a manifold with its volume measure \mu^*, and \mathcal{B}_\gamma is the unit ball of a suitably defined smoothness class, parametrized by \gamma. In this paper, we study this question in the context of a quasi-metric, locally compact, measure space \mathbb{X} with a probability measure \mu^*. We show that quadrature formulas exact for integrating the so called diffusion polynomials of degree <n satisfy such estimates. Without requiring exactness, such formulas can be obtained as a solutions of some kernel-based optimization problem. We discuss the connection with the question of optimal covering radius. Our results generalize in some sense many recent results in this direction.
