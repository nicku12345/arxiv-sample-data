Differences between computer simulation of dynamical systems and laboratory experiments are common in teaching and research in engineering. Normally, numerical inaccuracy and the non-ideal behaviour of the devices involved in the experiment are the most common explanations. With the application of interval analysis, it is possible to incorporate the numerical and parametric uncertainties in the simulation, allowing a better understanding of the play between simulation and experiment. This article presents a case study in which an step input is applied to an RLC circuit. Using the toolbox Intlab for Matlab, it was possible to present a computer simulation with the range that encompasses the experimental results . Comparison of simulation with experimental data show the success of the technique and indicates a potential content to be delivered to undergraduate engineering courses.
