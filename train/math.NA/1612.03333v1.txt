In this study collocation method based on the extended B-spline functions for the numerical solutions of the Generalized Burhers Fisher equation is set up. The approximate solution of the equation is constructed with the combination of the extended B-splines. Some initial boundary value problems are solved by the proposed method. The accuracy and validity and of the method is demonstrated by measuring the error between the numerical solutions and the analytical solutions, if exist.
