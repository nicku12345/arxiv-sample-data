Polynomial minimal bases of rational vector subspaces are a classical concept that plays an important role in control theory, linear systems theory, and coding theory. It is a common practice to arrange the vectors of any minimal basis as the rows of a polynomial matrix and to call such matrix simply a minimal basis. Very recently, minimal bases, as well as the closely related pairs of dual minimal bases, have been applied to a number of problems that include the solution of general inverse eigenstructure problems for polynomial matrices, the development of new classes of linearizations and \ell-ifications of polynomial matrices, and backward error analyses of complete polynomial eigenstructure problems solved via a wide class of strong linearizations. These new applications have revealed that although the algebraic properties of minimal bases are rather well understood, their robustness and the behavior of the corresponding dual minimal bases under perturbations have not yet been explored in the literature, as far as we know. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to study in detail when a minimal basis M(\lambda) is robust under perturbations, i.e., when all the polynomial matrices in a neighborhood of M(\lambda) are minimal bases, and, in this case, how perturbations of M(\lambda) change its dual minimal bases. In order to study such problems, a new characterization of whether or not a polynomial matrix is a minimal basis in terms of a finite number of rank conditions is introduced and, based on it, we prove that polynomial matrices are generically minimal bases with very specific properties. In addition, some applications of the results of this paper are discussed.
