The goal of this paper is to reconstruct spatially distributed dielectric constants from complex-valued scattered wave field by solving a 3D coefficient inverse problem for the Helmholtz equation at multi-frequencies. The data are generated by only a single direction of the incident plane wave. To solve this inverse problem, a globally convergent algorithm is analytically developed. We prove that this algorithm provides a good approximation for the exact coefficient without any \textit{a priori} knowledge of any point in a small neighborhood of that coefficient. This is the main advantage of our method, compared with classical approaches using optimization schemes. Numerical results are presented for both computationally simulated data and experimental data. Potential applications of this problem are in detection and identification of explosive-like targets.
