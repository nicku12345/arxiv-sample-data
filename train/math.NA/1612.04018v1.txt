The trigonometric interpolants to a periodic function f in equispaced points converge if f is Dini-continuous, and the associated quadrature formula, the trapezoidal rule, converges if f is continuous. What if the points are perturbed? With equispaced grid spacing h, let each point be perturbed by an arbitrary amount \le \alpha h, where \alpha\in [\kern .5pt 0,1/2) is a fixed constant. The Kadec 1/4 theorem of sampling theory suggests there may be be trouble for \alpha\ge 1/4. We show that convergence of both the interpolants and the quadrature estimates is guaranteed for all \alpha<1/2 if f is twice continuously differentiable, with the convergence rate depending on the smoothness of f. More precisely it is enough for f to have 4\alpha derivatives in a certain sense, and we conjecture that 2\alpha derivatives is enough. Connections with the Fej\'er--Kalm\'ar theorem are discussed.
