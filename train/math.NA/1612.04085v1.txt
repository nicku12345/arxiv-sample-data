The set {\cal P}^{m\times n}_{r,d} of m \times n complex matrix polynomials of grade d and (normal) rank at most r in a complex (d+1)mn dimensional space is studied. For r = 1, \dots , \min \{m, n\}-1, we show that {\cal P}^{m\times n}_{r,d} is the union of the closures of the rd+1 sets of matrix polynomials with rank r, degree exactly d, and explicitly described complete eigenstructures. In addition, for the full-rank rectangular polynomials, i.e. r= \min \{m, n\} and m \neq n, we show that {\cal P}^{m\times n}_{r,d} coincides with the closure of a single set of the polynomials with rank r, degree exactly d, and the described complete eigenstructure. These complete eigenstructures correspond to generic m \times n matrix polynomials of grade d and rank at most~r.
