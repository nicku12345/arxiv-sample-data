We develop two fast algorithms for Hessenberg reduction of a structured matrix A = D + UV^H where D is a real or unitary n \times n diagonal matrix and U, V \in\mathbb{C}^{n \times k}. The proposed algorithm for the real case exploits a two--stage approach by first reducing the matrix to a generalized Hessenberg form and then completing the reduction by annihilation of the unwanted sub-diagonals. It is shown that the novel method requires O(n^2k) arithmetic operations and it is significantly faster than other reduction algorithms for rank structured matrices. The method is then extended to the unitary plus low rank case by using a block analogue of the CMV form of unitary matrices. It is shown that a block Lanczos-type procedure for the block tridiagonalization of \Re(D) induces a structured reduction on A in a block staircase CMV--type shape. Then, we present a numerically stable method for performing this reduction using unitary transformations and we show how to generalize the sub-diagonal elimination to this shape, while still being able to provide a condensed representation for the reduced matrix. In this way the complexity still remains linear in k and, moreover, the resulting algorithm can be adapted to deal efficiently with block companion matrices.
