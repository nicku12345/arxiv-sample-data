We study some theoretical aspects of P_NP_M schemes, which are a novel class of high order accurate reconstruction based discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws. The PNPM schemes store and evolve the discrete solution u_h under the form of piecewise polynomials of degree N, while piecewise polynomials w_h of degree M \geq N are used for the computation of the volume and boundary fluxes. The piecewise polynomials w_h are obtained from u_h via a suitable reconstruction or recovery operator. The P_NP_M approach contains high order finite volume methods (N=0) as well as classical DG schemes (N=M) as special cases of a more general framework. Furthermore, for N \neq M and N>0, it leads to a new intermediate class of methods, which can be denoted either as Hermite finite volume or as reconstructed DG methods. We show analytically why P_NP_M methods for N \neq M are, in general, not L^2-diminishing. To this end, we extend the well-known cell entropy inequality and the following L^2 stability result of Jiang and Shu for DG methods (i.e. for N=M) to the general P_NP_M case and identify which part in the reconstruction step may cause the instability. With this insight we design a flux limiter that enforces a cell square entropy inequality and thus an L^2 stability condition for P_NP_M schemes for scalar conservation laws in one space dimension. Furthermore, in this paper we prove existence and uniqueness of the solution of the P_NP_M reconstruction operator.
