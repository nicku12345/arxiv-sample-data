In this paper we consider efficient algorithms for solving the algebraic equation {\mathcal A}^\alpha {\bf u}={\bf f}, 0< \alpha <1, where {\mathcal A} is a symmetric and positive definite matrix obtained form finite difference or finite element approximations of second order elliptic problems in {\mathbb R}^d, d=1,2,3. The method is based on the best uniform rational approximation of the function t^{\beta-\alpha} for 0 < t \le 1 and natural \beta, and the assumption that one has at hand an efficient method (e.g. multigrid, multilevel, or other fast algorithm) for solving equations like ({\mathcal A} +c {\mathcal I}){\bf u}= {\bf f}, c \ge 0. The provided numerical experiments on model problems with {\mathcal A} obtained by finite element approximation of elliptic equations in one and three spacial dimensions confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
