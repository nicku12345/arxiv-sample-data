Let A\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n} and \widetilde{A}\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n} be two normal matrices with spectra \{\lambda_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n} and \{\widetilde{\lambda}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}, respectively. The celebrated Hoffman--Wielandt theorem states that there exists a permutation \pi of \{1,\ldots,n\} such that \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\big|\widetilde{\lambda}_{\pi(i)}-\lambda_{i}\big|^{2}\right)^{1\over 2} is no larger than the Frobenius norm of \widetilde{A}-A. However, if either A or \widetilde{A} is non-normal, this result does not hold in general. In this paper, we present several novel upper bounds for \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\big|\widetilde{\lambda}_{\pi(i)}-\lambda_{i}\big|^{2}\right)^{1\over 2}, provided that A is normal and \widetilde{A} is arbitrary. Some of these estimates involving the "departure from normality" of \widetilde{A} have generalized the Hoffman--Wielandt theorem. Furthermore, we give new perturbation bounds for the spectrum of a Hermitian matrix.
