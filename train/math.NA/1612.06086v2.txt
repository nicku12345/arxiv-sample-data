We study the approximation of functions that map a Euclidean domain \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{d} into an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M,g) minimizing an elliptic, semilinear energy in a function set H\subset W^{1,2}(\Omega,M). The approximation is given by a restriction of the energy minimization problem to a family of conforming finite-dimensional approximations S_{h}\subset H. We provide a set of conditions on S_{h} such that we can prove a priori W^{1,2}- and L^{2}-approximation error estimates comparable to standard Euclidean finite elements. This is done in an intrinsic framework, independently of embeddings of the manifold or the choice of coordinates. A special construction of approximations ---geodesic finite elements--- is shown to fulfill the conditions, and in the process extended to maps into the tangential bundle.
