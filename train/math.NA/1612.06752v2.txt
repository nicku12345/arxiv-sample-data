This article considers the use of total variation minimization for the recovery of a superposition of point sources from samples of its Fourier transform along radial lines. We present a numerical algorithm for the computation of solutions to this infinite dimensional problem. The theoretical results of this paper make precise the link between the sampling operator and the recoverability of the point sources.
