The paper provides the fractional integrals and derivatives of the Rie\-mann-Liouville and Caputo type for the five kinds of radial basis functions (RBFs), including the powers, Gaussian, multiquadric, Matern and thin-plate splines, in one dimension. It allows to use high order numerical methods for solving fractional differential equations. The results are tested by solving two fractional differential equations. The first one is a fractional ODE which is solved by the RBF collocation method and the second one is a fractional PDE which is solved by the method of lines based on the spatial trial spaces spanned by the Lagrange basis associated to the RBFs.
