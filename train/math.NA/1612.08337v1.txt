In this paper, we consider the mixed and componentwise condition numbers for a linear function of the solution to the total least squares (TLS) problem. We derive the explicit expressions of the mixed and componentwise condition numbers through the dual techniques. The sharp upper bounds for the derived mixed and componentwise condition numbers are obtained. For the structured TLS problem, we consider the structured perturbation analysis and obtain the corresponding expressions of the mixed and componentwise condition numbers. We prove that the structured ones are smaller than their corresponding unstructured ones based on the derived expressions. Moreover, we point out that the new derived expressions can recover the previous results on the condition analysis for the TLS problem. The numerical examples show that the derived condition numbers can give sharp perturbation bounds, on the other hand normwise condition numbers can severely overestimate the relative errors because normwise condition numbers ignore the data sparsity and scaling. Meanwhile, from the observations of numerical examples, it is more suitable to adopt structured condition numbers to measure the conditioning for the structured TLS problem.
