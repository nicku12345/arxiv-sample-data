In this paper, we introduce a reduction of a matrix to a condensed form, the upper J- Hessenberg form, via elementary symplectic Householder transformations, which are rank-one modification of the identity . Features of the reduction are highlighted. Two variants numerically more stables are then derived. Some numerical experiments are given, showing the efficiency of these variants.
