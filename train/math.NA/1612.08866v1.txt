We propose a new arbitrary high order accurate semi-implicit space-time discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the solution of the two and three dimensional compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on staggered unstructured curved meshes. The method is pressure-based and semi-implicit and is able to deal with all Mach number flows. In our scheme, the discrete pressure is defined on the primal grid, while the discrete velocity field and the density are defined on a face-based staggered dual grid. All convective terms are discretized explicitly, while the pressure terms appearing in the momentum and energy equation are discretized implicitly. Substitution of the momentum equation into the energy equation yields a linear system for the scalar pressure as the only unknown. The enthalpy and the kinetic energy are taken explicitly and are then updated using a simple Picard procedure. Thanks to the use of a staggered grid, the final pressure system is a very sparse block five-point system for three dimensional problems. The viscous terms and the heat flux are also discretized making use of the staggered grid by defining the viscous stress tensor and the heat flux vector on the dual grid, which corresponds to the use of a lifting operator on the dual grid. The time step of our new numerical method is limited by a CFL condition based only on the fluid velocity and not on the sound speed. This makes the method particularly interesting for low Mach number flows. Finally, a very simple combination of artificial viscosity and the a posteriori MOOD technique allows to deal with shock waves and thus permits also to simulate high Mach number flows. We show computational results for a large set of two and three-dimensional benchmark problems, including both low and high Mach number flows and using polynomial approximation degrees up to p=4.
