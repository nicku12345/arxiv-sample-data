We consider an identification problem, where the state u is governed by a fractional elliptic equation and the unknown variable corresponds to the order s \in (0,1) of the underlying operator. We study the existence of an optimal pair (\bar s, \bar u) and provide sufficient conditions for its local uniqueness. We develop semi-discrete and fully discrete algorithms to approximate the solutions to our identification problem and provide a convergence analysis. We present numerical illustrations that confirm and extend our theory.
