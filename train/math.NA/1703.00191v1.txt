Two cubic B-spline functions from different families are placed to the collocation method for the numerical solutions to the Gardner equation.Four models describing propagation of bell shaped single solitary, travel of a kink type wave, wave generation and interaction of two positive bell shaped solitaries propagating in the opposite directions are studied by both methods. The error between the numerical and the analytical solutions ismeasured by using the discrete maximum norm when the analytical solutions exist. The absolute changes of the lowest three conservation laws are also good indicators of valid results even when the analytical solutions do not exist. The stability of the proposed method is investigated by the Von Neumann analysis.
