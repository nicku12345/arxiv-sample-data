A family of Virtual Element Methods for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations is proposed and analysed. The schemes provide a discrete velocity field which is point-wise divergence-free. A rigorous error analysis is developed, showing that the methods are stable and optimally convergent. Several numerical tests are presented, confirming the theoretical predictions. A comparison with some mixed finite elements is also performed.
