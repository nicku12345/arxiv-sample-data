We consider the numerical approximations for a phase field model consisting of incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with a generalized Navier boundary condition, and the Cahn-Hilliard equation with a dynamic moving contact line boundary condition. A crucial and challenging issue for solving this model numerically is the time marching problem, due to the high order, nonlinear, and coupled properties of the system. We solve this issue by developing two linear, second order accurate, and energy stable schemes based on the projection method for the Navier--Stokes equations, the invariant energy quadratization for the nonlinear gradient terms in the bulk and boundary, and a subtle implicit-explicit treatment for the stress and convective terms. The well-posedness of the semidiscretized system and the unconditional energy stabilities are proved. Various numerical results based on a spectral-Galerkin spatial discretization are presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes.
