We address two models for the simulation of dust clouds premixed combustion: the first one consists in usual balance equations, to derive the second one, we suppose that the solution takes the form of a travelling combustion wave and track the location of the flame brush by a phase-field-like technique. We build a finite volume fractional step scheme for both models, which respects the natural physical bounds of the unknowns. Then we assess the consistency of both formulations.
