Butterfly algorithms are an effective multilevel technique to compress discretizations of integral operators with highly oscillatory kernel functions. The particular version of the butterfly algorithm considered here realizes the transfer between levels by Chebyshev interpolation. We present a refinement of the analysis that improves the stability estimates underlying the error bounds.
