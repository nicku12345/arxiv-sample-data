In this paper we consider the initial-boundary value problem for the time-dependent Maxwell-Schr\"{o}dinger equations, which arises in the interaction between the matter and the electromagnetic field for the semiconductor quantum devices. A Crank-Nicolson finite element method for solving the problem is presented. The optimal energy-norm error estimates for the numerical algorithm without any time-step restrictions are derived. Numerical tests are then carried out to confirm the theoretical results.
