We present and analyze an interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin Isogeometric Analysis (dG-IgA) method for the biharmonic equation in computational domain in \mathbb{R}^d with d =2,3. The computational domain consist of several non-overlapping sub-domains or patches. We construct B-Spline approximation spaces which are discontinuous across patch interfaces. We present a priori error estimate in a discrete norm and numerical experiments to confirm the theory.
