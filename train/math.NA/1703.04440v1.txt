The stochastic H^\infty-norm is defined as the L^2-induced norm of the input-output operator of a stochastic linear system. Like the deterministic H^\infty-norm it is characterised by a version of the bounded real lemma, but without a frequency domain description or a Hamiltonian condition. Therefore, we base its computation on a parametrised algebraic Riccati-type matrix equation.
