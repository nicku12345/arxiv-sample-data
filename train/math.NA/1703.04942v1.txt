Tempered fractional derivatives originated from the tempered fractional diffusion equations (TFDEs) modeled on the whole space R (see [23]). For numerically solving TFDEs, two kinds of generalized Laguerre functions were defined and some important properties were proposed to establish the approximate theory. The related prototype tempered fractional differ- ential problems was proposed and solved as the guidance. TFDEs are numerically solved by two domains Laguerre spectral method and the numerical experiments show some properties of the TFDEs and verify the efficiency of the spectral scheme.
