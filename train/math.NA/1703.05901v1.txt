We propose an unconditionally convergent linear finite element scheme for the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert (LLG) equation with multi-dimensional noise. By using the Doss-Sussmann technique, we first transform the stochastic LLG equation into a partial differential equation that depends on the solution of the auxiliary equation for the diffusion part. The resulting equation has solutions absolutely continuous with respect to time. We then propose a convergent \theta-linear scheme for the numerical solution of the reformulated equation. As a consequence, we are able to show the existence of weak martingale solutions to the stochastic LLG equation.
