We develop a finite element method for the Laplace--Beltrami operator on a surface described by a set of patchwise parametrizations. The patches provide a partition of the surface and each patch is the image by a diffeomorphism of a subdomain of the unit square which is bounded by a number of smooth trim curves. A patchwise tensor product mesh is constructed by using a structured mesh in the reference domain. Since the patches are trimmed we obtain cut elements in the vicinity of the interfaces. We discretize the Laplace--Beltrami operator using a cut finite element method that utilizes Nitsche's method to enforce continuity at the interfaces and a consistent stabilization term to handle the cut elements. Several quantities in the method are conveniently computed in the reference domain where the mappings impose a Riemannian metric. We derive a priori estimates in the energy and L^2 norm and also present several numerical examples confirming our theoretical results.
