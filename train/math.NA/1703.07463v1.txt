In this paper, a two-grid method is proposed to linearize and symmetrize the steady-state Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. The computational system is decoupled to linearize and symmetrize equations by using this method, which can improve the computational efficiency compared with the finite element method. Error estimates are derived for the proposed method. The numerical results show that the two-grid method is effective.
