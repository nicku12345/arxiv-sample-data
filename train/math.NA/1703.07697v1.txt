We are concerned with the efficient implementation of symplectic implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) methods applied to systems of (non-necessarily Hamiltonian) ordinary differential equations by means of Newton-like iterations. We pay particular attention to symmetric symplectic IRK schemes (such as collocation methods with Gaussian nodes). For a s-stage IRK scheme used to integrate a d-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, the application of simplified versions of Newton iterations requires solving at each step several linear systems (one per iteration) with the same sd \times sd real coefficient matrix. We propose rewriting such sd-dimensional linear systems as an equivalent (s+1)d-dimensional systems that can be solved by performing the LU decompositions of [s/2] +1 real matrices of size d \times d. We present a C implementation (based on Newton-like iterations) of Runge-Kutta collocation methods with Gaussian nodes that make use of such a rewriting of the linear system and that takes special care in reducing the effect of round-off errors. We report some numerical experiments that demonstrate the reduced round-off error propagation of our implementation.
