By excluding some sets, which don't include any eigenvalue of a tensor, from some existing eigenvalue inclusion sets, two new sets are given to locate all eigenvalues of a tensor. And it is shown that these two sets are contained in the Ger\v{s}gorin eigenvalue inclusion set of tensors provide by Qi (Journal of Symbolic Computation 2005; 40:1302-1324) and the Brauer-type eigenvalue inclusion set provide by Li et al. (Numer. Linear Algebra Appl. 2014; 21:39-50) respectively. Two sufficient conditions such that the determinant of a tensor is not zero are also provided.
