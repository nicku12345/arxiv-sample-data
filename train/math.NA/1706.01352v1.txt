We study mixed finite element methods for the rotating shallow water equations with linearized momentum terms but nonlinear drag. By means of an equivalent second-order formulation, we prove long-time stability of the system without energy accumulation. We also give rates of damping in unforced systems and various continuous dependence results on initial conditions and forcing terms. \emph{A priori} error estimates for the momentum and free surface elevation are given in L^2 as well as for the time derivative and divergence of the momentum. Numerical results confirm the theoretical results regarding both energy damping and convergence rates.
