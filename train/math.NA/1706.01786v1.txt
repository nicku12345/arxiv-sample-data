Let the scalars A^{(j)}_n be defined via the linear equations A_l=A^{(j)}_n+\sum^n_{k=1}\bar{\alpha}_ku_{k+l-1},\ \ l=j,j+1,\ldots,j+n\ . Here the A_i and u_i are known and the \bar{\alpha}_k are additional unknowns, and the quantities of interest are the A^{(j)}_n. This problem arises, for example, when one computes infinite-range integrals by the higher-order G-transformation of Gray, Atchison, and McWilliams. One efficient procedure for computing the A^{(j)}_n is the rs-algorithm of Pye and Atchison. In the present work, we develop yet another procedure that combines the FS-algorithm of Ford and Sidi and the qd-algorithm of Rutishauser, and we denote it the FS/qd-algorithm. We show that the FS/qd-algorithm has a smaller operation count than the rs-algorithm. We also show that the FS/qd algorithm can also be used to implement the transformation of Shanks, and compares very favorably with the \varepsilon-algorithm of Wynn that is normally used for this purpose.
