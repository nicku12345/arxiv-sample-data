In this paper, we study a novel second-order energy stable Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) finite difference scheme for the epitaxial thin film equation with slope selection (SS). One major challenge for the higher oder in time temporal discretization is how to ensure an unconditional energy stability and an efficient numerical implementation. We propose a general framework for designing the higher order in time numerical scheme with unconditional energy stability by using the BDF method with constant coefficient stabilized terms. Based on the unconditional energy stability property, we derive an L^\infty_h (0,T; H_{h}^2) stability for the numerical solution and provide an optimal the convergence analysis. To deal with the 4-Laplacian solver in an L^{2} gradient flow at each time step, we apply an efficient preconditioned steepest descent algorithm and preconditioned nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm to solve the corresponding nonlinear system. Various numerical simulations are present to demonstrate the stability and efficiency of the proposed schemes and slovers.
