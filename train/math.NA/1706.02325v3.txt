In this paper, we propose a two-level overlapping additive Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioner for the symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method for the second order elliptic boundary value problem with highly heterogeneous coefficients. A specific feature of this preconditioner is that it is based on adaptively enriching its coarse space with functions created by solving generalized eigenvalue problems on thin patches covering the subdomain interfaces. It is shown that the condition number of the underlined preconditioned system is independent of the contrast if an adequate number of functions are used to enrich the coarse space. Numerical results are provided to confirm this claim.
