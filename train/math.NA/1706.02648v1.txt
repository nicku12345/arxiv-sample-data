In this paper, we propose a robust solver for the finite element discrete problem of the stationary incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in three dimensions. By the mixed finite element method, both the velocity and the pressure are approximated by H1-conforming finite elements, while the magnetic field is approximated by H(curl)-conforming edge elements. An efficient preconditioner is proposed to accelerate the convergence of the GMRES method for solving the linearized MHD problem. We use three numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the finite element method and the robustness of the discrete solver. The preconditioner contains the least undetermined parameters and is optimal with respect to the number of degrees of freedom. We also show the scalability of the solver for moderate physical parameters.
