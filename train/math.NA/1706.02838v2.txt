We investigate a discretization of a class of stochastic heat equations on the unit sphere with multiplicative noises. A spectral method is used for the spatial discretization and the truncation of the Wiener process, while an implicit Euler scheme with non-uniform steps is used for the temporal discretization. Some numerical experiments inspired by Earth's surface temperature data analysis GISTEMP provided by NASA are given.
