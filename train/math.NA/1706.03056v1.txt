Univariate pseudo-splines are a generalization of uniform B-splines and interpolatory 2n-point subdivision schemes. Each pseudo-spline is characterized as the subdivision scheme with least possible support among all schemes with specific degrees of polynomial generation and reproduction. In this paper we consider the problem of constructing the symbols of the bivariate counterpart and provide a formula for the symbols of a family of symmetric four-directional bivariate pseudo-splines. All methods employed are of purely algebraic nature.
