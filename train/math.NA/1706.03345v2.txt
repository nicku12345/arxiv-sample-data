This paper develops a computational method for studying stable/unstable manifolds attached to periodic orbits of differential equations. The method uses high order Chebyshev-Taylor series approximations in conjunction with the parameterization method -- a general functional analytic framework for invariant manifolds. The parameterization method can follow folds in the embedding, recovers the dynamics on the manifold through a simple conjugacy, and admits a natural notion of a-posteriori error analysis. The key to the approach is the derivation of a recursive system of linear differential equations describing the Taylor coefficients of the invariant manifold. We find periodic solutions of these equations by solving a coupled collection of boundary value problems with Chebyshev spectral methods. We discuss the performance of the method for the Lorenz system, and for circular restricted three and four body problems. We also illustrate the use of the method as a tool for computing cycle-to-cycle connecting orbits.
