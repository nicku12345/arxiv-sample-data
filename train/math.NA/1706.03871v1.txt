A linear implicit finite difference method is proposed for the approximation of the solution to a periodic, initial value problem for a Schrodinger-Hirota equation. Optimal, second order convergence in the discrete H^1-norm is proved, assuming that \tau, h and \tau^4/h are sufficiently small, where \tau is the time-step and h is the space mesh-size. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified by results from numerical experiments.
