We consider settings for which one needs to perform multiple flow simulations based on the Navier-Stokes equations, each having different values for the physical parameters and/or different initial condition data, boundary conditions data, and/or forcing functions. For such settings, we propose a second-order time accurate ensemble-based method that to simulate the whole set of solutions, requires, at each time step, the solution of only a single linear system with multiple right-hand-side vectors. Rigorous analyses are given proving the conditional stability and error estimates for the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments are provided that illustrate the analyses.
