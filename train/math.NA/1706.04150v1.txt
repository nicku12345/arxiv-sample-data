For each square matrix polynomial P(\lambda) of odd degree, a block-symmetric block-tridiagonal pencil \mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda) was introduced by Antoniou and Vologiannidis in 2004, and a variation \mathcal{R}_P(\lambda) was introduced by Mackey et al. in 2010. These two pencils have several appealing properties, namely they are always strong linearizations of P(\lambda), they are easy to construct from the coefficients of P(\lambda), the eigenvectors of P(\lambda) can be recovered easily from those of \mathcal{T}_P(\lambda) and \mathcal{R}_P(\lambda), the two pencils are symmetric (resp. Hermitian) when P(\lambda) is, and they preserve the sign characteristic of P(\lambda) when P(\lambda) is Hermitian. In this paper we study the numerical behavior of \mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda) and \mathcal{R}_P(\lambda). We compare the conditioning of a finite, nonzero, simple eigenvalue \delta of P(\lambda), when considered an eigenvalue of P(\lambda) and an eigenvalue of \mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda). We also compare the backward error of an approximate eigenpair (z,\delta) of \mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda) with the backward error of an approximate eigenpair (x,\delta) of P(\lambda), where x was recovered from z in an appropriate way. When the matrix coefficients of P(\lambda) have similar norms and P(\lambda) is scaled so that the largest norm of the matrix coefficients of P(\lambda) is one, we conclude that \mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda) and \mathcal{R}_P(\lambda) have good numerical properties in terms of eigenvalue conditioning and backward error. Moreover, we compare the numerical behavior of \mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda) with that of other well-studied linearizations in the literature, and conclude that \mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda) performs better than these linearizations when P(\lambda) has odd degree and has been scaled.
