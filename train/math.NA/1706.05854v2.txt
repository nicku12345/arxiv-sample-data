We investigate the application of the method of moments approach for the one-dimensional population balance equation. We consider different types of moment closures, namely polynomial (P_N) closures, maximum entropy (M_N) closures and the quadrature method of moments QMOM_N. Realizability issues and implementation details are discussed. The numerical examples range from spatially homogeneous cases to a population balance equation coupled with fluid dynamic equations for a lid-driven cavity test case. A detailed numerical discussion of accuracy, order of the moment method and computational time is given.
