We propose a two-scale finite element method for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation with Dirichlet boundary condition in dimension d\ge2 and prove that it converges to the viscosity solution uniformly. The method is inspired by a finite difference method of Froese and Oberman, but is defined on unstructured grids and relies on two separate scales: the first one is the mesh size h and the second one is a larger scale that controls appropriate directions and substitutes the need of a wide stencil. The main tools for the analysis are a discrete comparison principle and discrete barrier functions that control the behavior of the discrete solution, which is continuous piecewise linear, both close to the boundary and in the interior of the domain.
