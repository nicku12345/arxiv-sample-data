In the semi-discrete version of Monge's problem one tries to find a transport map T with minimum cost from an absolutely continuous measure \mu on \mathbb{R}^d to a discrete measure \nu that is supported on a finite set in \mathbb{R}^d.   The problem is considered for the case of the Euclidean cost function. Existence and uniqueness is shown by an explicit construction which yields a one-to-one mapping between the optimal T and an additively weighted Voronoi partition of \mathbb{R}^d. From the proof an algorithm is derived to compute this partition.
