The main goal of this paper is to generalize Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods for solving non-square linear system. Towards this goal, we present iterative procedures to obtain an approximate solution for non-square linear system. We derive sufficient conditions for the convergence of such iterative methods. Procedure is given to show that how an exact solution can be obtained from these methods. Lastly, an example is considered to compare these methods with other available method(s) for the same.
