In this paper we continue the analysis of the two-scale method for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation for dimension d \geq 2 introduced in [10]. We prove continuous dependence of discrete solutions on data that in turn hinges on a discrete version of the Alexandroff estimate. They are both instrumental to prove pointwise error estimates for classical solutions with H\"older and Sobolev regularity. We also derive convergence rates for viscosity solutions with bounded Hessians which may be piecewise smooth or degenerate.
