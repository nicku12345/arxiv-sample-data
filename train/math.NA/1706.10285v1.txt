In the construction of low-rank matrix approximation and maximum element search it is effective to use maxvol algorithm. Nevertheless, even in the case of rank 1 approximation the algorithm does not always converge to the maximum matrix element, and it is unclear how often close to the maximum element can be found. In this article it is shown that with a certain degree of randomness in the matrix and proper selection of the starting column, the algorithm with high probability in a few steps converges to an element, which module differs little from the maximum. It is also shown that with more severe restrictions on the error matrix no restrictions on the starting column need to be introduced.
