Pointwise error analysis of the linear finite element approximation for -\Delta u + u = f in \Omega, \partial_n u = \tau on \partial\Omega, where \Omega is a bounded smooth domain in \mathbb R^N, is presented. We establish O(h^2|\log h|) and O(h) error bounds in the L^\infty- and W^{1,\infty}-norms respectively, by adopting the technique of regularized Green's functions combined with local H^1- and L^2-estimates in dyadic annuli. Since the computational domain \Omega_h is only polyhedral, one has to take into account non-conformity of the approximation caused by the discrepancy \Omega_h \neq \Omega. In particular, the so-called Galerkin orthogonality relation, utilized three times in the proof, does not exactly hold and involves domain perturbation terms (or boundary-skin terms), which need to be addressed carefully. A numerical example is provided to confirm the theoretical result.
