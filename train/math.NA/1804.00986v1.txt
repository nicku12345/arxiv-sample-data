We extend the conforming virtual element method to the numerical resolution of eigenvalue problems with potential terms on a polytopal mesh. An important application is that of the Schrodinger equation with a pseudopotential term. This model is a fundamental element in the numerical resolution of more complex problems from the Density Functional Theory. The VEM is based on the construction of the discrete bilinear forms of the variational formulation through certain polynomial projection operators that are directly computable from the degrees of freedom. The method shows a great flexibility with respect to the meshes and provide a correct spectral approximation with optimal convergence rates. This point is discussed from both the theoretical and the numerical viewpoint. The performance of the method is numerically investigated by solving the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator problem with the harmonic potential and a singular eigenvalue problem with zero potential for the first eigenvalues.
