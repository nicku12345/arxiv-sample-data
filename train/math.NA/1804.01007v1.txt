In this paper we consider the confluent Heun equation, which is a linear differential equation of second order with three singular points --- two of them are regular and the third one is irregular of rank 1. The purpose of the work is to propose a procedure for numerical evaluation of the equation's solutions (confluent Heun functions). A scheme based on power series, asymptotic expansions and analytic continuation is described. Results of numerical tests are given.
