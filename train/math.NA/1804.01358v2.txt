In this paper, we study the approximate orthogonal diagonalization problem of third order symmetric tensors. We define several classes of approximately diagonal tensors, including the ones corresponding to the stationary points of this problem. We study the relationships between these classes, and other well-known objects, such as tensor Z-eigenvalue and Z-eigenvector. We also prove results on convergence of the cyclic Jacobi (or Jacobi CoM2) algorithm.
