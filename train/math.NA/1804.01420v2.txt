Making use of two different analytical-numerical methods for capacity computation, we obtain matching to a very high precision numerical values for capacities of a wide family of planar condensers. These two methods are based respectively on the use of the Lauricella function and Riemann theta functions. We apply these results to benchmark the performance of numerical algorithms, which are based on adaptive hp--finite element method and boundary integral method.
