This paper is concerned with the inverse time-harmonic elastic scattering problem of recovering unbounded rough surfaces in two dimensions. We assume that elastic plane waves with different directions are incident onto a rigid rough surface in a half plane. The elastic scattered field is measured on a horizontal straight line segment within a finite distance above the rough surface. A direct imaging algorithm is proposed to recover the unbounded rough surface from the scattered near-field data, which involves only inner products between the data. Numerical experiments are presented to show that the inversion scheme is not only efficient but also accurate and robust with respect to noise.
