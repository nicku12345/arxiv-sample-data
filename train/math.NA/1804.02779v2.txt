This paper investigates numerical methods for solving coupled system of nonlinear elliptic problems. We utilize block monotone iterative methods based on Jacobi and Gauss--Seidel methods to solve difference schemes which approximate the coupled system of nonlinear elliptic problems. In the view of upper and lower solutions method, two monotone upper and lower sequences of solutions are constructed, where the monotone property ensures the theorem on existence of solutions to problems with quasimonotone nondecreasing reaction functions. Construction of initial upper and lower solutions is presented. The sequences of solutions generated by the block Gauss--Seidel method converge not slower than by the block Jacobi method.Mohamed
