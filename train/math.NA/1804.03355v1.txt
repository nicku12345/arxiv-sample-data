An implicit Euler--Maruyama method with non-uniform step-size applied to a class of stochastic partial differential equations is studied. A spectral method is used for the spatial discretization and the truncation of the Wiener process. A discrete analogue of maximal L^2-regularity of the scheme and the discretised stochastic convolution is established, which has the same form as their continuous counterpart.
