We prove generalized Gaffney inequalities and the discrete compactness for finite element differential forms on s-regular domains, including general Lipschitz domains. In computational electromagnetism, special cases of these results have been established for edge elements with weakly imposed divergence-free conditions and used in the analysis of nonlinear and eigenvalue problems. In this paper, we generalize these results to discrete differential forms, not necessarily with strongly or weakly imposed constraints. The analysis relies on a new Hodge mapping and its approximation property. As an application, we show L^{p} estimates for several finite element approximations of the scalar and vector Laplacian problems.
