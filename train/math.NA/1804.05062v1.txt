In this paper, we consider the inverse problem of determining the location and the shape of a sound-soft obstacle from the modulus of the far-field data for a single incident plane wave. By adding a reference ball artificially to the inverse scattering system, we propose a system of nonlinear integral equations based iterative scheme to reconstruct both the location and the shape of the obstacle. The reference ball technique causes few extra computational costs, but breaks the translation invariance and brings information about the location of the obstacle. Several validating numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed inversion algorithm.
