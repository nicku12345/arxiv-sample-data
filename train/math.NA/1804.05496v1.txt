This paper is concerned with the inverse scattering problem of time-harmonic elastic waves by an unbounded rigid rough surface. A direct imaging method is developed to reconstruct the unbounded rough surface from the elastic scattered near-field Cauchy data generated by point sources. A Helmholtz-Kirchhoff-type identity is derived and then used to provide a theoretical analysis of the direct imaging algorithm. Numerical experiments are presented to show that the direct imaging algorithm is fast, accurate and robust with respect to noise in the data.
