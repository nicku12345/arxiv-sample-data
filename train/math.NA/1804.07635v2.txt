A class of super-linear stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) with variable delay and Markovian switching is considered. The main aim of this paper is to develop the partially truncated Euler-Maruyama (EM) method for the super-linear SDDEs with variable delay and Markovian switching, and investigate the convergence and stability properties of the numerical solution under the generalized Khasminskii0type condition.
