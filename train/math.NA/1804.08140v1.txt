When 0\lt \rho \lt 1, the Kac-Murdock-Szeg\"o matrix K_n(\rho)=\left[\rho^{\lvert j-k \rvert}\right]_{j,k=1}^n is a Toeplitz correlation matrix with many applications and very well known spectral properties. We study the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of K_n(\rho) for the general case where \rho is complex, pointing out similarities and differences to the case 0\lt \rho \lt 1. We then specialize our results to real \rho with \rho \gt 1, emphasizing the continuity of the eigenvalues as functions of \rho. For \rho \gt 1, we develop simple approximate formulas for the eigenvalues and pinpoint all eigenvalues' locations. Our study starts from a certain polynomial whose zeros are connected to the eigenvalues by elementary formulas. We discuss relations of our results to earlier results of W. F. Trench.
