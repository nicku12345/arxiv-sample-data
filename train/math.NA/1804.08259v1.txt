Recovered finite element methods (R-FEM) have been recently introduced for meshes consisting of simplicial and/or box-type meshes. Here, utilising the flexibility of R-FEM framework, we extend their definition on polygonal and polyhedral meshes in two and three spatial dimensions, respectively. A key attractive feature of this framework is its ability to produce conforming discretizations, yet involving only as many degrees of freedom as discontinuous Galerkin methods over general polygonal/polyhedral meshes with potentially many faces per element. A priori error bounds are shown for general linear, possibly degenerate, second order advection-diffusion-reaction boundary value problems. A series of numerical experiments highlights the good practical performance of the proposed numerical framework.
