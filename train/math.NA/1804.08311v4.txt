We prove that front tracking approximations to entropy solutions of scalar conservation laws with convex fluxes converge at a rate of \Delta x^2 in the 1-Wasserstein distance W_1. Assuming positive initial data, we also show that the approximations converge at a rate of \Delta x in the \infty-Wasserstein distance W_\infty. Moreover, from a simple interpolation inequality between W_1 and W_\infty we obtain convergence rates in all the p-Wasserstein distances: \Delta x^{1+1/p}, p \in [1,\infty].
