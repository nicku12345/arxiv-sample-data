In this paper, we study the long-time near conservation of the total and oscillatory energies for extended RKN (ERKN) integrators when applied to muti-frequency highly oscillatory Hamiltonian systems. We consider one-stage explicit symmetric integrators and show their long-time behaviour of numerical energy conservations by using modulated multi-frequency Fourier expansions. Numerical experiments are carried out and the numerical results demonstrate the remarkable long-time near conservation of the energies for the ERKN integrators and support our theoretical analysis presented in this paper.
