Symplectic integrators can be excellent for Hamiltonian initial value problems. Reasons for this include their preservation of invariant sets like tori, good energy behaviour, nonexistence of attractors, and good behaviour of statistical properties. These all refer to {\em long-time} behaviour. They are directly connected to the dynamical behaviour of symplectic maps \varphi\colon M\to M on the phase space under iteration. Boundary value problems, in contrast, are posed for fixed (and often quite short) times. Symplecticity manifests as a symplectic map \varphi\colon M\to M' which is not iterated. Is there any point, therefore, for a symplectic integrator to be used on a Hamiltonian boundary value problem? In this paper we announce results that symplectic integrators preserve bifurcations of Hamiltonian boundary value problems and that nonsymplectic integrators do not.
