We derive and study a Lax--Friedrichs type finite volume method for a large class of nonlocal continuity equations in multiple dimensions. We prove that the method converges weakly to the measure-valued solution, and converges strongly if the initial data is of bounded variation. Several numerical examples for the kinetic Kuramoto equation are provided, demonstrating that the method works well both for regular and singular data.
