We consider, as a simple model problem, the application of Virtual Element Methods (VEM) to the linear Magnetostatic three-dimensional problem in the formulation of F. Kikuchi. In doing so, we also introduce new serendipity VEM spaces, where the serendipity reduction is made only on the faces of a general polyhedral decomposition (assuming that internal degrees of freedom could be more easily eliminated by static condensation). These new spaces are meant, more generally, for the combined approximation of H^1-conforming (0-forms), H({\rm {\bf curl}})-conforming (1-forms), and H({\rm div})-conforming (2-forms) functional spaces in three dimensions, and they would surely be useful for other problems and in more general contexts.
