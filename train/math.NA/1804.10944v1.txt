We propose some numerical schemes for forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) based on a new fundamental concept of transposition solutions. These schemes exploit time-splitting methods for the variation of constants formula of the associated partial differential equations and a discrete representation of the transition semigroups. The convergence of the schemes is established for FBSDEs with uniformly Lipschitz drivers, locally Lipschitz and maximal monotone drivers. Numerical experiments are presented for several nonlinear financial derivative pricing problems to demonstrate the adaptivity and effectiveness of the new schemes. The ideas here can be applied to construct high-order schemes for FBSDEs with general Markov forward processes.
