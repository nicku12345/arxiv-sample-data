We present a numerical method for solving the free-space Maxwell's equations in three dimensions using compact convolution kernels on a rectangular grid. We first rewrite Maxwell's Equations as a system of wave equations with auxiliary variables and discretize its solution from the method of spherical means. The algorithm has been extended to be used on a locally-refined nested hierarchy of rectangular grids.
