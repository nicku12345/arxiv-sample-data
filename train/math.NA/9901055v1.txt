The possibility of interaction between Maple and numeric compiled languages in performing extensive numeric calculations is exemplified by the Ndynamics package, a tool for studying the (chaotic) behavior of dynamical systems. Programming hints concerning the construction of Ndynamics are presented. The system command, together with the application of the black-box concept, is used to implement a powerful cooperation between Maple code and some other numeric language code.
