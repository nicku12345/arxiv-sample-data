Trigonometric polynomials are widely used for the approximation of a smooth function f from a set of nonuniformly spaced samples \{f(x_j)\}_{j=0}^{N-1}. If the samples are perturbed by noise, controlling the smoothness of the trigonometric approximation becomes an essential issue to avoid overfitting and underfitting of the data. Using the polynomial degree as regularization parameter we derive a multi-level algorithm that iteratively adapts to the least squares solution of optimal smoothness. The proposed algorithm computes the solution in at most \cal{O}(NM + M^2) operations (M being the polynomial degree of the approximation) by solving a family of nested Toeplitz systems. It is shown how the presented method can be extended to multivariate trigonometric approximation. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by applying it in echocardiography to the recovery of the boundary of the Left Ventricle.
