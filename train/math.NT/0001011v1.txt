We discuss computation of the special values of partial zeta functions associated to totally real number fields. The main tool is the \emph{Eisenstein cocycle} \Psi , a group cocycle for GL_{n} (\Z ); the special values are computed as periods of \Psi , and are expressed in terms of generalized Dedekind sums. We conclude with some numerical examples for cubic and quartic fields of small discriminant.
