For each positive integer n it is shown how to construct a finite collection of multivariable polynomials \{F_{i}:=F_{i}(t,X_{1},..., X_{\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor})\} such that each positive integer whose squareroot has a continued fraction expansion with period n+1 lies in the range of exactly one of these polynomials. Moreover, each of these polynomials satisfy a polynomial Pell's equation C_{i}^{2} -F_{i}H_{i}^{2} = (-1)^{n-1} (where C_{i} and H_{i} are polynomials in the variables t,X_{1},..., X_{\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor}) and the fundamental solution can be written down. Likewise, if all the X_{i}'s and t are non-negative then the continued fraction expansion of \sqrt{F_{i}} can be written down. Furthermore, the congruence class modulo 4 of F_{i} depends in a simple way on the variables t,X_{1},..., X_{\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor} so that the fundamental unit can be written down for a large class of real quadratic fields. Along the way a complete solution is given to the problem of determining for which symmetric strings of positive integers a_{1},..., a_{n} do there exist positive integers D and a_{0} such that \sqrt{D} = [ a_{0};\bar{a_{1}, >..., a_{n},2a_{0}}].
