The theory of continued fractions of functions  \sqrt D  is used to give lower bound for class numbers h(D) of general real quadratic function fields K=k(\sqrt D) over k={\bf F}_q(T). For five series of real quadratic function fields K, the bounds of h(D) are given more explicitly, e.g., if  D=F^2+c, \mbox{}\hspace{0.1cm} then  h(D)\geq {deg}F /{deg} P; \hspace{0.1cm} if D=(SG)^2+cS,  then  h(D)\geq {deg}S / {deg} P;  if D=(A^m+a)^2+A,  then  h(D)\geq {deg}A / {deg} P,  where P is irreducible polynomial splitting in K, c\in {\bf F}_q is any constant. In addition, six types of quadratic function fields are found to have ideal class numbers bounded and bigger than one.   {\bf keywords:} quadratic function field, ideal class number, continued fractions of functions
