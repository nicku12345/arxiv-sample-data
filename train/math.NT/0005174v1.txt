A new recursive procedure of the calculation of partition numbers function W(s,{\bf d}^m) is suggested. We find its zeroes and prove a lemma on the function parity properties. The explicit formulas of W(s,{\bf d}^m) and their periods \tau(G) for the irreducible Coxeter groups and a list for the first ten symmetric group {\cal S}_m are presented. A {\it least common multiple} {\cal L}(m) of the series of the natural numbers 1,2,..,m plays a role of the period \tau({\cal S}_m) of W(s,{\bf d}^m) in {\cal S}_m. An asymptotic behaviour of {\cal L}(m) with m \to \infty is found.
