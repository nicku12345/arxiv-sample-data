We develop a partial trace formula which circumvents some technical difficulties in computing the Selberg trace formula for the quotient SL_3({\Z})\backslash SL_3({\R})/SO_3({\R}). As applications, we establish the Weyl asymptotic law for the discrete Laplace spectrum and prove that almost all of its cusp forms are tempered at infinity. The technique shows there are non-lifted cusp forms on SL_3({\Z})\backslash SL_3({\R})/SO_3({\R}) as well as non-self-dual ones. A self-contained description of our proof for SL_2({\Z})\backslash \U is included to convey the main new ideas. Heavy use is made of truncation and the Maass-Selberg relations.
