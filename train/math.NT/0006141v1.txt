Let f be an indefinite ternary quadratic form, and let q be an integer such that -q det(f) is not a square. Let N(T,f,q) denote the number of integral solutions of the equation f(x)=q where x lies in the ball of radius T centered at the origin. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of N(T,f,q) as T tends to infinity.   We deduce from the results of our joint paper with Z. Rudnick that N(T,f,q) grows like cE(T,f,q) as T tends to infinity, where E(T,f,q) is the Hardy-Littlewood expectation (the product of local densities) and 0 \le c \le 2. We give examples of f and q such that c takes the values 0, 1, 2.
