This paper is devoted to the study of the \ell-adic representations of the absolute Galois group G of {\mathbb Q}_p, p\geq 5, associated to an elliptic curve over {\mathbb Q}_p, as \ell runs through the set of all prime numbers (including \ell =p, in which case we use the theory of potentially semi-stable p-adic representations). For each prime \ell, we give the complete list of isomorphism classes of {\mathbb Q}_{\ell}[G]-modules coming from an elliptic curve over {\mathbb Q}_p, that is, those which are isomorphic to the Tate module of an elliptic curve over {\mathbb Q}_p. The \ell =p case is the more delicate. It requires studying the liftings of a given elliptic curve over {\mathbb F}_p to an elliptic scheme over the ring of integers of a totally ramified finite extension of {\mathbb Q}_p, and combining it with a descent theorem providing a Galois criterion for an elliptic curve having good reduction over a p-adic field to be defined over a closed subfield. This enables us to state necessary and sufficient conditions for an \ell-adic representation of G to come from an elliptic curve over {\mathbb Q}_p, for each prime \ell.
