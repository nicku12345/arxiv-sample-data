Let \{b(n):n\in\N\} be the sequence of coefficients in the Taylor expansion of a rational function R(X)\in\Q(X) and suppose that b(n) is a perfect d^{\rm th} power for all large n. A conjecture of Pisot states that one can choose a d^{\rm th} root a(n) of b(n) such that \sum a(n)X^n is also a rational function. Actually, this is the fundamental case of an analogous statement formulated for fields more general than \Q. A number of papers have been devoted to various special cases. In this note we shall completely settle the general case.
