It has been well-observed that an inequality of the type \pi(x;q,a) > \pi(x;q,b) is more likely to hold if a is a non-square modulo q and b is a square modulo q (the so-called ``Chebyshev Bias''). For instance, each of \pi(x;8,3), \pi(x;8,5), and \pi(x;8,7) tends to be somewhat larger than \pi(x;8,1). However, it has come to light that the tendencies of these three \pi(x;8,a) to dominate \pi(x;8,1) have different strengths. A related phenomenon is that the six possible inequalities of the form \pi(x;8,a_1) > \pi(x;8,a_2) > \pi(x;8,a_3) with \{a_1,a_2,a_3\}=\{3,5,7\} are not all equally likely---some orderings are preferred over others. In this paper we discuss these phenomena, focusing on the moduli q=8 and q=12, and we explain why the observed asymmetries (as opposed to other possible asymmetries) occur.
