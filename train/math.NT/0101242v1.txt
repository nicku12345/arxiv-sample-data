Let f be a complex valued function on a finite field F such that f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, and |f(x)| = 1 for x \neq 0. Cohn asked if it follows that f is a nontrivial multiplicative character provided that \sum_{x \in F} f(x) \bar{f(x+h)} = -1 for h \neq 0. We prove that this is the case for finite fields of prime cardinality under the assumption that the nonzero values of f are roots of unity.
