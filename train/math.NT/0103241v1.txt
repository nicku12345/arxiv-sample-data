We say that a group is {\em almost abelian} if every commutator is central and squares to the identity. Now let G be the Galois group of the algebraic closure of the field \QQ of rational numbers in the field of complex numbers. Let G^{\ab+\epsilon} be the quotient of G universal for homomorphisms to almost abelian profinite groups and let \QQ^{\ab+\epsilon}/\QQ be the corresponding Galois extension. We prove that \QQ^{\ab+\epsilon} is generated by the roots of unity, the fourth roots of the (rational) prime numbers and the square roots of certain sine-monomials. The inspiration for the paper came from recent studies of algebraic \Gamma-monomials by P.~Das and by S.~Seo.   This paper has appeared as Duke Math. J. 114 (2002) 439-475.
