L-series attached to two classical families of elliptic curves with complex multiplications are studied over number fields, formulae for their special values at s=1,  bound of the values, and criterion of reaching the bound are given. Let  E_1: y^{2}=x^{3}-D_1 x  be elliptic curves over the Gaussian field K=\Q(\sqrt{-1}),  with  D_1 =\pi_{1} ... \pi_{n}  or  D_1 =\pi_{1} ^{2}... \pi_{r} ^{2} \pi_{r+1} ... \pi_{n}, where \pi_{1}, ..., \pi_{n} are distinct primes in K. A formula for special values of Hecke L-series attached to such curves expressed by Weierstrass \wp-function are given; a lower bound of 2-adic valuations of these values of Hecke L-series as well as a criterion for reaching these bounds are obtained. Furthermore, let  E_{2}: y^{2}=x^{3}-2^{4}3^{3}D_2^{2}  be elliptic curves over the quadratic field  \Q(\sqrt{-3})  with  D_2 =\pi_{1} ... \pi_{n},  where \pi_{1}, ..., \pi_{n} are distinct primes of \Q(\sqrt{-3}), similar results as above but for 3-adic valuation are also obtained. These results are consistent with the predictions of the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, and develop some results in recent literature for more special case and for 2-adic valuation.
