The computer data up to 2^{44}\approx 1.76\times 10^{13} on the gaps between consecutive twins is presented. The simple derivation of the heuristic formula describing computer results contained in the recent papers by P.F.Kelly and T.Pilling \cite{Kelly1}, \cite{Kelly2} is provided and compared with the ``experimental'' values.
