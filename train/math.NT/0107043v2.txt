Let the continued fraction expansion of any irrational number t \in (0,1) be denoted by [0,a_{1}(t),a_{2}(t),...] and let the i-th convergent of this continued fraction expansion be denoted by c_{i}(t)/d_{i}(t). Let \[ S=\{t \in (0,1): a_{i+1}(t) \geq \phi^{d_{i}(t)} \text{infinitely often}\}, \] where \phi = (\sqrt{5}+1)/2. Let Y_{S} =\{\exp(2 \pi i t): t \in S \}. It is shown that if y \in Y_{S} then the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction, R(y), diverges at y. S is an uncountable set of measure zero. It is also shown that there is an uncountable set of points, G \subset Y_{S}, such that if y \in G, then R(y) does not converge generally.   It is further shown that R(y) does not converge generally for |y| > 1 and that R(y) does converge generally if y is a primitive 5m-th root of unity, some m \in \mathbb{N}.
