We review the main conjecture for an elliptic curve on \Q having good supersingular reduction at p and give some consequences of it. Then we define the notion of \lambda-invariant and of \mu- invariant in this situation, generalizing a work of Kurihara and deduce from it the behaviour of the order of the group of Shafarevich-Tate along the cyclotomique \Z_p-extension. By examples, we give some arguments which, by allying theorems and numeral calculations, allow to calculate the order of the p-primary part of the group of Shafarevich-Tate in not yet known cases (non trivial Shafarevich-Tate group, curves of rank greater than  1).
