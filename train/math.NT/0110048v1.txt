Let F denote an unramified extension of the cyclotomic extension of Q_p by (p^n)th roots of unity, for an odd prime p. We determine the conductors of those Kummer extensions of F of degree dividing p^n which are Galois over the maximal unramified subfield of F. This follows from a comparison of the Galois module structure of the multiplicative group of F with the unit filtration of F.
