This paper develops an analytic theory of Dirichlet series in several complex variables which possess sufficiently many functional equations. In the first two sections it is shown how straightforward conjectures about the meromorphic continuation and polar divisors of certain such series imply, as a consequence, precise asymptotics (previously conjectured via random matrix theory) for moments of zeta functions and quadratic L-series. As an application of the theory, in a third section, we obtain the current best known error term for mean values of cubes of central values of Dirichlet L-series. The methods utilized to derive this result are the convexity principle for functions of several complex variables combined with a knowledge of groups of functional equations for certain multiple Dirichlet series.
