Let p be a prime number, and G a compact p-adic Lie group. We recall that the Iwasawa algebra \Lambda(G) is defined to be the completed group ring of G over the ring of p-adic integers. Interesting examples of finitely generated modules over \Lambda(G), in which G is the image of Galois in the automorphism group of a p-adic Galois representation, abound in arithmetic geometry. The study of such \Lambda(G)-modules arising from arithmetic geometry can be thought of as a natural generalization of Iwasawa theory. One of the cornerstones of classical Iwasawa theory is the fact that, when G is the additive group of p-adic integers, a good structure theory for finitely generated \Lambda(G)-modules is known, up to pseudo-isomorphism. The aim of the present paper is to extend as much as possible of this commutative structure theory to the non-commuta tive case.
