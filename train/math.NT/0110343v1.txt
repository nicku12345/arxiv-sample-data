The p-group generation algorithm from computational group theory is used to obtain information about large quotients of the pro-2 group G = \text{Gal} (k^{nr,2}/k) for k = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d}) with d = -445, -1015, -1595, -2379. In each case we are able to narrow the identity of G down to one of a finite number of explicitly given finite groups. From this follow several results regarding the corresponding 2-class tower.   This is a revised version of ANT-0302.
