The {\em abeliant} is a polynomial rule for producing an n by n matrix with entries in a given ring from an n by n by n+2 array of elements of that ring. The theory of abeliants, first introduced in an earlier paper of the author, is redeveloped here in a simpler way. Then this theory is exploited to give an explicit elementary construction of the Jacobian of a nonsingular projective algebraic curve defined over an algebraically closed field. The standard of usefulness and aptness we strive toward is that set by Mumford's elementary construction of the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve.
