Towards the end of his life Ramanujan wrote a manuscript on properties of the partition and tau functions, some parts of which remained unpublished until very recently. Nevertheless, this manuscript gave rise to a lot of subsequent work. In it Ramanujan considers congruences for \tau(n) modulo some special primes q. He proves for example that \tau(n)\equiv \sum_{d|n}d^{11}({\rm mod}691). He defines t_n=1 if \tau(n) is not divisible by q and t_n=0 otherwise. He then typically writes: "It can be shown by transcendental methods that  \sum_{k=1}^n t_k=C\int_1^n {dx\over (\log x)^{\delta}}+O({n\over (\log n)^r}).  where r is any positive number" (after stating some weaker estimates for the above sum). The number \delta is a positve rational number depending on q and for the positive number C Ramanujan usually wrote down an Euler product.   In this paper it is shown that Ramanujan's claim for every r>1+\delta and each of the special primes q is false. Furthermore, we correct a 1928 paper of Geraldine Stanley who claimed to have disproved Ramanujan's claim in case q=5.
