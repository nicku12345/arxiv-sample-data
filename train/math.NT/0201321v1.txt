We split the program of explicit descent of elliptic curves into two parts. For n=3 and n=5, we first display a model for the universal elliptic curve E with full level n structure and describe the map of rational points of E to the cohomology group H^1(G, E[n]). Second, we find models in \PP^{n-1} of principal homogeneous spaces of E corresponding to all possible elements of H^1(G, E[n]), i.e. for those elements with trivial period-index obstruction. For this we use the relationship established in \cite{me2} between the period-index obstruction and the norm symbol, a generalization of the Hilbert symbol.
