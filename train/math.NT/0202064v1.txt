The problem we consider is to define families of n-dimensional integrals, endowed with group actions as in Rhin-Viola's work on irrationality measures of \zeta(2) and \zeta(3), the values of which are linear forms, over the rationals, in multiple zeta values of weight at most n. We generalize Vasilyev's and Sorokin's approaches, and give a change of variables that connects them to each other. We describe a group structure for a n-dimensional integral that specializes, for n=2 and n=3, to the ones obtained by Rhin and Viola.
