Let \rho(x)=x-[x], \chi=\chi_{(0,1)}. In L_2(0,\infty) consider the subspace \B generated by \{\rho_a | a \geq 1\} where \rho_a(x):=\rho(\frac{1}{ax}). By the Nyman-Beurling criterion the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement \chi\in\bar{\B}. For some time it has been conjectured, and proved in this paper, that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the stronger statement that \chi\in\bar{\Bnat} where \Bnat is the much smaller subspace generated by \{\rho_a | a\in\Nat\}.
