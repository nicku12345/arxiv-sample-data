Let k be a function field of one variable over a finite field with the characteristic not equal to two. In this paper, we consider the prehomogeneous representation of the space of binary quadratic forms over k. We have two main results. The first result is on the principal part of the global zeta function associated with the prehomogeneous vector space. The second result is on a mean value theorem for degree zero divisor class groups of quadratic extensions over k, which is a consequence of the first one.
