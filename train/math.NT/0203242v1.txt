In two previous papers we used the geometry of complete polyhedral fans to construct a subring \TTT (l) of the modular forms on \Gamma_{1} (l), and showed that for weight two the cuspidal part of \TTT (l) coincides with the space of cusp forms of analytic rank zero. In this paper we show that in weights greater than two, the cuspidal part of \TTT (l) coincides with the space of all cusp forms.
