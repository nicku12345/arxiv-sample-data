B. Mazur has considered the question of density in the Euclidean topology of the set of {\Bbb Q}-rational points on a variety X defined over {\Bbb Q}, in particular for Abelian varieties. In this paper we consider the question of closures of the image of finitely generated subgroups of T({\Bbb Q}) in \Gamma \backslash T({\Bbb R}) where T is a torus defined over {\Bbb Q}, \Gamma an arithmetic subgroup such that \Gamma \backslash T({\Bbb R}) is compact. Assuming Schanuel's conjecture, we prove that the closures correspond to sub {\it algebraic} tori of T.
