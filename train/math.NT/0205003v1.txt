Let \rho(x)=x-[x], \chi=\chi_{(0,1)}. In L_2(0,\infty) consider the subspace \B generated by \{\rho_a|a\geq1\} where \rho_a(x):=\rho(\frac{1}{ax}). By the Nyman-Beurling criterion the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement \chi\in\bar{\B}. For some time it has been conjectured, and proved in the first version of this paper, posted in arXiv:math.NT/0202141 v2, that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the stronger statement that \chi\in\bar{\Bnat} where \Bnat is the much smaller subspace generated by \{\rho_a|a\in\Nat\}. This second version differs from the first in showing that under the Riemann hypothesis for some constant c>0 the distance between \chi and -\sum_{a=1}^n\mu(a)e^{-c\frac{\log a}{\log\log n}}\rho_a is of order (\log\log n)^{-1/3}.
