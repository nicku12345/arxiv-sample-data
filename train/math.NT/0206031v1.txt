In this paper we investigate the distribution of values of L(1,chi) as chi ranges over primitive real characters. In particular we focus on the extent to which this distribution may be approximated by "random Euler products." Our work also establishes a recent conjecture of Montgomery and Vaughan on the frequency of large (or small) values of L(1,chi).
