Let A be a semistable abelian variety defined over {\bf Q} with bad reduction only at one prime p. Let L= {\bf Q}(A[\ell]) be the \ell-division field of A for a prime \ell not equal to p and let F={\bf Q}(\mu_\ell) be the cyclotomic field generated by the group of \ell^{th}-roots of unity. We study the varieties A for which H={\rm Gal(L/F)} is "small" in the sense that H is an \ell-group or, more generally, that H is nilpotent.   We show that if \ell=2 or 3 and H is nilpotent then the reduction of A at p is totally toroidal, so its conductor is p^{\dim A}. The Jacobian of the modular curve X_0(41) is a simple semistable abelian variety of dimension 3, with bad reduction only at p=41 and the Galois group of its 2-division field is a 2-group.   For \ell=2, 3 or 5, there exist elliptic curves E of prime conductor such that {\bf Q}(E[\ell]) = {\bf Q}(\mu_{2 \ell}). We characterize the abelian varieties that are isogenous to products E^d.
