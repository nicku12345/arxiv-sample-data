We generalize a theorem of Tate and show that the second cohomology of the Weil group of a global or local field with coefficients in \C^* (or more generally, with coefficients in the complex points of a tori over \C) vanish, where the cohomology groups are defined using measurable cochains in the sense of Moore. We recover a theorem of Labesse proving that admissible homomorphisms of a Weil group to the Langlands dual of a reductive group can be lifted to an extension of the Langlands dual group by a tori.
