let U_z be the universal norm distribution and M a fixed power of prime p, by using the double complex method employed by Anderson, we study the universal Kolyvagin recursion occurred in the canonical basis in the zero-th cohomology group of U_z/M U_z. We furthermore show that the universal Kolyvagin recursion implies the Kolyvagin recursion in the theory of Euler systems(cf. Theorem 4.5.4 of K. Rubin's book Euler systems). One certainly hopes this could lead a new way to find new Euler systems.
