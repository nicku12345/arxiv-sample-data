Let -D < -4 denote a fundamental discriminant which is either odd or divisible by 8, so that the canonical Hecke character of \Bbb Q(\sqrt{-D}) exists. Let d be a fundamental discriminant prime to D. Let 2k-1 be an odd natural integer prime to the class number of \Bbb Q(\sqrt{-D}). Let \chi be the twist of the (2k-1)th power of a canonical Hecke character of \Bbb Q(\sqrt{-D}) by the Kronecker's symbol n\mapsto(\frac{d}{n}). It is proved that the order of the Hecke L-function L(s,\chi) at its central point s=k is determined by its root number when |d| \leq c(\epsilon)D^{{1/24}-\epsilon} or, when |d| \leq c(\epsilon)D^{\frac1{12} -\epsilon} and k\geq 2, where \epsilon > 0 and c(\epsilon) is a constant depending only on \epsilon.
