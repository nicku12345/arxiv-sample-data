We prove a reciprocity law for one-dimensional compatible systems of mod p representations of absolute Galois groups of number fields. We prove that these arise from Hecke characters, and in particular recover by purely algebraic means the classical result (that is usually proven using deep results of Waldschmidt in transcendental number theory) that one-dimensional compatible p-adic systems arise from Hecke characters.
