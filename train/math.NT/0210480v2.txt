A one-to-one continuous function from a triangle to itself is defined that has both interesting number theoretic and analytic properties. This function is shown to be a natural generalization of the classical Minkowski ?(x) function. It is shown there exists a natural class of pairs of cubic irrational numbers in the same cubic number field that are mapped to pairs of rational numbers, in analog to ?(x) mapping quadratic irrationals on the unit interval to rational numbers on the unit interval. It is also shown that this new function satisfies an analog to the fact that ?(x), while increasing and continuous, has derivative zero almost everywhere.
