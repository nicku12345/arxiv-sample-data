{Let K be a number field, and A_1,A_2 abelian varieties over K. Let P (resp. Q) be a non-torsion point in  A_1(K) (resp. A_2(K)) such that for almost all places v of K, the order of Q mod v divides the order of P mod v. Then we prove (under some conditions on A_i, i=1,2) that there is a homomorphism j from A_1 to A_2 such that j(P) = Q. We formulate and extend such a result for any subgroups of A_i(K), i=1,2. These results in particular extend the work of Corrales and Schoof from elliptic curves to abelian varieties.
