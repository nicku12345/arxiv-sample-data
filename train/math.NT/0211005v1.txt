We give a different approach to the well-known modularity lifting results of Wiles and Taylor. Instead of Taylor-Wiles systems we use a Galois cohomological discovery of R. Ramakrishna. This paper is 2 years older than math.NT/0210296 where another approach to modularity lifting results was presented.
