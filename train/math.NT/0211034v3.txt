In Wilson's Theorem the primality of a number hinges on a congruence. We present a similar test where the primality of a number m hinges, instead, on the indivisibility of 4(m-5)! by m. One implication of this theorem is a necessary and sufficient condition for two numbers to be twin primes, a result reminiscent of Clement's theorem but involving indivisibility. MSC: 11A41 and 11A51.
