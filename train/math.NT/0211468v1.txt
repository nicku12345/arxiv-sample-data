Let K_{m}=\Bbb{Q}(\zeta_{m}) where \zeta_{m} is a primitive mth root of unity. Let p>2 be prime and let C_{p} denote the group of order p. The ring of algebraic integers of K_{m} is \Cal{O}_{m}=\Bbb{Z}[\zeta_{m}]. Let \Lambda_{m,p} denote the order \Cal{O}_{m}[C_{p}] in the algebra K_{m}[C_{p}]. Consider the kernel group D(\Lambda_{m,p}) and the Swan subgroup T(\Lambda_{m,p}). If (p,m)=1 these two subgroups of the class group coincide. Restricting to when there is a rational prime p that is prime in \Cal{O}_{m} requires m=4 or q^{n} where q>2 is prime. For each such m, 3 \leq m \leq 100, we give such a prime, and show that one may compute T(\Lambda_{m,p}) as a quotient of the group of units of a finite field. When h_{mp}^{+}=1 we give exact values for |T(\Lambda_{m,p})|, and for other cases we provide an upper bound. We explore the Galois module theoretic implications of these results.
