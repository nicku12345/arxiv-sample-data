We establish a criterion for a complex number to be algebraic over Q of degree at most two. It requires that, for any sufficiently large real number X, there exists a non-zero polynomial with integral coefficients, of degree at most two and height at most X, whose absolute value at that complex number is at most (1/4)X^{-(3+sqrt{5})/2}. We show that the exponent (3+sqrt{5})/2 in this condition is optimal, and deduce from this criterion a result of simultaneous approximation of a real number by conjugate algebraic numbers.
