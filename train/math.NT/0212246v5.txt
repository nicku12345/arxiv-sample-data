Differentiable real function reproducing primes up to a given number and having a differentiable inverse function is constructed. This inverse function is compared with the Riemann-Von Mangoldt exact expression for the number of primes not exceeding a given value. Software for computation of the direct and inverse functions and their derivatives is developed. Examples of approximate solution of Diophantine equations on the primes are given.
