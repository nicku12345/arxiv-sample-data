In this note we study the symmetric powers of strongly modular icosahedral representations \rho of {\rm Gal} (\bar{F}/F), F a number field, and their twisted L--functions. We prove that for such \rho, there exists a cuspidal automorphic representation \Pi = \Pi_{\infty} \otimes \Pi_{f} of GL_{6} (\mathbb{A}_{F}) such that L (s, {\rm sym}^{5} (\rho)) = L (s, \Pi_{f}). One sees that {\rm sym}^{5} (\rho) is twist equivalent to \rho' \otimes {\rm sym}^{2} (\rho) for another modular icosahedral representation \rho', and our theorem is a special case of a cuspidality criterion formulated and proved in this paper, which may be of independent interest, for the Kim--Shahidi automorphic tensor product \pi \boxtimes {\rm sym}^{2} (\pi'), where \pi and \pi' are cuspidal automorphic representations of GL (2) / F. We also give a complete structure theory of modular icosahedral representations. As a result, we prove that L (s, {\rm sym}^{m} (\rho) \otimes \chi) does not admit any Landau--Siegel zero when it is not divisible by L--functions of quadratic characters. In general, there is no such divisibility and and there are no Landau--Siegel zeros for such L--functions.
