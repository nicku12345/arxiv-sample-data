Let \tau be the primitive Dirichlet character of conductor 4, let \chi be the primitive even Dirichlet character of conductor 8 and let k be an integer. Then the U_2 operator acting on cuspidal overconvergent modular forms of weight 2k+1 and character \tau has slopes in the arithmetic progression {2,4,...,2n,...}, and the U_2 operator acting on cuspidal overconvergent modular forms of weight k and character \chi \cdot \tau^k has slopes in the arithmetic progression {1,2,...,n,...}.   We then show that the characteristic polynomials of the Hecke operators U_2 and T_p acting on the space of classical cusp forms of weight k and character either \tau or \chi\cdot\tau^k split completely over \qtwo.
