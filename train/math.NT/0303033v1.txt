Let M be a manifold, and G a Lie group which satisfies the unique extension property. An (M,G) manifold N is a manifold endowed with an atlas (U_i,f_i) where f_i is a diffeomorphism between U_i and an open set of M such that the coordinates change defined by this atlas are restriction of elements of G. We define the notion of geometric structures for toposes, and apply it to fields theory. We also interpret the Beyli theorem in this setting.
