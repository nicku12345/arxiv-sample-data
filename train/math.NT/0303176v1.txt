Using the representation of numbers, the methods of decreasing the number of calculation steps for Pell's equation are developed. The formulae relating the natural solution x0 of Pell's equation for A0 with the infinite number of minimal natural solutions xi for other Ai are obtained for various cases. The parametric representation of Pell's equation solutions are obtained with the help of new "method of hidden parameters".
