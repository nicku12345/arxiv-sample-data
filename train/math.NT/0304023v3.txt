The proof by Ullmo and Zhang of Bogomolov's conjecture about points of small height in abelian varieties made a crucial use of an equidistribution property for ``small points'' in the associated complex abelian variety.   We study the analogous equidistribution property at p-adic places. Our results can be conveniently stated within the framework of the analytic spaces defined by Berkovich. The first one is valid in any dimension but is restricted to ``algebraic metrics'', the second one is valid for curves, but allows for more general metrics, in particular to the normalized heights with respect to dynamical systems.
