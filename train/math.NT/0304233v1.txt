Spencer Bloch and the author formulated a general conjecture (Tamagawa number conjecture) on the relation between values of zeta functions of motives and arithmetic groups associated to motives. We discuss this conjecture, and describe some application of the philosophy of the conjecture to the study of elliptic curves.
