In this paper we prove two results. The first theorem uses a paper of Kim \cite{K} to show that for fixed primes p_1,...,p_k, and for fixed integers m_1,...,m_k, with p_i\not|m_i, the numbers (e_{p_1}(n),...,e_{p_k}(n)) are uniformly distributed modulo (m_1,...,m_k), where e_p(n) is the order of the prime p in the factorization of n!. That implies one of Sander's conjecture from \cite{S}, for any set of odd primes. Berend \cite{B} asks to find the fastest growing function f(x) so that for large x and any given finite sequence \epsilon_i\in \{0,1\}, i\le f(x), there exists n<x such that the congruences e_{p_i}(n)\equiv \epsilon_i\pmod 2 hold for all i\le f(x). Here, p_i is the ith prime number.   In our second result, we are able to show that f(x) can be taken to be at least c_1 (\log x/(\log\log x)^6)^{1/9}, with some absolute constant c_1, provided that only the first odd prime numbers are involved.
