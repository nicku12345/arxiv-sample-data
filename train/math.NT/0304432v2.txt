We prove the following uniformity principle: if one of the Galois representations in the family attached to a genus two Siegel cusp form of weight k>3, "semistable" and with multiplicity one, is reducible (for an odd prime p),then all the representations in the family are reducible. This, combined with Serre's conjecture (which is now a theorem) gives a proof of the Endoscopy Conjecture.
