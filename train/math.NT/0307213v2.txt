We compute integral moments of partial sums of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line and obtain an expression for the leading coefficient as a product of the standard arithmetic factor and a geometric factor. The geometric factor is equal to the volume of the convex polytope of substochastic matrices and is equal to the leading coefficient in the expression for moments of truncated characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix.
