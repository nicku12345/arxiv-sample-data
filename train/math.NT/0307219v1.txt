Let p > 2 be a prime, let n > m > 0. Let pi_n be the norm of zeta_{p^n} - 1 under C_{p-1}, so that Z_(p)[pi_n] | Z_(p) is a purely ramified extension of discrete valuation rings of degree p^{n-1}. The minimal polynomial of pi_n over Q(pi_m) is an Eisenstein polynomial; we give lower bounds for its coefficient valuations at pi_m. The function field analogue, as introduced by Carlitz and Hayes, is studied as well.
