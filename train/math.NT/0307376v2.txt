Let \underline{\mathcal F} be a \tau-sheaf. Building on previous work of Drinfeld, Anderson, Taguchi, and Wan, B\"ockle and Pink \cite{bp1} develop a cohomology theory for \underline{\mathcal F}. In \cite{boc1} B\"ockle uses this theory to establish the analytic continuation of the L-series associated to \underline{\mathcal F} (which is a characteristic p valued ``Dirichlet series'') {\em and} the logarithmic growth of the degrees of its special polynomials. In this paper we shall show that this logarithmic growth is all that is needed to analytically continue the original L-series as well as {\em all} associated partial L-series. Moreover, we show that the degrees of the special polynomials attached to the partial L-series also grow logarithmically. Our tools are B\"ockle's original results, non-Archimedean integration, and the very strong estimates of Y. Amice \cite{am1}. Along the way, we define certain natural modules associated with non-Archimedean measures (in the characteristic 0 case as well as in characteristic p).
