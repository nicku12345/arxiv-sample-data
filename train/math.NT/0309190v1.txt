We establish a connection between the coefficients of Artin-Mazur zeta-functions and Kummer congruences. This allows to settle positively the question of the existence of a map T such that the number of fixed points of the n-th iterate of T is equal to the absolute value of the 2n-th Euler number. Also we solve a problem of Gabcke related to the coefficients of Riemann-Siegel formula.
