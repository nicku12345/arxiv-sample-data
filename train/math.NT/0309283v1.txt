In this paper we show that two dimensional (mod p) Galois representations satisfying mild hypotheses can be lifted to p-adic Galois representations ramified at infinitely many primes such that the characteristic polynomials of Frobenius at a density one set of unramified primes are defined over the rational integers. In particular we show that often one can "density one compatibly" lift mod p and mod q Galois representations.
