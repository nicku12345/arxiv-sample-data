Let r : G_Q -> GL_n Q_l be a motivic l-adic Galois representation. For fixed m > 1 we initiate an investigation of the density of the set of primes p such that the trace of the image of an arithmetic Frobenius at p under r is an m^th power residue modulo p. Based on numerical investigations with modular forms we conjecture (with Ramakrishna) that this density equals 1/m whenever the image of r is open. We further conjecture that for such r the set of these primes p is independent of any set defined by Cebatorev-style Galois theoretic conditions (in an appropriate sense). We then compute these densities for certain m in the complementary case of modular forms of CM-type with rational Fourier coefficients; our proofs are a combination of the Cebatorev density theorem (which does apply in the CM case) and reciprocity laws applied to Hecke characters. We also discuss a potential application (suggested by Ramakrishna) to computing inertial degrees at p in abelian extensions of imaginary quadratic fields unramified away from p.
