We consider a multiple arithmetical sum involving the Moebius function which despite its elementary appearance is in fact of a highly intriguing nature. We establish an asymptotic formula for the quadruple case that raises the first genuinely non-trivial situation. This is a rework of an old unpublished note of ours.
