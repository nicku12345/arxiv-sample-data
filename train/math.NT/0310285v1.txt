Euler--Maclaurin and Poisson analogues of the summations \sum_{a < n \leq b} \chi(n) f(n), \sum_{a < n \leq b} d(n) f(n), \sum_{a < n \leq b} d(n) \chi (n) f(n) have been obtained in a unified manner, where (\chi (n)) is a periodic complex sequence; d(n) is the divisor function and f(x) is a sufficiently smooth function on [a,b]. We also state a generalised Abel's summation formula, generalised Euler's summation formula and Euler's summation formula in several variables.
