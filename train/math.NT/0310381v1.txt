Let the summatory function of the M\"{o}bius function be denoted M(x). We deduce in this article conditional results concerning M(x) assuming the Riemann Hypothesis and a conjecture of Gonek and Hejhal on the negative moments of the Riemann zeta function. The main results shown are that the weak Mertens conjecture and the existence of a limiting distribution of e^{-y/2}M(e^{y}) are consequences of the aforementioned conjectures. By probabilistic techniques, we present an argument that suggests M(x) grows as large positive and large negative as a constant times \pm \sqrt{x} (\log \log \log x)^{{5/4}} infinitely often, thus providing evidence for an unpublished conjecture of Gonek's.
