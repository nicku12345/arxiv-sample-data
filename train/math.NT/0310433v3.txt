It is shown that for any translation invariant outer measure M, the M-measure of the intersection of any subset of R^n that is invariant under rational translations and which does not have full Lebesgue measure with an the closure of an open set of positive measure cannot be positive and finite. Analogues for p-adic fields and fields of formal power series over a finite field are established. The results are applied to some problems in metric Diophantine approximation.
