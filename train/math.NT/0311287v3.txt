In this paper we exhibit a noncongruence subgroup \G whose space of weight 3 cusp forms S_3(\G) admits a basis satisfying the Atkin-Swinnerton-Dyer congruence relations with two weight 3 newforms for certain congruence subgroups. This gives a modularity interpretation of the motive attached to S_3(\G) by A. Scholl and also verifies the Atkin-Swinnerton-Dyer congruence conjecture for this space.
