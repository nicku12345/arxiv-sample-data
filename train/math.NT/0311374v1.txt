We prove \sum_{K-G}\le \kappa_j \le K+G}\alpha_j H_j^3(1/2) \ll_\epsilon GK^{1+\epsilon} for K^\epsilon \le G \le K, where \alpha_j = |\rho_j(1)|^2(\cosh \pi\kappa_j)^{-1}, and \rho_j(1) is the first Fourier coefficient of the Maass wave form corresponding to the eigenvalue \lambda_j = \kappa_j^2 + 1/4 to which the Hecke series H_j(s) is attached. This result yields the new bound H_j(1/2) \ll_\epsilon \kappa_j^{1/3+\epsilon}.
