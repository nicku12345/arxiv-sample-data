For a fixed integer k\ge 3 and fixed 1/2 < \sigma > 1 we consider  \int_1^T |\zeta(\sigma + it)|^{2k}dt = \sum_{n=1}^\infty d_k^2(n)n^{-2\sigma}T + R(k,\sigma;T),  where R(k,\sigma;T) = o(T) (T\to\infty) is the error term in the above asymptotic formula. Hitherto the sharpest bounds for R(k,\sigma;T) are given for certain ranges of \sigma. We also obtain new mean value results for the zeta-functions of holomorphic cusp forms and the Rankin-Selberg series.
