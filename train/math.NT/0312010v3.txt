By some extremely simple arguments, we point out the following: (i) If n is the least positive k-th power non-residue modulo a positive integer m, then the greatest number of consecutive k-th power residues mod m is smaller than m/n. (ii) Let O_K be the ring of algebraic integers in a quadratic field K=Q(\sqrt d) with d in {-1,-2,-3,-7,-11}. Then, for any irreducible \pi\in O_K and positive integer k not relatively prime to \pi\bar\pi-1, there exists a k-th power non-residue \omega\in O_K modulo \pi such that |\omega|<\sqrt{|\pi|}+0.65.
