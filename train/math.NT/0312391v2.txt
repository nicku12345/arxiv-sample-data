Let K be a finite tamely ramified extension of \Q_p and let L/K be a totally ramified (\Z/p^n\Z)-extension. Let \pi_L be a uniformizer for L, let \sigma be a generator for \Gal(L/K), and let f(X) be an element of \O_K[X] such that \sigma(\pi_L)=f(\pi_L). We show that the reduction of f(X) modulo the maximal ideal of \O_K determines a certain subextension of L/K up to isomorphism. We use this result to study the field extensions generated by periodic points of a p-adic dynamical system.
