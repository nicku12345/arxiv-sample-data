Let \cal C be a non--degenerate planar curve and for a real, positive decreasing function \psi let \cal C(\psi) denote the set of simultaneously \psi--approximable points lying on \cal C. We show that \cal C is of Khintchine type for divergence; i.e. if a certain sum diverges then the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on \cal C of \cal C(\psi) is full. We also obtain the Hausdorff measure analogue of the divergent Khintchine type result. In the case that \cal C is a rational quadric the convergence counterparts of the divergent results are also obtained. Furthermore, for functions \psi with lower order in a critical range we determine a general, exact formula for the Hausdorff dimension of \cal C(\psi). These results constitute the first precise and general results in the theory of simultaneous Diophantine approximation on manifolds.
