A q-analogue of the Riemann zeta function was studied in [Kaneko et al. 03] via a certain q-series of two variables. We introduce in a similar way a q-analogue of the Dirichlet L-functions and make a detailed study of them, including some issues concerning the classical limit of the q-analogue left open in [Kaneko et al. 03]. We also examine a "crystal" limit (i.e. q->0) behavior of the q-analogue. The q-trajectories of the trivial and essential zeros of the Riemann zeta function are investigated numerically when q moves in (0,1]. Moreover, conjectures for the crystal limit behavior of zeros of the q-analogue are given.
