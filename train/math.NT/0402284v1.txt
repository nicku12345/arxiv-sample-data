Given a quadratic form and M linear forms in N+1 variables with coefficients in a number field K, suppose that there exists a point in K^{N+1} at which the quadratic form vanishes and all the linear forms do not. Then we show that there exists a point like this of relatively small height. This generalizes a result of D.W. Masser (1998). As a corollary of this result, we prove an extension of Cassels' theorem on small zeros of quadratic forms (1955) to non-singular small zeros over a number field.
