Let f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]. Set f_{0}(x) = x and, for n \geq 1, define f_{n}(x) = f(f_{n-1}(x)). We describe several infinite families of polynomials for which the infinite product \prod_{n=0}^{\infty} (1 + \frac{1}{f_{n}(x)}) has a \emph{specializable} continued fraction expansion of the form S_{\infty} = [1;a_{1}(x), a_{2}(x), a_{3}(x), ... ], where a_{i}(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x], for i \geq 1. When the infinite product and the continued fraction are \emph{specialized} by letting x take integral values, we get infinite classes of real numbers whose regular continued fraction expansion is predictable. We also show that, under some simple conditions, all the real numbers produced by this specialization are transcendental.
