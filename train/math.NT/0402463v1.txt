If a continued fraction K_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}/b_{n} is known to converge but its limit is not easy to determine, it may be easier to use an extension of K_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}/b_{n} to find the limit. By an extension of K_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}/b_{n} we mean a continued fraction K_{n=1}^{\infty} c_{n}/d_{n} whose odd or even part is K_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}/b_{n}. One can then possibly find the limit in one of three ways:   (i) Prove the extension converges and find its limit;   (ii) Prove the extension converges and find the limit of the other contraction (for example, the odd part, if K_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}/b_{n} is the even part);   (ii) Find the limit of the other contraction and show that the odd and even parts of the extension tend to the same limit.   We apply these ideas to derive new proofs of certain continued fraction identities of Ramanujan and to prove a generalization of an identity involving the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction, which was conjectured by Blecksmith and Brillhart.
