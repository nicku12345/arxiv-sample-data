In this paper an explicit formula is given for a sequence of numbers. The positivity of this sequence of numbers implies that zeros in the critical strip of the Euler product of   Hecke polynomials, which are associated with the space of cusp forms of weight k for Hecke congruence subgroups, lie on the critical line.
