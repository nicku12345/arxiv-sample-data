About fifty years ago Mahler proved that if \alpha>1 is rational but not an integer and if 0<l<1 then the fractional part of \alpha^n is >l^n apart from a finite set of integers n depending on \alpha and l. Answering completely a question of Mahler we show that the same conclusion holds for all algebraic numbers which are not d-th roots of Pisot numbers. By related methods, we also answer a question by Mendes France, characterizing completely the quadratic irrationals \alpha such that the continued fraction of \alpha^n has period length tending to infinity.
