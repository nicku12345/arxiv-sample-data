Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a number field F. In this paper, we study the structure of the p^\infty-Selmer group of E over p-adic Lie extensions F_\infty of F which are obtained by adjoining to F the p-division points of an abelian variety A defined over F. The main focus of the paper is the calculation of the \Gal(F_\infty/F)-Euler characteristic of the p^\infty-Selmer group of E. The final section illustrates the main theory with the example of an elliptic curve of conductor 294.
