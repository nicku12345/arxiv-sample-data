The main conjectures of Iwasawa theory provide the only general method known at present for studying the mysterious relationship between purely arithmetic problems and the special values of complex L-functions, typified by the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer and its generalizations. Our goal in the present paper is to develop algebraic techniques which enable us to formulate a precise version of such a main conjecture for motives over a large class of p-adic Lie extensions of number fields. The paper ends by formulating and briefly discussing the main conjecture for an elliptic curve E over the rationals Q over the field generated by the coordinates of its p-power division points, where p is a prime greater than 3 of good ordinary reduction for E.
