Suppose p is a prime of the form u^2+64 for some integer u, which we take to be 3 mod 4. Then there are two Neumann--Setzer elliptic curves E_0 and E_1 of prime conductor p, and both have Mordell--Weil group \Z/2\Z. There is a surjective map X_0(p)\xrightarrow{\pi} E_0 that does not factor through any other elliptic curve (i.e., \pi is optimal), where X_0(p) is the modular curve of level p. Our main result is that the degree of \pi is odd if and only if u \con 3\pmod{8}. We also prove the prime-conductor case of a conjecture of Glenn Stevens, namely that that if E is an elliptic curve of prime conductor p then the optimal quotient of X_1(p) in the isogeny class of E is the curve with minimal Faltings height. Finally we discuss some conjectures and data about modular degrees and orders of Shafarevich--Tate groups of Neumann--Setzer curves.
