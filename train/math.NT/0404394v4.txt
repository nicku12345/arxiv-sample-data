Xian-Jin Li gave a criterion for the Riemann hypothesis in terms of the positivity of a set of coefficients lambda_n, indexed by the integers. We define similar coefficients attached to principal automorphic L-functions over GL(N). We relate these coefficients to values of Weil's quadratic functional for the associated automorphic representation, and deduce a Riemann hypothesis criterion in terms of positivity of the real parts of these coefficients. We determine asymptotics of the coefficients, both unconditionally and on the Riemann hypothesis, as n increases. We show the existence of an entire function of exponential type that interpolates the generalized Li coefficients at integer values.
