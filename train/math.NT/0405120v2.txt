We consider the periods of the linear congruential and the power generators modulo n and, for fixed choices of initial parameters, give lower bounds that hold for ``most'' n when n ranges over three different sets: the set of primes, the set of products of two primes (of similar size), and the set of all integers. For most n in these sets, the period is at least n^{1/2+\epsilon(n)} for any monotone function \epsilon(n) tending to zero as n tends to infinity. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, for most n in these sets the period is greater than n^{1-\epsilon} for any \epsilon >0. Moreover, the period is unconditionally greater than n^{1/2+\delta}, for some fixed \delta>0, for a positive proportion of n in the above mentioned sets. These bounds are related to lower bounds on the multiplicative order of an integer e modulo p-1, modulo \lambda(pl), and modulo \lambda(m) where p,l range over the primes, m ranges over the integers, and where \lambda(n) is the order of the largest cyclic subgroup of (\Z/n\Z)^\times.
