We prove a gluing lemma for sections of line bundles on a rigid analytic variety. We apply the lemma, in conjunction with a result of Buzzard's, to give a proof of (a generalization) of Coleman's theorem which states that overconvergent modular forms of small slope are classical. The proof is "geometric" in nature, and is suitable for generalization to other PEL Shimura varieties.
