The present paper proves that if for a power sum \alpha over \ZZ the length of the period of the continued fraction for \sqrt{\alpha(n)} is constant for infinitely many even (resp. odd) n, then \sqrt{\alpha(n)} admits a functional continued fraction expansion for all even (resp. odd) n, except finitely many; in particular, for such n, the partial quotients can be expressed by power sums of the same kind.
