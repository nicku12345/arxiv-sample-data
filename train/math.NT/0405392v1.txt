Let X be an algebraic variety, defined over the rationals. This paper gives upper bounds for the number of rational points on X, with height at most B, for the case in which X is a curve or a surface. In the latter case one excludes from the counting function those points that lie on lines in the surface. The bounds are uniform for all X of a given degree. They are best possible in the case of curves. As an application it is shown that if F is an irreducible binary form of degree 3 or more then almost all integers represented by F have essentially one such representation.
