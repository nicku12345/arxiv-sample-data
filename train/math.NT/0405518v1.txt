Let {\mathbf F}_q denote a finite field of characteristic p and let n be an effective divisor on the affine line over {\mathbf F}_q and let v be a point on the affine line outside n. In this paper, we get congruences between {\mathbb Q}_l-valued weight two v-old Drinfeld modular forms and v-new Drinfeld modular forms of level vn. In order to do this, we shall first construct a cokernel torsion-free injection from a full lattice in the space of v-old Drinfeld modular forms of level vn into a full lattice in the space of all Drinfeld modular forms of level vn. To get this injection we use ideas introduced by Gekeler and Reversat on uniformization of jacobians of Drinfeld moduli curves.
