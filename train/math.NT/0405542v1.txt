In earlier papers the author studied some classes of equations with Carlitz derivatives for \mathbb F_q-linear functions, which are the natural function field counterparts of linear ordinary differential equations. Here we consider equations containing self-compositions u\circ u\circ ... \circ u of the unknown function. As an algebraic background, imbeddings of the composition ring of \mathbb F_q-linear holomorphic functions into skew fields are considered.
