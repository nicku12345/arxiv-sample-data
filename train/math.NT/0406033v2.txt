D.H. Lehmer found a quadratic polynomial such that 326 is a primitive root for the first 206 primes represented by this polynomial. It is shown that this is related to the class number one problem and prime producing quadratics. An algorithm is described to find more impressive examples in the same spirit. Y. Gallot used it to establish the current record in which 206 is being replaced by 31082.
