Let p be a prime number and let n be a positive integer prime to p. By an Ihara result we mean existence of an injection with torsion-free cokernel from a full lattice in the space of p-old modular forms, into a full lattice in the space of all modular forms of level np. In this paper, we prove Ihara results for genus two Siegel modular forms, Siegel-Jacobi forms and Hilbert modular forms. We also propose a geometric formulation for the notion of p-old Siegel modular forms of genus two.
