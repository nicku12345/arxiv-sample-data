We introduce a higher dimensional Atkin-Lehner theory for Siegel-Parahoric congruence subgroups of GSp(2g). Old Siegel forms are induced by geometric correspondences on Siegel moduli spaces which commute with almost all local Hecke algebras. We also introduce an algorithm to get equations for moduli spaces of Siegel-Parahoric level structures, once we have equations for prime levels and square prime levels over the level one Siegel space. This way we give equations for an infinite tower of Siegel spaces after N. Elkies who did the genus one case.
