We study p-divisibility of discriminants of Hecke algebras associated to spaces of cusp forms of prime level. We make a precise conjecture about the indexes of Hecke algebras in their normalisation which implies (if true) the conjecture that there are no mod p congruences between non-conjugate newforms of weight 2 and level Gamma_0(p).
