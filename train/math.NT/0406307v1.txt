We study the algebraic properties of Generalized Laguerre Polynomials for negative integral values of the parameter. For integers r,n\geq 0, we conjecture that L_n^{(-1-n-r)}(x) = \sum_{j=0}^n \binom{n-j+r}{n-j}x^j/j! is a \Q-irreducible polynomial whose Galois group contains the alternating group on n letters. That this is so for r=n was conjectured in the 50's by Grosswald and proven recently by Filaseta and Trifonov. It follows from recent work of Hajir and Wong that the conjecture is true when r is large with respect to n\geq 5. Here we verify it in three situations: i) when n is large with respect to r, ii) when r \leq 8, and iii) when n\leq 4. The main tool is the theory of p-adic Newton Polygons.
