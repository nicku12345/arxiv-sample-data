Using the theory of Newton Polygons, we formulate a simple criterion for the Galois group of a polynomial to be ``large.'' For a fixed \alpha \in \Q - \Z_{<0}, Filaseta and Lam have shown that the nth degree Generalized Laguerre Polynomial L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) = \sum_{j=0}^n \binom{n+\alpha}{n-j}(-x)^j/j! is irreducible for all large enough n. We use our criterion to show that, under these conditions, the Galois group of \La is either the alternating or symmetric group on n letters, generalizing results of Schur for \alpha=0,1.
