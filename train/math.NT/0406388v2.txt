Let x be a CM point on a modular or Shimura curve and p a prime of good reduction, split in the CM field K. We define an expansion of an holomorphic modular form f in the p-adic neighborhood of x and show that the expansion coefficients give information on the p-adic ring of definition of f. Also, we show that letting x vary in its Galois orbit, the expansions coefficients allow to construct a p-adic measure whose moments squared are essentially the values at the centre of symmetry of L-functions of the automorphic representation attached to f based-changed to K and twisted by a suitable family of Grossencharakters for K.
