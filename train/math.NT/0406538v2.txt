Richard G. Swan proved in 1962 that trinomials x^{8k} + x^m + 1 with 8k > m have an even number of irreducible factors, and so cannot be irreducible. In fact, he found the parity of the number of irreducible factors for any square-free trinomial in F_2[x]. We prove a result that is similar in spirit. Namely, suppose n is odd and f(x) = x^n + Sum_{i in S} x^i + 1 in F_2[x], where S subset {i : i odd, i < n/3} Union {i : i = n (mod 4), i < n} We show that if n = +-1 (mod 8) then f(x) has an odd number of irreducible factors, and if n = +=3 (mod 8) then f(x) has an even number of irreducible factors. This has an application to the problem of finding polynomial bases {1,a,a^2,...a^{n-1}} of F_{2^n} such that Tr(a^i) = 0 for all 1 <= i < n.
