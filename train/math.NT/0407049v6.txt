Let N(t, \rho) be the number of lattice points in a thin elliptical annuli. We assume the aspect ratio \beta of the ellipse is transcendental and Diophantine in a strong sense (this holds for {\em almost all} aspect ratios). The variance of N(t, \rho) is t(8\pi \beta \cdot \rho). We show that if \rho shrinks slowly to zero then the distribution of the normalized counting function \frac{N(t, \rho) - A(2t\rho+\rho^2)}{\sqrt{8 \pi \beta \cdot t \rho}} is Gaussian, where A is the area of the ellipse. The case of \underline{circular} annuli is due to Hughes and Rudnick.
