Nesterenko proved, among other results, the algebraic independence over \QQ of the numbers \pi,e^{\pi},\Gamma(1/4). A very important feature of his proof is a multiplicity estimate for quasi-modular forms associated to \SL_2(\ZZ) which involves profound differential properties of certain non-linear differential systems. The aim of this article is to begin the study of the analogous properties for Hilbert modular and quasi-modular forms, especially those which are associated with the number field \QQ(\sqrt{5}). We show that the differential structure of these functions has several analogies with the differential structure of the quasi-modular forms associated to \SL_2(\ZZ).
