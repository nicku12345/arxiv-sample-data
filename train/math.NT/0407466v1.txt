It is a well-known fact that Riemann Hypothesis will follows if the function identically equal to -1 can be arbitrarily approximated in the norm \norma{.} of L^{2}([0,1],dx) by functions of the form f(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k} \rho(\frac{\theta_{k}}{x}), where \rho(x)\adef\pfrac{x}, and a_{k}\in\cc, 0<\theta_{k}\leqslant 1 satisfies \sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k} \theta_{k}=0. Parsevall Identity \norma{f(x)+1}^{2}=\sum_{n\in\zz}\modulo{c(n)}^{2} is a possible tool to compute or estimate this norm. In this note we give an expression for the Fourier coefficients c(n) of f+1, when f is a function defined as above. As an application, we derive an expression for M_{f}(s)\adef\int_{0}^{1}(f(x)+1) x^{s-1} dx as a series that only depends on M_{f}(2k), k\in\nn. We remark that the Fourier coefficients c(n) depend on M_{f}(2k) which, for a function f defined as above, can be expressed also in terms of the a_{k}'s and \theta_{k}'s. Therefore, a better control on these parameters will allow to estimate M_{f}(2k) and therefore eventually to handle \norma{f+1} via our expression for the Fourier coefficients and Parsevall Identity.
