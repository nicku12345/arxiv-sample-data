We introduce Wilson's theorem and Clement's result and present a necessary and sufficient condition for p and p+2k to be primes where k is a positive integer. By using Simiov's Theorem, we derive an improved version of Clement's result and characterizations of Polignac twin primes which parallel previous characterizations.
