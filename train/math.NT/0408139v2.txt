For a number field K with ring of integers {\mathcal O}_K, we prove an analogue over finite rings of the form {\mathcal O}_K/{\mathcal P}^m of the Fundamental Theorem on the Fourier transform of a relative invariant of prehomogeneous vector spaces, where {\mathcal P} is a big enough prime ideal of {\mathcal O}_K and m>1. In the appendix, F. Sato gives an application of the Theorems A, B and the Theorems A, B, C in J. Denef and A. Gyoja [\emph{Character sums associated to prehomogeneous vector spaces}, Compos. Math., \textbf{113} (1998) 237--346] to the functional equation of L-functions of Dirichlet type associated with prehomogeneous vector spaces.
