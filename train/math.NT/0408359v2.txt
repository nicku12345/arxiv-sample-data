The Katz-Sarnak philosophy predicts that statistics of zeros of families of L-functions are strikingly universal. However, subtle arithmetical differences between families of the same symmetry type can be detected by calculating lower-order terms of the statistics of interest. In this paper we calculate lower-order terms of the 1-level density of some families of elliptic curves. We show that there are essentially two different effects on the distribution of low-lying zeros. First, low-lying zeros are more numerous in families of elliptic curves E with relatively large numbers of points (mod p). Second, and somewhat surprisingly, a family with a relatively large number of primes of bad reduction has relatively fewer low-lying zeros.   We also show that the lower order term can grow arbitrarily large by taking a biased family with a relatively large number of points (mod p) for all small primes p.
