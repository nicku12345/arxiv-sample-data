We prove modularity for any irreducible crystalline \ell-adic odd 2-dimensional Galois representation (with finite ramification set) unramified at 3 verifying an "ordinarity at 3" easy to check condition, with Hodge-Tate weights \{0, w \} such that 2 w < \ell (and \ell > 3) and such that the traces a_p of the images of Frobenii verify \Q(\{a_p \}) = \Q . This result applies in particular to any motivic compatible family of odd two-dimensional Galois representations of \Gal(\bar{\Q}/\Q) if the motive has rational coefficients, good reduction at 3, and the "ordinarity at 3" condition is satisfied. As a corollary, this proves that all rigid Calabi-Yau threefolds defined over \Q having good reduction at 3 and satisfying  3 \nmid a_3 are modular.
