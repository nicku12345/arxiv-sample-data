In a recent preprint, F. Calegari has shown that for \ell = 2, 3, 5 and 7 there exist 2-dimensional surjective representations \rho of \Gal(\bar{\Q}/\Q) with values in \F_\ell coming from the \ell-torsion points of an elliptic curve defined over \Q, but not minimally, i.e., so that any elliptic curve giving rise to \rho has prime-to-\ell conductor greater than the (prime-to-\ell) conductor of \rho. In this brief note, we will show that the same is true for any prime \ell >7, concretely, we will show that for any such \ell the elliptic curve E^\ell: \qquad Y^2 = X (X- 3^\ell ) (X - 3^\ell - 1)  is semistable, has bad reduction at 3, the associated \mod \ell Galois representation \rho is surjective, unramified at 3, and there is no elliptic curve with good reduction at 3 whose associated \mod \ell representation is isomorphic to \rho.
