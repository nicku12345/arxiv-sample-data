Let B_n (n = 0, 1, 2, ...) denote the usual n-th Bernoulli number. Let l be a positive even integer where l=12 or l \geq 16. It is well known that the numerator of the reduced quotient |B_l/l| is a product of powers of irregular primes. Let (p,l) be an irregular pair with B_l/l \not\equiv B_{l+p-1}/(l+p-1) \modp{p^2}. We show that for every r \geq 1 the congruence B_{m_r}/m_r \equiv 0 \modp{p^r} has a unique solution m_r where m_r \equiv l \modp{p-1} and l \leq m_r < (p-1)p^{r-1}. The sequence (m_r)_{r \geq 1} defines a p-adic integer \chi_{(p, l)} which is a zero of a certain p-adic zeta function \zeta_{p, l} originally defined by T. Kubota and H. W. Leopoldt. We show some properties of these functions and give some applications. Subsequently we give several computations of the (truncated) p-adic expansion of \chi_{(p, l)} for irregular pairs (p,l) with p below 1000.
