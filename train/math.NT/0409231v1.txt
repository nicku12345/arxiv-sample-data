Let \phi(\cdot) and \sigma(\cdot) denote the Euler function and the sum of divisors function, respectively. In this paper, we give a lower bound for the number of positive integers m\le x for which the equation m=n-\phi(n) has no solution. We also give a lower bound for the number of m\le x for which the equation m=\sigma(n)-n has no solution. Finally, we show the set of positive integers m not of the form (p-1)/2-\phi(p-1) for some prime number p has a positive lower asymptotic density.
