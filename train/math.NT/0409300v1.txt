We study compatible families of four-dimensional Galois representations constructed in the \'{e}tale cohomology of a smooth projective variety. We prove a theorem asserting that the images will be generically large if certain conditions are satisfied. We only consider representations with coefficients in an imaginary quadratic field. We apply our result to an example constructed by Jasper Scholten, obtaining a family of linear groups and one of unitary groups as Galois groups over \mathbb{Q}.
