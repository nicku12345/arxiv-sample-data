The matrix representation of the set \Delta({\bf d}^3), {\bf d}^3=(d_1,d_2, d_3), of the integers which are unrepresentable by d_1,d_2,d_3 is found. The diagrammatic procedure of calculation of the generating function \Phi({\bf d}^3;z) for the set \Delta({\bf d}^3) is developed. The Frobenius number F({\bf d}^3), genus G({\bf d}^3) and Hilbert series H({\bf d}^3;z) of a graded subring for non--symmetric and symmetric semigroups {\sf S}({\bf d}^3) are found. The upper bound for the number of non--zero coefficients in the polynomial numerators of Hilbert series H({\bf d}^m;z) of graded subrings for non--symmetric semigroups {\sf S} ({\bf d}^m) of dimension, m\geq 4, is established.
