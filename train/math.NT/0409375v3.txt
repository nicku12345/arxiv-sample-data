Let K be a number field, and let W be a subspace of K^N, N \geq 1. Let V_1,...,V_M be subspaces of K^N of dimension less than dimension of W. We prove the existence of a point of small height in W \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^M V_i, providing an explicit upper bound on the height of such a point in terms of heights of W and V_1,...,V_M. Our main tool is a counting estimate we prove for the number of points of a subspace of K^N inside of an adelic cube. As corollaries to our main result we derive an explicit bound on the height of a non-vanishing point for a decomposable form and an effective subspace extension lemma.
