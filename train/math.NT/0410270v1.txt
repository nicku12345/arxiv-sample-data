We study generalised prime systems \mathcal{P} (1<p_1\leq p_2\leq..., with p_j\in\R tending to infinity) and the associated Beurling zeta function \zeta_{\mathcal{P}}(s) =\prod_{j=1}^{\infty} (1-p_j^{-s})^{-1}. Under appropriate assumptions, we establish various analytic properties of \zeta_{\mathcal{P}}(s), including its analytic continuation and we characterise the existence of a suitable generalised functional equation. In particular, we examine the relationship between a counterpart of the Prime Number Theorem (with error term) and the properties of the analytic continuation of \zeta_{\mathcal{P}}(s). Further we study `well-behaved' g-prime systems, namely, systems for which both the prime and integer counting function are asymptotically well-behaved. Finally, we show that there exists a natural correspondence between generalised prime systems and suitable orders on \N^2.   Some of the above results may be relevant to the second author's theory of `fractal membranes', whose spectral partition functions are precisely given by Beurling zeta functions.
