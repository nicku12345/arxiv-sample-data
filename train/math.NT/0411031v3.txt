We consider the geometric generalization of ordinary continued fraction to the multidimensional case introduced by F. Klein in 1895. A multidimensional periodic continued fraction is the union of sails with some special group acting freely on these sails. This group transposes the faces. In this article, we present a method of constructing "approximate" fundamental domains of algebraic multidimensional continued fractions and an algorithm testing whether this domain is indeed fundamental or not. We give some polynomial estimates on number of the operations for the algorithm. In conclusion we present an example of fundamental domains calculation for a two-dimensional series of two-dimensional periodic continued fractions.
