We extend Norton-Borcherds-Koike's replication formulae to super-replicable ones by working with the congruence groups \Gamma_1(N) and find the product identities which characterize super-replicable functions. These will provide a clue for constructing certain new infinite dimensional Lie superalgebras whose denominator identities coincide with the above product identities. Therefore it could be one way to find a connection between modular functions and infinite dimensional Lie algebras.
