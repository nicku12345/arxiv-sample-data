We show that an infinite family of odd complex 2-dimensional Galois representations ramified at 5 having nonsolvable projective image are modular, thereby verifying Artin's conjecture for a new case of examples. Such a family contains the original example studied by Buhler. In the process, we prove that an infinite family of residually modular Galois representations are modular by studying \Lambda-adic Hecke algebras.
