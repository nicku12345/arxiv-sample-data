Let f\in \mathbb{Z}\lbrack x\rbrack be a polynomial of degree d\geq 3 without roots of multiplicity d or (d-1). Erd\H{o}s conjectured that, if f satisfies the necessary local conditions, then f(p) is free of (d-1)th powers for infinitely many primes p. This is proved here for all f with sufficiently high entropy.   The proof serves to demonstrate two innovations: a strong repulsion principle for integer points on curves of positive genus, and a number-theoretical analogue of Sanov's theorem from the theory of large deviations.
