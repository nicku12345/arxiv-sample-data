Let E/\bbq be an elliptic curve defined over \bbq with conductor N and \gq the absolute Galois group of an algebraic closure \bar{\bbq} of \bbq. We prove that for every \sigma\in \gq, the Mordell-Weil group E(\oqs) of E over the fixed subfield of \bar{\bbq} under \sigma has infinite rank. Our approach uses the modularity of E/\bbq and a collection of algebraic points on E -- the so-called {\em Heegner points} -- arising from the theory of complex multiplication.
