Let \sigma(n) denote the sum of the positive divisors of n. We say that n is perfect if \sigma(n) = 2 n. Currently there are no known odd perfect numbers. It is known that if an odd perfect number exists, then it must be of the form N = p^\alpha \prod_{j=1}^k q_j^{2 \beta_j}, where p, q_1, ..., q_k are distinct primes and p \equiv \alpha\equiv 1 \pmod{4}. Define the total number of prime factors of N as \Omega(N) := \alpha + 2 \sum_{j=1}^k \beta_j. Sayers showed that \Omega(N) \geq 29. This was later extended by Iannucci and Sorli to show that \Omega(N) \geq 37. This was extended by the author to show that \Omega(N) \geq 47. Using an idea of Carl Pomerance this paper extends these results. The current new bound is \Omega(N) \geq 75.
