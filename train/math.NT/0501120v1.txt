This paper is continuation of the paper "Primitive roots in quadratic field". We consider an analogue of Artin's primitive root conjecture for algebraic numbers which is not a unit in real quadratic fields. Given such an algebraic number, for a rational prime p which is inert in the field the maximal order of the unit modulo p is p^2-1. An extension of Artin's conjecture is that there are infinitely many such inert primes for which this order is maximal. we show that for any choice of 85 algebraic numbers satisfying a certain simple restriction, there is at least one of the algebraic numbers which satisfies the above version of Artin's conjecture.
