Let K be a number field, and let F be a symmetric bilinear form in 2N variables over K. Let Z be a subspace of K^N. A classical theorem of Witt states that the bilinear space (Z,F) can be decomposed into an orthogonal sum of hyperbolic planes, singular, and anisotropic components. We prove the existence of such a decomposition of small height, where all bounds on height are explicit in terms of heights of F and Z. We also prove a special version of Siegel's Lemma for a bilinear space, which provides a small-height orthogonal decomposition into one-dimensional subspaces. Finally, we prove an effective version of Cartan-Dieudonn{\'e} theorem. Namely, we show that every isometry \sigma of a regular bilinear space (Z,F) can be represented as a product of reflections of small heights with an explicit bound on heights in terms of heights of F, Z, and \sigma.
