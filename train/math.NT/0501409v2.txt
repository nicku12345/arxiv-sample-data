We investigate the anticanonical height zeta function of a (non necessarily split) toric variety defined over a global field of positive characteristic, drawing our inspiration from the method used by Batyrev and Tschinkel to deal with the analogous problem over a number field. By the way, we give a detailed account of their method.
