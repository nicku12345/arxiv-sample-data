Several results are obtained concerning multiplicities of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function \zeta(s). They include upper bounds for multiplicities, showing that zeros with large multiplicities have to lie to the left of the line \sigma = 1. A zero-density counting function involving multiplicities is also discussed.
