The modified Mellin transform {\cal Z}_k(s) = \int_1^\infty |\zeta(1/2+ix)|^{2k}x^{-s}{\rm d} x (k = 1,2,...) is investigated. Analytic continuation and mean square estimates of {\cal Z}_k(s)  are discussed, as well as connections with power moments of |\zeta(1/2+ix)|, with the special emphasis on the cases k = 1,2.
