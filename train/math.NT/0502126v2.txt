For functions defined via Dirichlet/generalized Dirichlet series in some half planes of the complex plane, we give a new simple elementary approach to obtain an Approximate Functional Equation(AFE for short) for the product of functions with explicit remainder term. We do this,using a highly generalized identity following Motohashi's approach,wherein he uses a generalisation of Dirichlet's device.We use our method to give an AFE for the product of two Dirichlet L-series corresponding to primitive Dirichlet characters with hitherto unknown estimate for its remainder term.We also consideer AFEs of functions on the real line and the AFEs not only of the r-th power of Dirichlet L-series(or,of Riemann Zeta function)but also of the r-th root of it,where r is a positive integer
