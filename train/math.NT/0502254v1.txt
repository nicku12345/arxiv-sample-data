We define a weighted multiplicity function for closed geodesics of given length on a finite area Riemann surface. These weighted multiplicities appear naturally in the Selberg trace formula, and in particular their mean square plays an important role in the study of statistics of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on the surface.   In the case of the modular domain, E. Bogomolny, F. Leyvraz and C. Schmit gave a formula for the mean square, which was rigorously proved by M. Peter. In this paper we calculate the mean square of weighted multiplicities for some surfaces associated to congruence subgroups of the unit group of a rational quaternion algebra, in particular for congruence subgroups of the modular group. Remarkably, the result turns out to be a rational multiple of the mean square for the modular domain.
