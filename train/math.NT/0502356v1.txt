Let l be a prime. We show that there do not exist any non-zero semi-stable abelian varieties over Q with good reduction outside l if and only if l=2, 3, 5, 7 or 13. We show that any semi-stable abelian variety over Q with good reduction outside l=11 is isogenous to a power of the Jacobian variety of the modular curve X_0(11). In addition we show that there do not exist any non-zero abelian varieties over Q with good reduction outside l acquiring semi-stable reduction at l over a tamely ramified extension if and only if l \le 5.
