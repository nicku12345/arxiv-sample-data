This article extends classical one variable results about Euler products defined by integral valued polynomial or analytic functions to several variables. We show there exists a meromorphic continuation up to a presumed natural boundary, and also give a criterion, a la Estermann-Dahlquist, for the existence of a meromorphic extension to \C^n. Among applications we deduce analytic properties of height zeta functions for toric varieties over \Q and group zeta functions.
