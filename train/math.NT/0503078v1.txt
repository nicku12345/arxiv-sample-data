Let \cS_n(\psi_1,...,\psi_n) denote the set of simultaneously (\psi_1,...,\psi_n)--approximable points in \R^n and \cSM_n(\psi) denote the set of multiplicatively \psi--approximable points in \R^n. Let \cM be a manifold in \R^n. The aim is to develop a metric theory for the sets  \cM \cap \cS_n(\psi_1,...,\psi_n)  and  \cM \cap \cSM_n(\psi)  analogous to the classical theory in which \cM is simply \R^n. In this note, we mainly restrict our attention to the case that \cM is a planar curve \cC. A complete Hausdorff dimension theory is established for the sets  \cC \cap \cS_2(\psi_1,\psi_2)  and  \cC \cap \cSM_2(\psi) . A divergent Khintchine type result is obtained for \cC \cap \cS_2(\psi_1,\psi_2) ; i.e. if a certain sum diverges then the one--dimensional Lebesgue measure on \cC of \cC \cap \cS_2(\psi_1,\psi_2)  is full. Furthermore, in the case that \cC is a rational quadric the convergent Khintchine type result is obtained for both types of approximation. Our results for \cC \cap \cS_2(\psi_1,\psi_2)  naturally generalize the dimension and Lebesgue measure statements of \cite{BDV03}. Within the multiplicative framework, our results for  \cC \cap \cSM_2(\psi) constitute the first of their type.
