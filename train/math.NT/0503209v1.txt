In this paper we construct the q-analogue of Barnes's Bernoulli numbers and polynomials of degree 2, for positive even integers, which is an answer to a part of Schlosser's question. For positive odd integers, Schlosser's question is still open.   Finally, we will treat the q-analogue of the sums of powers of consecutive integers.
