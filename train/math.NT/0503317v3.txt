Upper bound estimates for the exponential sum  \sum_{K<\kappa_j\le K'<2K} \alpha_j H_j^3(1/2) \cos(\k_j\log({4{\rm e}T\over \kappa_j})) \qquad(T^\epsilon \le K \le T^{1/2-\epsilon})  are considered, where \alpha_j = |\rho_j(1)|^2(\cosh\pi\kappa_j)^{-1}, and \rho_j(1) is the first Fourier coefficient of the Maass wave form corresponding to the eigenvalue \lambda_j = \kappa_j^2 + {1\over4} to which the Hecke series H_j(s) is attached. The problem is transformed to the estimation of a classical exponential sum involving the binary additive divisor problem. The analogous exponential sums with H_j(\hf) or H_j^2(\hf) replacing H_j^3(1/2) are also considered. The above sum is conjectured to be \ll_\epsilon K^{3/2+\epsilon}, which is proved to be true in the mean square sense.
