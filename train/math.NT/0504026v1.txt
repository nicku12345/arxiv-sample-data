We establish a new bound for the exponential sum \begin{eqnarray*} \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}\Big|\sum_{y\in \mathcal{Y}}\gamma(y)\exp(2\pi i a \lambda^{xy}/p)\Big|, \end{eqnarray*} where \lambda is an element of the residue ring modulo a large prime number p, \mathcal{X} and \mathcal{Y} are arbitrary subsets of the residue ring modulo p-1 and \gamma(n) are any complex numbers with |\gamma(n)| \le 1. In particular, we improve several previously known bounds.
