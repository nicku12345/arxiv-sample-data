We estimate exponential sums with the Fermat-like quotients  f_g(n) = \frac{g^{n-1} - 1}{n} \mand h_g(n)=\frac{g^{n-1}-1}{P(n)},  where g and n are positive integers, n is composite, and P(n) is the largest prime factor of n. Clearly, both f_g(n) and h_g(n) are integers if n is a Fermat pseudoprime to base g, and if n is a Carmichael number this is true for all g coprime to n. Nevertheless, our bounds imply that the fractional parts \{f_g(n)\} and \{h_g(n)\} are uniformly distributed, on average over g for f_g(n), and individually for h_g(n). We also obtain similar results with the functions {\widetilde f}_g(n) = gf_g(n) and {\widetilde h}_g(n) = gh_g(n).
