Let \lambda be a fixed integer, \lambda\ge 2. Let s_n be any strictly increasing sequence of positive integers satisfying s_n\le n^{15/14+o(1)}. In this paper we give a version of the large sieve inequality for the sequence \lambda^{s_n}. In particular, we prove that for \pi(X)(1+o(1)) primes p, \ p\le X, the numbers  \lambda^{s_n},\quad n\le X(\log X)^{2+\epsilon}  are uniformly distributed modulo p.
