Our principal aim in the present article is to establish a uniform hybrid bound for individual values on the critical line of Hecke L-functions associated with cusp forms over the full modular group. This is rendered in the statement that for t\ge0  \eqalignno{H_j(\txt{1\over2}+it)&\ll(\kappa_j+t)^{1/3+\epsilon},& (1.1)\cr H_{j,k}(\txt{1\over2}+it)&\ll (k+t)^{1/3+\epsilon},&(1.2)\cr}  with the common notation to be made precise in the course of discussion. Talks on this and relevant results were delivered by the authors at MF Oberwolfach on September 20, 2004, and at General Assembry of Math. Soc. Japan on March 30, 2005.
