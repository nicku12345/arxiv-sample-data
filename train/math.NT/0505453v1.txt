For each f:[0,\infty)\to\Com formally consider its co-Poisson or M\"{u}ntz transform g(x)=\sum_{n\geq 1}f(nx)-\frac{1}{x}\int_0^\infty f(t)dt. For certain f's with both f, g \in L_2(0,\infty) it is true that the Riemann hypothesis holds if and only if f is in the L_2 closure of the vector space generated by the dilations g(kx), k\in\Nat. Such is the case for example when f=\chi_{(0,1]} where the above statement reduces to the strong Nyman criterion already established by the author. In this note we show that the necessity implication holds for any continuously differentiable function f vanishing at infinity and satisfying \int_0^\infty t|f'(t)|dt<\infty. If in addition f is of compact support then the sufficiency implication also holds true. It would be convenient to remove this compactness condition.
