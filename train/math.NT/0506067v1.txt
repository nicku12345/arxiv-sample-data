Let p_n denote the n^{th} prime. Goldston, Pintz, and Yildirim recently proved that  \liminf_{n\to \infty} \frac{(p_{n+1}-p_n)}{\log p_n} =0. We give an alternative proof of this result. We also prove some corresponding results for numbers with two prime factors. Let q_n denote the n^{th} number that is a product of exactly two distinct primes. We prove that \liminf_{n\to \infty} (q_{n+1}-q_n) \le 26. If an appropriate generalization of the Elliott-Halberstam Conjecture is true, then the above bound can be improved to 6.
