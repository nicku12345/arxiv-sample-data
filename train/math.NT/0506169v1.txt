Recently, the two variable q-L-functions which interpolate the generalized q-Bernoulli polynomials associated with \chi are introduced and studied, cf. [2]. In this paper, we construct multiple Dirichlet's q-L-function which interpolates the generalized multiple q-Bernoulli numbers attached to \chi  at negative integer and study its properties.
