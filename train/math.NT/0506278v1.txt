Carlitz has introduced an interesting q-analogue of Frobenius-Euler numbers in [4]. He has indicated a corresponding Stadudt-Clausen theorem and also some interesting congruence properties of the q-Euler numbers. In this paper we give another construction of q-Euler numbers, which are different than his q-Euler numbers. By using our q-Euler numbers, we define the q-analogue of Genocchi numbers and investigate the relations between q-Euler numbers and q-analogs of Genocchi numbers.
