V. I. Vasyunin has introduced special sequences of step functions related to the strong Nyman-Beurling criterion that converge pointwise to 1 in [1,\infty). We show here that the first and simplest such sequence considered by Vasyunin diverges in L_1((1,\infty),x^{-2}dx), which of course precludes the L_2((1,\infty),x^{-2}dx)-convergence needed for the Riemann hypothesis. Whether all sequences considered by this author also diverge remains an interesting open question.
