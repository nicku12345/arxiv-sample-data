We address a question posed by Ono, prove a general result for powers of an arbitrary prime, and provide an explanation for the appearance of higher congruence moduli for certain small primes. One of our results coincides with a recent result of Edixhoven, and we hope that the comparison of the methods, which are entirely different, may reveal a connection between the p-adic geometry and the arithmetic of half-integral weight Hecke operators.
