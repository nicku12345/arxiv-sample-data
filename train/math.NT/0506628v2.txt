An arbitrary-depth reduction theorem for the `convolution' multiple L-values of Euler-Zagier type is proven by an analytic method. To this end, generalized polylogarithms associated to Dirichlet characters are defined. The proof uses the monodromies of these functions and the parities of generating functions of generalized Bernoulli numbers. Some general formulas for resulting reductions in the depth 2 case are provided.
