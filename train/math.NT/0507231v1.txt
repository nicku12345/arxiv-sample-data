Following earlier results of Sondow, we propose another criterion of irrationality for Euler's constant \gamma. It involves similar linear combinations of logarithm numbers L\_{n,m}. To prove that \gamma is irrational, it suffices to prove that, for some fixed m, the distance of d\_n L\_{n,m} (d\_n is the least common multiple of the n first integers) to the set of integers \mathbf{Z} does not converge to 0. A similar result is obtained by replacing logarithms numbers by rational numbers: it gives a sufficient condition involving only rational numbers. Unfortunately, the chaotic behavior of d\_n is an obstacle to verify this sufficient condition. All the proofs use in a large manner the theory of Pad\'e approximation.
