We study the problem of finding nonconstant monic integer polynomials, normalized by their degree, with small supremum on an interval I. The monic integer transfinite diameter t_M(I) is defined as the infimum of all such supremums. We show that if I has length 1 then t_M(I) = 1/2.   We make three general conjectures relating to the value of t_M(I) for intervals I of length less that 4. We also conjecture a value for t_M([0, b]) where 0 < b < 1. We give some partial results, as well as computational evidence, to support these conjectures.   We define two functions that measure properties of the lengths of intervals I with t_M(I) on either side of t. Upper and lower bounds are given for these functions.   We also consider the problem of determining t_M(I) when I is a Farey interval. We prove that a conjecture of Borwein, Pinner and Pritsker concerning this value is true for an infinite family of Farey intervals.
