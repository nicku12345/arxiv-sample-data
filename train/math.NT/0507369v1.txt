A Hausdorff measure version of W.M. Schmidt's inhomogeneous, linear forms theorem in metric number theory is established. The key ingredient is a `slicing' technique motivated by a standard result in geometric measure theory. In short, `slicing' together with the Mass Transference Principle [3] allows us to transfer Lebesgue measure theoretic statements for limsup sets associated with linear forms to Hausdorff measure theoretic statements. This extends the approach developed in [3] for simultaneous approximation. Furthermore, we establish a new Mass Transference Principle which incorporates both forms of approximation. As an application we obtain a complete metric theory for a `fully' non-linear Diophantine problem within the linear forms setup.   [3] V. Beresnevich and S.
