Let 2^+S_4 denote the double cover of S_4 corresponding to the element in H^2(S_4,\Z/2\Z) where transpositions lift to elements of order 2 and the product of two disjoint transpositions to elements of order 4 (denoted \tilde S_4 in \cite{Serre}). Given an elliptic curve E, let E[2] denote its 2-torsion points. Under some conditions on E (as in \cite{Bayer}) elements in H^1(\Gal_\Q,E[2])\backslash \{0 \} correspond to Galois extensions N of \Q with Galois group (isomorphic to) S_4. On this work we give an interpretation of the addition law on such fields, and prove that the obstruction for N having a Galois extension \tilde N with \Gal(\tilde N/ \Q) \simeq 2^+S_4 gives an homomorphism s_4^+:H^1(\Gal_\Q,E[2]) \to H^2(\Gal_\Q,\Z/2\Z). As a Corollary we can prove (if E has conductor divisible by few primes and high rank) the existence of 1-dimensional representations attached to E and use them in some examples to construct 3/2 modular forms mapping via the Shimura map to (the modular form attached to) E.
