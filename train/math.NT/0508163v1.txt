We improve the results in a previous article of Dieulefait and Manoharmayum and we deduce some stronger modularity results. In particular we deduce that any rigid Calabi-Yau threefold defined over Q with good reduction at 5 is modular and we also obtain a fairly general version of the principle of "switching the residual characteristic" used in proofs of cases of Serre's conjecture.
