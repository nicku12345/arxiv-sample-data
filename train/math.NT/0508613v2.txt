We derive explicit formulas for the action of the Hecke operator T(p) on the genus theta series of a positive definite integral quadratic form and prove a theorem on the generation of spaces of Eisenstein series by genus theta series. We also discuss connections of our results with Kudla's matching principle for theta integrals.
