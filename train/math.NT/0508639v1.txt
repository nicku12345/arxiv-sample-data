A prime p is called Sophie Germain prime if 2p+1 is also prime. A formula for the density of such primes is given in a more general setting using a new approach. This method uses the Ramanujan-Fourier series for a modified von Mangoldt function. The proof remains heuristic as interchange of certain limits has not been justified. Experimental evidence using computer calculations is provided for the plausibility of the result.
