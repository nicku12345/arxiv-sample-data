The main result of this paper is a new version of Newton-Hensel lifting that relates to interpolation questions. It allows one to lift polynomials in Z[x] from information modulo a prime number p\ne 2 to a power p^k for any k, and its originality is that it is a mixed version that not only lifts the coefficients of the polynomial but also its exponents. We show that this result corresponds exactly to a Newton-Hensel lifting of a system of 2t generalized equations in 2t unknowns in the ring of p-adic integers \Z_p. Finally we apply our results to sparse polynomial interpolation in \Z[x]
