In this article we give a Galois-theoretic characterization of the canonical theta structure. The Galois property of the canonical theta structure translates into certain p-adic theta relations which are satisfied by the canonical theta null point of the canonical lift. As an application we give a purely algebraic proof of some 2-adic theta identities which describe the set of theta null points of the canonical lifts of ordinary abelian varieties in characteristic 2. The latter theta relations are suitable for explicit canonical lifting.
