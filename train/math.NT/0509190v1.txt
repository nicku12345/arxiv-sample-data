We are concerned here with Lehmer's problem in dimension 2 ; we give a lower bound for the height of a non-torsion point of G\_m^2 on a non-torsion curve defined over Q, depending on the degree of the curve only. We have first been inspired by \cite{Am-Da3}; we develop a new approach, inherent in the dimension two (or more precisely the codimension two), and then obtain a better result where the error's term is improved significantly, moreover we give an explicit expression for the constant.
