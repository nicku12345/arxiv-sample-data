We reduce the leading term in Lehman's theorem. This improved estimate allows us to refine the main theorem of Bays and Hudson. Entering 2,000,000 Riemann zeros, we prove that there exists x in the interval [exp(727.951858), exp(727.952178)] for which \pi(x)-\li(x) > 3.2 \times 10^{151}. There are at least 10^{154} successive integers x in this interval for which \pi(x)>\li(x). This interval is strictly a sub-interval of the interval in Bays and Hudson, and is narrower by a factor of about 12.
