In this paper we establish a formula for the average of representation numbers of ternary quadratic forms in a spinor genus over a totally real number field.   The significant fact about the formula is the fact that it is given in terms of local quantities. Such a formula has already been established by Kneser, Hsia, and Schulze-Pillot, by a different method.
