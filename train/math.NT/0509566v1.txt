Let E be an elliptic curve over Q, and \tau an Artin representation over Q that factors through the non-abelian extension Q(\sqrt[p^n]{m},\mu_{p^n})/Q, where p is an odd prime and n,m are positive integers. We show that L(E,\tau,1), the special value at s=1 of the L-function of the twist of E by \tau, divided by the classical transcendental period \Omega_{+}^{d^+}|\Omega_{-}^{d^-}|\epsilon(\tau) is algebraic and Galois-equivariant, as predicted by Deligne's conjecture.
