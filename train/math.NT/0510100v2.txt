We prove that if the signed binomial coefficient (-1)^i\binom{k}{i} viewed modulo p is a periodic function of i with period h prime to p in the range 0\le i\le k, then k+1 is a power of p, provided h is not too large compared to k. (In particular, 2h\le k suffices.) As an application, we prove that if G and H are multiplicative subgroups of a finite field, with H<G, and such that 1-\alpha\in G for all \alpha\in G\setminus H, then G\cup\{0\} is a subfield.
