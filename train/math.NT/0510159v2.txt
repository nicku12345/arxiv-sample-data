We consider random Fibonacci sequences given by x_{n+1}=\pm \beta x_{n}+x_{n-1}. Viswanath (\cite{viswanath}), following Furstenberg (\cite{furst}) showed that when \beta = 1, \lim_{n\to \infty}|x_{n}|^{1/n}=1.13..., but his proof involves the use of floating point computer calculations. We give a completely elementary proof that 1.25577 \ge (E(|x_{n}|))^{1/n} \ge 1.12095 where E(|x_{n}|) is the expected value for the absolute value of the nth term in a random Fibonacci sequence. We compute this expected value using recurrence relations which bound the sum of all possible nth terms for such sequences. In addition, we give upper an lower
