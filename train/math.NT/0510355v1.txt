Our main result is elementary and concerns the relationship between the multiplicative groups of the coordinate and endomorphism rings of the formal additive group over a field of characteristic p>0. The proof involves the combinatorics of base p representations of positive integers in a striking way. We apply the main result to construct a canonical quotient of the module of Coleman power series over the Iwasawa algebra when the base local field is of characteristic p. This gives information in a situation which apparently has never previously been investigated.
