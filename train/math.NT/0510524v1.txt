The main purpose of this paper is to present a systemic study of some families of multiple q-Euler numbers and polynomials. In particular, by using the q-Volkenborn integration on \Bbb Z_p, we construct p-adic q-Euler numbers and polynomials of higher order. We also define new generating functions of multiple q-Euler numbers and polynomials. Furthermore, we construct Euler q-Zeta function. This paper is the version of the preprint of my paper to publish in the special issues as the preprint part of this proceedings.
