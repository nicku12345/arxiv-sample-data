Let L(s,\chi) be the Dirichlet L-function associated to a non-principal primitive character \chi modulo q with 3\le q \le 400\,000. We prove a new explicit zero-free region for L(s,\chi): L(s,\chi) does not vanish in the region \Re s \ge 1-\frac1{R \log \left(q\max(1,| \Im s|)\right) } with R=5.60. This improves a result of McCurley where 9.65 was shown to be an admissible value for R.
