We define a variant of normal basis, called a {\em Galois scaffolding}, that allows for an easy determination of valuation, and has implications for Galois module structure. We identify fully ramified, elementary abelian extensions of local function fields of characteristic p, called {\em one-dimensional}, that, in a particular sense, are as simple as cyclic degree p extensions, and prove the statement in the title above.
