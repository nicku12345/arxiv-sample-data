In the paper we prove an explicit formula for the central values of certain Rankin L-functions. These L-functions are L-functions of Hilbert newforms over a totally real field F, twisted by unitary Hecke characters of a totally imaginary quadratic extension of F. The formula generalizes our former result on L-functions twisted by finite characters. It also eliminates the restriction on ramifications of Popa's paper.
