In this study, we construct the two-variable multiple Dirichlet q-L-function and two-variable multiple Dirichlet type Changhee q-L-function. These functions interpolate the q-Bernoulli polynomials and generalized Changhee q-Bernoulli polynomials. By using the Mellin transformation, we give an integral representation for the two-variable multiple Dirichlet type q-zeta function and the two variable multiple Dirichlet type Changhee q-L-function.
