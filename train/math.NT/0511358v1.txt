Let F_Q be the set of Farey fractions of order Q. Given the integers \d\ge 2 and 0\le \c \le \d-1, let F_Q(c,d) be the subset of F_Q of those fractions whose denominators are \equiv c \pmod d, arranged in ascending order. The problem we address here is to show that as Q\to\infty, there exists a limit probability measuring the distribution of s-tuples of consecutive denominators of fractions in F_Q(c,d). This shows that the clusters of points (q_0/Q,q_1/Q,...,q_s/Q)\in[0,1]^{s+1}, where q_0,q_1,...,q_s are consecutive denominators of members of F_Q produce a limit set, denoted by D(c,d). The shape and the structure of this set are presented in several particular cases.
