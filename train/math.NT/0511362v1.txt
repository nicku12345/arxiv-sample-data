Let F_Q be the Farey sequence of order Q and let F_{Q,o} and F_{Q,e} be the set of those Farey fractions of order Q with odd, respectively even denominators. A fundamental property of F_Q says that the sum of denominators of any pair of neighbor fractions is always greater than Q. This property fails for F_{Q,o} and for F_{Q,e}. The local density, as Q\to\infty, of the normalized pairs (q'/Q,q''/Q), where q',q'' are denominators of consecutive fractions in F_{Q,o}, was computed previously. The density increases over a series of quadrilateral steps ascending in a harmonic series towards the point (1,1). Numerical computations for small values of Q suggest that such a result should rather occur in the even case, while in the odd case the distribution of the corresponding points appears to be more uniform. Reconciling with the numerical experiments, in this paper we show that, as Q\to\infty, the local densities in the odd and even case coincide.
