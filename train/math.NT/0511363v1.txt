The spacing distribution between Farey points has drawn attention in recent years. It was found that the gaps \gamma_{j+1}-\gamma_j between consecutive elements of the Farey sequence produce, as Q\to\infty, a limiting measure. Numerical computations suggest that for any d\ge 2, the gaps \gamma_{j+d}-\gamma_j also produce a limiting measure whose support is distinguished by remarkable topological features. Here we prove the existence of the spacing distribution for d=2 and characterize completely the corresponding support of the measure.
