The purpose of this paper is to define generalized twisted q-Bernoulli numbers by using p-adic q-integrals. Furthermore, we construct a q-analogue of the p-adic generalized twisted L-functions which interpolate generalized twisted q-Bernoulli numbers. This is the generalization of Kim's h-extension of p-adic q-L-function which was constructed in [5] and is a partial answer for the open question which was remained in [3]
