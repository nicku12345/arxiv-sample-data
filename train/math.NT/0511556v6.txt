For a local field K and n \geq 2, let \Xi_n and \Delta_n denote the affine buildings naturally associated to the special linear and symplectic groups \SL_n(K) and \Sp_n(K), respectively. We relate the number of vertices in \Xi_n (n \geq 3) close (i.e., gallery distance 1) to a given vertex in \Xi_n to the number of chambers in \Xi_n containing the given vertex, proving a conjecture of Schwartz and Shemanske. We then consider the special vertices in \Delta_n (n \geq 2) close to a given special vertex in \Delta_n (all the vertices in \Xi_n are special) and establish analogues of our results for \Delta_n.
