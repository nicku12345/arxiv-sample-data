We discuss the formalism of Iwasawa theory descent in the setting of the localized K_1-groups of Fukaya and Kato. We then prove interpolation formulas for the `leading terms' of the global Zeta isomorphisms that are associated to certain Tate motives and of the p-adic L-functions that are associated to certain critical motives.
