We obtain lower bounds for Selmer ranks of elliptic curves over dihedral extensions of number fields.   Suppose K/k is a quadratic extension of number fields, E is an elliptic curve defined over k, and p is an odd prime. Let F denote the maximal abelian p-extension of K that is unramified at all primes where E has bad reduction and that is Galois over k with dihedral Galois group (i.e., the generator c of Gal(K/k) acts on Gal(F/K) by -1). We prove (under mild hypotheses on p) that if the rank of the pro-p Selmer group S_p(E/K) is odd, then the rank of S_p(E/L) is at least [L:K] for every finite extension L of K in F.
