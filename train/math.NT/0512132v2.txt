Let N \geq 2 be an integer, F a quadratic form in N variables over \bar{\mathbb Q}, and Z \subseteq \bar{\mathbb Q}^N an L-dimensional subspace, 1 \leq L \leq N. We prove the existence of a small-height maximal totally isotropic subspace of the bilinear space (Z,F). This provides an analogue over \bar{\mathbb Q} of a well-known theorem of Vaaler proved over number fields. We use our result to prove an effective version of Witt decomposition for a bilinear space over \bar{\mathbb Q}. We also include some related effective results on orthogonal decomposition and structure of isometries for a bilinear space over \bar{\mathbb Q}. This extends previous results of the author over number fields. All bounds on height are explicit.
