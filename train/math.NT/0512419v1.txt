In this paper we present some new results about unlike powers in arithmetic progression. We prove among other things that for given k\geq 4 and L\geq 3 there are only finitely many arithmetic progressions of the form (x_0^{l_0},x_1^{l_1},...,x_{k-1}^{l_{k-1}}) with x_i\in{\Bbb Z}, gcd(x_0,x_1)=1 and 2\leq l_i\leq L for i=0,1,...,k-1. Furthermore, we show that, for L=3, the progression (1,1,...,1) is the only such progression up to sign.
