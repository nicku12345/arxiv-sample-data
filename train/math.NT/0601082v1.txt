We prove several identities relating three-variable Mahler measures to integrals of inverse trigonometric functions. After deriving closed forms for most of these integrals, we obtain ten explicit formulas for three-variable Mahler measures. Several of these results generalize formulas due to Condon and Lal\'in. As a corollary, we also obtain three q-series expansions for the dilogarithm.
