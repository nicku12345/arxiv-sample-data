Let k be a local field of positive characteristic. Let L be a cocompact discrete subgroup of k. Let U be an open compact subgroup of k. Let \ell, u and a be elements of k, with a nonzero. We study the behavior of the product \prod_{0\neq x\in (\ell+L)\cap a(u+U)}x as a varies. Our main result, which blends harmonic analysis and local class field theory, provides local confirmation of a conjecture concerning global function fields recently made by the author (math.NT/0407535).
