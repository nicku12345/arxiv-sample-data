We study one-parameter families of S-unit equations of the form f(t)u+g(t)v=h(t), where f, g, and h are univariate polynomials over a number field, t is an S-integer, and u and v are S-units. For many possible choices of f, g, and h, we are able to determine all but finitely many solutions to the corresponding one-parameter family of S-unit equations. The results are obtained as consequences of some recent results on integral points on surfaces.
