In cyclic, degree 8 extensions of algebraic number fields N/K, ambiguous ideals in N are canonical \mathbb{Z}[C_8]-modules. Their \mathbb{Z}[C_8]-structure is determined here. It is described in terms of indecomposable modules and determined by ramification invariants. Although infinitely many indecomposable \mathbb{Z}[C_8]-modules are available (classification by Yakovlev), only 23 appear.
