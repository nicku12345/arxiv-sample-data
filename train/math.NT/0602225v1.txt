The convergence theory for the set of simultaneously \psi-approximable points lying on a planar curve is established. Our results complement the divergence theory developed in `Diophantine approximation on planar curves and the distribution of rational points' (by V. Beresnevich, H. Dickinson, and S. Velani, with an Appendix: `Sums of two squares near perfect squares' by R.C. Vaughan, To appear: Annals of Math., Pre-print: arkiv:math.NT/0401148, (2004), 1-52.) and thereby completes the general metric theory for planar curves.
