We describe the additive structure of the graded ring \widetilde{M}_* of quasimodular forms over any discrete and cocompact group \Gamma \subset \rm{PSL}(2, \RM). We show that this ring is never finitely generated. We calculate the exact number of new generators in each weight k. This number is constant for k sufficiently large and equals \dim_{\CM}(I / I \cap \widetilde{I}^2), where I and \widetilde{I} are the ideals of modular forms and quasimodular forms, respectively, of positive weight. We show that \widetilde{M}_* is contained in some finitely generated ring \widetilde{R}_* of meromorphic quasimodular forms with \dim \widetilde{R}_k = O(k^2), i.e. the same order of growth as \widetilde{M}_*.
