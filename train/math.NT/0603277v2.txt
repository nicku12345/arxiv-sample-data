We give a proof of the irrationality of the p-adic zeta-values \zeta_p(k) for p=2,3 and k=2,3. Such results were recently obtained by F.Calegari as an application of overconvergent p-adic modular forms. In this paper we present an approach using classical continued fractions discovered by Stieltjes. In addition we show irrationality of some other p-adic L-series values, and values of the p-adic Hurwitz zeta-function.
