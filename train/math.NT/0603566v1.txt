This is basically a summary of [Mu]. The focus of the paper is the explicit computation of Hecke operators for period functions. In particular we compute the matrix representations of the 2nd Hecke operator on period functions for the full modular group SL(2,Z) and the congruence subgroup \Gamma_0(2).
