Let \GN\leq\SLR be a genus zero Fuchsian group of the first kind with \infty as a cusp, and let \Ek be the holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight 2k on \GN that is nonvanishing at \infty and vanishes at all the other cusps (provided that such an Eisenstein series exists). Under certain assumptions on \GN, and on a choice of a fundamental domain \F, we prove that all but possibly c(\GN,\F) of the non-trivial zeros of \Ek lie on a certain subset of \{z\in\mathfrak{H} : \JN(z)\in\mathbb{R}\}. Here c(\GN,\F) is a constant that does not depend on the weight 2k and \JN is the canonical hauptmodul for \GN.
