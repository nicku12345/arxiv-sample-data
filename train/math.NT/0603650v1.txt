We study \alpha-adic expansions of numbers in an extension field, that is to say, left infinite representations of numbers in the positional numeration system with the base \alpha, where \alpha is an algebraic conjugate of a Pisot number \beta. Based on a result of Bertrand and Schmidt, we prove that a number belongs to \mathbb{Q}(\alpha) if and only if it has an eventually periodic \alpha-expansion. Then we consider \alpha-adic expansions of elements of the extension ring \mathbb{Z}[\alpha^{-1}] when \beta satisfies the so-called Finiteness property (F). In the particular case that \beta is a quadratic Pisot unit, we inspect the unicity and/or multiplicity of \alpha-adic expansions of elements of \mathbb{Z}[\alpha^{-1}]. We also provide algorithms to generate \alpha-adic expansions of rational numbers.
