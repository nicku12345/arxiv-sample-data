We derive an expression for the value \zeta_Q(3) of the spectral zeta function \zeta_Q(s) studied by Ichinose and Wakayama for the non-commutative harmonic oscillator defined in the work of Parmeggiani and Wakayama using a Gaussian hypergeometric function. In this study, two sequences of rational numbers, denoted J_2(n) and J_3(n), which can be regarded as analogues of the Ap\'ery numbers, naturally arise and play a key role in obtaining the expressions for the values \zeta_Q(2) and \zeta_Q(3). We also show that the numbers J_2(n) and J_3(n) have congruence relations like those of the Ap\'ery numbers.
