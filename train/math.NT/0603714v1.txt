We give a factorization of averages of Borcherds forms over CM points associated to a quadratic form of signature (n,2). As a consequence of this result, we are able to state a theorem like that of Gross and Zagier about which primes can occur in this factorization. One remarkable phenomenon we observe is that the regularized theta lift of a weakly holomorphic modular form is always finite.
