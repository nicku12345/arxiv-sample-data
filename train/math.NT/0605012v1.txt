We initiate a study of the spectral theory of the locally symmetric space X=\Gamma\backslash G/K, where G=SO(3,Complex), \Gamma=SO(3,Z[i]), K=SO{3}. We write down explicit equations defining a fundamental domain for the action of \Gamma on G/K. The fundamental domain is well-adapted for studying the theory of \Gamma-invariant functions on G/K. We write down equations defining a fundamental domain for the subgroup \Gamma_Z=\SO(2,1)_Z of \Gamma acting on the symmetric space G_R/K_R, where G_R is the split real form \SO(2,1) of G and K_R is its maximal compact subgroup \SO(2). We formulate a simple geometric relation between the fundamental domains of \Gamma and \Gamma_Z so described. We then use the previous results compute the covolumes of of the lattices \Gamma and \Gamma_Z in G and G_R.
