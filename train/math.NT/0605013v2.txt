Let G=SO(3,C), \Gamma=SO(3,Z[i]), K=SO(3), and let X be the locally symmetric space \Gamma\backslash G/K. In this paper, we write down explicit equations defining a fundamental domain for the action of \Gamma on G/K. The fundamental domain is well-adapted for studying the theory of \Gamma-invariant functions on G/K. We write down equations defining a fundamental domain for the subgroup \Gamma_Z=SO(2,1)_Z of \Gamma acting on the symmetric space G_{R}/K_R, where G_R is the split real form SO(2,1) of G and K_R is its maximal compact subgroup SO(2). We formulate a simple geometric relation between the fundamental domain of \Gamma and \Gamma_Z so described. These fundamental domains are geared towards the detailed study of the spectral theory of X and the embedded subspace X_R=\Gamma_Z\backslash G_R/K_R.}
