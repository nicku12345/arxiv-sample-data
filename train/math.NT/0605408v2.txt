At the end of the twentieth century, J.-B. Bost developped a slope theory of hermitian vector bundles over number fields. A new method of diophantine approximation, the so-called slope method, has emerged from his research. Our article proposes a generalisation to adelic vector bundles over global fields. The norms at the archimedean places are no longer supposed to be hermitian. The link with adelic successive minima is also mentioned. To get these results, we use several concepts from the geometry of finite dimensional Banach spaces.
