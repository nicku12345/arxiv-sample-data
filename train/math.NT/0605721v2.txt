This paper gives a survey of known results concerning the Laplace transform  L_k(s) := \int_0^\infty |\zeta(1/2+ ix)|^{2k}{\rm e}^{-sx}{\rm d} x \qquad(k \in N, \R s > 0),  and the (modified) Mellin transform  {\cal Z}_k(s) := \int_1^\infty|\zeta(1/2+ ix)|^{2k}x^{-s}{\rm d} x\qquad(k\in N),  where the integral is absolutely convergent for \R s \ge c(k) > 1. Also some new results on these integral transforms of |\zeta(1/2+ ix)|^{2k} are given, which have important connections with power moments of the Riemann zeta-function \zeta(s).
