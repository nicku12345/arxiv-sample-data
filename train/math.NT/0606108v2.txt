We give a self-contained proof of local class field theory, via Lubin-Tate theory and the Hasse-Arf theorem, refining the arguments of Iwasawa's book.   In the revised version, (i) positive characteristic case is included, (ii) the proof of base change is simplified, (iii) the construction of Artin map is simplified, and strengthened so that we start with an arbitrary Lubin-Tate group over complete maximal unramified extension.
