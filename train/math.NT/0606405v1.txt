Given two elliptic curves defined over a number field K, not both with j-invariant zero, we show that there are infinitely many D\in K^\times with pairwise distinct image in  K^\times/{K^\times}^2 , such that the quadratic twist of both curves by D have positive Mordell-Weil rank. The proof depends on relating the values of pairs of cubic polynomials to rational points on another elliptic curve, and on a fiber product construction.
