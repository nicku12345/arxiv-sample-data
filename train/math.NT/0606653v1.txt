In connection with each global field of positive characteristic we exhibit many examples of two-variable algebraic functions possessing properties consistent with a conjectural refinement of the Stark conjecture in the function field case recently proposed by the author (math.NT/0407535). Most notably, all examples are Coleman units. We obtain our results by studying rank one shtukas in which both zero and pole are generic, i.~e., shtukas not associated to any Drinfeld module.
