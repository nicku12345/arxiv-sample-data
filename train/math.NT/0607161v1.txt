We discuss modular forms as objects of computer algebra and as elements of certain p-adic Banach modules. Problem-solving approach in number theory is discussed which is based on the use of generating functions and their links with modular forms. In particular, the critical values of various L-functions of modular forms produce non-trivial but computable solutions of arithmetical problems. Namely, for a prime number p\ge 5, we consider three classical cusp eigenforms f_j(z)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{n,j}e(nz)\in \Sr_{k_j}(N_j, \psi_j),\ (j=1, 2,3) of weights k_1, k_2, k_3, of conductors N_1, N_2, N_3, and of nebentypus characters \psi_j \bmod N_j. According to H.Hida \cite{Hi86} and R.Coleman \cite{CoPB}, one can include each f_j (j=1, 2, 3) (under suitable assumptions on p and on f_j) into a p-adic analytic family k_j{}\mapsto \{f_{j,k_j{}}= \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{n}(f_{j, k_j{}})q^n\} of cusp eigenforms f_{j,k_j{}} of weights k_j{} in such a way that f_{j,k_j}=f_j, and that all their Fourier coefficients a_n(f_{j, k_j{}}) are given by certain p-adic analytic functions k_j{}\mapsto a_{n, j}(k_j{}). The purpose of this paper is to describe a four variable p-adic L-function attached to Garrett's triple product of three Coleman's families k_j{}\mapsto \left \{f_{j,k_j{}}= \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{n,j}(k{}) q^n\right \} of cusp eigenforms of three fixed slopes \sigma_j=v_p(\alpha_{p, j}^{(1)}(k_j{}))\ge 0, where \alpha_{p,j}^{(1)} = \al_{p,j}^{(1)}(k_j{}) is an eigenvalue (which depends on k_j{}) of Atkin's operator U=U_p acting on Fourier expansions by U(\sum_{n\ge 0}^\infty a_{n}q^n) = \sum_{n \ge 0}^\infty a_{np} q^n.
