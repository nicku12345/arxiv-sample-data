For a prime number p\ge 5, we consider three classical cusp eigenforms f_j(z) of weights k_1, k_2, k_3, of conductors N_1, N_2, N_3, and of nebentypus characters \psi_j \bmod N_j. According to H.Hida and R.Coleman, one can include each f_j into a {p-adic analytic family} k_j \mapsto \{f_{j,k_j}\} of cusp eigenforms f_{j,k_j} of weights k_j in such a way that f_{j,k_j}=f_j, and that all their Fourier coefficients a_n(f_{j, k_j}) are given by certain p-adic analytic functions k_j{}\mapsto a_{n, j}(k_j{}). The purpose of this paper is to describe a four variable p-adic L-function attached to Garrett's triple product of three Coleman's families k_j \mapsto \{f_{j,k_j}\} of cusp eigenforms of three fixed slopes \sigma_j=v_p(\alpha_{p, j}^{(1)}(k_j{}))\ge 0 where \alpha_{p,j}^{(1)} = \al_{p,j}^{(1)}(k_j{}) is an eigenvalue (which depends on k_j{}) of Atkin's operator U=U_p acting on Fourier expansions by U(\sum_{n\ge 0}^\infty a_{n}q^n) = \sum_{n \ge 0}^\infty a_{np} q^n. We consider the p-adic weight space X containing all (k{}_j, \psi_j). Our p-adic L-functions are Mellin transforms of certain measures with values in \Ar, where \Ar=\Ar({\cal B}) denotes an affinoid algebra associated with an affinoid space {\cal B} as in \cite{CoPB}, where {\cal B}={\cal B}_1\times{\cal B}_2\times{\cal B}_3, is an affinoid neighbourhood around (k_1, k_2, k_3)\in X^3 (with a given integers k_j and fixed Dirichlet characters \psi_j \bmod N). We construct such a measure from higher twists of classical Siegel-Eisenstein series, which produce distributions with values in certain Banach \Ar-modules \Mr = \Mr(N;\Ar) of triple modular forms with coefficients in the algebra \Ar.
