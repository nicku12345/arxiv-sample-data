Let e>=1 and b>=2 be integers. For a positive integer n=\sum_{j=0}^ka_jb^j with 0<=a_j<b, define T_{e,b}(n)=\sum_{j=0}^ka_j^e. n is called (e,b)-happy if T_{e,b}^r(n)=1 for some r>=0, where T_{e,b}^r is the r-th iteration of T_{e,b}. In this paper, we prove that there exist arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive (e,b)-happy numbers provided that e-1 is not divisible by p-1 for any prime divisor p of b-1.
