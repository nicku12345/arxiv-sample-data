We study some arithmetic properties of the Ramanujan function \tau(n), such as the largest prime divisor P(\tau(n)) and the number of distinct prime divisors \omega(\tau(n)) of \tau(n) for various sequences of n. In particular, we show that \hbox{P(\tau(n)) \geq (\log n)^{33/31 + o(1)}} for infinitely many n, and \begin{equation*} P(\tau(p)\tau(p^2)\tau(p^3)) > (1+o(1))\frac{\log\log p\log\log\log p} {\log\log\log\log p} \end{equation*} for every prime p with \hbox{\tau(p)\neq 0}.
