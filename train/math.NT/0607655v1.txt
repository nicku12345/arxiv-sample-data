Let p and l be rational primes such that l is odd and the order of p modulo l is even. For such primes p and l, and for e=l, 2l, we consider the non-singular projective curves aY^e = bX^e + cZ^e (abc \neq 0) defined over finite fields \mathbf{F}_q such that q=p^\alpha \equiv 1(\bmod {e}). We see that the Fermat curves correspond precisely to those curves among each class (for e=l,2l), that are maximal or minimal over \mathbf{F}_q. We observe that each Fermat prime gives rise to explicit maximal and minimal curves over finite fields of characteristic 2. For e=2l, we explicitly determine the \zeta-function(s) for this class of curves, over \mathbf{F}_q, as rational functions in the variable t, for distinct cases of a,b, and c, in \mathbf{F}_q^*. The \zeta-function in each case is seen to satisfy the Weil conjectures (now theorems) for this concrete class of curves.
