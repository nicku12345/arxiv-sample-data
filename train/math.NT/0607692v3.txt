We show that for any fixed \eps>0, there are numbers \delta>0 and p_0\ge 2 with the following property: for every prime p\ge p_0 and every integer N such that p^{1/(4\sqrt{e})+\eps}\le N\le p, the sequence 1,2,...,N contains at least \delta N quadratic non-residues modulo p. We use this result to obtain strong upper bounds on the sizes of the least quadratic non-residues in Beatty and Piatetski--Shapiro sequences.
