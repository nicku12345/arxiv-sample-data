We consider the infinite sequences (A\_n)\_{n\in\NN} of 2\times2 matrices with nonnegative entries, where the A\_n are taken in a finite set of matrices. Given a vector V=\pmatrix{v\_1\cr v\_2} with v\_1,v\_2>0, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for \displaystyle{A\_1... A\_nV\over|| A\_1... A\_nV||} to converge uniformly. In application we prove that the Bernoulli convolutions related to the numeration in Pisot quadratic bases are weak Gibbs.
