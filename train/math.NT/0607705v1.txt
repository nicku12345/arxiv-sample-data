We study the selfsimilarity and the Gibbs properties of several measures defined on the product space \Omega\_r:=\{0,1,...,\break r-1\}^{\mathbb N}. This space can be identified with the interval [0,1] by means of the numeration in base r. The last section is devoted to the Bernoulli convolution in base \beta={1+\sqrt5\over2}, called the Erd\H os measure, and its analogue in base -\beta=-{1+\sqrt5\over2}, that we study by means of a suitable system of numeration.
