We investigate the relation between the Riesz and the Baez-Duarte criterion for the Riemann Hypothesis. In particular we present the relation between the function R(x) appearing in the Riesz criterion and the sequence c_k appearing in the Baez-Duarte formulation. It is shown that R(x) can expressed by c_k and vice versa the sequence c_k can be obtained from the values of R(x) at integer arguments. We give also some relations involving c_k and R(x), in particular value of the alternating sum of c_k.
