For an elliptic curve E over \ratq and an integer r let \pi_E^r(x) be the number of primes p\le x of good reduction such that the trace of the Frobenius morphism of E/\fie_p equals r. We consider the quantity \pi_E^r(x) on average over certain sets of elliptic curves. More in particular, we establish the following: If A,B>x^{1/2+\epsilon} and AB>x^{3/2+\epsilon}, then the arithmetic mean of \pi_E^r(x) over all elliptic curves E : y^2=x^3+ax+b with a,b\in \intz, |a|\le A and |b|\le B is \sim C_r\sqrt{x}/\log x, where C_r is some constant depending on r. This improves a result of C. David and F. Pappalardi. Moreover, we establish an ``almost-all'' result on \pi_E^r(x).
