We obtain asymptotic formulae for the number of primes p\le x for which the reduction modulo p of the elliptic curve  \E_{a,b} : Y^2 = X^3 + aX + b  satisfies certain ``natural'' properties, on average over integers a and b with |a|\le A and |b| \le B, where A and B are small relative to x. Specifically, we investigate behavior with respect to the Sato--Tate conjecture, cyclicity, and divisibility of the number of points by a fixed integer m.
