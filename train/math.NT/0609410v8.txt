Let p be an irregular prime. Let K=\Q(\zeta) be the p-cyclotomic field.   From Kummer and class field theory, there exist Galois extensions S/\Q of degree p(p-1) such that S/K is a cyclic unramified extension of degree [S:K]=p. We give an algebraic construction of the subfields M of S with degree [M:\Q]=p and an explicit formula for the prime decomposition and ramification of the prime number p in the extensions S/K, M/\Q and S/M. In the last section, we examine the consequences of these results for the Vandiver's conjecture. This article is at elementary level on Classical Algebraic Number Theory.
