The main results of this article concern the definition of a compactly supported cohomology class for the congruence group \Gamma_0(p^n) with values in the second Milnor K-group (modulo 2-torsion) of the ring of p-integers of the cyclotomic extension \Q(\mu_{p^n}). We endow this cohomology group with a natural action of the standard Hecke operators and discuss the existence of special Hecke eigenclasses in its parabolic cohomology. Moreover, for n=1, assuming the non-degeneracy of a certain pairing on p-units induced by the Steinberg symbol when (p,k) is an irregular pair, i.e. p|\frac{B_k}{k}, we show that the values of the above pairing are congruent mod p to the L-values of a weight k, level 1 cusp form which satisfies Eisenstein-type congruences mod p, a result that was predicted by a conjecture of R.
