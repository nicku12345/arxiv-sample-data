Let p be an odd prime. Let F_p^* be the no-null part of the finite field of p elements. Let K=\Q(zeta) be a p-cyclotomic field and O_K be its ring of integers. Let pi be the prime ideal of K lying over p. Let sigma : zeta --> zeta^v be the Q-isomorphism of K for a primitive root v mod p.   The subgroup of exponent p of the class group of K can be seen as a direct sum oplus_{i=1}^r Gamma_i of groups of order p where the group Gamma_i is annihilated by a polynomial sigma-mu_i with mu_i \in F_p^*. Let Gamma be one of the Gamma_i. From Kummer, there exist prime non-principal prime ideals Q of inertial degree 1 with Cl(Q) \in Gamma. We show that there exists singular semi-primary integers A such that A O_K= Q^p with A^{sigma-mu} = alpha^p where alpha in K. Let E = \frac{alpha^p}{\bar{\alpha}^p}-1 and nu the positive integer defined by nu = v_pi(E) -(p-1), where v_pi(.) is the pi-adic valuation. The aims of this article are to describe the pi-adic expansions of the Gauss Sum g(Q) and of E and to derive an upper bound of nu from the Jacobi resolvents and Kummer-Stickelberger relation of the cyclotomic field K.
