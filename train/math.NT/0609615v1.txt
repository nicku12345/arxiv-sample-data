Let q_n denote the n^{th} number that is a product of exactly two distinct primes. We prove that   \liminf_{n\to \infty} (q_{n+1}-q_n) \le 6.   This sharpens an earlier result of the authors (arXivMath NT/0506067), which had 26 in place of 6. More generally, we prove that if \nu is any positive integer, then    \liminf_{n\to \infty} (q_{n+\nu}-q_n) \le C(\nu) = \nu e^{\nu-\gamma} (1+o(1)).   We also prove several other results on the representation of numbers with exactly two prime factors by linear forms.
