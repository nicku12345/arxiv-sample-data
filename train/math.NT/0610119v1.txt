In this note we study an analogy between a positive definite quadratic form for elliptic curves over finite fields and a positive definite quadratic form for elliptic curves over the rational number field. A question is posed of which an affirmative answer would imply the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis for elliptic curves over the rational number field.
