An explicit Dirichlet series is obtained, which represents an analytic function of s in the half-plane \Re s>1/2 except for having simple poles at points s_j that correspond to exceptional eigenvalues \lambda_j of the non-Euclidean Laplacian for Hecke congruence subgroups \Gamma_0(N) by the relation \lambda_j=s_j(1-s_j) for j=1,2,..., S. Coefficients of the Dirichlet series involve all class numbers h_d of real quadratic number fields. But, only the terms with h_d\gg d^{1/2-\epsilon} for sufficiently large discriminants d contribute to the residues m_j/2 of the Dirichlet series at the poles s_j, where m_j is the multiplicity of the eigenvalue \lambda_j for j=1,2,..., S. This may indicate (I'm not able to prove yet) that the multiplicity of exceptional eigenvalues can be arbitrarily large. On the other hand, by density theorem [3] the multiplicity of exceptional eigenvalues is bounded above by a constant depending only on N.
