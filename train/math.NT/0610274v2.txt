The integer d is called an exponential divisor of n=\prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{a_i}>1 if d=\prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{c_i}, where c_i \mid a_i for every 1\le i \le r. The integers n=\prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{a_i}, m=\prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{b_i}>1 having the same prime factors are called exponentially coprime if (a_i,b_i)=1 for every 1\le i\le r.   In the paper we investigate asymptotic properties of certain arithmetic functions involving exponential divisors and exponentially coprime integers.
