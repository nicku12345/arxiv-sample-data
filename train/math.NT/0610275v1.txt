The integers n=\prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{a_i} and m=\prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{b_i} having the same prime factors are called exponentially coprime if (a_i,b_i)=1 for every 1\le i\le r. We estimate the number of pairs of exponentially coprime integers n,m\le x having the prime factors p_1,...,p_r and show that the asymptotic density of pairs of exponentially coprime integers having r fixed prime divisors is (\zeta(2))^{-r}.
