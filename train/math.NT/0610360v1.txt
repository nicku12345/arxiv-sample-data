We prove simple theorems concerning the maximal order of a large class of multiplicative functions. As an application, we determine the maximal orders of certain functions of the type \sigma_A(n)= \sum_{d\in A(n)} d, where A(n) is a subset of the set of all positive divisors of n, including the divisor-sum function \sigma(n) and its unitary and exponential analogues. We also give the minimal order of a new class of Euler-type functions, including the Euler-function \phi(n) and its unitary analogue.
