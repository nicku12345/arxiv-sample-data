We determine the asymptotic density \delta_k of the set of ordered k-tuples (n_1,...,n_k)\in \N^k, k\ge 2, such that there exists no prime power p^a, a\ge 1, appearing in the canonical factorization of each n_i, 1\le i\le k, and deduce asymptotic formulae with error terms regarding this problem and analogous ones. We give numerical approximations of the constants \delta_k and improve the error term of formula (1.2) due to {\sc E. Cohen}.   We point out that our treatment, based on certain inversion functions, is applicable also in case k=1 in order to establish asymptotic formulae with error terms regarding the densities of subsets of \N with additional multiplicative properties. These generalize an often cited result of {\sc G. J. Rieger}.
