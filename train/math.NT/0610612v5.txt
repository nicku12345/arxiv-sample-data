We consider the uniform distribution of solutions (x,y) to xy=N \mod a, and obtain a bound on the second moment of the number of solutions in squares of length approximately a^{1/2}. We use this to study a new factoring algorithm that factors N=UV provably in O(N^{1/3+\epsilon}) time, and discuss the potential for improving the runtime to sub-exponential.
