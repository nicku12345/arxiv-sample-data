We revisit the relation between the von Koch curve and the Thue-Morse sequence given in a recent paper of Ma and Goldener by relating their study to papers written by Coquet and Dekking at the beginning of the 80s. We also emphasize that more general links between fractal objects and automatic sequences can be found in the literature.
