Fix a prime N, and consider the action of the Hecke operator T_N on the space M_k(SL(2,Z)) of modular forms of full level and varying weight k. The coefficients of the matrix of T_N with respect to the basis {E_4^i E_6^j | 4i + 6j = k} for M_k(SL(2,Z)) can be combined for varying k into a generating function F_N. We show that this generating function is a rational function for all N, and present a systematic method for computing F_N. We carry out the computations for N = 2, 3, 5, and indicate and discuss generalizations to spaces of modular forms of arbitrary level.
