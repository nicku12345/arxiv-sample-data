In this paper we shall define the renormalization of the multiple q-zeta values (MqZV) which are special values of multiple q-zeta functions \zeta_q(s_1,...,s_d) when the arguments are all positive integers or all non-positive integers. This generalizes the work of Guo and Zhang (math.NT/0606076v3) on the renormalization of Euler-Zagier multiple zeta values. We show that our renormalization process produces the same values if the MqZVs are well-defined originally and that these renormalizations of MqZV satisfy the q-stuffle relations if we use shifted-renormalizations for all divergent \zeta_q(s_1,...,s_d) (i.e., s_1\le 1). Moreover, when \qup our renormalizations agree with those of Guo and Zhang.
