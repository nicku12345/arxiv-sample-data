Let f(x) be a monic polynomial in \dZ[x] with no rational roots but with roots in \dQ_p for all p, or equivalently, with roots mod n for all n. It is known that f(x) cannot be irreducible but can be a product of two or more irreducible polynomials, and that if f(x) is a product of m>1 irreducible polynomials, then its Galois group must be a union of conjugates of m proper subgroups. We prove that for any m>1, every finite solvable group which is a union of conjugates of m proper subgroups (where all these conjugates have trivial intersection) occurs as the Galois group of such a polynomial, and that the same result (with m=2) holds for all Frobenius groups. It is also observed that every nonsolvable Frobenius group is realizable as the Galois group of a geometric--i.e. regular-- extension of \dQ(t).
