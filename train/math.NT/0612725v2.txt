We introduce a new class of exponentials of Artin-Hasse type, called \boldsymbol{\pi}-exponentials. These exponentials depends on the choice of a generator \boldsymbol{\pi} of the Tate module of a Lubin-Tate group \mathfrak{G} over \mathbb{Z}_p. They arise naturally as solutions of solvable differential modules over the Robba ring. If \mathfrak{G} is isomorphic to \hat{\mathbb{G}}_m over \mathbb{Z}_p, we develop methods to test their over-convergence, and get in this way a stronger version of the Frobenius structure theorem for differential equations. We define a natural transformation of the Artin-Schreier complex into the Kummer complex. This provides an explicit generator of the Kummer unramified extension of \mathcal{E}^{\dag}_{K_{\infty}}, whose residue field is a given Artin-Schreier extension of k((t)), where k is the residue field of K. We then compute explicitely the group, under tensor product, of isomorphism classes of rank one solvable differential equations. Moreover, we get a canonical way to compute the rank one \phi-module over \mathcal{E}^{\dag}_{K_{\infty}} attached to a rank one representation of Gal(k((t))^{sep}/k((t))), defined by an Artin-Schreier character.
