We develop the theory of p-adic confluence of q-difference equations. The main result is the surprising fact that, in the p-adic framework, a function is solution of a differential equation if and only if it is solution of a q-difference equation. This fact implies an equivalence, called ``Confluence'', between the category of differential equations and those of q-difference equations. We obtain this result by introducing a category of ``sheaves'' on the disk \mathrm{D}^-(1,1), whose stalk at 1 is a differential equation, the stalk at q is a q-difference equation if q is not a root of unity \xi, and the stalk at a root of unity is a mixed object, formed by a differential equation and an action of \sigma_\xi.
