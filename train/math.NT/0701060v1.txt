Let k_{\infty} be a \Z_p^d-extension of a global function field k of characteristic p. Let \Cl_{k_{\infty},p} be the p completion of the class group of k_{\infty}. We prove that the characteristic ideal of the Galois module \Cl_{k_{\infty},p} is generated by the Stickelberger element of Gross which calculates the special values of L functions.
