(Below, \Box means "perfect square") Let P and Q be non-zero integers. The Lucas sequence \{U_n(P,Q)\} is defined by U_0=0, U_1=1, U_n=P U_{n-1}-Q U_{n-2}, (n \geq 2). Historically, there has been much interest in when the terms of such sequences are perfect squares (or higher powers). Here, we summarize results on this problem, and investigate for fixed k solutions of U_n(P,Q)= k\Box, (P,Q)=1. We show finiteness of the number of solutions, and under certain hypotheses on n, describe explicit methods for finding solutions. These involve solving finitely many Thue-Mahler equations. As an illustration of the methods, we find all solutions to U_n(P,Q)=k\Box where k=\pm1,\pm2, and n is a power of 2.
