In this paper we introduce a Daehee constant which is called q-extension of Napier constant, and consider Daehee formula associated with the qextensions of trigonometric functions. That is, we derive the q-extensions of sine and cosine functions from this Daehee formula. Finally, we give the q-calculus related to the q-extensions of sine and cosine functions.
