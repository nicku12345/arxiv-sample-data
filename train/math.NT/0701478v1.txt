In this note we consider a question of Ono, concerning which spaces of classical modular forms can be generated by sums of \eta-quotients. We give some new examples of spaces of modular forms which can be generated as sums of \eta-quotients, and show that we can write all modular forms of level \Gamma_0(N) as rational functions of \eta-products.
