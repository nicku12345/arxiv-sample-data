In this letter we show that for certain infinite families of modular forms of growing level it is possible to have a control result for the exceptional primes of the attached Galois representations. As an application, a uniform version of a result of Wiese on Galois realizations of linear groups over finite fields of arbitrarily large exponent is proved.
