In this paper we prove the weak local Tamagawa number conjecture for the remaining non-critical cases for the motives associated to Hecke characters \psi_{\theta}:\mathbb{A}_K\to K^* of the author's previous paper, where K is an imaginary quadratic field with cl(K)=1, under certain restrictions which originate mainly from the Iwasawa theory of imaginary quadratic fields.
