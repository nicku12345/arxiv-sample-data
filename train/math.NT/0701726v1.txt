We study the horizontal distribution of zeros of \zeta'(s) which are denoted as \rho'=\beta'+i\gamma'. We assume the Riemann hypothesis which implies \beta'\geqslant1/2 for any non-real zero \rho', equality being possible only at a multiple zero of \zeta(s). In this paper we prove that \liminf(\beta'-1/2)\log\gamma'\not=0 if and only if for any c>0 and s=\sigma+it with |\sigma-1/2|<c/\log t (t\geqslant10)  \frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}(s)=\frac{1}{s-\rho}+O(\log t),  where \rho=1/2+i\gamma is the closest zero of \zeta(s) to s and the origin. We also show that if \liminf(\beta'-1/2)\log\gamma'\not=0, then for any c>0 and s=\sigma+it (t\geqslant10), we have  \log\zeta(s)=O(\frac{(\log t)^{2-2\sigma}}{\log\log t})  uniformly for 1/2+c/\log t\leqslant\sigma\leqslant\sigma_1<1.
