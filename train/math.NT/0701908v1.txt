Zagier proved that the traces of singular values of the classical j-invariant are the Fourier coefficients of a weight 3/2 modular form and Duke provided a new proof of the result by establishing an exact formula for the traces using Niebur's work on a certain class of non-holomorphic modular forms. In this short note, by utilizing Niebur's work again, we generalize Duke's result to exact formulas for traces of singular moduli of higher level modular functions.
