In this paper, we study the Drinfeld cusp forms for \Gamma_1(T) and \Gamma(T) using Teitelbaum's interpretation as harmonic cocycles. We obtain explicit eigenvalues of Hecke operators associated to degree one prime ideals acting on the cusp forms for \Gamma_1(T) of small weights and conclude that these Hecke operators are simultaneously diagonalizable. We also show that the Hecke operators are not diagonalizable in general for \Gamma_1(T) of large weights, and not for \Gamma(T) even of small weights. The Hecke eigenvalues on cusp forms for \Gamma(T) with small weights are determined and the eigenspaces characterized.
