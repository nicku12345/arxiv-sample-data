For special d-dimensional hyperbolic shells E with  d\geq 5 we show that the number of lattice points in E intersected with a d-dimensional cube C_r of edge length r, can be approximated by the volume of E\cap C_r, as r tends to infinity, up to an error of order {\mathcal O}(r^{d-2}). We generalize results and techniques, used by F. G\"otze (2004), to a large class of {\em indefinite} quadratic forms and we provide explicit bounds for the errors in terms of certain Minkowski minima related to these quadratic forms. Furthermore, we obtain, as in the positive definite case, a result for multivariate diophantine approximation and for the maximal gap between values of such indefinite forms.
