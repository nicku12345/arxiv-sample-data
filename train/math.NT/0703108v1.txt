Estimating the discrepancy of the hypergraph of all arithmetic progressions in the set [N]=\{1,2,\hdots,N\} was one of the famous open problems in combinatorial discrepancy theory for a long time. An extension of this classical hypergraph is the hypergraph of sums of k (k\geq 1 fixed) arithmetic progressions. The hyperedges of this hypergraph are of the form A_{1}+A_{2}+\hdots+A_{k} in [N], where the A_{i} are arithmetic progressions. For this hypergraph Hebbinghaus (2004) proved a lower bound of \Omega(N^{k/(2k+2)}). Note that the probabilistic method gives an upper bound of order O((N\log N)^{1/2}) for all fixed k. P\v{r}\'{i}v\v{e}tiv\'{y} improved the lower bound for all k\geq 3 to \Omega(N^{1/2}) in 2005. Thus, the case k=2 (hypergraph of sums of two arithmetic progressions) remained the only case with a large gap between the known upper and lower bound. We bridge his gap (up to a logarithmic factor) by proving a lower bound of order \Omega(N^{1/2}) for the discrepancy of the hypergraph of sums of two arithmetic progressions.
