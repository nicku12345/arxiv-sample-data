When \{\alpha_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq m} is a sequence of distinct non-zero elements of an integral domain A and \gamma is a common multiple of the \alpha_i in A we obtain, by means of a simple identity for the   Vandermonde determinant, a lower bound for \sup_{1\leq i < j \leq m}\phi(\alpha_i - \alpha_j) in terms of \phi(\gamma), where \phi is a function from the nonzero elements of A to {\bf R}_{+} satisfying certain natural conditions. We describe several applications of this bound.
