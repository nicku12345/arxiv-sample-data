In this paper we construct, using Stark elements of Rubin [Ann. Inst. Fourier (Grenoble) 46 (1996), no. 1, 33-62], Kolyvagin systems for certain modified Selmer structures (that are adjusted to have core rank one in the sense of [Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 168 (2004), no. 799] and prove a Gras-type conjecture, relating these Kolyvagin systems to appropriate ideal class groups, refining the results of Rubin [J. Reine Angew. Math. 425 (1992), 141-154].
