In this article, we prove a generalisation of the Mertens theorem for prime numbers to number fields and algebraic varieties over finite fields, paying attention to the genus of the field (or the Betti numbers of the variety), in order to make it tend to infinity and thus to point out the link between it and the famous Brauer-Siegel theorem. Using this we deduce an explicit version of the generalised Brauer-Siegel theorem under GRH, and a unified proof of this theorem for asymptotically exact families of almost normal number fields.
