This article is divided in two parts. In the first part we endow a certain ring of ``Drinfeld quasi-modular forms'' for \GL_2(\FF_q[T]) (where q is a power of a prime) with a system of "divided derivatives" (or hyperderivations). This ring contains Drinfeld modular forms as defined by Gekeler in \cite{Ge}, and the hyperdifferential ring obtained should be considered as a close analogue in positive characteristic of famous Ramanujan's differential system relating to the first derivatives of the classical Eisenstein series of weights 2, 4 and 6. In the second part of this article we prove that, when q\not=2,3, if {\cal P} is a non-zero hyperdifferential prime ideal, then it contains the Poincar\'e series h=P_{q+1,1} of \cite{Ge}. This last result is the analogue of a crucial property proved by Nesterenko \cite{Nes} in characteristic zero in order to establish a multiplicity estimate.
