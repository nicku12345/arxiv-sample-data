We present a collection of results on a conjecture of Jannsen about the p-adic realizations associated to Hecke characters over an imaginary quadratic field K of class number 1.   The conjecture is easy to check for Galois groups purely of local type. We prove the conjecture under a geometric regularity condition for the imaginary quadratic field K at p, which is related to the property that a global Galois group is purely of local type. Without this regularity assumption at p, we present a review of the known situations in the critical case and in the non-critical case for the realizations associated to Hecke characters over K. We relate the conjecture to the non-vanishing of some concrete non-critical values of the associated p-adic L-function of the Hecke character.   Finally, we prove that the conjecture follows from a general conjecture on Iwasawa theory for almost all Tate twists.
