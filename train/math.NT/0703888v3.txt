We consider the problem of determining the monic integer transfinite diameter for real intervals I of length less than 4. We show that t_M([0,x]), as a function in x>0, is continuous, therefore disproving two conjectures due to Hare and Smyth. Consequently, for n>2\in\naturals, we define the quantity b_{\max}(n)&=&\sup_{b>\frac{1}{n}}\left\{b|t_M([0,b])=\tfrac{1}{n}\right.\right\} and give lower and upper bounds of b_{\max}(n). Finally, we improve the lower bound for b_{\max}(n) for 3\leq n\leq 8.
