For an elliptic curve E over any field K, the Weil pairing e_n is a bilinear map on n-torsion. For K of characteristic p>0, the map e_n is degenerate if and only if n is divisible by p. In this paper, we consider E over the dual numbers K[\epsilon] and define a non-degenerate ``Weil pairing on p-torsion" which shares many of the same properties of the Weil pairing. We also show that the discrete logarithm attacks on p-torsion subgroups of Semaev and R\"uck may be viewed as Weil-pairing-based attacks, just like the MOV attack. Finally, we describe an attack on the discrete logarithm problem on anomalous curves, analogous to that of Smart, using a lift of E over the dual numbers of the finite field of p elements.
