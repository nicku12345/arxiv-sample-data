For a prime p and an absolutely irreducible modulo p polynomial f(U,V) \in \Z[U,V] we obtain an asymptotic formulas for the number of solutions to the congruence f(x,y) \equiv a \pmod p in positive integers x \le X, y \le Y, with the additional condition \gcd(x,y)=1. Such solutions have a natural interpretation as solutions which are visible from the origin. These formulas are derived on average over a for a fixed prime p, and also on average over p for a fixed integer a.
