Let k \ge 2 and \alpha_1, \beta_1, ..., \alpha_k, \beta_k be reals such that the \alpha_i's are irrational and greater than 1. Suppose further that some ratio \alpha_i/\alpha_j is irrational. We study the representations of an integer n in the form  p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_k = n,  where p_i is a prime from the Beatty sequence  \mathcal B_i = \left\{n \in \mathbb N : n = [ \alpha_i m + \beta_i ] \text{for some} m \in \mathbb Z \right\}.
