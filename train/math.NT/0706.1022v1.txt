Using a method of H. Davenport and W. M. Schmidt, we show that, for each positive integer n, the ratio 2/n is the optimal exponent of simultaneous approximation to real irrational numbers 1) by all conjugates of algebraic numbers of degree n, and 2) by all but one conjugates of algebraic integers of degree n+1.
