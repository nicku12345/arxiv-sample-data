Friedberg, Hoffstein and Lieman have constructed two related multiple Dirichlet series from quadratic and higher-order L-functions and Gauss sums. We compute these multiple Dirichlet series explicitly in the case of the rational function field. This is done by utilizing the functional equation of the L-functions and the functional equation relating the two multiple Dirichlet series. We also point out a very simple correspondence between these series and their p-parts.
