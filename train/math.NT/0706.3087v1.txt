Main theorem of [Buyukboduk, arXiv:0706.0377v1] suggests that it should be possible to lift the Kolyvagin systems of Stark units constructed in [Buyukboduk, arXiv:math/0703426v1] to a Kolyvagin system over the cyclotomic Iwasawa algebra. This is what we prove in this paper. This construction gives the first example towards a more systematic study of Kolyvagin system theory over an Iwasawa algebra when the core Selmer rank is greater than one. As a result of this construction, we reduce the main conjectures of Iwasawa theory for totally real fields to a statement of local Iwasawa theory. This statement, however, turns out to be interesting in its own right as it suggests a relation between solutions to p-adic and complex Stark conjectures.
