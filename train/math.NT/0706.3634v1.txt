In a previous paper [3] we computed cohomology groups H^5 (Gamma_0 (N), \C), where Gamma_0 (N) is a certain congruence subgroup of SL (4, \Z), for a range of levels N. In this note we update this earlier work by extending the range of levels and describe cuspidal cohomology classes and additional boundary phenomena found since the publication of [3]. The cuspidal cohomology classes in this paper are the first cuspforms for GL(4) concretely constructed in terms of Betti cohomology.
