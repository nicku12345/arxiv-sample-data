We study low order terms of Emerton's spectral sequence for simply connected, simple groups. As a result, for real rank 1 groups, we show that Emerton's method for constructing eigenvarieties is successful in cohomological dimension 1. For real rank 2 groups, we show that a slight modification of Emerton's method allows one to construct eigenvarieties in cohomological dimension 2.
