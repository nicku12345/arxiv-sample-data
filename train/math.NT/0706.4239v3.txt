W. Luo and P. Sarnak have proved the quantum unique ergodicity property for Eisenstein series on \rm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) \backslash H. We extend their result to Eisenstein series on \rm{PSL}(2,O) \backslash H^n, where O is the ring of integers in a totally real field of degree n over Q with narrow class number one, using the Eisenstein series considered by I. Efrat. We also give an expository treatment of the theory of Hecke operators on non-holomorphic Hilbert modular forms.
