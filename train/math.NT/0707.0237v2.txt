We investigate the number {\Cal F}(h) of imaginary quadratic fields with class number h. We establish an asymptotic formula for the average value of {\Cal F}(h). We also establish a modest non-trivial upper bound for {\Cal F}(h) and give an application to a question of Rosen and Silverman on the odd part of the class number. Finally, we speculate on the asymptotic nature of {\Cal F}(h).
