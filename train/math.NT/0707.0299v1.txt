For a wide range of x and y we show that {\Cal S}(x,y), the set of integers below x composed only of prime factors below y, is equidistributed in the reduced residue classes \pmod q for all q<y^{4\sqrt{e}-\epsilon}. This improves earlier work of Granville; any improvement of this range of q would have interesting consequences for Vinogradov's conjecture on the least quadratic non-residue. For larger ranges of q we prove the existence of a large subgroup of the group of reduced residues such that {\Cal S}(x,y) is equidistributed within cosets of that subgroup.
