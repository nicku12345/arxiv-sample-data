We will study modular Abelian varieties with odd congruence numbers, by studying the cuspidal subgroup of J_0(N). We show the conductor of such Abelian varieties must be of a special type, for example if N is odd then N=p^\alpha or N=pq for some prime p and q. We then focus our attention to modular elliptic curves, and using result of Agashe, Ribet, and Stein, we try to classify all elliptic curves of odd modular degree. Our studies prove many cases of the Stein and Watkins's conjecture on elliptic curves with odd modular degree.
