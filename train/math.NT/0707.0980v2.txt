The results of the computer investigation of the sign changes of the difference between the number of twin primes \pi_2(x) and the Hardy--Littlewood conjecture c_2\Li_2(x) are reported. It turns out that \pi_2(x) - c_2\Li_2(x) changes the sign at unexpectedly low values of x and for x<2^{42} there are over 90000 sign changes of this difference. It is conjectured that the number of sign changes of \pi_2(x) - c_2\Li_2(x) for x\in (1, T) is given by \sqrt T/\log(T).
