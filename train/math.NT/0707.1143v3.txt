Let F be a function field of characteristic p>0, \F/F a Galois extension with Gal(\F/F)\simeq \Z_l^d (for some prime l\neq p) and E/F a non-isotrivial elliptic curve. We study the behaviour of Selmer groups Sel_E(L)_r (r any prime) as L varies through the subextensions of \F via appropriate versions of Mazur's Control Theorem. As a consequence we prove that Sel_E(\F)_r is a cofinitely generated (in some cases cotorsion) \Z_r[[Gal(\F/F)]]-module.
