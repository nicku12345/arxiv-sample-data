We obtain, for T^\epsilon \le U=U(T)\le T^{1/2-\epsilon}, asymptotic formulas for  \int_T^{2T}(E(t+U) - E(t))^2 dt,\quad \int_T^{2T}(\Delta(t+U) - \Delta(t))^2 dt,  where \Delta(x) is the error term in the classical divisor problem, and E(T) is the error term in the mean square formula for |\zeta(1/2+it)|. Upper bounds of the form O_\epsilon(T^{1+\epsilon}U^2) for the above integrals with biquadrates instead of square are shown to hold for T^{3/8} \le U =U(T) \ll T^{1/2}. The connection between the moments of E(t+U) - E(t) and |\zeta(1/2+it)| is also given. Generalizations to some other number-theoretic error terms are discussed.
