Sums of the form \sum_{n\le x}E^k(n) (k\in{\bf N} fixed) are investigated, where  E(T) = \int_0^T|\zeta(1/2+it)|^2 dt - T\Bigl(\log {T\over2\pi} + 2\gamma -1\Bigr) is the error term in the mean square formula for |\zeta(1/2+it)|. The emphasis is on the case k=1, which is more difficult than the corresponding sum for the divisor problem. The analysis requires bounds for the irrationality measure of {\rm e}^{2\pi m} and for the partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion.
