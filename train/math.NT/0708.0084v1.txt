Let E be an elliptic curved defined over \Q and let K/\Q be a finite Galois extension with Galois group G. The equivariant Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for h^1(E\times_{\Q} K)(1) viewed as a motive over \Q with coefficients in \Q[G] relates the twisted L-values associated with E with the arithmetic invariants of the same. In this paper we prescribe an approach to verify this conjecture for a given data. Using this approach, we verify the conjecture for an elliptic curve of conductor 11 and an S_3-extension of \Q.
