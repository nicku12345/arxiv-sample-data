The aim of this paper is to define an n-1-cocycle \sigma on \GL_{n}(\Q) with values in a certain space \hD of distributions on \A_f^{n}\setminus\{0\}. Here \A_f denotes the ring of finite ad\`{e}les of \Q, and the distributions take values in the Laurent series \C((z_{1},...,z_{n})). This cocycle can be used to evaluate special values of Artin L-functions on number fields at negative integers. The construction generalizes that of Solomon in the case n=2.
