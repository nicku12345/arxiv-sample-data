The purpose of the current paper is to introduce some new methods for studying the p-adic Banach spaces introduced by Emerton \cite{emerton}. We first relate these spaces to more familiar sheaf cohomology groups. As an application, we obtain a more general version of Emerton's spectral sequence. We also calculate the spaces in some easy cases. As a consequence, we obtain a number of vanishing theorems.
