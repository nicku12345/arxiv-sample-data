In this article, we give evidence that computing Fourier coefficients of the Hecke eigenforms for composite indices is no easier than factoring integers. In particular, we show that the existence of a polynomial time algorithm that, given n, computes the n-th Fourier coefficient of a (fixed) Hecke eigenform implies that we can factor most RSA moduli (numbers that are products of two distinct primes) in polynomial time.
