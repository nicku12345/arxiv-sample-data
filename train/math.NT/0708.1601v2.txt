We provide upper bounds for the mean square integral  \int_X^{2X}(\Delta_k(x+h) - \Delta_k(x))^2 dx \qquad(h = h(X)\gg1, h = o(x) {\roman{as}} X\to\infty)  where h lies in a suitable range. For k\ge2 a fixed integer, \Delta_k(x) is the error term in the asymptotic formula for the summatory function of the divisor function d_k(n), generated by \zeta^k(s).
