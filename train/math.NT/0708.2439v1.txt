In this paper we will extend a p-adic algorithm of Boyd in order to study the size of the set: \[J_p(y)=\left\{n :\sum_{j=1}^{n}\frac{y^j}{j}\equiv 0(\mod p)\right\}.\] Suppose that p is one of the first 100 odd primes and y\in\{1,2,...,p-1\}, then our calculations prove that |J_p(y)|<\infty in 24240 out of 24578 possible cases. Among other results we show that |J_{13}(9)|=18763. The paper concludes by discussing some possible applications of our method to sums involving Fibonacci numbers.
