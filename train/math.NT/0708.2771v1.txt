We study a problem of finding good approximations to Euler's constant \gamma=\lim_{n\to\infty}S_n, where S_n=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{n}-\log(n+1), by linear forms in logarithms and harmonic numbers. In 1995, C. Elsner showed that slow convergence of the sequence S_n can be significantly improved if S_n is replaced by linear combinations of S_n with integer coefficients. In this paper, considering more general linear transformations of the sequence S_n we establish new accelerating convergence formulae for \gamma. Our estimates sharpen and generalize recent Elsner's, Rivoal's and author's results.
