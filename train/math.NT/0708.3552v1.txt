The integer d=\prod_{i=1}^s p_i^{b_i} is called an exponential divisor of n=\prod_{i=1}^s p_i^{a_i}>1 if b_i \mid a_i for every i\in \{1,2,...,s\}. Let \tau^{(e)}(n) denote the number of exponential divisors of n, where \tau^{(e)}(1)=1 by convention. The aim of the present paper is to establish an asymptotic formula with remainder term for the r-th power of the function \tau^{(e)}, where r\ge 1 is an integer. This improves an earlier result of {\sc M. V. Subbarao} [5].
