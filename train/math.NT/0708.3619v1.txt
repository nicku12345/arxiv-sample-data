Let p be an odd prime and let f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^ka_ix^{p^{\alpha_i}+1}\in\Bbb F_{p^n}[x], where 0\le \alpha_1<...<\alpha_k. We consider the exponential sum S(f,n)=\sum_{x\in\Bbb F_{p^n}}e_n(f(x)), where e_n(y)=e^{2\pi i\text{Tr}_n(y)/p}, y\in\Bbb F_{p^n}, \text{Tr}_n=\text{Tr}_{\Bbb F_{p^n}/\Bbb F_p}. There is an effective way to compute the nullity of the quadratic form \text{Tr}_{mn}(f(x)) for all integer m>0. Assuming that all such nullities are known, we find relative formulas for S(f,mn) in terms of S(f,n) when \nu_p(m) \le \min\{\nu_p(\alpha_i):1\le i\le k\}, where \nu_p is the p-adic order. We also find an explicit formula for S(f,n) when \nu_2(\alpha_1)=...= \nu_2(\alpha_k)<\nu_2(n). These results generalize those by Carlitz and by Baumert and McEliece. Parallel results with p=2 were obtained in a previous paper by the second author.
