The Riemann Hypothesis can be reformulated as statements about the eigenvalues of certain matrices whose entries are defined in terms of the Taylor coefficients of the zeta function. These eigenvalues exhibit interesting visual patterns allowing one to state a number of conjectures.   The Hankel matrices introduced here are obtained, by rearranging of columns, from Toeplitz matrices whose eigenvalues were considered in arXiv:0707.1983 . The present paper is a continuation of that publication.
