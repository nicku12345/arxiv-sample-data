Let \Psi_n(x) be the monic polynomial having precisely all non-primitive nth roots of unity as its simple zeros. One has \Psi_n(x)=(x^n-1)/\Phi_n(x), with \Phi_n(x) the nth cyclotomic polynomial. The coefficients of \Psi_n(x) are integers that like the coefficients of \Phi_n(x) tend to be surprisingly small in absolute value, e.g. for n<561 all coefficients of \Psi_n(x) are \le 1 in absolute value. We establish various properties of the coefficients of \Psi_n(x).
