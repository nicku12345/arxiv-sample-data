Let p be a prime. We discuss methods of solution of congruences modulo p^n using p-adic numbers; these methods are similar to computations with real numbers (local methods). Examples of relations between local and global methods are given producing a passage from congruences to solutions in integers (global methods). The use of a computer is illistrated for the study of p-adic numbers and algebraic curves.
