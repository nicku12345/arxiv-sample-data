Let p be a prime, and let \Gamma=\Sp_g(\Z) be the Siegel modular group of genus g. We study p-adic families of zeta functions and Siegel modular forms. L-functions of Siegel modular forms are described in terms of motivic L-functions attached to \Sp_g, and their analytic properties are given. Critical values for the spinor L-functions and p-adic constructions are discussed. Rankin's lemma of higher genus is established. A general conjecture on a lifting from  GSp_{2m} \times GSp_{2m} to GSp_{4m} (of genus g=4m) is formulated. Constructions of p-adic families of Siegel modular forms are given using Ikeda-Miyawaki constructions.
