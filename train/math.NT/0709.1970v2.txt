We recall some basic constructions from p-adic Hodge theory, then describe some recent results in the subject. We chiefly discuss the notion of B-pairs, introduced recently by Berger, which provides a natural enlargement of the category of p-adic Galois representations. (This enlargement, in a different form, figures in recent work of Colmez, Bellaiche, and Chenevier on trianguline representations.) We also discuss results of Liu that indicate that the formalism of Galois cohomology, including Tate local duality, extends to B-pairs.
