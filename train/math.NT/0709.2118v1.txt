Fix K a p-adic field and denote by G_K its absolute Galois group. Let K_infty be the extension of K obtained by adding (p^n)-th roots of a fixed uniformizer, and G_\infty its absolute Galois group. In this article, we define a class of p-adic torsion representations of G_\infty, named quasi-semi-stable. We prove that these representations are "explicitly" described by a certain category of linear algebra objects. The results of this note should be consider as a first step in the understanding of the structure of quotients of two lattices in a crystalline (resp. semi-stable) Galois representation.
