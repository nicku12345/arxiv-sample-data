An almost square of type 2 is an integer n that can be factored in two different ways as n = a_1 b_1 = a_2 b_2 with a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2 \approx \sqrt{n}. In this paper, we shall improve upon previous result on short intervals containing an almost square of type 2. This leads to an inquiry of finding a short interval around x that contains an integer divisible by some integer in [x^c, 2 x^c] with 0 < c < 1.
