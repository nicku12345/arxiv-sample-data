We show, in an effective way, that there exists a sequence of congruence classes a_k\pmod {m_k} such that the minimal solution n=n_k of the congruence \phi(n)\equiv a_k\pmod {m_k} exists and satisfies \log n_k/\log m_k\to\infty  as k\to\infty. Here, \phi(n) is the Euler function. This answers a question raised in \cite{FS}. We also show that every congruence class containing an even integer contains infinitely many values of the Carmichael function \lambda(n) and the least such n satisfies n\ll m^{13}.
