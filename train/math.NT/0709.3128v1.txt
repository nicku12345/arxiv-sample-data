The explicit construction of function fields tower with many rational points relative to the genus in the tower play a key role for the construction of asymptotically good algebraic-geometric codes. In 1997 Garcia, Stichtenoth and Thomas [6] exhibited two recursive asymptotically good Kummer towers over any non-prime field. Wulftange determined the limit of one tower in his PhD thesis [13]. In this paper we determine the limit of another tower [14].
