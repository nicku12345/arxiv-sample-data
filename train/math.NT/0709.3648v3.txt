We study the arithmetic (real) function f=g*1, with g "essentially bounded" and supported over the integers of [1,Q]. In particular, we obtain non-trivial bounds, through f "correlations", for the "Selberg integral" and the "symmetry integral" of f in almost all short intervals [x-h,x+h], N<x<2N, beyond the "classical" level, up to level of distribution, say, lambda=log Q/log N < 2/3 (for enough large h). This time we don't apply Large Sieve inequality, as in our paper [C-S]. Precisely, our method is completely elementary.
