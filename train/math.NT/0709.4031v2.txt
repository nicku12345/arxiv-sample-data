Let N_{1,B}(n) denote the number of ones in the B-ary expansion of an integer n. Woods introduced the infinite product P :=\prod_{n \geq 0} (\frac{2n+1}{2n+2})^{(-1)^{N_{1,2}(n)}} and Robbins proved that P = 1/\sqrt{2}. Related products were studied by several authors. We show that a trick for proving that P^2 = 1/2 (knowing that P converges) can be extended to evaluating new products with (generalized) strongly B-multiplicative exponents. A simple example is  \prod_{n \geq 0} (\frac{Bn+1}{Bn+2})^{(-1)^{N_{1,B}(n)}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt B}.
