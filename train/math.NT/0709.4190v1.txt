We generalise Coleman's construction of Hecke operators to define an action of GL_2(Q_l) on the space of finite slope overconvergent p-adic modular forms (l not equal p). In this way we associate to any C_p-valued point on the tame level N Coleman-Mazur eigencurve an admissible smooth representation of GL_2(Q_l) extending the classical construction. Using the Galois theoretic interpretation of the eigencurve we associate a 2-dimensional Weil-Deligne representation to such points and show that away from a discrete set they agree under the Local Langlands correspondence.
