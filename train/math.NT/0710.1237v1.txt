In this paper we explicitly compute mod-l Galois representations associated to modular forms. To be precise, we look at cases with l<=23 and the modular forms considered will be cusp forms of level 1 and weight up to 22. We present the result in terms of polynomials associated to the projectivised representations. As an application, we will improve a known result on Lehmer's non-vanishing conjecture for Ramanujan's tau function.
