Let n=p_1^{\nu_1}... p_r^{\nu_r} >1 be an integer. An integer a is called regular (mod n) if there is an integer x such that a^2x\equiv a (mod n). Let \varrho(n) denote the number of regular integers a (mod n) such that 1\le a\le n. Here \varrho(n)=(\phi(p_1^{\nu_1})+1)... (\phi(p_r^{\nu_r})+1), where \phi(n) is the Euler function. In this paper we first summarize some basic properties of regular integers (mod n). Then in order to compare the rates of growth of the functions \varrho(n) and \phi(n) we investigate the average orders and the extremal orders of the functions \varrho(n)/\phi(n), \phi(n)/\varrho(n) and 1/\varrho(n).
