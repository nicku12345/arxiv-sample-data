The aim of the present paper is to study the relations between the prime distribution and the zero distribution for generalized zeta functions which are expressed by Euler products and is analytically continued as meromorphic functions of finite order. In this paper, we give an inequality between the order of the zeta function as a meromorphic function and the growth of the multiplicity in the prime distribution.
