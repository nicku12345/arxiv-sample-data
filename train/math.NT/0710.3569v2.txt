Let \goth E(\goth p) denote the Eisenstein ideal in the Hecke algebra \Bbb T(\goth p) of the Drinfeld modular curve X_0(\goth p) parameterizing Drinfeld modules of rank two over \Bbb F_q[T] of general characteristic with Hecke level \goth p-structure, where \goth p\triangleleft\Bbb F_q[T] is a non-zero prime ideal. We prove that the characteristic p of the field \Bbb F_q does not divide the order of the quotient \Bbb T(\goth p)/\goth E(\goth p) and the Eisenstein ideal \goth E(\goth p) is locally principal.
