We fix \ell a prime and let M be an integer such that \ell\not|M; let f\in S_2(\Gamma_1(M\ell^2)) be a newform supercuspidal of fixed type related to the nebentypus, at \ell and special at a finite set of primes. Let \TT^\psi be the local quaternionic Hecke algebra associated to f. The algebra \TT^\psi acts on a module \mathcal M^\psi_f coming from the cohomology of a Shimura curve. Applying the Taylor-Wiles criterion and a recent Savitt's theorem, \TT^\psi is the universal deformation ring of a global Galois deformation problem associated to \orho_f. Moreover \mathcal M^\psi_f is free of rank 2 over \TT^\psi. If f occurs at minimal level, by a generalization of a Conrad, Diamond and Taylor's result and by the classical Ihara's lemma, we prove a theorem of raising the level and a result about congruence ideals. The extension of this results to the non minimal case is an open problem.
