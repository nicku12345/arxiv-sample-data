We prove a `Weierstrass Preparation Theorem' and develop an explicit descent formalism in the context of Whitehead groups of non-commutative Iwasawa algebras. We use these results to describe the precise connection between the main conjecture of non-commutative Iwasawa theory (in the sense of Coates, Fukaya, Kato, Sujatha and Venjakob) and the equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture. The latter result is both a converse to a theorem of Fukaya and Kato and also provides an important means of deriving explicit consequences of the main conjecture.
