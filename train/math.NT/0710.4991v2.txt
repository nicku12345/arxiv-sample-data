We will introduce a method to get all universal Hermitian lattices over imaginary quadratic fields over \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-m}) for all m. For each imaginary quadratic field \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-m}), we obtain a criterion on universality of Hermitian lattices: if a Hermitian lattice L represents 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13,14 and 15, then L is universal. We call this the fifteen theorem for universal Hermitian lattices. Note that the difference between Conway-Schneeberger's fifteen theorem and ours is the number 13.
