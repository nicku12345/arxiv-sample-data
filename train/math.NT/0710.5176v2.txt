We prove a formula, with power savings, for the sixth moment of Dirichlet L-functions averaged over moduli q, over primitive characters \chi modulo q, and over the critical line. Our formula agrees precisely with predictions motivated by random matrix theory. In particular, the constant 42 appears as a factor in the leading order term, exactly as is predicted for the sixth moment of the Riemann zeta-function.
