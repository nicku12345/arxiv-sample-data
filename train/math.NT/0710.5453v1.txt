We discuss the relationship between different notions of "integrality" in motivic cohomology/K-theory which arise in the Beilinson and Bloch-Kato conjectures, and prove their equivalence in some cases for products of curves (used in the authors' previous paper in this series), as well as obtaining a general result, first proved by Jannsen (unpublished), which reduces their equivalence to standard conjectures in arithmetic algebraic geometry.
