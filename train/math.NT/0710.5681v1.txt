The aim of this paper is to define new generating functions. By applying the Mellin transformation formula to these generating functions, we define q-analogue of Genocchi zeta function, q-analogue Hurwitz type Genocchi zeta function, q-analogue Genocchi type l-function and two-variable q-Genocchi type l-function. Furthermore, we construct new genereting functions of q-Hardy-Berndt type sums and q-Hardy-Berndt type sums attached to Dirichlet character. We also give some new relations related to q-Hardy-Berndt type sums and q-Genocchi zeta function as well.
