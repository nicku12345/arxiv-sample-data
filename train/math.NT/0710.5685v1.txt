In 1998, Kleinbock & Margulis established a conjecture of V.G. Sprindzuk in metrical Diophantine approximation (and indeed the stronger Baker-Sprindzuk conjecture). In essence the conjecture stated that the simultaneous homogeneous Diophantine exponent w_{0}(\vv x) = 1/n for almost every point \vv x on a non-degenerate submanifold \cM of \R^n. In this paper the simultaneous inhomogeneous analogue of Sprindzuk's conjecture is established. More precisely, for any `inhomogeneous' vector \bm\theta\in\R^n we prove that the simultaneous inhomogeneous Diophantine exponent w_{0}(\vv x, \bm\theta)= 1/n for almost every point \vv x on M. The key result is an inhomogeneous transference principle which enables us to deduce that the homogeneous exponent w_0(\vv x)=1/n for almost all \vv x\in \cM if and only if for any \bm\theta\in\R^n the inhomogeneous exponent w_0(\vv x,\bm\theta)=1/n for almost all \vv x\in \cM. The inhomogeneous transference principle introduced in this paper is an extremely simplified version of that recently discovered in \cite{Beresnevich-Velani-new-inhom}. Nevertheless, it should be emphasised that the simplified version has the great advantage of bringing to the forefront the main ideas of \cite{Beresnevich-Velani-new-inhom} while omitting the abstract and technical notions that come with describing the inhomogeneous transference principle in all its glory.
