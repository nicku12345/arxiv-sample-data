In [14] Ozden-Simsek-Cangul constructed generating functions of higher-order twisted (h,q)-extension of Euler polynomials and numbers, by using p-adic q-deformed fermionic integral on \Bbb Z_p. By applying their generating functions, they derived the complete sums of products of the twisted (h,q)-extension of Euler polynomials and numbers, see[13, 14]. In this paper we cosider the new q-extension of Euler numbers and polynomials to be different which is treated by Ozden-Simsek-Cangul. From our q-Euler numbers and polynomials we derive some interesting identities and we construct q-Euler zeta functions which interpolate the new q-Euler numbers and polynomials at a negative integer. Furthermore we study Barnes' type q-Euler zeta functions. Finally we will derive the new formula for " sums products of q-Euler numbers and polynomials" by using fermionic p-adic q-integral on \Bbb Z_p.
