The aim of this paper is to study certain family of elliptic curves \{\mathscr{X}_H\}_H defined over a number field F arising from hyperplane sections of some cubic surface \mathscr{X}/F associated to a cyclic cubic extension K/F. We show that each \mathscr{X}_H admits a 3-isogeny \phi over F and the dual Selmer group S^{(\hat{\phi})}(\hat{\mathscr{X}_H}/F) is bounded by a kind of unit/class groups attached to K/F. This is proven via certain rational function on the elliptic curve \mathscr{X}_H with nice property. We also prove that the Shafarevich-Tate group \text{\cyr X} (\hat{\mathscr{X}_H}/\rat)[\hat{\phi}] coincides with a class group of K as a special case.
