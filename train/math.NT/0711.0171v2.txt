A classical problem in analytic number theory is to study the distribution of \alpha p modulo 1, where \alpha is irrational and p runs over the set of primes. We consider the subsequence generated by the primes p such that p+2 is an almost-prime (the existence of infinitely many such p is another topical result in prime number theory) and prove that its distribution has a similar property.
