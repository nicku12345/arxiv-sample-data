The paper starts out from pseudomeasures (in the sense of Serre) which hold the arithmetic properties of the abelian l-adic Artin L-functions over totally real number fields. In order to generalize to non-abelian l-adic L-functions, these abelian pseudomeasures must satisfy congruences which are introduced but not yet known to be true. The relation to the ``equivariant main conjecture'' of Iwasawa theory is discussed.
