Following Deligne and Ribet (`Values of abelian L-functions at negative integers over totally real fields.' Invent. Math. 59 (1980), 227-286) we prove that the `torsion congruences' (as introduced in our paper `Non-abelian pseudomeasures and congruences between abelian Iwasawa L-functions.' To appear in Pure and Applied Mathematics Quarterly) hold and so reduce the `main conjecture' of equivariant Iwasawa theory to the integrality of the logarithmic pseudomeasure.
