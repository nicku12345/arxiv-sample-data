We consider a complete discrete valuation field of characteristic p, with possibly non perfect residue field. Let V be a rank one continuous representation with finite local monodromy of its absolute Galois group. We will prove that the Arithmetic Swan conductor of V (defined after Kato in [Kat89] which fits in the more general theory of [AS02] and [AS06]) coincides with the Differential Swan conductor of the associated differential module D^{\dag}(V) defined by Kedlaya in [Ked]. This construction is a generalization to the non perfect residue case of the Fontaine's formalism as presented in [Tsu98a]. Our method of proof will allow us to give a new interpretation of the Refined Swan Conductor.
