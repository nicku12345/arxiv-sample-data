Let F be a number field, abelian over the rational field, and fix a odd prime number p. Consider the cyclotomic Z_p-extension F_\infty/F and denote F_n the {n}^{\rm th} finite subfield and C_n its group of circular units. Then the Galois groups G_{m,n}=\Gal(F_m/F_n) act naturally on the C_m's (for any m\geq n>> 0). We compute the Tate cohomology groups \Hha^i(G_{m,n}, C_m) for i=-1,0 without assuming anything else neither on F nor on p.
