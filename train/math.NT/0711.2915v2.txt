Bounds and other relations involving variables connected with Carmichael numbers are reviewed and extended. Families of numbers or individual numbers attaining or approaching these bounds are given. A new algorithm for finding three-prime Carmichael numbers is described, with its implementation up to 10^{24}. Statistics relevant to the distribution of three-prime Carmichael numbers are given, with particular reference to the conjecture of Granville and Pomerance in [A.Granville and C.Pomerance, Two contradictory conjectures concerning Carmichael numbers, Math. Comp. 71 (2001), 883-908].
