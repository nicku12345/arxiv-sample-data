Let f be a non-CM newform of weight k > 1.   Let L be a subfield of the coefficient field of f.   We completely settle the question of the density of the set of primes p such that the p-th coefficient of f generates the field L. This density is determined by the inner twists of f. As a particular case, we obtain that in the absence of non-trivial inner twists, the density is 1 for L equal to the whole coefficient field. We also present some new data on reducibility of Hecke polynomials, which suggest questions for further investigation.
