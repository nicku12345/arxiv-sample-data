We compute the averages over elliptic curves of the constants occurring in the Lang-Trotter conjecture, the Koblitz conjecture, and the cyclicity conjecture. The results obtained confirm the consistency of these conjectures with the corresponding ``theorems on average'' obtained recently by various authors.
