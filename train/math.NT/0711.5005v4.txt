The Riemann zeta function on the critical line can be computed using a straightforward application of the Riemann-Siegel formula, Sch\"onhage's method, or Heath-Brown's method. The complexities of these methods have exponents 1/2, 3/8 (=0.375), and 1/3 respectively. In this paper, three new fast and potentially practical methods to compute zeta are presented. One method is very simple. Its complexity has exponent 2/5. A second method relies on this author's algorithm to compute quadratic exponential sums. Its complexity has exponent 1/3. The third method employs an algorithm, developed in this paper, to compute cubic exponential sums. Its complexity has exponent 4/13 (approximately, 0.307).
