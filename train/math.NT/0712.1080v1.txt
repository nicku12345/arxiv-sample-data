An x-pseudopower to base g is a positive integer which is not a power of g yet is so modulo p for all primes p\le x. We improve an upper bound for the least such number due to E. Bach, R. Lukes, J. Shallit, and H. C. Williams. The method is based on a combination of some bounds of exponential sums with new results about the average behaviour of the multiplicative order of g modulo prime numbers.
