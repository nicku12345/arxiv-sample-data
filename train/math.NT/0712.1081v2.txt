Introduced by Kraitchik and Lehmer, an x-pseudosquare is a positive integer n\equiv1\pmod 8 that is a quadratic residue for each odd prime p\le x, yet is not a square. We use bounds of character sums to prove that pseudosquares are equidistributed in fairly short intervals. An x-pseudopower to base g is a positive integer which is not a power of g yet is so modulo p for all primes p\le x. It is conjectured by Bach, Lukes, Shallit, and Williams that the least such number is at most \exp(a_g x/\log x) for a suitable constant a_g. A bound of \exp(a_g x\log\log x/\log x) is proved conditionally on the Riemann Hypothesis for Dedekind zeta functions, thus improving on a recent conditional exponential bound of Konyagin and the present authors. We also give a GRH-conditional equidistribution result for pseudopowers that is analogous to our unconditional result for pseudosquares.
