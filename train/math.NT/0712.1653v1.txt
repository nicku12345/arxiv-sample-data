This paper gives some restrictions on finite groups that can occur as Galois groups of extensions over \Q and over \F_q(t) ramified only at one finite prime. Over \Q, we strengthen results of Jensen and Yui about dihedral extensions and rule out some non-solvable groups. Over \F_q(t) restrictions are given for symmetric groups and dihedral groups to occur as tamely ramified extension over \F_q(t) ramified only at one prime.
