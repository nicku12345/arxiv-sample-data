We revisit recent work of Heath-Brown on the average order of the quantity r(L_1)r(L_2)r(L_3)r(L_4), for suitable binary linear forms L_1,..., L_4, for integers ranging over quite general regions. In addition to improving the error term in Heath-Brown's estimate we generalise his result quite extensively.
