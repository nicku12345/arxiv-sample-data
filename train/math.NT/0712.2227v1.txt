Let k > 3 be an integer and p a prime with p > 2k-2. Let f be a newform of weight 2k-2 and level 1 so that f is ordinary at p and \bar{\rho}_{f} is irreducible. Under some additional hypotheses we prove that ord_{p}(L_{alg}(k,f)) \leq ord_{p}(# S) where S is the Pontryagin dual of the Selmer group associated to \rho_{f} \otimes \epsilon^{1-k} with \epsilon the p-adic cyclotomic character. We accomplish this by first constructing a congruence between the Saito-Kurokawa lift of f and a non-CAP Siegel cusp form. Once this congruence is established, we use Galois representations to obtain the lower bound on the Selmer group.
