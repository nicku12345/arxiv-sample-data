We provide an upper bound on the uniform exponent of approximation to a triple (xi, xi^2, xi^3) by rational numbers with the same denominator, valid for any transcendental real number xi. This upper bound refines a previous result of Davenport and Schmidt. As a consequence, we get a sharper lower bound on the exponent of approximation of such a number xi by algebraic integers of degree at most 4.
