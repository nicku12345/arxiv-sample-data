Let \Phi_n(x) denote the nth cyclotomic polynomial. In 1968 Sister Marion Beiter conjectured that a_n(k), the coefficient of x^k in \Phi_n(x), satisfies |a_n(k)|\le (p+1)/2 in case n=pqr with p<q<r primes (in this case \Phi_n(x) is said to be ternary). Since then several results towards establishing her conjecture have been proved (for example |a_n(k)|\le 3p/4). Here we show that, nevertheless, Beiter's conjecture is false for every p\ge 11. We also prove that given any \epsilon>0 there exist infinitely many triples (p_j,q_j,r_j) with p_1<p_2<...  consecutive primes such that |a_{p_jq_jr_j}(n_j)|>(2/3-\epsilon)p_j for j\ge 1.
