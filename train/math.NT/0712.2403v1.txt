Linear recursions of degree k are determined by evaluating the sequence of Generalized Fibonacci Polynomials, \{F_{k,n}(t_1,...,t_k)\} (isobaric reflects of the complete symmetric polynomials) at the integer vectors (t_1,...,t_k). If F_{k,n}(t_1,...,t_k) = f_n, then   f_n - \sum_{j=1}^k t_j f_{n-j} = 0, and \{f_n\} is a linear recursion of degree k. On the one hand, the periodic properties of such sequences modulo a prime p are discussed, and are shown to be rela ted to the prime structure of certain algebraic number fields; for example, the arithmetic properties of the period ar e shown to characterize ramification of primes in an extension field. On the other hand, the structure of the semiloca l rings associated with the number field is shown to be completely determined by Schur-hook polynomials.
