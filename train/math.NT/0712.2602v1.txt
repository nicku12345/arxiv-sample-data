A perfect polynomial over the binary field \F_2 is a polynomial A \in \F_2[x] that equals the sum of all its divisors. If \gcd(A,x^2-x) \neq 1 then we call A even. The list of all even perfect polynomials over \F_2 with at most 3 prime factors in known. The object of this paper is to give the list of all even perfect polynomials over \F_2 with four prime factors. These are all the known perfect polynomials with four prime factors over \F_2.
