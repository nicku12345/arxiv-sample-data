For a fixed n\ge2, consider an n\times n matrix M whose entries are random integers bounded by k in absolute value. In this paper, we examine the probability that M is singular (hence has eigenvalue 0), and the probability that M has at least one rational eigenvalue. We show that both of these probabilities tend to 0 as k increases. More precisely, we establish an upper bound of size k^{-2+\epsilon} for the probability that M is singular, and size k^{-1+\epsilon} for the probability that M has a rational eigenvalue. These results generalize earlier work by Kowalsky for the case n=2 and answer a question posed by Hetzel, Liew, and Morrison.
