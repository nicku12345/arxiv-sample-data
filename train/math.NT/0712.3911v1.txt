Enge and Schertz gave the method of using the double eta-quotient for the construction of elliptic curves over finite fields. In their method, it is necessary to count the number of rational points of elliptic curves corresponding to solutions of the modular equation over a finite field, because in advance we can not know which solution of the modular equation is that corresponding to the modular invariant. We give a condition that the modular invariant is a multiple root of the modular polynomial. Consequently, we give a method to reduce the amount of computation in the process of counting the number of rational points.
