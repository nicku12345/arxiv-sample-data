We prove the modularity of minimally ramified ordinary residually reducible p-adic Galois representations of an imaginary quadratic field F under certain assumptions. We first exhibit conditions under which the residual representation is unique up to isomorphism. Then we prove the existence of deformations arising from cuspforms on GL_2(A_F) via the Galois representations constructed by Taylor et al. We establish a sufficient condition (in terms of the non-existence of certain field extensions which in many cases can be reduced to a condition on an L-value) for the universal deformation ring to be a discrete valuation ring and in that case we prove an R=T theorem. We also study reducible deformations and show that no minimal characteristic 0 reducible deformation exists.
