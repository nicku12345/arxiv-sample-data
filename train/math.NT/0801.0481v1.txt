Earnest and Khosravani, Iwabuchi, and Kim and Park recently gave a complete classification of the universal binary Hermitian forms. We give a unified proof of the universalities of these Hermitian forms, relying primarily on Ramanujan's list of universal quadratic forms and on the Bhargava-Hanke 290-Theorem. Our methods bypass nearly all of the ad hoc universality arguments required in the original classification.
