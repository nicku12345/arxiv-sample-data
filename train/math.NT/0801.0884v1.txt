For Hurwitz Zeta function,we consider its Taylor series expansion about various points as an analytic function of second variable in appropriate discs.We show that these Taylor are all polynomials in second variable for a non positive integral argument in first variable.On using functionalequations this results in instant evaluation of Riemann Zeta function at positive even integral values of its argument and of Dirichlet L series at positive integral values of its argument,when the argument and the corresponding Dirichlet character are both even or both odd.We also obtain finite sum expression for any Dirichlet L series,when its argument is one.We also deal with Lerch's Zeta function on similar lines.
