We study the l-part of the the wild \'etale kernels WK2i(F) of an arbitary number field F for a given prime l in connection with the logarithmic l-class groups. From the logarithmic arithmetic we deduce rank formulas, periodicity and reflection theorems, triviality characterizations and various consequences.
