The purpose of this paper is to present a systemic study of some families of multiple q-Genocchi and euler numbers by using multivariate q-Volkenborn integral. From the studies of those q-Genocchi numbers and polynomials of higher order we derive some interesting identities related to q-Genocchi numbers and polynomials of higher order.
