Let \Gamma\backslash\mathbb H^3 be a finite-volume quotient of the upper-half space, where \Gamma\subset {\rm SL}(2,\mathbb C) is a discrete subgroup. To a finite dimensional unitary representation \chi of \Gamma one associates the Selberg zeta function Z(s;\Gamma;\chi). In this paper we prove the Artin formalism for the Selberg zeta function. Namely, if \tilde\Gamma is a finite index group extension of \Gamma in {\rm SL}(2,\mathbb C), and \pi={\rm Ind}_{\Gamma}^{\tilde\Gamma}\chi is the induced representation, then Z(s;\Gamma;\chi)=Z(s;\tilde\Gamma;\pi). In the second part of the paper we prove by a direct method the analogous identity for the scattering function, namely \phi(s;\Gamma;\chi)=\phi(s;\tilde\Gamma;\pi), for an appropriate normalization of the Eisenstein series.
