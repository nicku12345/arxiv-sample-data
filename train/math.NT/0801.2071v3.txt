We show that the Boundedness Height Conjecture is optimal; all varieties in a power of an elliptic curve which do not satisfy the hypothesis neither satisfy the thesis. The Bounded Height Conjecture is known to hold for varieties in a power of an elliptic curve. We also present some examples and remarks.
