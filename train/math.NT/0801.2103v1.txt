We investigate the Galois group G_S(p) of the maximal p-extension unramified outside a finite set S of primes of a number field in the (mixed) case, when there are primes dividing p inside and outside S. We show that the cohomology of G_S(p) is "often" isomorphic to the etale cohomology of the scheme Spec(O_k   S), in particular, G_S(p) is of cohomological dimension 2 then. We deduce this from the results in our previous paper "Rings of integers of type K(\pi,1)" (arXiv:0705.3372), which mainly dealt with the tame case.
