Let \Gamma be a Fuchsian group of the first kind acting on the hyperbolic upper half plane \mathbb H, and let M = \Gamma \backslash \mathbb H be the associated finite volume hyperbolic Riemann surface. If \gamma is parabolic, there is an associated (parabolic) Eisenstein series, which, by now, is a classical part of mathematical literature. If \gamma is hyperbolic, then, following ideas due to Kudla-Millson, there is a corresponding hyperbolic Eisenstein series. In this article, we study the limiting behavior of parabolic and hyperbolic Eisenstein series on a degenerating family of finite volume hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. In particular, we prove the following result. If \gamma \in \Gamma corresponds to a degenerating hyperbolic element, then a multiple of the associated hyperbolic Eisenstein series converges to parabolic Eisenstein series on the limit surface.
