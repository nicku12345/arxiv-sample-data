We give a completely explicit upper bound for integral points on (standard) affine models of hyperelliptic curves, provided we know at least one rational point and a Mordell-Weil basis of the Jacobian. We also explain a powerful refinement of the Mordell--Weil sieve which, combined with the upper bound, is capable of determining all the integral points. Our method is illustrated by determining the integral points on a two genus 2 hyperelliptic curves with Mordell--Weil Jacobian ranks of 3 and 6.
