Let k be a complete discretely valued field of equal characteristic p > 0 with possibly imperfect residue field and let G_k be its Galois group. We prove that the conductors computed by the arithmetic ramification filtrations on G_k coincide with the differential Artin conductors and Swan conductors of Galois representations of G_k. As a consequence, we give a Hasse-Arf theorem for arithmetic ramification filtrations in this case. As applications, we obtain a Hasse-Arf theorem for finite flat group schemes; we also give a comparison theorem between the differential Artin conductors and Borger's conductors.
