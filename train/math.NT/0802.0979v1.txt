We present and analyze two algorithms for computing the Hilbert class polynomial H_D . The first is a p-adic lifting algorithm for inert primes p in the order of discriminant D < 0. The second is an improved Chinese remainder algorithm which uses the class group action on CM-curves over finite fields. Our run time analysis gives tighter bounds for the complexity of all known algorithms for computing H_D, and we show that all methods have comparable run times.
