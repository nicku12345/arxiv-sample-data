We study the exact extremal orders of compositions f(g(n)) of certain arithmetical functions, including the functions \sigma(n), \phi(n), \sigma^*(n) and \phi^*(n), representing the sum of divisors of n, Euler's function and their unitary analogues, respectively. Our results complete, generalize and refine known results.
