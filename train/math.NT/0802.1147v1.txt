In this article, we make use of some known method to investigate some properties of the numbers represented as sums of two equal odd powers, i.e., the equation x^n+y^n=N for n\ge3. It was originated in developing algorithms to search new taxicab numbers (i.e., naturals that can be represented as a sum of positive cubes in many different ways) and to verify their minimality. We discuss properties of diophantine equations that can be used for our investigations. This techniques is applied to develop an algorithm allowing us to compute new taxicab numbers (i.e., numbers represented as sums of two positive cubes in k different ways), for k=7...14.
