We present an algorithm that, on input of a CM-field K, an integer k\ge1, and a prime r \equiv 1 \bmod k, constructs a q-Weil number \pi \in \O_K corresponding to an ordinary, simple abelian variety A over the field \F of q elements that has an \F-rational point of order r and embedding degree k with respect to r. We then discuss how CM-methods over K can be used to explicitly construct A.
