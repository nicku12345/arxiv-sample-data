We show that a certain subspace of space of elliptic cusp forms is isomorphic as a Hecke module to a certain subspace of space of Jacobi cusp forms of degree one with matrix index by constructing an explicit lifting. This is a partial generalization of the work of Skoruppa and Zagier. This lifting is also related with the Ikeda lifting.
