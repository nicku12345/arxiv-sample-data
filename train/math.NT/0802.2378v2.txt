Let q\ge 2 and N\ge 1 be integers. W. Zhang (2008) has shown that for any fixed \epsilon> 0, and q^{\epsilon} \le N \le q^{1/2 -\epsilon},  \sum_{\chi \ne \chi_0} |\sum_{n=1}^N \chi(n)|^2 |L(1, \chi)|^2 = (1 + o(1)) \alpha_q q N  where the sum is take over all nonprincipal characters \chi modulo q, L(s, \chi) is the L-functions L(1, \chi) corresponding to \chi and \alpha_q = q^{o(1)} is some explicit function of q. Here we show that the same formula holds in the range q^{\epsilon} \le N \le q^{1 -\epsilon}.
