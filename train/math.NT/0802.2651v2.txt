If E is a minimal elliptic curve defined over \ZZ, we obtain a bound C, depending only on the global Tamagawa number of E, such that for any point P\in E(\QQ), nP is integral for at most one value of n>C. As a corollary, we show that if E/\QQ is a fixed elliptic curve, then for all twists E' of E of sufficient height, and all torsion-free, rank-one subgroups \Gamma\subseteq E'(\QQ), \Gamma contains at most 6 integral points. Explicit computations for congruent number curves are included.
