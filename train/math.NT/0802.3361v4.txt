We show that for any fixed base a, a positive proportion of primes have the property that they become composite after altering any one of their digits in the base a expansion; the case a=2 was already established by Cohen-Selfridge and Sun, using some covering congruence ideas of Erd\H{o}s. Our method is slightly different, using a partially covering set of congruences followed by an application of the Selberg sieve upper bound. As a consequence, it is not always possible to test whether a number is prime from its base a expansion without reading all of its digits. We also present some slight generalisations of these results.
