A fast new algorithm is used compute the zeros of the quadratic character L-functions for all negative fundamental discriminants with absolute value 10^12<d<10^12+10^7. These are compared to the 1-level density, including various lower order terms. These terms come from, on the one hand the Explicit Formula, and on the other the L-functions Ratios Conjecture. The latter give a much better fit to the data, providing numerical evidence for the conjecture.
