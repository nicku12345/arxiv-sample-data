We present here a method which allows to derive a nontrivial lower bounds for the least common multiple of some finite sequences of integers. We obtain efficient lower bounds (which in a way are optimal) for the arithmetic progressions and lower bounds less efficient (but nontrivial) for quadratic sequences whose general term has the form u_n = a n (n + t) + b with (a, t, b) \in {\mathbb{Z}}^3, a \geq 5, t \geq 0, \rm{gcd}(a, b) = 1. From this, we deduce for instance the lower bound: \mathrm{lcm}\{1^2 + 1, 2^2 + 1, ..., n^2 + 1\} \geq 0,32 (1,442)^n (for all n \geq 1).   In the last part of this article, we study the integer \mathrm{lcm}(n, n + 1, ..., n + k) (k \in \mathbb{N}, n \in {\mathbb{N}}^*). We show that it has a divisor d_{n, k} simple in its dependence on n and k, and a multiple m_{n, k} also simple in its dependence on n. In addition, we prove that both equalities: \mathrm{lcm}(n, n + 1, ..., n + k) = d_{n, k} and \mathrm{lcm}(n, n + 1, ..., n + k) = m_{n, k} hold for an infinitely many pairs (n, k).
