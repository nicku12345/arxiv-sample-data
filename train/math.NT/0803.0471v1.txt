We prove, without recourse to the Extended Riemann Hypothesis, that the projection modulo p of any prefixed polynomial with integer coefficients can be completely factored in deterministic polynomial time if p-1 has a (\ln p)^{O(1)}-smooth divisor exceeding (p-1)^{{1/2}+\delta} for some arbitrary small \delta. We also address the issue of computing roots modulo p in deterministic time.
