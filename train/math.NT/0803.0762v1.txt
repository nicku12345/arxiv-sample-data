The automorphic cohomology of a connected reductive algebraic group defined over Q decomposes as a direct algebraic sum of cuspidal and Eisenstein cohomology. In the present paper we construct regular Eisenstein cohomology classes for congruence subgroups of a rational form G of Q-rank 2 of SO(n,2).
