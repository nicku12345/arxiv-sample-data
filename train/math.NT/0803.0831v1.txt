We show that for every fixed A>0 and \theta>0 there is a   \vartheta=\vartheta(A,\theta)>0 with the following property.   Let n be odd and sufficiently large, and let   Q_{1}=Q_{2}:=n^{\h}(\log n)^{-\vartheta} and Q_{3}:=(\log n)^{\theta}. Then for all q_{3}\leq Q_{3}, all reduced residues a_{3} mod q_{3}, almost all q_{2}\leq Q_{2}, all admissible residues a_{2} mod q_{2}, almost all q_{1}\leq Q_{1} and all admissible residues a_{1} mod q_{1}, there exists a representation n=p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3} with primes p_{i}\equiv a_{i} (q_{i}), i=1,2,3.
