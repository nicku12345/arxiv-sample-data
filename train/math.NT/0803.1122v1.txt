Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a number field K. Michael Larsen conjectured that for any finitely generated subgroup G of Gal(\bar K/K), the Mordell-Weil rank of E is unbounded in number fields fixed by G. We prove that the conjecture holds over K=Q for both the analytic rank and the p-infinity Selmer rank of E for every odd prime p. For arbitrary E/K, we show that Larsen's conjecture follows from the standard conjectures for ranks of elliptic curves, provided K has a real place or E has non-integral j-invariant.
