The results of the computer hunt for the primes of the form q = m^2+1 up to 10^{20} are reported. The number of sign changes of the difference \pi_q(x) - \frac{C_q}{2}\int_2^x{du \over \sqrt{u}\log(u)} and the error term for this difference is investigated. The analogs of the Brun's constant and the Skewes number are calculated. An analog of the B conjecture of Hardy--Littlewood is formulated. It is argued that there is no Chebyshev bias for primes of the form q=m^2+1. All encountered integrals we were able to express by the logarithmic integral.
