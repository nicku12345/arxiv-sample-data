The "hybrid" moments  \int_T^{2T}|\zeta(1/2+it)|^k{(\int_{t-G}^{t+G}|\zeta(1/2+ix)|^\ell dx)}^m dt  of the Riemann zeta-function \zeta(s) on the critical line \Re s = 1/2 are studied. The expected upper bound for the above expression is O_\epsilon(T^{1+\epsilon}G^m). This is shown to be true for certain specific values of the natural numbers k,\ell,m, and the explicitly determined range of G = G(T;k,\ell,m). The application to a mean square bound for the Mellin transform function of |\zeta(1/2+ix)|^4 is given.
