The Stickelberger elements attached to an abelian extension of number fields conjecturally participate, under certain conditions, in annihilator relations involving higher algebraic K-groups. In [Victor P. Snaith, Stark's conjecture and new Stickelberger phenomena, Canad. J. Math. 58 (2) (2006) 419--448], Snaith introduces canonical Galois modules hoped to appear in annihilator relations generalising and improving those involving Stickelberger elements. In this paper we study the first of these modules, corresponding to the classical Stickelberger element, and prove a connection with the Stark units in a special case.
