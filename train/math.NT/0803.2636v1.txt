In a previous paper, the authors proved that in any system of three linear forms satisfying obvious necessary local conditions, there are at least two forms that infinitely often assume E_2-values; i.e., values that are products of exactly two primes. We use that result to prove that there are inifinitely many integers x that simultaneously satisfy \omega(x)=\omega(x+1)=4, \Omega(x)=\Omega(x+1)=5, \text{and} d(x)=d(x+1)=24. Here, \omega(x), \Omega(x), d(x) represent the number of prime divisors of x, the number of prime power divisors of x, and the number of divisors of x, respectively. We also prove similar theorems where x+1 is replaced by x+b for an arbitrary positive integer b. Our results sharpen earlier work of Heath-Brown, Pinner, and Schlage-Puchta.
