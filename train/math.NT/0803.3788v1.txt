Serre and Stark found a basis for the space of modular forms of weight 1/2 in terms of theta series. In this paper, we generalize their result - under certain mild restrictions on the level and character - to the case of weight 1/2 Hilbert modular forms over a totally real field of narrow class number 1. The methods broadly follow those of Serre-Stark; however we are forced to overcome technical difficulties which arise when we move out of Q.
