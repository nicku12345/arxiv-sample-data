Let f(z) = sum_n a(n) n^{(k-1)/2} e(nz) be a cusp form for Gamma_0(N), character chi and weight k geq 4. Let q(x) = x^2 + sx + t be a polynomial with integral coefficients. It is shown that sum_{n \leq X} a(q(n)) = cX + O(X^{6/7+eps}) for some constant c depending on f and q. The constant vanishes in many cases, for example if k is even. On the way a Kuznetsov formula for half-integral weight and entries having different sign is derived.
