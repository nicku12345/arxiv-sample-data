This paper explores the study of the general Hermite constant associated to the general linear group and its irreducible representations, as defined by T. Watanabe. To that end, a height, which naturally applies to flag varieties, is built and notions of perfection and eutaxy characterising extremality are introduced. Finally we acquaint some relations (e.g. with Korkine--Zolotareff reduction), upper bounds and computation relative to these constants.
