The number of points on a hyperelliptic curve over a field of q elements may be expressed as q+1+S where S is a certain character sum. We study fluctuations of S as the curve varies over a large family of hyperelliptic curves of genus g. For fixed genus and growing q, Katz and Sarnak showed that S/\sqrt{q} is distributed as the trace of a random 2g\times 2g unitary symplectic matrix. When the finite field is fixed and the genus grows, we find that the the limiting distribution of S is that of a sum of q independent trinomial random variables taking the values \pm 1 with probabilities 1/2(1+q^{-1}) and the value 0 with probability 1/(q+1). When both the genus and the finite field grow, we find that S/\sqrt{q} has a standard Gaussian distribution.
