In this paper, we propose the use of Ramanujan class of polynomials for the construction of prime order elliptic curves using the CM-method. We compare (theoretically and experimentally) the efficiency of using this new class against the use of the Weber, M_{D,l}(x) and M_{D,p_1,p_2}(x) polynomials and show that they clearly outweigh all of them in the generation of prime order elliptic curves.
