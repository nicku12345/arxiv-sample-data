We present an algorithm to determine if the L-series associated to an automorphic representation and the one associated to an elliptic curve over an imaginary quadratic field agree. By the work of Harris-Soudry-Taylor, Taylor and Berger-Harcos (cf. \cite{harris-taylor}, \cite{taylorII} and \cite{berger-harcos}) we can associate to an automorphic representation a family of compatible p-adic representations. Our algorithm is based on Faltings-Serre's method to prove that p-adic Galois representations are isomorphic.
