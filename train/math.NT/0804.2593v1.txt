Let A,B be nonempty subsets of a an abelian group G. Let N_i(A,B) denote the set of elements of G having i distinct decompositions as a product of an element of A and an element of B. We prove that  \sum _{1\le i \le t} |N_i (A,B)|\ge t(|A|+|B|- t-\alpha+1+w)-w,  where \alpha  is the largest size of a coset contained in AB and w=\min (\alpha-1,1), with a strict inequality if \alpha\ge 3 and t\ge 2, or if \alpha\ge 2 and t= 2.   This result is a local extension of results by Pollard and Green--Ruzsa and extends also for t>2 a recent result of Grynkiewicz, conjectured by Dicks--Ivanov (for non necessarily abelian groups) in connection to the famous Hanna Neumann problem in Group Theory.
