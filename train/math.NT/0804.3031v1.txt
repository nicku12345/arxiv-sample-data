Let A be an abelian variety defined over a number field K, the number of torsion points rational over a finite extension L is bounded polynomially in terms of the degree [L:K]. We formulate a question suggesting the optimal exponent for this bound in terms of the dimension of the Mumford-Tate groups of the abelian subvarieties of A; we study the behaviour under product and then give a positive answer to our question when A is the product of elliptic curves.
