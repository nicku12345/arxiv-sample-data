Bhargava proved a formula for counting, with certain weights, degree n etale extensions of a local field, or equivalently, local Galois representations to S_n. This formula is motivation for his conjectures about the density of discriminants of S_n-number fields. We prove there are analogous ``mass formulas'' that count local Galois representations to any group that can be formed from symmetric groups by wreath products and cross products, corresponding to counting towers and direct sums of etale extensions. We obtain as a corollary that the above mentioned groups have rational character tables. Our result implies that D_4 has a mass formula for certain weights, but we show that D_4 does not have a mass formula when the local Galois representations to D_4 are weighted in the same way as representations to S_4 are weighted in Bhargava's mass formula.
