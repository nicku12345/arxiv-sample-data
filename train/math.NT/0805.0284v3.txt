This paper uses the machinery of almost periodic functions to prove that even without uniform convergence the connection between a pair of almost periodic functions and the constants of the associated Fourier series exists for both the convolution and cross-correlation.   The general results for two almost periodic functions are narrowed and applied to Ramanujan sums and finally applied to support the specific relation of the Wiener-Khinchin formula for arithemic functions with a Ramanujan-Fourier Series.
