We consider some variations on the classical method of Runge for effectively determining integral points on certain curves. We first prove a version of Runge's theorem valid for higher-dimensional varieties, generalizing a uniform version of Runge's theorem due to Bombieri. We then take up the study of how Runge's method may be expanded by taking advantage of certain coverings. We prove both a result for arbitrary curves and a more explicit result for superelliptic curves. As an application of our method, we solve certain equations involving squares in products of terms in an arithmetic progression.
