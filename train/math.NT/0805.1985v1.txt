We study the arithmetic (real) function, with f 'essentially bounded'. In particular, we obtain non-trivial bounds, through f 'correlations', for the 'Selberg integral' and the 'symmetry integral' of f in almost all short intervals [x-h,x+h], N\le x\le 2N, beyond the 'classical' level, up to a very high level of distribution (for h not too small). This time we go beyond Large Sieve inequality. Precisely, our method applies Weil bound for Kloosterman sums.
