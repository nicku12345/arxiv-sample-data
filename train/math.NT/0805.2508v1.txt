Let p be an odd prime, and let K/K_0 be a quadratic extension of number fields. Denote by K_\pm the maximal \mathbb{Z}_p-power extensions of K that are Galois over K_0, with K_+ abelian over K_0 and K_- dihedral over K_0. In this paper we show that for a Galois representation over K_0 satisfying certain hypotheses, if it has odd Selmer rank over K then for one of K_\pm its Selmer rank over L is bounded below by [L:K] for L ranging over the finite subextensions of K in K_\pm. Our method or proof generalizes a method of Mazur--Rubin, building upon results of Nekov\'a\v{r}, and applies to abelian varieties of arbitrary dimension, (self-dual twists of) modular forms of even weight, and (twisted) Hida families.
