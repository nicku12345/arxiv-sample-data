Let p be a prime number, and let K be a p-adic local field. We study a class of semistable p-adic Galois representations of K, which we call {\it triangulordinary} because it includes the ordinary ones yet allows non-\'etale behavior in the associated (\phi,\Gamma_K)-modules over the Robba ring. Our main result provides a description of the Bloch--Kato local condition of such representations. We also propose a program, using variational techniques, that would give a definition of the Selmer group along the eigencurve of Coleman--Mazur, including notably its nonordinary locus.
