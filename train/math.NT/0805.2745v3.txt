We continue our investigation of the distribution of the fractional parts of a \gamma, where a is a fixed non-zero real number and \gamma runs over the imaginary parts of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. We establish some connections to pair correlation functions and the distribution of primes in short intervals. We also discuss analogous results for a more general L-function. This is a sequel to the paper math.NT/0405459.
