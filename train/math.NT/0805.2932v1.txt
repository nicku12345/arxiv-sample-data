Let k be a finite field. Wintenberger used the field of norms to give an equivalence between a category whose objects are totally ramified abelian p-adic Lie extensions E/F, where F is a local field with residue field k, and a category whose objects are pairs (K,A), where K\cong k((T)) and A is an abelian p-adic Lie subgroup of \Aut_k(K). In this paper we extend this equivalence to allow \Gal(E/F) and A to be arbitrary abelian pro-p groups.
