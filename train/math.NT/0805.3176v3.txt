In this paper, Thue's Fundamentaltheorem is analysed. We show that it includes, and often strengthens, known effective irrationality measures obtained via the so-called hypergeometric method as well as showing that it can be applied to previously unconsidered families of algebraic numbers. Furthermore, we extend the method to also cover approximation by algebraic numbers in imaginary quadratic number fields.
