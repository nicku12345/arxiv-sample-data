In recent papers, Fesenko has defined the non-abelian local reciprocity map for every totally-ramified arithmetically profinite (APF) Galois extension of a given local field K by extending the works of Hazewinkel and Neukirch-Iwasawa. The theory of Fesenko extends the previous non-abelian generalizations of local class field theory given by Koch-de Shalit and by A. Gurevich. In this paper, which is research-expository in nature, we give a detailed account of Fesenko's work including all the skipped proofs.
