In this paper, which is the natural continuation and generalization of Fesenko's non-abelian reciprocity map, we extend the theory of Fesenko to infinite APF-Galois extensions L over a local field K, with finite residue-class field \kappa_K of q=p^f elements, satisfying \pmb{\mu}_p(K^{sep})\subset K and K\subset L\subset K_{\phi^d} where the residue-class degree [\kappa_L:\kappa_K]=d. More precisely, for such extensions L/K, fixing a Lubin-Tate splitting \phi over K, we construct a 1-cocycle,   \pmb{\Phi}_{L/K}^{(\phi)}:\text{Gal}(L/K)\to K^\times/N_{L_0/K}L_0^\times\times U_{\widetilde{\mathbb X}(L/K)}^\diamond /Y_{L/L_0},   where L_0=L\cap K^{nr}, and study its functorial and ramification-theoretic properties. The case d=1 recovers the theory of Fesenko.
