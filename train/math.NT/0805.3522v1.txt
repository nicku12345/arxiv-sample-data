We introduce the notion of a hyper-atom. One of the main results of this paper is the \frac{2|G|}3--Theorem:   Let S be a finite generating subset of an abelian group G of order \ge 2. Let T be a finite subset of G such that 2\le |S|\le |T|, S+T is aperiodic, 0\in S\cap T and  \frac{2|G|+2}3\ge |S+T|= |S|+|T|-1. Let H be a hyper-atom of S. Then S and T are H--quasi-periodic. Moreover \phi(S) and \phi(T) are arithmetic progressions with the same difference, where \phi :G\mapsto G/H denotes the canonical morphism. This result implies easily the traditional critical pair Theory and its basic stone: Kemperman's Structure Theorem.
