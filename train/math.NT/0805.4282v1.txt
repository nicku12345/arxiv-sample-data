We introduce a ray class invariant X(C) for a totally real field, following Shintani's work in the real quadratic case. We prove a factorization formula X=X_1... X_n where each X_i=X_i(C) corresponds to a real place. Although this factorization depends a priori on some choices (especially on a cone decomposition), we can show that it is actually independent of these choices. Finally, we describe the behavior of X_i(C) when the signature of C at a real place is changed. This last result is also interpreted into an interesting behavior of the derivative L'(0,\chi) of L-functions.
