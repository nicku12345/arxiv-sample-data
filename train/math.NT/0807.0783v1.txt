Let a=(a_n)_{n\ge 1} be a periodic sequence, F_a(s) the meromorphic continuation of \sum_{n\ge 1} a_n/n^s, and N_a(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, T) the number of zeros of F_a(s), counted with their multiplicities, in the rectangle \sigma_1 < \Re s < \sigma_2, |\Im s | \le T. We extend previous results of Laurin\v{c}ikas, Kaczorowski, Kulas, and Steuding, by showing that if F_a(s) is not of the form P(s) L_{\chi} (s), where P(s) is a Dirichlet polynomial and L_{\chi}(s) a Dirichlet L-function, then there exists an \eta=\eta(a)>0 such that for all 1/2 < \sigma_1 < \sigma_2 < 1+\eta, we have c_1 T \le N_a(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, T) \le c_2 T for sufficiently large T, and suitable positive constants c_1 and c_2 depending on a, \sigma_1, and \sigma_2.
