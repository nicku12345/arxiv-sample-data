After providing a general result for dihedral extensions, we study the growth of the p-part of the class group of the non-normal subfields of the anticyclotomic extension of an imaginary quadratic field, providing a formula of Iwasawa type. Furthermore, we describe the structure of the projective limit of these class groups.
