Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis it is proved that, for fixed k>0 and H = T^\theta with fixed 0<\theta \le 1,  \int_T^{T+H}|\zeta(1/2+it)|^{2k} dt \ll H(\log T)^{k^2(1+O(1/\log_3T))},  where \log_jT = \log(\log_{j-1}T). The proof is based on the recent method of K. Soundararajan for counting the occurrence of large values of \log|\zeta(1/2+it)|, who proved that  \int_0^{T}|\zeta(1/2+it)|^{2k} dt \ll_\epsilon T(\log T)^{k^2+\epsilon}.
