For Hurwitz zeta function, we obtain power series expression in second variable for its higher order derivatives (with respect to first variable) at non-positive integer arguments and consequently obtain rapidly decreasing series expression for Riemann zeta fuction at positive odd integer arguments. Further, we obtain corresponding results for Dirichlet L-series. We also a unified proof of various classical identities involving Riemann zeta values.
