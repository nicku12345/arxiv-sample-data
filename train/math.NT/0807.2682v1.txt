In this paper we give the q-extension of Euler numbers which can be viewed as interpolating of the q-analogue of Euler zeta function ay negative integers, in the same way that Riemann zeta function interpolates Bernoulli numbers at negative integers. Finally we woll treat some identities of the q-extension of the euler numbers by using fermionic p-adic q-integration on Z_p.
