We investigate the relation between the Riesz and the B{\'a}ez-Duarte criterion for the Riemann Hypothesis. In particular we present the relation between the function R(x) appearing in the Riesz criterion and the sequence c_k appearing in the B{\'a}ez-Duarte formulation. It is shown that R(x) can be expressed by c_k, and, vice versa, the sequence c_k can be obtained from the values of R(x) at integer arguments. Also, we give some relations involving c_k and R(x), and value of the alternating sum of c_k.
