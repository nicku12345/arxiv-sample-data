We show that for a non-positive value of the first variable,Hurwitz zeta function becomes a polynomial in the second variable. We show this, using 'integration approach', instead of 'power series approach', which we had resorted to, in our earlier paper with the same title. This, in particular, explains why Riemann zeta function at positive even integer arguments, can be evaluated and why it cannot be evaluated explicitly at positive odd integer arguments.
