Let A be an additive basis. We call ``essential subset'' of A any finite subset P of A such that A \setminus P is not an additive basis and that P is minimal (for the inclusion order) to have this property. A recent theorem due to B. Deschamps and the author states that any additive basis has only finitely many essential subsets (see ``Essentialit\'e dans les bases additives, J. Number Theory, 123 (2007), p. 170-192''). The aim of this note is to give a simple proof of this theorem.
