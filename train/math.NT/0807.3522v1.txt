Let pi be a cuspidal, automorphic representation of GSp(4) attached to a Siegel modular form of degree 2. We refine the method of Furusawa to obtain an integral representation for the degree-8 L-function L(s,pi x tau), where tau runs through certain cuspidal, automorphic representation of GL(2). Our calculations include the case of square-free level for the p-adic components of tau, and a wide class of archimedean types including Maass forms. As an application we obtain a special value result for L(s,pi x tau).
