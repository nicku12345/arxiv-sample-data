Consider an elliptic curve defined over an imaginary quadratic field K with good reduction at the primes above p\geq 5 and has complex multiplication by the full ring of integers \mathcal{O}_K of K. In this paper, we construct p-adic analogues of the Eisenstein-Kronecker series for such elliptic curve as Coleman functions on the elliptic curve. We then prove p-adic analogues of the first and second Kronecker limit formulas by using the distribution relation of the Kronecker theta function.
