Let \epsilon be a fixed positive quantity, m be a large integer, x_j denote integer variables. We prove that for any positive integers N_1,N_2,N_3 with N_1N_2N_3>m^{1+\epsilon}, the set  \{x_1x_2x_3 \pmod m: \quad x_j\in [1,N_j] \}  contains almost all the residue classes modulo m (i.e., its cardinality is equal to m+o(m)). We further show that if m is cubefree, then for any positive integers N_1,N_2,N_3,N_4 with N_1N_2N_3N_4>m^{1+\epsilon}, the set  \{x_1x_2x_3x_4 \pmod m: \quad x_j\in [1,N_j] \}  also contains almost all the residue classes modulo m.   Let p be a large prime parameter and let p>N>p^{63/76+\epsilon}. We prove that for any nonzero integer constant k and any integer \lambda\not\equiv 0\pmod p the congruence  p_1p_2(p_3+k)\equiv \lambda\pmod p  admits (1+o(1))\pi(N)^3/p solutions in prime numbers p_1, p_2, p_3\le N.
