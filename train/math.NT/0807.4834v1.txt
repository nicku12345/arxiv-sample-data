In this Ph.D. thesis, written under the direction of D.B. Zagier and R.W. Bruggeman, we study the mock theta functions, that were introduced by Ramanujan. We show how they can be interpreted in the theory of (real-analytic) modular forms. In Chapter 1 we give results for Lerch sums (also called Appell functions, or generalized Lambert series). In Chapter 2 we consider indefinite theta functions of type (r-1,1). Chapter 3 deals with Fourier coefficients of meromorphic Jacobi forms. In Chapter 4 we use the results from Chapter 2 to give explicit results for 8 of the 10 fifth order mock theta functions and all 3 seventh order functions, that were originally defined by Ramanujan. The result is that we can find a correction term, which is a period integral of a weight 3/2 unary theta functions, such that if we add it to the mock theta function, we get a weight 1/2 real-analytic modular form, which is annihilated by the hyperbolic Laplacian.
