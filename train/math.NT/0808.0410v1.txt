We generalize well-known Catalan-type integrals for Euler's constant to values of the generalized-Euler-constant function and its derivatives. Using generating functions appeared in these integral representations we give new Vacca and Ramanujan-type series for values of the generalized-Euler-constant function and Addison-type series for values of the generalized-Euler-constant function and its derivative. As a consequence, we get base B rational series for \log\frac{4}{\pi}, \frac{G}{\pi} (where G is Catalan's constant), \frac{\zeta'(2)}{\pi^2} and also for logarithms of Somos's and Glaisher-Kinkelin's constants.
