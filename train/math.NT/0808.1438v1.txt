Furusawa has given an integral representation for the degree 8 L-function of GSp(4) x GL(2) and has carried out the unramified calculation. The local p-adic zeta integrals were calculated in our earlier work under the assumption that the GSp(4) representation \pi is unramified and the GL(2) representation \tau has conductor p. In the present work we generalize to the case where the GL(2) representation has arbitrarily high conductor. The result is that the zeta integral represents the local Euler factor L(s,\pi \times \tau) in all cases. As a global application we obtain a special value result for a GSp(4) x GL(2) global L-function coming from classical holomorphic cusp forms with arbitrarily high level for the elliptic modular form.
