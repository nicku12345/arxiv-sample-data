When studying the least common multiple of some finite sequences of integers, the first author introduced the interesting arithmetic functions g_k (k \in \mathbb{N}), defined by g_k(n) := \frac{n (n + 1) ... (n + k)}{\lcm(n, n + 1, >..., n + k)} (\forall n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}). He proved that g_k (k \in \mathbb{N}) is periodic and k! is a period of g_k. He raised the open problem consisting to determine the smallest positive period P_k of g_k. Very recently, S. Hong and Y. Yang have improved the period k! of g_k to \lcm(1, 2, ..., k). In addition, they have conjectured that P_k is always a multiple of the positive integer \frac{\lcm(1, 2, >..., k, k + 1)}{k + 1}. An immediate consequence of this conjecture states that if (k + 1) is prime then the exact period of g_k is precisely equal to \lcm(1, 2, ..., k).   In this paper, we first prove the conjecture of S. Hong and Y. Yang and then we give the exact value of P_k (k \in \mathbb{N}). We deduce, as a corollary, that P_k is equal to the part of \lcm(1, 2, ..., k) not divisible by some prime.
