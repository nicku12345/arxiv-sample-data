Let f be an L^2-normalized weight zero Hecke-Maass cusp form of square-free level N, character \chi and Laplacian eigenvalue \lambda\geq 1/4. It is shown that \| f \|_{\infty} \ll_{\lambda} N^{-1/37}, from which the hybrid bound \|f \|_{\infty} \ll \lambda^{1/4} (N\lambda)^{-\delta} (for some \delta > 0) is derived. The first bound holds also for f = y^{k/2}F where F is a holomorphic cusp form of weight k with the implied constant now depending on k.
