Following Rankin's method, D. Zagier computed the n-th Rankin-Cohen bracket of a modular form g of weight k_1 with the Eisenstein series of weight k_2 and then computed the inner product of this Rankin-Cohen bracket with a cusp form f of weight k = k_1+k_2+2n and showed that this inner product gives, upto a constant, the special value of the Rankin-Selberg convolution of f and g. This result was generalized to Jacobi forms of degree 1 by Y. Choie and W. Kohnen. In this paper, we generalize this result to Jacobi forms defined over {\mathcal H} \times {\mathbb C}^{(g, 1)}.
