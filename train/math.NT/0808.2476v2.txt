Let K be a number field, \overline{\mathbb Q}, or the field of rational functions on a smooth projective curve over a perfect field, and let V be a subspace of K^N, N \geq 2. Let Z_K be a union of varieties defined over K such that V \nsubseteq Z_K. We prove the existence of a point of small height in V \setminus Z_K, providing an explicit upper bound on the height of such a point in terms of the height of V and the degree of a hypersurface containing Z_K, where dependence on both is optimal. This generalizes and improves upon the previous results of the author. As a part of our argument, we provide a basic extension of the function field version of Siegel's lemma of J. Thunder to an inequality with inhomogeneous heights. As a corollary of the method, we derive an explicit lower bound for the number of algebraic integers of bounded height in a fixed number field.
