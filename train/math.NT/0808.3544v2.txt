Let p be a prime. In this paper, we present a detailed p-adic analysis to factorials and double factorials and their congruences. We give good bounds for the p-adic sizes of the coefficients of the divided universal Bernoulli number {{\hat B_n}\over n} when n is divisible by p-1. Using these we then establish the universal Kummer congruences modulo powers of a prime p for the divided universal Bernoulli numbers {{\hat B_n}\over n} when n is divisible by p-1.
