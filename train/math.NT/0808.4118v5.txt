In this paper we present systematically analysis on the smallest eigenvalue of matrices associated with completely even functions (mod r). We obtain several theorems on the asymptotic behavior of the smallest eigenvalue of matrices associated with completely even functions (mod r). In particular, we get information on the asymptotic behavior of the smallest eigenvalue of the famous Smith matrices. Finally some examples are given to demonstrate the main results.
