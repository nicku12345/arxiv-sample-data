Under the assumption that the approximating function \psi is monotonic, the classical Khintchine-Groshev theorem provides an elegant probabilistic criterion for the Lebesgue measure of the set of \psi-approximable matrices in \R^{mn}. The famous Duffin-Schaeffer counterexample shows that the monotonicity assumption on \psi is absolutely necessary when m=n=1. On the other hand, it is known that monotonicity is not necessary when n > 2 (Sprindzuk) or when n=1 and m>1 (Gallagher). Surprisingly, when n=2 the situation is unresolved. We deal with this remaining case and thereby remove all unnecessary conditions from the classical Khintchine-Groshev theorem. This settles a multi-dimensional analogue of Catlin's Conjecture.
