Given a nonnegative function \psi : \N \to \R , let W(\psi) denote the set of real numbers x such that |nx -a| < \psi(n)  for infinitely many reduced rationals a/n (n>0) . A consequence of our main result is that W(\psi) is of full Lebesgue measure if there exists an \epsilon > 0  such that  \textstyle \sum_{n\in\N}(\frac{\psi(n)}{n})^{1+\epsilon}\varphi (n)=\infty .  The Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture is the corresponding statement with \epsilon = 0 and represents a fundamental unsolved problem in metric number theory. Another consequence is that W(\psi) is of full Hausdorff dimension if the above sum with \epsilon = 0 diverges; i.e. the dimension analogue of the Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture is true.
