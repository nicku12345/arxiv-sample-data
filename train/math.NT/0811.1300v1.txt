A. Mukhopadhyay, M. R. Murty and K. Srinivas (http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0418) have recently studied various arithmetic properties of the discriminant \Delta_n(a,b) of the trinomial f_{n,a,b}(t) = t^n + at + b, where n \ge 5 is a fixed integer. In particular, it is shown that, under the abc-conjecture, for every n \equiv 1 \pmod 4, the quadratic fields \Q(\sqrt{\Delta_n(a,b)}) are pairwise distinct for a positive proportion of such discriminants with integers a and b such that f_{n,a,b} is irreducible over \Q and |\Delta_n(a,b)|\le X, as X\to \infty. We use the square-sieve and bounds of character sums to obtain a weaker but unconditional version of this result.
