Building upon work of Clozel, Harris, Shepherd-Barron, and Taylor, this paper shows that certain Galois representations become automorphic after one makes a suitably large totally-real extension to the base field. The main innovation here is that the result applies to Galois representations to GL_{2n}, where previous work dealt with representations to GSp_n. The main technique is the consideration of the cohomology the Dwork hypersurface, and in particular, of pieces of this cohomology other than the invariants under the natural group action.
