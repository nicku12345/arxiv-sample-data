We consider the one-parameter family of hypersurfaces in \Pj^5 with projective equation (X_1^5+X_2^5+X_3^5+X_4^5+X_5^5) = 5\lambda X_1 X_2... X_5, (writing \lambda for the parameter), proving that the Galois representations attached to their cohomologies are potentially automorphic, and hence that the zeta function of the family has meromorphic continuation throughout the complex plane.
