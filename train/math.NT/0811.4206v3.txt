Let F_p be the field of a prime order p. For a subset A\subset F_p we consider the product set A(A+1). This set is an image of A\times A under the polynomial mapping f(x,y)=xy+x:F_p\times F_p\to F_p. In the present paper we show that if |A|<p^{1/2}, then  |A(A+1)|\ge |A|^{106/105+o(1)}. If |A|>p^{2/3}, then we prove that |A(A+1)|\gg \sqrt{p |A|} and show that this is the optimal in general settings bound up to the implied constant. We also estimate the cardinality of A(A+1) when A is a subset of real numbers. We show that in this case one has the Elekes type bound  |A(A+1)|\gg |A|^{5/4}.
