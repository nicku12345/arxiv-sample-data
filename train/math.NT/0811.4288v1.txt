Concentration and equi-distribution, near the unit circle, in Solomyak's set, of the union of the Galois conjugates and the beta-conjugates of a Parry number \beta are characterized by means of the Erd\H{o}s-Tur\'an approach, and its improvements by Mignotte and Amoroso, applied to the analytical function f_{\beta}(z) = -1 + \sum_{i \geq 1} t_i z^i associated with the R\'enyi \beta-expansion d_{\beta}(1)= 0.t_1 t_2 ... of unity. Mignotte's discrepancy function requires the knowledge of the factorization of the Parry polynomial of \beta. This one is investigated using theorems of Cassels, Dobrowolski, Pinner and Vaaler, Smyth, Schinzel in terms of cyclotomic, reciprocal non-cyclotomic and non-reciprocal factors. An upper bound of Mignotte's discrepancy function which arises from the beta-conjugates of \beta which are roots of cyclotomic factors is linked to the Riemann hypothesis, following Amoroso. An equidistribution limit theorem, following Bilu's theorem, is formulated for the concentration phenomenon of conjugates of Parry numbers near the unit circle. Parry numbers are Perron numbers. Open problems on non-Parry Perron numbers are mentioned in the context of the existence of non-unique factorizations of elements of number fields into irreducible Perron numbers (Lind).
