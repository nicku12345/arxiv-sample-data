We study the solutions of a Diophantine equation of the form a^x+b^y=c^z, where a\equiv 2 \pmod 4, b\equiv 3 \pmod 4 and \gcd (a,b,c)=1. The main result is that if there exists a solution (x,y,z)=(2,2,r) with r>1 odd then this is the only solution in integers greater than 1, with the possible exception of finitely many values (c,r). We also prove the uniqueness of such a solution if any of a, b, c is a prime power. In a different vein, we obtain various inequalities that must be satisfied by the components of a putative second solution.
