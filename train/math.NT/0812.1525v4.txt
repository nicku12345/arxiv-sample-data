We present a Serre-type conjecture on the modularity of four-dimensional symplectic mod p Galois representations. We assume that the Galois representation is irreducible and odd (in the symplectic sense). The modularity condition is formulated using the etale and the algebraic de Rham cohomology of Siegel modular varieties of level prime to p. We concentrate on the case when the Galois representation is ordinary at p and we give a corresponding list of Serre weights. When the representation is moreover tamely ramified at p, we conjecture that all weights of this list are modular, otherwise we describe a subset of weights on the list that should be modular. We propose a construction of de Rham cohomology classes using the dual BGG complex, which should realise some of these weights.
