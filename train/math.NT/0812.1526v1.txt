In this paper we consider the congruence equation q_1 q_2 \equiv c \pmod q with a < q_1 \leq a + q^{1/2+\epsilon} and b < q_2 \leq b + q^{1/2+\epsilon} and show that it has solution for almost all a and b. Then we apply it to a question of Fujii and Kitaoka as well as generalize it to more variables. At the end, we will present a new way to attack the above congruence equation question through higher moments.
