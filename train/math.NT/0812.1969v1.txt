Let K be an algebraic number field, and \pi=\otimes\pi_{v} an irreducible, automorphic, cuspidal representation of \GL_{m}(\mathbb{A}_{K}) with analytic conductor C(\pi). The theorem on analytic strong multiplicity one established in this note states, essentially, that there exists a positive constant c depending on \varepsilon>0, m, and K only, such that \pi can be decided completely by its local components \pi_{v} with norm N(v)<c\cdot C(\pi)^{2m+\varepsilon}.
