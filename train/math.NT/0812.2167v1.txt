Let p be an odd prime. Let F/k be a cyclic extension of degree p and of characteristic different from p. The explicit constructions of the non-abelian p^{3}-extensions over k, are induced by certain elements in {F(\mu_{p})}^{*}. In this paper we let k=\QQ and present sufficient conditions for these elements to be suitable for the constructions. Polynomials for the non-abelian groups of order 27 over \QQ are constructed. We describe explicit realizations of those groups with exactly two ramified primes, without consider Scholz conditions.
