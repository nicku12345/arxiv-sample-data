We obtain several expansions for \zeta(s) involving a sequence of polynomials in s, denoted in this paper by \alpha_k(s). These polynomials can be regarded as a generalization of Stirling numbers of the first kind and our identities extend some series expansions for the zeta function that are known for integer values of s. The expansions also give a different approach to the analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function.
