This paper contains results concerning a conjecture made by Lang and Silverman predicting a lower bound for the canonical height on abelian varieties of dimension 2 over number fields. The method used here is a local height decomposition. We derive as corollaries uniform bounds on the number of torsion points on families of abelian surfaces and on the number of rational points on families of genus 2 curves.
