Recently, \lambda-Bernoulli and \lambda-Euler numbers are studied in [5, 10]. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic study of some families of the q-extensions of the \lambda-Bernoulli and the \lambda-Euler numbers by using the bosonic p-adic q-integral and the fermionic p-adic q-integral. The investigation of these \lambda-q-Bernoulli and \lambda-q-Euler numbers leads to interesting identities related to these objects. The results of the present paper cover earlier results concerning q-Bernoulli and q-Euler numbers. By using derivative operator to the generating functions of \lambda-q-Bernoulli and \lambda-q-Euler numbers, we give the q-extensions of Lerch zeta function.
