We give a new construction of q-Genocchi numbers, Euler numbers of higher order, which are different than the q-Genocchi numbers of Cangul-Ozden-Simsek. By using our q-Genoucchi, Euler nimbers of higher order, we can investigate the interesting relationship between w-q-Euler polynomials and w-q-Genocchi polynomials.
