A generalization of the Apery-like numbers, which is used to describe the special values \zeta_Q(2) and \zeta_Q(3) of the spectral zeta function for the non-commutative harmonic oscillator, are introduced and studied. In fact, we give a recurrence relation for them, which shows a ladder structure among them. Further, we consider the `rational part' of the higher Apery-like numbers. We discuss several kinds of congruence relations among them, which are regarded as an analogue of the ones among Apery numbers.
