In this paper we present the generalization of the higher order q-Euler numbers and q-Genocchi numbers and w-Genocchi numbers and polynomials of high order using the multivariate fermionic p-adic integral on Zp. We have the interpolation functions of these numbers and polynomials. We obtain the distribution relations for q-extensions of w-Euler and w-Genocchi polynomials. We also have the interesting relation for q-extensions of these polynomials. We define (h, q)-extensions of w-Euler and w-Genocchi polynomials of high order. We have the interpolation functions for (h, q)-extensions of these polynomials. Moreover, we obtain some meaningful results of (h, q)-extensions of w-Euler and w-Genocchi polynomials.
