The purpose of this paper is to present a systemic study of some families of q-Euler numbers and polynomials of Norlund's type by using multivariate fermionic p-adic integral on Zp. Moreover, the study of these higher-order q-Euler numbers and polynomials implies some interesting q-analogue of stirling numbers identities.
