Let C be a hyperelliptic curve given by the equation y^2=f(x), where f\in\Z[x] and f hasn't multiple roots. We say that points P_{i}=(x_{i}, y_{i})\in C(\Q) for i=1,2,..., n are in arithmetic progression if the numbers x_{i} for i=1,2,..., n are in arithmetic progression.   In this paper we show that there exists a polynomial k\in\Z[t] with such a property that on the elliptic curve \cal{E}: y^2=x^3+k(t) (defined over the field \Q(t)) we can find four points in arithmetic progression which are independent in the group of all \Q(t)-rational points on the curve \cal{E}. In particular this result generalizes some earlier results of Lee and V\'{e}lez from \cite{LeeVel}. We also show that if n\in\N is odd then there are infinitely many k's with such a property that on the curves y^2=x^n+k there are four rational points in arithmetic progressions. In the case when n is even we can find infinitely many k's such that on the curves y^2=x^n+k there are six rational points in arithmetic progression.
