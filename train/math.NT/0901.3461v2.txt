In this article we compute the qth power values of the quadratic polynomials f with negative squarefree discriminant such that q is coprime to the class number of the splitting field of f over \mathbb{Q}. The theory of unique factorisation and that of primitive divisors of integer sequences is used to deduce a bound on the values of q which is small enough to allow the remaining cases to be easily checked. The results are used to determine all perfect power terms of certain polynomially generated integer sequences, including the Sylvester sequence.
