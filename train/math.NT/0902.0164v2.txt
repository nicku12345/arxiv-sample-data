The aim of this paper is to describe some partial advances in the solution of the following two problems. Find the maximal order of vanishing at infinity of a non-zero Drinfeld quasi-modular form of given weight. Determine differential properties of a Drinfeld quasi-modular form of given weight and depth with maximal order of vanishing at infinity.
