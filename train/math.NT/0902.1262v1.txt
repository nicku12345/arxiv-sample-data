In this paper, we shall show that certain signed cyclic sums of Mordell-Tornheim L-values are rational linear combinations of products of multiple L-values of lower depths (i.e., reducible). This simultaneously generalizes some results of Subbarao and Sitaramachandrarao, and Matsumoto et al. As a direct corollary, we can prove that for any integer k>2 and positive integer n, the Mordell-Tornheim sums zeta_\MT(\{n\}_k) is reducible.
