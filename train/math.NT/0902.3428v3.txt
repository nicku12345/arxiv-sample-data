Let A be a Dedekind domain, K the fraction field, \p a non-zero prime ideal of A, and K_\pp the completion of K with respect to the \p-adic topology. At the input of a monic irreducible separable polynomial, f(x)\in A[x], Montes algorithm determines the factorization of f(x) over K_\pp[x], and it provides essential arithmetic information about the finite extensions of K_\pp determined by the different irreducible factors. In particular, it can be used to compute \p-integral bases of the extension of K determined by f(x) \cite{newapp}. In this paper we present new (and faster) methods to compute \p-integral bases, based on the use of the quotients of certain divisions with remainder of f(x) that occur along the flow of Montes algorithm.
