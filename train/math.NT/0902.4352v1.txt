Taking r>0, let \pi_{2r}(x) denote the number of prime pairs (p, p+2r) with p\le x. The prime-pair conjecture of Hardy and Littlewood (1923) asserts that \pi_{2r}(x)\sim 2C_{2r} {\rm li}_2(x) with an explicit constant C_{2r}>0. There seems to be no good conjecture for the remainders \omega_{2r}(x)=\pi_{2r}(x)- 2C_{2r} {\rm li}_2(x) that corresponds to Riemann's formula for \pi(x)-{\rm li}(x). However, there is a heuristic approximate formula for averages of the remainders \omega_{2r}(x) which is supported by numerical results.
