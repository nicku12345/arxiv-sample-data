Given two newforms f and g of respective weights k and l with k<l, Hida constructed a p-adic L-function interpolating the values of the Rankin convolution of f and g in the critical strip l \leq s \leq k. However, this construction works only if f is an ordinary form. Using a method developed by Panchishkin to construct p-adic L-function associated with modular forms, we generalize this construction to the case where the slope of f is small.
