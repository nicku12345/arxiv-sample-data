Let k\ge 0,a\ge 1 and b\ge 0 be integers. We define the arithmetic function g_{k,a,b} for any positive integer n by g_{k,a,b}(n):=\frac{(b+na)(b+(n+1)a)...(b+(n+k)a)} {{\rm lcm}(b+na,b+(n+1)a,...,b+(n+k)a)}. Letting a=1 and b=0, then g_{k,a,b} becomes the arithmetic function introduced previously by Farhi. Farhi proved that g_{k,1,0} is periodic and that k! is a period. Hong and Yang improved Farhi's period k! to {\rm lcm}(1,2,...,k) and conjectured that \frac{{\rm lcm}(1,2,...,k,k+1)}{k+1} divides the smallest period of g_{k,1,0}. Recently, Farhi and Kane proved this conjecture and determined the smallest period of g_{k,1,0}. For the general integers a\ge 1 and b\ge 0, it is natural to ask the interesting question: Is g_{k,a,b} periodic? If so, then what is the smallest period of g_{k,a,b}? We first show that the arithmetic function g_{k,a,b} is periodic. Subsequently, we provide detailed p-adic analysis of the periodic function g_{k,a,b}. Finally, we determine the smallest period of g_{k,a,b}. Our result extends the Farhi-Kane theorem from the set of positive integers to general arithmetic progressions.
