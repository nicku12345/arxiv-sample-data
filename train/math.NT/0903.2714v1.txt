When A and B are subsets of the integers in [1,X] and [1,Y] respectively, with |A| \geq \alpha X and |B| \geq \beta X, we show that the number of rational numbers expressible as a/b with (a,b) in A \times B is \gg (\alpha \beta)^{1+\epsilon}XY for any \epsilon > 0, where the implied constant depends on \epsilon alone. We then construct examples that show that this bound cannot in general be improved to \gg \alpha \beta XY. We also resolve the natural generalisation of our problem to arbitrary subsets C of the integer points in [1,X] \times [1,Y]. Finally, we apply our results to answer a question of S\'ark\"ozy concerning the differences of consecutive terms of the product sequence of a given integer sequence.
