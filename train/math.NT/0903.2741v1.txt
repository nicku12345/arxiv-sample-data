Let d be a positive integer. Let p be a prime number. Let \alpha be a real algebraic number of degree d+1. We establish that there exist a positive constant c and infinitely many algebraic numbers \xi of degree d such that |\alpha - \xi| \cdot \min\{|\Norm(\xi)|_p,1\} < c H(\xi)^{-d-1} (\log 3 H(\xi))^{-1/d}. Here, H(\xi) and \Norm(\xi) denote the na{\"\i}ve height of \xi and its norm, respectively. This extends an earlier result of de Mathan and Teuli\'e that deals with the case d=1.
