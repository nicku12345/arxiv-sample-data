In this paper, by the properties of p-adic invariant integral on Zp, we establish various identities concerning the generalized Bernoulli numbers and polynomials. From the symmetric properties of p-adic invariant integral on Zp, we give some interesting relationship between the power sums and the generalized Bernoulli polynomials.
