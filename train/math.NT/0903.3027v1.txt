We consider properties of infinite algebraic extensions of global fields through their Tsfasman-Vladuts invariants (related in particular to the decomposition of primes). We use recent results of A. Schmidt and a weak effective version of the Grunwald-Wang theorem to construct infinite global fields having at the same time a given finite set of positive invariants, a prescribed set of invariants being zero and a controlled deficiency.
