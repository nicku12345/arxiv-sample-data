We extend Kobayashi's formulation of Iwasawa theory for elliptic curves at supersingular primes to include the case a_p \neq 0, where a_p is the trace of Frobenius. To do this, we algebraically construct p-adic L-functions L_p^{\sharp} and L_p^{\flat} with the good growth properties of the classical Pollack p-adic L-functions that in fact match them exactly when a_p=0 and p is odd. We then generalize Kobayashi's methods to define two Selmer groups \Sel^{\sharp} and \Sel^{\flat} and formulate a main conjecture, stating that each characteristic ideal of the duals of these Selmer groups is generated by our p-adic L-functions L_p^{\sharp} and L_p^{\flat}. We then use results by Kato to prove a divisibility statement.
