We translate O'Meara's classification Theorem 93:28 in terms of BONGs. BONGs, short for "basis of norm generators", are a new way of describing quadratic lattices, an alternative to the traditional Jordan decompositions. They were introduced in [B].   Our result has its own merits as it is somewhat simpler than O'Meara's 93:28. However, it's main importance is that it is a prerequisite for a future work where we solve the more complicated problem of representation.   [B] C. N.
