We obtain the formula for the twisted harmonic second moment of the L-functions associated with primitive Hecke eigenforms of weight 2. A consequence of our mean value theorem is reminiscent of recent results of Conrey and Young on the reciprocity formula for the twisted second moment of Dirichlet L-functions.
