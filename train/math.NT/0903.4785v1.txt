Let f_1,...,f_d be an orthogonal basis for the space of cusp forms of even weight 2k on \Gamma_0(N). Let L(f_i,s) and L(f_i,\chi,s) denote the L-function of f_i and its twist by a Dirichlet character \chi, respectively. In this note, we obtain a ``trace formula'' for the values L(f_i,\chi,m)\overline{L(f_i,n)} at integers m and n with 0<m,n<2k and proper parity. In the case N=1 or N=2, the formula gives us a convenient way to evaluate precisly the value of the ratio L(f,\chi,m)/L(f,n) for a Hecke eigenform f.
