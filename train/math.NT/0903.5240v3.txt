Let K be a field of characteristic 0, f:\mathbb{N}\to K be a multiplicative function, and F(z)=\sum_{n\geq 1} f(n)z^n\in K[[z]] be algebraic over K(z). Then either there is a natural number k and a periodic multiplicative function \chi(n) such that f(n)=n^k \chi(n) for all n, or f(n) is eventually zero. In particular, the generating function of a multiplicative function f:\mathbb{N}\to K is either transcendental or rational.
