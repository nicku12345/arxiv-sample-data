We give a general expression of spherical functions on p-adic homogeneous spaces of G, based on data of G and functional equations of spherical functions. Then, we show a unified method to obtain functional equations of spherical functions and relate them those of p-adic local zeta functions of small prehomogeneous vector spaces.
