We examine the behaviour of the zeros of the real and imaginary parts of \xi(s) on the vertical line \Re s = 1/2+\lambda, for \lambda \neq 0. This can be rephrased in terms of studying the zeros of families of entire functions A(s) = {1/2} (\xi(s+\lambda) + \xi(s - \lambda)) and B(s) = \frac{1}{2i} (\xi(s+\lambda) - \xi(s - \lambda)). We will prove some unconditional analogues of results appearing in \cite{Lag}, specifically that the normalized spacings of the zeros of these functions converges to a limiting distribution consisting of equal spacings of length 1, in contrast to the expected GUE distribution for the same zeros at \lambda = 0. We will also show that, outside of a small exceptional set, the zeros of \Re \xi(s) and \Im \xi(s) interlace on \Re s = 1/2+\lambda. These results will depend on showing that away from the critical line, \arg \xi(s) is well behaved.
