In 'The Lost Notebook and Other Unpublished Papers' of Ramanujan are present some manuscripts of Ramanujan in the handwriting of G. N. Watson which are 'copied from loose papers'. We present a proof of a beautiful formula of Ramanujan in one of these manuscripts, namely a transformation formula involving the Gamma function and Riemann Zeta function. This formula elegantly yields a modular relation. Later we also give another proof of the first equality of this transformation formula along the lines suggested by Andrew P. Guinand.
