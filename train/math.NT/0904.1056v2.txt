We derive two new analogues of a transformation formula of Ramanujan involving the Gamma and Riemann zeta functions present in the Lost Notebook. Both involve infinite series consisting of Hurwitz zeta functions and yield modular relations. As a special case of the first formula, we obtain an identity involving polygamma functions given by Andrew P. Guinand and as a limiting case of the second formula, we derive the transformation formula of Ramanujan.
