This paper is a continuation of our recent paper with the same title, arXiv:0806.1596v1 [math.NT], where a number of integral equalities involving integrals of the logarithm of the Riemann zeta-function were introduced and it was shown that some of them are equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. A few new equalities of this type are established; contrary to the preceding paper the focus now is on integrals involving the argument of the Riemann zeta-function (imaginary part of logarithm) rather than the logarithm of its module (real part of logarithm). Preliminary results of the numerical research performed using these equalities to test the Riemann hypothesis are presented. Our integral equalities, together with the equalities given in the previous paper, include all earlier known criteria of this kind, viz. Wang, Volchkov and Balazard-Saias-Yor criteria, which are certain particular cases of the general approach proposed.
