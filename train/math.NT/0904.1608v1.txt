Assuming GRH, we present an algorithm which inputs a prime p and outputs the set of fundamental discriminants D<0 such that the reduction map modulo a prime above p from elliptic curves with CM by \order_{D} to supersingular elliptic curves in characteristic p. In the algorithm we first determine an explicit constant D_p so that |D|> D_p implies that the map is necessarily surjective and then we compute explicitly the cases |D|<D_p.
