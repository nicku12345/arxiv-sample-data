We prove that for a positive integer c and any given \varepsilon, 0<\varepsilon<1, the number N(c) of equations c=a+b, a<b, with positive coprime integers a and b, which satisfy the inequality c < R(c)^{\frac{\varepsilon}{1+\varepsilon}}R(a)^{\frac{1}{1+\varepsilon}}R(b)^{\frac{1}{1+\varepsilon}}, where R(n) is the radical of n, is for c\to\infty N(c)=(1-\varepsilon)\frac{\phi(c)}{2}+O\Bigl(\frac{\phi(c)}{2}\Bigr). An analogue for the abc-conjecture inequality c<R(abc)^{1+\varepsilon} (without a constant factor) will also be proved.
