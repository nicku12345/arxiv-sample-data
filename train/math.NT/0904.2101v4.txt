Sequence of positive integers \{x_n\}_{n\geq1} is called similar to \mathbb {N} respectively a given property A if for every n\geq1 the numbers x_n and n are in the same class of equivalence respectively A\enskip(x_n\sim n (prop \enskip A). If x_1=a(>1)\sim1 (prop\enskip A) and x_n>x_{n-1} with the condition that x_n is the nearest to x_{n-1} number such that x_n\sim n (prop \enskip A), then the sequence \{x_n\} is called minimal recursive with the first term a\enskip(\{x_n^{(a)}\}). We study two cases: A=A_1 is the value of exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing an integer and A=A_2 is the parity of the number of ones in the binary expansion of an integer. In the first case we prove that, for sufficiently large n, \enskip x_n^{(a)}=x_n^{(3)}; in the second case we prove that, for a>4 and sufficiently large n,\enskip x_n^{(a)}=x_n^{(4)}.
