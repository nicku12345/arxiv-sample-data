Let p(n) denote the partition function. In this article, we will show that congruences of the form  p(m^j\ell^kn+B)\equiv 0\mod m \text{for all} n\ge 0  exist for all primes m and \ell satisfying m\ge 13 and \ell\neq 2,3,m. Here the integer k depends on the Hecke eigenvalues of a certain invariant subspace of S_{m/2-1}(\Gamma_0(576),\chi_{12}) and can be explicitly computed. More generally, we will show that for each integer i>0 there exists an integer k such that for every non-negative integers j\ge i with a properly chosen B the congruence  p(m^j\ell^kn+B)\equiv 0\mod m^i  holds for all integers n not divisible by \ell.
