Let \Gamma be an irreducible lattice in \PSL_2(\RR)^d (d\in\NN) and z a point in the d-fold direct product of the upper half plane.   We study the discrete set of componentwise distances {\bf D}(\Gm,z)\subset \RR^d defined in (1). We prove asymptotic results on the number of \gm\in\Gm such that d(z,\gamma z is contained in strips expanding in some directions and also in expanding hypercubes. The results on the counting in expanding strips are new. The results on expanding hypercubes % improve the error terms improve the existing error terms (by Gorodnick and Nevo) and generalize the Selberg error term for d=1. We give an asymptotic formula for the number of lattice points \gamma z such that the hyperbolic distance in each of the factors satisfies d((\gamma z)_j, z_j)\le T. The error term, as T \to \infty generalizes the error term given by Selberg for d=1, also we describe how the counting function depends on z. We also prove asymptotic results when the distance satisfies A_j \le d((\gamma z)_j, z_j) < B_j, with fixed A_j < B_j in some factors, while in the remaining factors 0 \le d((\gamma z)_j, z_j) \le T is satisfied.
