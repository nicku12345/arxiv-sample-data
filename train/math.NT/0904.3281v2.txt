We construct a norm compatible system of Galois cohomology classes in the cyclotomic extension of the field of rationnals giving rise (conjecturally) to the degree four p-adic L-function of the symplectic group GSp(4). These classes are defined as cup products of torsion sections of the elliptic polylogarithm pro-sheaf. We rely on the norm compatibility of the elliptic polylogarithm and on some weight computations in the cohomology of Siegel threefolds.
