After Zagier proved that the traces of singular moduli j(z) are Fourier coefficients of a weakly holomorphic modular form, various properties of the traces of the singular values of modular functions mostly on the full modular group PSL_2(\mathbb{Z}) have been investigated such as their exact formulas, limiting distribution, duality, and congruences. The purpose of this paper is to generalize these arithmetic properties of traces of singular values of a weakly holomorphic modular function on the full modular group to those on a congruence subgroup \Gamma_0(N).
