Recently Ritter and Weiss introduced an equivariant "main conjecture" than generalizes and refines the Main Conjecture of Iwasawa theory. In this paper, we show that, for the prime 2 and a dihedral extension of order 8 over Q, this conjecture is equivalent to a congruence condition on the coefficients of a power series with 2-adic integral coefficients constructed using the 2-adic L-series associated to the extension. We then verify that this congruence condition holds for the first coefficients in a large number of examples.
