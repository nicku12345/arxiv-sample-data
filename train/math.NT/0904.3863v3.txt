Lazard showed in his seminal work "Groupes analytiques p-adiques" that for rational coefficients continuous group cohomology of p-adic Lie-groups is isomorphic to Lie-algebra cohomology. We refine this result in two directions: firstly we extend his isomorphism under certain conditions to integral coefficients and secondly, we show that for algebraic groups, his isomorphism can be realized by differentiating locally analytic cochains.
