We generalise works of Kobayashi to give a formulation of the Iwasawa main conjecture for modular forms at supersingular primes. In particular, we give analogous definitions of even and odd Coleman maps for normalised new forms of arbitrary weights and relate Pollack's p-adic L-functions to the even and odd Selmer groups. In addition, by generalising works of Pollack and Rubin on CM elliptic curves, we prove the "main conjecture" for CM modular forms.
