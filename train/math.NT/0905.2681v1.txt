Let p be a prime and a a quadratic non-residue \bmod p. Then the set of integral solutions of the diophantine equation x_0^2 - ax_1^2 -px_2^2 + apx_3^2=1 form a cocompact discrete subgroup \Gamma_{p,a}\subset SL(2,\mathbb{R}) and is commensurable with the group of units of an order in a quaternion algebra over \mathbb{Q}. The problem addressed in this paper is an estimate for the traces of a set of generators for \Gamma_{p,a}. Empirical results summarized in several tables show that the trace has significant and irregular fluctuations which is reminiscent of the behavior of the size of a generator for the solutions of Pell's equation. The geometry and arithmetic of the group of units of an order in a quaternion algebra play a key role in the development of the code for the purpose of this paper.
