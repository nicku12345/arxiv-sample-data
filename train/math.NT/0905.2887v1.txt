In the literature, the standard approach to finding bases of spaces of modular forms is via modular symbols and the homology of modular curves. By using the Eichler-Shimura isomorphism, a work by Wang shows how one can use a cohomological viewpoint to determine bases of spaces of cusp forms on \Gamma_0(N) of weight k \geq 2 and character \chi. It is interesting to look at the complexity of this alternative approach, and we do this for an explicit implementation of the algorithm suggested by Wang.
