Let S/R be a finite extension of discrete valuation rings of characteristic p>0, and suppose that the corresponding extension L/K of fields of fractions is separable and is H-Galois for some K-Hopf algebra H. Let D_{S/R} be the different of S/R. We show that if S/R is totally ramified and its degree n is a power of p, then any element \rho of L with v_L(\rho) congruent to -v_L(D_{S/R})-1 mod n generates L as an H-module. This criterion is best possible. These results generalise to the Hopf-Galois situation recent work of G. Elder for Galois extensions.
