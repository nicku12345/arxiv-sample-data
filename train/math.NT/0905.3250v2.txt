A generalised Weber function is given by \w_N(z) = \eta(z/N)/\eta(z), where \eta(z) is the Dedekind function and N is any integer; the original function corresponds to N=2. We classify the cases where some power \w_N^e evaluated at some quadratic integer generates the ring class field associated to an order of an imaginary quadratic field. We compare the heights of our invariants by giving a general formula for the degree of the modular equation relating \w_N(z) and j(z). Our ultimate goal is the use of these invariants in constructing reductions of elliptic curves over finite fields suitable for cryptographic use.
