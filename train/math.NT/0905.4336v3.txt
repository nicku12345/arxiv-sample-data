We introduce a new ideal {\mathfrak D} of the p-adic Galois group-ring associated to a real abelian field and a related ideal {\mathfrak J} for imaginary abelian fields. Both result from an equivariant, Kummer-type pairing applied to Stark units in a Z_p-tower of abelian fields and {\mathfrak J} is linked by explicit reciprocity to a third ideal {\mathfrak S} studied more generally in a previous work. This leads to a new and unifying framework for the Iwasawa Theory of such fields including a real analogue of Stickelberger's Theorem, links with certain Fitting ideals and \Lambda-torsion submodules, and a new exact sequence related to the Main Conjecture.
