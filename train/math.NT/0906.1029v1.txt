The {\em Liouville function} is defined by \gl(n):=(-1)^{\Omega(n)} where \Omega(n) is the number of prime divisors of n counting multiplicity. Let \z_m:=e^{2\pi i/m} be a primitive m--th root of unity. As a generalization of Liouville's function, we study the functions \gl_{m,k}(n):=\z_m^{k\Omega(n)}. Using properties of these functions, we give a weak equidistribution result for \Omega(n) among residue classes. More formally, we show that for any positive integer m, there exists an A>0 such that for all j=0,1,...,m-1, we have #\{n\leq x:\Omega(n)\equiv j (\bmod m)\}=\frac{x}{m}+O(\frac{x}{\log^A x}). Best possible error terms are also discussed. In particular, we show that for m>2 the error term is not o(x^\ga) for any \ga<1.
