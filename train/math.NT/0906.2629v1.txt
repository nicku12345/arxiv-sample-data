Let p be a prime number. In this paper we use an old technique of Ore, based on Newton polygons, to construct in an efficient way p-integral bases of number fields defined by a p-regular equation. To illustrate the potential applications of this construction, we show how this result yields a computation of a p-integral basis of an arbitrary quartic field in terms of a defining equation.
