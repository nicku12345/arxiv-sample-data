We introduce a geometric formalism for studying modular forms of half-integral weight and explore some of its basic properties. Geometric Hecke operators are constructed and some basic spaces of p-adic forms are introduced. The p-adic theory is greatly expanded in subsequent papers, making that part of this paper largely obsolete.
