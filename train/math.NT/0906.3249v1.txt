In this paper we define Banach spaces of overconvergent half-integral weight p-adic modular forms and Banach modules of families of overconvergent half-integral weight p-adic modular forms over admissible open subsets of weight space. Both spaces are equipped with a continuous Hecke action for which U_{p^2} is moreover compact. The modules of families of forms are used to construct an eigencurve parameterizing all finite-slope systems of eigenvalues of Hecke operators acting on these spaces. We also prove an analog of Coleman's theorem stating that overconvergent eigenforms of suitably low slope are classical.
