It is known that infinitely many number fields and function fields of any degree m have class number divisible by a given integer n. However, significantly less is known about the indivisibility of class numbers of such fields. While it's known that there exist infinitely many quadratic number fields with class number indivisible by a given prime, the fields are not constructed explicitly, and nothing appears to be known for higher degree extensions. In \cite{Pacelli-Rosen}, Pacelli and Rosen explicitly constructed an infinite class of function fields of any degree m, 3 \nmid m, over \F_q(T) with class number indivisible by 3, generalizing a result of Ichimura for quadratic extensions. Here we generalize that result, constructing, for an arbitrary prime \ell, and positive integer m > 1, infinitely many function fields of degree m over the rational function field, with class number indivisible by \ell.
