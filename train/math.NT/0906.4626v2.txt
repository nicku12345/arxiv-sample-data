Let q be a power of a prime number p. Let k=\mathbb{F}_{q}(t) be the rational function field with constant field \mathbb{F}_{q}. Let K=k(\alpha) be an Artin-Schreier extension of k. In this paper, we explicitly describe the ambiguous ideal classes and the genus field of K . Using these results we study the p-part of the ideal class group of the integral closure of \mathbb{F}_{q}[t] in K. And we also give an analogy of R\acute{e}dei-Reichardt's formulae for K.
