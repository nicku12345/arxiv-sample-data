Expansions in noninteger positive bases have been intensively investigated since the pioneering works of R\'enyi (1957) and Parry (1960). The discovery of surprising unique expansions in certain noninteger bases by Erd\H os, Horv\'ath and Jo\'o (1991) was followed by many studies aiming to clarify the topological and combinatorial nature of the sets of these bases. In the present work we extend some of these studies to more general, negative or complex bases.
