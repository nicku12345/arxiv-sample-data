An algebraic number field K defines a maximal torus T of the linear group G = GL_{n}. Let \chi be a character of the idele class group of K, satisfying suitable assumptions. The \chi-toroidal forms are the functions defined on G(\mathbf{Q}) Z(\mathbf{A}) \backslash G(\mathbf{A}) such that the Fourier coefficient corresponding to \chi with respect to the subgroup induced by T is zero. The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to certain conditions concerning some spaces of toroidal forms, constructed from Eisenstein series. Furthermore, we define a Hilbert space and a self-adjoint operator on this space, whose spectrum equals the set of zeroes of L(s, \chi) on the critical line.
