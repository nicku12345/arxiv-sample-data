We prove certain general forms of functional relations among Witten multiple zeta-functions in several variables (or zeta-functions of root systems). The structural background of those functional relations is given by the symmetry with respect to Weyl groups. From those relations we can deduce explicit expressions of values of Witten zeta-functions at positive even integers, which is written in terms of generalized Bernoulli numbers of root systems. Furthermore we introduce generating functions of those Bernoulli numbers of root systems, by which we can give an algorithm of calculating Bernoulli numbers of root systems.
