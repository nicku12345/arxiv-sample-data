In our previous work, we established the theory of multi-variable Witten zeta-functions, which are called the zeta-functions of root systems. We have already considered the cases of types A_2, A_3, B_2, B_3 and C_3. In this paper, we consider the case of G_2-type. We define certain analogues of Bernoulli polynomials of G_2-type and study the generating functions of them to determine the coefficients of Witten's volume formulas of G_2-type. Next we consider the meromorphic continuation of the zeta-function of G_2-type and determine its possible singularities. Finally, by using our previous method, we give explicit functional relations for them which include Witten's volume formulas.
