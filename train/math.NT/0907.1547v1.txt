In this paper we prove theorems related to the Ramanujan-type series for 1/\pi (type _3F_2) and to the Ramanujan-like series, discovered by the author, for 1/\pi^2 (type _5F_4). Our developments for the cases _3 F_2 and _5 F_4 connect with the theory of modular functions and with the theory of Calabi-Yau differential equations, respectively.
