Let \omega(n) denote the number of distinct prime factors of n. Then for any given K\geq 2, small \epsilon>0 and sufficiently large (only depending on K and \epsilon) x, there exist at least x^{1-\epsilon} integers n\in[x,(1+K^{-1})x] such that \omega(nj\pm a^hk)\geq(\log\log\log x)^{{1/3}-\epsilon} for all 2\leq a\leq K, 1\leq j,k\leq K and 0\leq h\leq K\log x.
