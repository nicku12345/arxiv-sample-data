In a previous paper, we proved that over a finite field k of sufficiently large cardinality, all curves of genus at most 3 over k can be modeled by a bivariate Laurent polynomial that is nondegenerate with respect to its Newton polytope. In this paper, we prove that there are exactly two curves of genus at most 3 over a finite field that are not nondegenerate, one over F_2 and one over F_3. Both of these curves have remarkable extremal properties concerning the number of rational points over various extension fields.
