During the last decade the Subspace Theorem found several quite unexpected applications, mainly in the Diophantine Analysis and in the Transcendence Theory. Among the great variety of spectacular results, I have chosen several which are technically simpler and which allow one to appreciate how miraculously does the Subspace Theorem emerge in numerous situations, implying beautiful solutions to difficult problems hardly anybody hoped to solve so easily. The three main topics discussed in this article are: the work of Adamczewski and Bugeaud on complexity of algebraic numbers; the work of Corvaja and Zannier on Diophantine equations with power sums; the work of Corvaja and Zannier on integral points on curves and surfaces, and the subsequent development due to Levin and Autissier. In particular, we give a complete proof of the beautiful theorem of Levin and Autissier: an affine surface with 4 (or more) properly intersecting ample divisors at infinity cannot have a Zariski dense set of integral points.
