In this paper we examine the subset of Farey fractions of order Q consisting of those fractions whose denominators are odd. In particular, we consider the frequencies of values of numerators of differences of consecutive elements in this set. After proving an asymptotic result for these frequencies, we use estimates coming from incomplete Kloosterman sums to generalize our result to subintervals of [0,1].
