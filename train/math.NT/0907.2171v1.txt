In this paper we generalize some of our results from, `A note on Farey fractions with odd denominators' to subsets of Farey fractions consisting of fractions with denominators not divisible by a given prime. We also investigate the joint distribution of numerators of differences of h-tuples of consecutive fractions in these sets.
