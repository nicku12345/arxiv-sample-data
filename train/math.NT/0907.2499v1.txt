We present seven theorems on the structure of prime order torsion points on CM elliptic curves defined over number fields. The first three results refine bounds of Silverberg and Prasad-Yogananda by taking into account the class number of the CM order and the splitting of the prime in the CM field. In many cases we can show that our refined bounds are optimal or asymptotically optimal. We also derive asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the least degree of a CM-point on X_1(N). Upon comparison to bounds for the least degree for which there exist infinitely many rational points on X_1(N), we deduce that, for sufficiently large N, X_1(N) will have a rational CM point of degree smaller than the degrees of at least all but finitely many non-CM points.
