We prove the functional equation for the twisted spinor L-series of a cuspidal, holomorphic Siegel eigenform for the full modular group of genus 2. It follows from a more general functional equation, valid for Rankin convolutions of paramodular cuspforms. A non-vanishing result for Fourier-Jacabi coefficients of the eigenforms in question is the central pillar of the deduction of the former from the latter functional equation.
