A local analogue of the Grothendieck Conjecture is an equivalence of the category of complete discrete valuation fields K with finite residue fields of characteristic p\ne 0 and the category of absolute Galois groups of fields K together with their ramification filtrations. The case of characteristic 0 fields K was considered by Mochizuki several years ago. Then the author proved it by different method if p>2 (but \operatorname{char}K=0 or p). This paper represents a modified approach: it covers the case p=2, contains considerable technical simplifications and replaces the Galois group of K by its maximal pro-p-quotient. Special attention is paid to the procedure of recovering field isomorphisms coming from isomorphisms of Galois groups, which are compatible with the corresponding ramification filtrations.
