In this paper, we investigate the 2-adic valuations of the Stirling numbers S(n, k) of the second kind. We show that v_2(S(4i, 5))=v_2(S(4i+3, 5)) if and only if i\not\equiv 7\pmod {32}. This confirms a conjecture of Amdeberhan, Manna and Moll raised in 2008. We show also that v_2(S(2^n+1, k+1))= s_2(n)-1 for any positive integer n, where s_2(n) is the sum of binary digits of n. It proves another conjecture of Amdeberhan, Manna and Moll.
