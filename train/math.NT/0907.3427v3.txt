We prove some cases of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture for even Galois representations. In particular, we prove, under mild hypotheses, that there are no irreducible two-dimensional ordinary even Galois representations of \Gal(\Qbar/\Q) with distinct Hodge-Tate weights. If K/\Q is an imaginary quadratic field, we also prove (again, under certain hypotheses) that \Gal(\Qbar/K) does not admit irreducible two-dimensional ordinary Galois representations of non-parallel weight. Finally, we prove that any weakly compatible family of two dimensional irreducible Galois representations of \Gal(\Qbar/\Q) is, up to twist, either modular or finite.
