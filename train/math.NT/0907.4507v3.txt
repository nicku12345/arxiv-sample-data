We introduce and study certain deformations of Drinfeld quasi-modular forms by using rigid analytic trivialisations of corresponding Anderson's t-motives. We show that a sub-algebra of these deformations has a natural graduation by the group Z^2 x Z/(q-1)Z and an homogeneous automorphism, and we deduce from this and other properties multiplicity estimates.
