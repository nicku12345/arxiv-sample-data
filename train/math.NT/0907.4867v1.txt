For Dirichlet series roughly of the type Z(s, w) = sum_d L(s, chi_d) d^{-w} the subconvexity bound Z(s, w) \ll (sw(s+w))^{1/6+\varepsilon} is proved on the critical lines \Re s = \Re w = 1/2. The convexity bound would replace 1/6 with 1/4. In addition, a mean square bound is proved that is consistent with the Lindel\"of hypothesis. An interesting specialization is s=1/2 in which case the above result give a subconvex bound for a Dirichlet series without an Euler product.
