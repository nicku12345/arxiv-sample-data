We deeply appreciate the papers of Ivi\'c on the links between the 2k-th moments of the Riemann zeta function and, say, d_k, the k-divisor function. More specifically, both the one bounding the 2k-th moment with a simple average of correlations of the d_k (Palanga 1996 Conference Proceedings) and the more recent (arXiv:0708.1601v2 to appear on JTNB), which bounds the Selberg integral of d_k applying the 2k-th moment of the zeta. Building on the former paper, we apply an elementary approach (based on arithmetic averages) in order to get information on the reverse link to the second work.
