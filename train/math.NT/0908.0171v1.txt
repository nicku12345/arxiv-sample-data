We consider a generalization of the Mahler measure of a multivariable polynomial P as the integral of \log^k|P| in the unit torus, as opposed to the classical definition with the integral of \log|P|. A zeta Mahler measure, involving the integral of |P|^s, is also considered. Specific examples are computed, yielding special values of zeta functions, Dirichlet L-functions, and polylogarithms.
