For smooth linear group schemes over \bbZ we give a cohomological interpretation of the local Tamagawa measures as cohomological periods. This is in the spirit of the Tamagawa measures for motives defined by Bloch and Kato. We show that in the case of tori the cohomological and the motivic Tamagawa measures coincide, which reproves the Bloch-Kato conjecture for motives associated to tori.
