Based on Furusawa's theory, we present an integral representation for the L-function L(s,\pi \times \tau), where \pi is a cuspidal automorphic representation on GSp(4) related to a holomorphic Siegel modular form, and where \tau is an arbitrary cuspidal automorphic representation on GL(2). As an application, a special value result for this L-function in the spirit of Deligne's conjecture is proved.
