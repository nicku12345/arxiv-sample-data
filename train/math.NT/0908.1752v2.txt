We construct infinitely ramified Galois representations \rho such that the a_l (\rho)'s have distributions in contrast to the statements of Sato-Tate, Lang-Trotter and others. Using similar methods we deform a residual Galois representation for number fields and obtain an infinitely ramified representation with very large image, generalising a result of Ramakrishna.
