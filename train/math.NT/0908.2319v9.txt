Let p be an odd prime, such that p_n<p/2<p_{n+1}, where p_n is the n-th prime. We study the following question: with what probability does there exist a prime in the interval (p, 2p_{n+1})? After the strong definition of the probability with help of the Ramanujan primes ([11], [12])and the introducing pseudo-Ramanujan primes, we show, that if such probability P exists, then P>=0.5. We also study a symmetrical case of the left intervals, which connected with sequence A080359 at OEIS.
