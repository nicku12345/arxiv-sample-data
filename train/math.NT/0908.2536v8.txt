In this paper, we prove that certain parametrized multiple series which generalize multiple zeta values satisfy the same relation as Ohno's relation for multiple zeta values. This is a parametrized generalization of Ohno's relation for multiple zeta values. By virtue of this generalization, we obtain a certain equivalence between the relation for the parametrized multiple series and its subfamily. As applications of the above results, we obtain some results for multiple zeta values.
