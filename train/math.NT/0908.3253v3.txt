In a recent work [JNT \textbf{129}, 2154 (2009)], Gun and co-workers have claimed that the number \,\log{\Gamma(x)} + \log{\Gamma(1-x)}\,, x being a rational number between 0 and 1, is transcendental with at most \emph{one} possible exception, but the proof presented there in that work is \emph{incorrect}. Here in this paper, I point out the mistake they committed and I present a theorem that establishes the transcendence of those numbers with at most \emph{two} possible exceptions. As a consequence, I make use of the reflection property of this function to establish a criteria for the transcendence of \,\log{\pi}, a number whose irrationality is not proved yet. This has an interesting consequence for the transcendence of the product \,\pi \cdot e, another number whose irrationality remains unproven.
