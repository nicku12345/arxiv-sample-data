Given a prime p, we consider the dynamical system generated by repeated exponentiations modulo p, that is, by the map u \mapsto f_g(u), where f_g(u) \equiv g^u \pmod p and 0 \le f_g(u) \le p-1. This map is in particular used in a number of constructions of cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators. We obtain nontrivial upper bounds on the number of fixed points and short cycles in the above dynamical system.
