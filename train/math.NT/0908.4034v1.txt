Is it possible to distinguish algebraic from transcendental real numbers by considering the b-ary expansion in some base b\ge2? In 1950, \'E. Borel suggested that the answer is no and that for any real irrational algebraic number x and for any base g\ge2, the g-ary expansion of x should satisfy some of the laws that are shared by almost all numbers. There is no explicitly known example of a triple (g,a,x), where g\ge3 is an integer, a a digit in \{0,...,g-1\} and x a real irrational algebraic number, for which one can claim that the digit a occurs infinitely often in the g-ary expansion of x. However, some progress has been made recently, thanks mainly to clever use of Schmidt's subspace theorem. We review some of these results.
