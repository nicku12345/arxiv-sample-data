Let <\P > \subset \N be a multiplicative subsemigroup of the natural numbers \N = \{1,2,3,...\} generated by an arbitrary set \P of primes (finite or infinite). We given an elementary proof that the partial sums \sum_{n \in < \P >: n \leq x} \frac{\mu(n)}{n} are bounded in magnitude by 1. With the aid of the prime number theorem, we also show that these sums converge to \prod_{p \in \P} (1 - \frac{1}{p}) (the case when \P is all the primes is a well-known observation of Landau). Interestingly, this convergence holds even in the presence of non-trivial zeroes and poles of the associated zeta function \zeta_\P(s) := \prod_{p \in \P} (1-\frac{1}{p^s})^{-1} on the line \{\Re(s)=1\}.   As equivalent forms of the first inequality, we have |\sum_{n \leq x: (n,P)=1} \frac{\mu(n)}{n}| \leq 1, |\sum_{n|N: n \leq x} \frac{\mu(n)}{n}| \leq 1, and |\sum_{n \leq x} \frac{\mu(mn)}{n}| \leq 1 for all m,x,N,P \geq 1.
