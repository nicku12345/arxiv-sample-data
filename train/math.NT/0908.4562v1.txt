This paper justifies an assertion in   (Elder, Proc AMS 137 (2009), no 4, 1193--1203) that Galois scaffolds make the questions of Galois module structure tractable. Let k be a perfect field of characteristic p and let K=k((T)). For the class of characteristic p elementary abelian p-extensions L/K with Galois scaffolds described in mentioned paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the valuation ring \mathfrak{O}_L to be free over its associated order \mathcal{A}_{L/K} in K[\Gal(L/K)]. Interestingly, this condition agrees with the condition found by Y. Miyata, concerning a class of cyclic Kummer extensions in characteristic zero.
