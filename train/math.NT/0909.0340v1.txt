Given an integral lattice \Lambda of rank n and a finite sequence m_1 \leq m_2 \leq ... \leq m_k of natural numbers we construct a modular form \Theta_{m_1,m_2,...,m_k,\Lambda} of level N=N(\Lambda). The weight of this modular form is nk/2+\sum_{i=1}^k m_k. This construction generalizes the theta series \Theta_\Lambda of integral lattices, because \Theta_\Lambda = \Theta_{0,\Lambda}. We give the q-expansions of the modular forms \Theta_{m,m,\Lambda}, and \Theta_{1,1,1,\Lambda} and show that (up to some scaling) they are given by power series with integer coefficients.
