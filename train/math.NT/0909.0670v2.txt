In this sequel to arXiv:0905.3327, we continue to study the congruence properties of the alternating version of multiple harmonic sums. As contrast to the study of multiple harmonic sums where Bernoulli numbers and Bernoulli polynomials play the key roles, in the alternating setting the Euler numbers and the Euler polynomials are also essential.
