Considering Ramanujan primes and the symmetric to them so-called Labos primes, we study their parallel properties, we study all primes with these properties (generalized Ramanujan and Labos primes) and construct two kinds of sieves for them. Finally, we give a further natural generalization of these constructions and pose some conjectures and open problems.
