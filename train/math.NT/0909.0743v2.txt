We introduce p-adic Kummer spaces of continuous functions on \mathbb{Z}_p that satisfy certain Kummer type congruences. We will classify these spaces and show their properties, for instance, ring properties and certain decompositions. As a result, these functions have always a fixed point, functions of certain subclasses have always a unique simple zero in \mathbb{Z}_p. The fixed points and the zeros are effectively computable by given algorithms. This theory can be transferred to values of Dirichlet L-functions at negative integer arguments. That leads to a conjecture about their structure supported by several computations. In particular we give an application to the classical Bernoulli and Euler numbers. Finally, we present a link to p-adic functions that are related to Fermat quotients.
