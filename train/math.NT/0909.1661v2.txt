For any elliptic curve E defined over the rationals with complex multiplication and for every prime p, we describe the image of the mod p Galois representation attached to E. We deduce information about the field of definition of torsion points of these curves, in particular we classify all cases where there are torsion points over Galois number fields not containing the field of definition of the CM.
