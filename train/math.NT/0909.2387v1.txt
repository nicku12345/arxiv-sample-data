In this paper we investigate the infinite convergent sum T=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{P(n)}{Q(n)}, where   P(x)\in\bar{\mathbb{Q}}[x], Q(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x] and Q(x) has only simple rational zeros. N. Saradha and R. Tijdeman have obtained sufficient and necessary conditions for the transcendence of T if the degree of Q(x) is 3. In this paper we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the transcendence of T if the degree of Q(x) is 4 and Q(x) is reduced.
