For the cyclic group G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} and any non-empty A\in\mathbb{Z}. We define the Davenport constant of G with weight A, denoted by D_A(n), to be the least natural number k such that for any sequence (x_1, ..., x_k) with x_i\in G, there exists a non-empty subsequence (x_{j_1}, ..., x_{j_l}) and a_1, ..., a_l\in A such that \sum_{i=1}^l a_ix_{j_i} = 0. Similarly, we define the constant E_A(n) to be the least t\in\mathbb{N} such that for all sequences (x_1, >..., x_t) with x_i \in G, there exist indices j_1, ..., j_n\in\mathbb{N}, 1\leq j_1 <... < j_n\leq t, and \vartheta_1, >..., \vartheta_n\in A with \sum^{n}_{i=1} \vartheta_ix_{j_i} = 0. In the present paper, we show that E_A(n)=D_A(n)+n-1. This solve the problem raised by Adhikari and Rath \cite{ar06}, Adhikari and Chen \cite{ac08}, Thangadurai \cite{th07} and Griffiths \cite{gr08}.
