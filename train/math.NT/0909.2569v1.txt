We compute the universal deformations of cuspidal representations \pi of \GL_2(F) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic l, where F is a local field of residue characteristic p not equal to l. When \pi is supercuspidal there is an irreducible, two-dimensional representation \rho of G_F that corresponds to \pi by the mod l local Langlands correspondence of Vign{\'e}ras; we show there is a natural isomorphism between the universal deformation rings of \pi and \rho that induces the usual local Langlands correspondence on characteristic zero points. Our work establishes certain cases of a conjecture of Emerton.
