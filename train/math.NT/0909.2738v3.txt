In this paper we give a short, elementary proof of the following too extreme cases of the Leopoldt conjecture: the case when \K/\Q is a solvable extension and the case when it is a totally real extension in which p splits completely. The first proof uses Baker theory, the second class field theory. The methods used here are a sharpening of the ones presented at the SANT meeting in G\"ottingen, 2008 and exposed in \cite{Mi2}, \cite{Mi1}.
