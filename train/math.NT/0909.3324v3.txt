Let 1<q<2 and \[ \Lambda(q)={\sum_{k=0}^n a_kq^k\mid a_k\in\{-1,0,1\}, n\ge1}. \] It is well known that if q is not a root of a polynomial with coefficients 0,\pm1, then \Lambda(q) is dense in \mathbb{R}. We give several sufficient conditions for the denseness of \Lambda(q) when q is a root of such a polynomial. In particular, we prove that if q is not a Perron number or it has a conjugate \alpha such that q|\alpha|<1, then \Lambda(q) is dense in \mathbb{R}.
