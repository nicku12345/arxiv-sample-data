Let us consider an abelian variety defined over \mathbb{Q_{\ell}} with good supersingular reduction. In this paper we give explicit conditions that ensure that the action of the wild inertia group on the \ell-torsion points of the variety is trivial. Furthermore we give a family of curves of genus 2 such that their Jacobian surfaces have good supersingular reduction and satisfy these conditions. We address this question by means of a detailed study of the formal group law attached to abelian varieties.
