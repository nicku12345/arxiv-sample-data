In this paper we obtain realizations of the 4-dimensional general symplectic group over a prime field of characteristic \ell>3 as the Galois group of a tamely ramified Galois extension of \mathbb{Q}. The strategy is to consider the Galois representation \rho_{\ell} attached to the Tate module at \ell of a suitable abelian surface. We need to choose the abelian varieties carefully in order to ensure that the image of \rho_{\ell} is large and simultaneously maintain a control on the ramification of the corresponding Galois extension. We obtain an explicit family of curves of genus 2 such that the Galois representation attached to the \ell-torsion points of their Jacobian varieties provide tame Galois realizations of the desired symplectic groups.
