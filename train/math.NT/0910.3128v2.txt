Let E be a separable quadratic extension of a locally compact field F of positive characteristic. Asai \gamma-factors are defined for smooth irreducible representations \pi of {\rm GL}_n(E). If \sigma is the Weil-Deligne representation of \mathcal{W}_E corresponding to \pi under the local Langlands correspondence, we show that the Asai \gamma-factor is the same as the Deligne-Langlands \gamma-factor of the Weil-Deligne representation of \mathcal{W}_F obtained from \sigma under tensor induction. This is achieved by proving that Asai \gamma-factors are characterized by their local properties together with their role in global functional equations for L-functions. As an immediate application, we establish the stability property of \gamma-factors under twists by highly ramified characters.
