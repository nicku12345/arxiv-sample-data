In this paper we investigate the metrical theory of Diophantine approximation associated with linear forms that are simultaneously small for infinitely many integer vectors; i.e. forms which are close to the origin. A complete Khintchine--Groshev type theorem is established, as well as its Hausdorff measure generalization. The latter implies the complete Hausdorff dimension theory.
