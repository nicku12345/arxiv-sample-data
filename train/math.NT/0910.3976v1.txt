We consider logarithmic vector- and matrix-valued modular forms of integral weight k associated with a p-dimensional representation \rho: SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \to GL_p(\mathbb{C}) of the modular group, subject only to the condition that \rho(T) has eigenvalues of absolute value 1. The main result is the construction of meromorphic matrix-valued Poincar\'e series associated to \rho for all large enough weights. The component functions are logarithmic q-series, i.e., finite sums of products of q-series and powers of \log q. We derive several consequences, in particular we show that the space \mathcal{H}(\rho)=\oplus_k \mathcal{H}(k, \rho) of all holomorphic logarithmic vector-valued modular forms associated to \rho is a free module of rank p over the ring of classical holomorphic modular forms on SL_2(\mathbb{Z}).
