In a recent work, Dancs and He found an Euler-type formula for \,\zeta{(2\,n+1)}, \,n\, being a positive integer, which contains a series they could not reduce to a finite closed-form. This open problem reveals a greater complexity in comparison to \zeta(2n), which is a rational multiple of \pi^{2n}. For the Dirichlet beta function, the things are `inverse': \beta(2n+1) is a rational multiple of \pi^{2n+1} and no closed-form expression is known for \beta(2n). Here in this work, I modify the Dancs-He approach in order to derive an Euler-type formula for \,\beta{(2n)}, including \,\beta{(2)} = G, the Catalan's constant. I also convert the resulting series into zeta series, which yields new exact closed-form expressions for a class of zeta series involving \,\beta{(2n)} and a finite number of odd zeta values. A closed-form expression for a certain zeta series is also conjectured.
