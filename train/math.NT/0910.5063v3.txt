In this paper, we prove some one level density results for low-lying zeros of families of L-functions. More specifically, the families under consideration are that of L-functions of holomorphic Hecke eigenforms of level 1 and weight k twisted with quadratic Dirichlet characters and that of cubic and quartic Dirichlet L-functions.
