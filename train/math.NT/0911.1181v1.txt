For any m\ge3, every integer of the form p_m(x)=\frac{(m-2)x^2-(m-4)x}2 with x \in \z is said to be a generalized m-gonal number. Let a\le b\le c be positive integers. For every non negative integer n, if there are integers x,y,z such that n=ap_k(x)+bp_k(y)+cp_k(z), then the quadruple (k;a,b,c) is said to be {\it universal}. Sun gave in \cite{s1} all possible quadruple candidates that are universal and proved some quadruples to be universal (see also \cite{gs}). He remains the following quadruples (5,1,1,k) for k=6,8,9,10, (5,1,2,8), and (5,1,3,s) for 7 \le s \le 8 as candidates and conjectured the universality of them. In this article we prove that the remaining 7 quadruples given above are, in fact, universal.
