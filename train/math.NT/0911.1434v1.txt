We give an instant evaluation of multiple Zeta function at non-positive integers by elementary methods and discuss the Fourier theory (on unit interval) of the product of Bernoulli polynomials.We also show that the polynomial expression for Hurwitz Zeta function(at non-positive integral values of the first variable) and the polynomial expression for Bernoulli polynomials are equivalent.
