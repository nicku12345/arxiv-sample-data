A. Renyi \cite{Renyi} made a definition that gives one generalization of simple normality in the context of Q-Cantor series. Similarly, in this paper we give a definition which generalizes the notion of normality in the context of Q-Cantor series. We will prove a theorem that allows us to concatenate sequences of digits that have a special property to give us the digits of a Q-normal number for certain Q. We will then use this theorem to construct a Q and a real number x that is Q-normal.
