In a recent work, Gun and co-workers have proposed that \,\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}{(n+\alpha)^{-k}}\, is a transcendental number for all integer \,k, k > 1, and \,\alpha \in \mathbb{Q} \backslash \mathbb{Z}. Here in this work, this proposition is shown to be \emph{false} whenever \,k\, is odd and \,\alpha\, is a half-integer. It is also shown that these are the only counterexamples, which allows for a correct reformulation of the original proposition. This leads to a theorem yielding a closed-form expression for the summation of that series, which determines its arithmetic nature. The result is then extended to a sum of polygamma functions and some related zeta series. In view of the recurrent appearance of these series and functions in different areas of mathematics and applications, the closed-form results put forward here could well be included in modern computer algebra systems (CAS).
