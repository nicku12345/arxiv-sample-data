We show several properties related to the structure of the family of classes of two-dimensional periodic continued fractions. This approach to the study of the family of classes of nonequivalent two dimexsional periodic continued fractions leads to the visualization of special subfamilies of continued fractions with torus triangulations (i.e. combinatorics of their fundamental domains) that possess explicit regularities.Several cases of such subfamilies are studied in detail; the method to construct other similar subfamilies is given.
