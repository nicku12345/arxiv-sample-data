The relations between the Bernoulli and Eulerian polynomials of higher order and the complete Bell polynomials are found that lead to new identities for the Bernoulli and Eulerian polynomials and numbers of higher order. General form of these identities is considered and generating function for polynomials satisfying this general identity is found.
