This paper studies integer solutions to the ABC equation A+B+C=0 in which none of A, B, C has a large prime factor. Set H(A,B, C)= max(|A|,|B|,|C|) and set the smoothness S(A, B, C) to be the largest prime factor of ABC. We consider primitive solutions (gcd(A, B, C)=1) having smoothness no larger than a fixed power p of log H. Assuming the abc Conjecture we show that there are finitely many solutions if p<1. We discuss a conditional result, showing that the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) implies there are infinitely many primitive solutions when p>8. We sketch some details of the proof of the latter result.
