A. R\'enyi \cite{Renyi} made a definition that gives a generalization of simple normality in the context of Q-Cantor series. In \cite{Mance}, a definition of Q-normality was given that generalizes the notion of normality in the context of Q-Cantor series. In this work, we examine both Q-normality and Q-distribution normality, treated in \cite{Laffer} and \cite{Salat}. Specifically, while the non-equivalence of these two notions is implicit in \cite{Laffer}, in this paper, we give an explicit construction witnessing the nontrivial direction. That is, we construct a base Q as well as a real x that is Q-normal yet not Q-distribution normal. We next approach the topic of simultaneous normality by constructing an explicit example of a base Q as well as a real x that is both Q-normal and Q-distribution normal.
