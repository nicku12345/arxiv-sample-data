We prove that the number of "hole elements" H(K) in the infrastructure of a hyperelliptic function field K of genus g with finite constant field \F_q with n + 1 places at infinity, of whom n' + 1 are of degree one, satisfies   |\frac{H(K)}{\abs{\Pic^0(K)}} - \frac{n'}{q}| = O(16^g n q^{-3/2}). We obtain an explicit formula for the number of holes using only information on the infinite places and the coefficients of the L-polynomial of the hyperelliptic function field. This proves a special case of a conjecture by E. Landquist and the author on the number of holes of an infrastructure of a global function field.   Moreover, we investigate the size of a hole in case n = n', and show that asymptotically for n \to \infty, the size of a hole next to a reduced divisor D behaves like the function \frac{n^{g - \deg D}}{(g - \deg D)!}.
