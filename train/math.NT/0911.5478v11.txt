For earlier considered our sequence A166944 in [4] we prove three statements of its connection with twin primes. We also give a sufficient condition for the infinity of twin primes and pose several new conjectures; among them we propose a very simple conjectural algorithm of constructing a pair (p,\enskip p+2) of twin primes over arbitrary given integer m\geq4 such that p+2\geq m.
