We study the nonclassical Hopf-Galois module structure of rings of algebraic integers in some extensions of  p -adic fields and number fields which are at most tamely ramified. We show that if  L/K  is an unramified extension of  p -adic fields which is  H -Galois for some Hopf algebra  H  then  \OL  is free over its associated order  \AH  in  H . If  H  is commutative, we show that this conclusion remains valid in ramified extensions of  p -adic fields if  p  does not divide the degree of the extension. By combining these results we prove a generalisation of Noether's theorem to nonclassical Hopf-Galois structures on domestic extensions of number fields.
