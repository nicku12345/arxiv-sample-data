Studying ceratin combinatorial properties of non-unique factorizations have been a subject of recent literatures. Little is known about two combinatorial invariants, namely the catenary degree and the tame degree, even in the case of numerical monoids. In this paper we compute these invariants for a certain class of numerical monoids generated by generalized arithmetic sequences. We also show that the difference between the tame degree and the catenary degree can be arbitrary large even if the number of minimal generators is fixed.
