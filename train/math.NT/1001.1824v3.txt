Various properties of the Mellin transform function  {\cal M}_k(s) := \int_1^\infty Z^k(x)x^{-s}dx  are investigated, where  Z(t) := \zeta(1/2+it){\bigl(\chi(1/2+it)\bigr)}^{-1/2}, \quad \zeta(s) = \chi(s)\zeta(1-s)  is Hardy's function and \zeta(s) is Riemann's zeta-function. Connections with power moments of |\zeta(1/2+it)| are established, and natural boundaries of {\cal M}_k(s) are discussed.
