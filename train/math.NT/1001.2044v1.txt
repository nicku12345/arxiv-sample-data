We prove a companion forms theorem for ordinary n-dimensional automorphic Galois representations, by use of automorphy lifting theorems developed by the second author, and a technique for deducing companion forms theorems due to the first author. We deduce results about the possible Serre weights of mod l Galois representations corresponding to automorphic representations on unitary groups. We then use functoriality to prove similar results for automorphic representations of GSp4 over totally real fields.
