Consider an irreducible, admissible representation \pi of GL(2,F) whose restriction to GL(2,F)^+ breaks up as a sum of two irreducible representations \pi_+ + \pi_-. If \pi=r_{\theta}, the Weil representation of GL(2,F) attached to a character \theta of K^* which does not factor through the norm map from K to F, then \chi\in \hat{K^*} with (\chi >. \theta ^{-1})|_{F^{*}}=\omega_{{K/F}} occurs in {r_{\theta}}_+ if and only if \epsilon(\theta\chi^{-1},\psi_0)=\epsilon(\bar \theta\chi^{-1},\psi_0)=1 and in {r_{\theta}}_- if and only if both the epsilon factors are -1. But given a conductor n, can we say precisely how many such \chi will appear in \pi? We calculate the number of such characters at each given conductor n in this work.
