Using three basic facts concerning Hurwitz zeta function,we give new natural proofs of the known results on Bernoulli polynomials,gamma function and also obtain Gauss' expression for Psi function at a rational point,all in a unified fashion.We also give a new proof of the relation between log gamma and derivative of the Hurwitz zeta function,including that of Stirling's expression for log gamma.
