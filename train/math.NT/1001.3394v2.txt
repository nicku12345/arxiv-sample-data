We adapt the CRT approach for computing Hilbert class polynomials to handle a wide range of class invariants. For suitable discriminants D, this improves its performance by a large constant factor, more than 200 in the most favourable circumstances. This has enabled record-breaking constructions of elliptic curves via the CM method, including examples with |D|>10^15.
