An arithmetic function f is called a sieve function of range Q, if it is the convolution product of the constantly 1 function and g such that g(q)\ll_{\varepsilon} q^{\varepsilon}, \forall\varepsilon>0, for q\leq Q, and g(q)=0 for q>Q. Here we establish a new result on the autocorrelation of f by using a famous theorem on bilinear forms of Kloosterman fractions by Duke, Friedlander and Iwaniec. In particular, for such correlations we obtain non-trivial asymptotic formul\ae\ that are actually unreachable by the standard approach of the distribution of f in the arithmetic progressions. Moreover, we apply our asymptotic formul\ae\ to obtain new bounds for the so-called Selberg integral and symmetry integral of f, which are basic tools for the study of the distribution of f in short intervals.
