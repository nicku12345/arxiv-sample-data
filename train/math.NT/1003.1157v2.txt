We present here simple trace formulas for Hecke operators T_k(p) for all p>3 on S_k(\Gamma_0(3)) and S_k(\Gamma_0(9)), the spaces of cusp forms of weight k and levels 3 and 9. These formulas can be expressed in terms of special values of Gaussian hypergeometric series and lend themselves to simple recursive expressions in terms of traces of Hecke operators on spaces of lower weight. Along the way, we show how to express the traces of Frobenius of a family of elliptic curves with 3-torsion as special values of a Gaussian hypergeometric series over \mathbb{F}_q, when q\equiv 1 \pmod{3}. We also use these formulas to provide a simple expression for the Fourier coefficients of \eta(3z)^8, the unique normalized cusp form of weight 4 and level 9, and then show that the number of points on a certain threefold is expressible in terms of these coefficients.
