In this paper, we give a new proof and an extension of the following result of B\'ezivin. Let f:\B{N}\to K be a multiplicative function taking values in a field K of characteristic 0 and write F(z)=\sum_{n\geq 1} f(n)z^n\in K[[z]] for its generating series. Suppose that F(z) is algebraic over K(z). Then either there is a natural number k and a periodic multiplicative function \chi(n) such that f(n)=n^k \chi(n) for all n, or f(n) is eventually zero. In particular, F(z) is either transcendental or rational. For K=\B{C}, we also prove that if F(z) is a D-finite generating series of a multiplicative function, then F(z) is either transcendental or rational.
