In this paper we fully describe the cuspidal and the Eisenstein cohomology of the group G=GL_2 over a definite quaternion algebra D/\Q. Functoriality is used to show the existence of residual and cuspidal automorphic forms, having cohomology in degree 1. The latter ones turn out to be CAP-representations, though G satisfies Strong Multiplicity One. A non-vanishing result on intertwining operators of induced representations will serve as a starting point for further investigations concerning rationality of critical L-values.
