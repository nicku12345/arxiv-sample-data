The authors have conjectured (\cite{KoM}) that if a normalized generalized modular function (GMF) f, defined on a congruence subgroup \Gamma, has integral Fourier coefficients, then f is classical in the sense that some power f^m is a modular function on \Gamma. A strengthened form of this conjecture was proved (loc cit) in case the divisor of f is \emph{empty}. In the present paper we study the canonical decomposition of a normalized parabolic GMF f = f_1f_0 into a product of normalized parabolic GMFs f_1, f_0 such that f_1 has \emph{unitary character} and f_0 has \emph{empty divisor}. We show that the strengthened form of the conjecture holds if the first "few" Fourier coefficients of f_1 are algebraic. We deduce proofs of several new cases of the conjecture, in particular if either f_0=1 or if the divisor of f is concentrated at the cusps of \Gamma.
