For a finite vector space V and a non-negative integer r\le\dim V we estimate the smallest possible size of a subset of V, containing a translate of every r-dimensional subspace. In particular, we show that if K\subset V is the smallest subset with this property, n denotes the dimension of V, and q is the size of the underlying field, then for r bounded and r<n\le rq^{r-1} we have |V\setminus K|=\Theta(nq^{n-r+1}). This improves previously known bounds |V\setminus K|=\Omega(q^{n-r+1}) and |V\setminus K|=O(n^2q^{n-r+1}).
