In this paper, we derive eight basic identities of symmetry in three variables related to generalized Euler polynomials and alternating generalized power sums. All of these are new, since there have been results only about identities of symmetry in two variables. The derivations of identities are based on the p-adic fermionic integral expression of the generating function for the generalized Euler polynomials and the quotient of integrals that can be expressed as the exponential generating function for the alternating generalized power sums.
