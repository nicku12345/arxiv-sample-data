We present here a formula for expressing the trace of the Frobenius endomorphism of an elliptic curve E over \mathbb{F}_q satisfying j(E)\neq 0,1728 and q\equiv 1 \pmod{12} in terms of special values of Gaussian hypergeometric series. This paper uses methods introduced in Fuselier's work for one parameter families of curves to express the trace of Frobenius of E as a function of its j-invariant and discriminant instead of a parameter, which are more intrinsic characteristics of the curve.
