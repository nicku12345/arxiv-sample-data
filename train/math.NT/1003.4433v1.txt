Recently, Garthwaite-Penniston have shown that the coefficients of Ramanujan's mock theta function \omega satisfy infinitely many congruences of Ramanujan-type. In this work we give the first explicit examples of congruences for Ramanujan's mock theta function \omega and another mock theta function \mathcal{C}.
