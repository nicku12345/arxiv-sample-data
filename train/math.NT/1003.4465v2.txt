In this paper, we consider the question of correcting mock modular forms in order to obtain p-adic modular forms. In certain cases we show that a mock modular form M^+ is a p-adic modular form. Furthermore, we prove that otherwise the unique correction of M^+ is intimately related to the shadow of M^+.
