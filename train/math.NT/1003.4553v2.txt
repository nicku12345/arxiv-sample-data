We study the \lq \lq symmetry integral\rq \rq, \thinspace say I_f, of some arithmetic functions f:\N \rightarrow \R; we obtain from lower bounds of I_f (for a large class of arithmetic functions f) lower bounds for the \lq \lq Selberg integral\rq \rq \thinspace of f, say J_f (both these integrals give informations about f in almost all the short intervals [x-h,x+h], when N\le x\le 2N). In particular, when \thinspace f=d_k, the divisor function (having Dirichlet series \thinspace \zeta^k, with \thinspace \zeta \thinspace the Riemann zeta function), where k\ge 3 is integer, we give lower bounds for the Selberg integrals, say \thinspace J_k=J_{d_k}, of the \thinspace d_k. We apply elementary methods (Cauchy inequality to get Large Sieve type bounds) in order to give I_f lower bounds.
