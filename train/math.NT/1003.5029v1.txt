In this paper, we prove the non-existence of certain semistable Galois representations of a number field. Our consequence can be applied to some geometric problems. For example, we prove a special case of a Conjecture of Rasmussen and Tamagawa, related with the finiteness of the set of isomorphism classes of abelian varieties with constrained prime power torsion.
