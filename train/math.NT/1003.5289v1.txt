Consider elliptic curves  E:\ y^{2} = x^{3} + D^{3}  defined over the quadratic field \ \Q(\sqrt{-3}) . Hecke  L-series attached to  E  are studied, formulae for their values at  s=1,  and bound of 3-adic valuations of these values are given. These results are complementary to those in [Q] and [QZ], and are consistent with the predictions of the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer.
