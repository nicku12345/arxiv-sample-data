As early as the 1930s, P\'al Erd\H{o}s conjectured that: {\em for any multiplicative function f:\mathbb{N}\to\{-1,1\}, the partial sums \sum_{n\leq x}f(n) are unbounded.} Considering this conjecture, in this paper we consider multiplicative functions f satisfying \sum_{p\leq x}f(p)=c\cdot\frac{x}{\log x}(1+o(1)). We prove that if c>0 then the partial sums of f are unbounded, and if c<0 then the partial sums of \mu f are unbounded. Extensions of this result are also discussed.
