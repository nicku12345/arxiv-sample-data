We present improvements to the index-calculus algorithm for the computation of the ideal class group and regulator of a real quadratic field. Our improvements consist of applying the double large prime strategy, an improved structured Gaussian elimination strategy, and the use of Bernstein's batch smoothness algorithm. We achieve a significant speed-up and are able to compute the ideal class group structure and the regulator corresponding to a number field with a 110-decimal digit discriminant.
