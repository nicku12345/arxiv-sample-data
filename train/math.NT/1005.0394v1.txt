We study the Selmer group of an elliptic curve over an admissible p-adic Lie extension of a number field F . We give a formula for the Akashi series attached to this module, in terms of the corresponding objects for the cyclotomic Zp-extension and certain correction terms. This extends our earlier work [arXiv:math/0404431], in particular since it applies to elliptic curves having split multiplicative reduction at some primes above p, in which case the Akashi series can have additional zeros.
