Given a subset of the integers of zero density, we define the weaker notion of fractional density of such a set. It is shown how this notion corresponds to that of the Hausdorff dimension of a compact subset of the reals. We then show that a version of a theorem of {\L}aba and Pramanik on 3-term arithmetic progressions in subsets of the unit interval also holds for subsets of the integers with fractional density and satisfying certain Fourier-decay conditions.
