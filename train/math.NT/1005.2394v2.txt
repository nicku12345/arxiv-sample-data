In this paper, we study dimensions of some varieties, that were introduced recently by Kisin in order to prove modularity of some Galois representations. In fact, we mainly consider a special case for which we obtain an estimation of the dimension we are interested in. Then, based on this result, we state a conjecture for the general case.
