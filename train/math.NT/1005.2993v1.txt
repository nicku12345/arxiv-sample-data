We give two congruence properties of Hermitian modular forms of degree 2 over \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1}) and \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3}). The one is a congruence criterion for Hermitian modular forms which is generalization of Sturm's theorem. Another is the well-definedness of the p-adic weight for Hermitian modular forms.
