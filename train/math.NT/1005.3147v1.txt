Let K be a finite extension of \mathbb{Q}_p, and choose a uniformizer \pi\in K, and put K_\infty:=K(\sqrt[p^\infty]{\pi}). We introduce a new technique using restriction to \Gal(\ol K/K_\infty) to study flat deformation rings. We show the existence of deformation rings for \Gal(\ol K/K_\infty)-representations ``of height \leqslant h'' for any positive integer h, and we use them to give a variant of Kisin's proof of connected component analysis of a certain flat deformation rings, which was used to prove Kisin's modularity lifting theorem for potentially Barsotti-Tate representations. Our proof does not use the classification of finite flat group schemes, so it avoids Zink's theory of windows and displays when p=2.   This \Gal(\ol K/K_\infty)-deformation theory has a good analogue in positive characteristics analogue of crystalline representations in the sense of Genestier-Lafforgue. In particular, we obtain a positive characteristic analogue of crystalline deformation rings, and can analyze their local structure.
