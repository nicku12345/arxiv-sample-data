Let E be an elliptic curve over \F_p without complex multiplication, and for each prime p of good reduction, let n_E(p) = | E(\F_p) |. Let Q_{E,b}(x) be the number of primes p \leq x such that b^{n_E(p)} \equiv b\,({\rm mod}\,n_E(p)), and \pi_{E, b}^{\rm pseu}(x) be the number of {\it compositive} n_E(p) such that b^{n_E(p)} \equiv b\,({\rm mod}\,n_E(p)) (also called elliptic curve pseudoprimes). Motivated by cryptography applications, we address in this paper the problem of finding upper bounds for Q_{E,b}(x) and \pi_{E, b}^{\rm pseu}(x), generalising some of the literature for the classical pseudoprimes \cite{Erdos56, Pomerance81} to this new setting.
