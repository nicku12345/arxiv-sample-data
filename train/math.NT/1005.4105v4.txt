In this paper we study the compatible family of degree-4 Scholl representations \rho_{\ell} associated with a space S of weight \kappa> 2 noncongruence cusp forms satisfying Quaternion Multiplications over a biquadratic field K. It is shown that when either K is totally real or \kappa is odd, \rho_\ell is automorphic, that is, its associated L-function has the same Euler factors as the L-function of an automorphic form for GL_4(\mathbb Q). Further, it yields a relation between the Fourier coefficients of noncongruence cusp forms in S and those of certain automorphic forms via the three-term Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer congruences.
