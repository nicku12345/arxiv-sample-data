Noncommutative Iwasawa theory has created a lot of interest in Whitehead groups of Iwasawa algebras of compact p-adic Lie groups with a quotient isomorphic to the additive group of p-adic integers. In this paper we compute Whitehead groups of Iwasawa algebra of a pro-p compact p-adic Lie group of dimension one. We also give results on Whitehead groups of the localisation of such Iwasawa algebras at the canonical Ore set defined by Coates, Fukaya, Kato, Sujatha and Venjakob.
