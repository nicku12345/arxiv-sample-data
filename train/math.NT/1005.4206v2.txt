Let E be an elliptic curve over Q with complex multiplication. The aim of the present paper is to strengthen the theoretical and numerical results of \cite{CZS}. For each prime p, let t_{E/Q, p} denote the Z_p-corank of the p-primary subgroup of the Tate-Shafarevich group of E/Q. For each \epsilon   0, we prove that t_{E/Q, p} is bounded above by (1/2+\epsilon)p for all sufficiently large good ordinary primes p. We also do numerical calculations on one such E of rank 3, and 5 such E of rank 2, showing in all cases that t_{E/Q, p} = 0 for all good ordinary primes p < 30,000. In fact, we show that, with the possible exception of one good ordinary prime in this range for just one of the curves of rank 2, the p-primary subgroup of the Tate-Shafarevich group of the curve is zero (always supposing p is a good ordinary prime).
