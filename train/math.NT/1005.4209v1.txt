We consider a mod 7 Galois representation attached to a genus 2 Siegel cuspforms of level 1 and weight 28 and using some of its Fourier coefficients and eigenvalues computed by N. Skoruppa and the classification of maximal subgroups of PGSp(4,p) we show that its image is as large as possible. This gives a realization of PGSp(4,7) as a Galois group over \Q and the corresponding number field provides a non-solvable extension of \Q which ramifies only at 7.
