Let A be a finite nonempty set of integers. An asymptotic estimate of several dilates sum size was obtained by Bukh. The unique known exact bound concerns the sum |A+k\cdot A|, where k is a prime and |A| is large. In its full generality, this bound is due to Cilleruelo, Serra and the first author.   Let k be an odd prime and assume that |A|>8k^{k}. A corollary to our main result states that |2\cdot A+k\cdot A|\ge (k+2)|A|-k^2-k+2. Notice that |2\cdot P+k\cdot P|=(k+2)|P|-2k, if P is an arithmetic progression.
