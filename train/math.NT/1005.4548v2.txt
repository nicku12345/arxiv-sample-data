Let \mathcal{K}(a) denote the Kloosterman sum on the finite field of order 2^n. We give a simple characterization of \mathcal{K}(a) modulo 16, in terms of the trace of a and one other function. We also give a characterization of \mathcal{K}(a) modulo 64 in terms of a different function, which we call the lifted trace. Our proofs use Fourier analysis, Stickelberger's theorem and the Gross-Koblitz formula.
