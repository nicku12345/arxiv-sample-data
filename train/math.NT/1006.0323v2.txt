This paper is a continuation of our recent papers with the same title, arXiv:0806.1596v1 [math.NT], arXiv:0904.1277v1 where a number of integral equalities involving integrals of the logarithm of the Riemann zeta-function were introduced and it was shown that some of them are equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. A few new equalities of this type, which this time involve exponential functions, are established, and for the first time we have found equalities involving the integrals of the logarithm of the Riemann zeta-function taken exclusively along the real axis. Some of the equalities we have found are tested numerically. In particular, an integral equality involving the logarithm of abs(zeta(1/2+it)) and a weight function cosh(pi*t)^(-1) is shown numerically to be correct up to the 80 digits. For exponential weight function exp(-at), the possible contribution of the Riemann function zeroes non-lying on the critical line is rigorously estimated and shown to be extremely small, in particular, smaller than trillion of digits, 10^(-10^(13)), for a=4*pi.
