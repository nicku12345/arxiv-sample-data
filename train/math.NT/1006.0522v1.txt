A ternary inclusion-exclusion polynomial is a polynomial of the form \[ Q_{{p,q,r}}=\frac{(z^{pqr}-1)(z^p-1)(z^q-1)(z^r-1)} {(z^{pq}-1)(z^{qr}-1)(z^{rp}-1)(z-1)}, \] where p, q, and r are integers \ge3 and relatively prime in pairs. This class of polynomials contains, as its principle subclass, the ternary cyclotomic polynomials corresponding to restricting p, q, and r to be distinct odd prime numbers. Our object here is to continue the investigation of the relationship between the coefficients of Q_{{p,q,r}} and Q_{{p,q,s}}, with r\equiv s\pmod{pq}. More specifically, we consider the case where 1\le s<\max(p,q)<r, and obtain a recursive estimate for the function A(p,q,r)--the function that gives the maximum of the absolute values of the coefficients of Q_{{p,q,r}}. A simple corollary of our main result is the following absolute estimate. If s\ge1 and r\equiv\pm s\pmod{pq}, then A(p,q,r)\le s.
