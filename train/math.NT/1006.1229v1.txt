We give a kind of \lq \lq approximate majorant principle\rq \rq \thinspace result for the \lq \lq modified Selberg integral\rq \rq, say \modSel_f(N,h), of essentially bounded f:\N \rightarrow \R (i.e., bounded by arbitrary small powers); i.e., we get an upper bound, in terms of the modified Selberg integral of a related function F (with |f\ast \mu|\ll F\ast \mu, in the supports intersection), getting a \lq \lq square-root cancellation\rq \rq \thinspace for the error-terms. Here \modSel_f(N,h) is the mean-square (in N<x\le 2N) of the \lq \lq averaged short sum\rq \rq \thinspace of, say, f:=g\ast \1, minus its expected value; i.e., {1\over h}\sum_{m\le h}\sum_{0\le |n-x|<m}f(n)-M_f(x,h), with expected value M_f(x,h) (say, \approx h\sum_{d\le x}g(d)/d); so, this mean-square weights, on average, the f-values in (almost all, i.e. all, but o(N) possible exceptions) the short intervals [x-h,x+h], with mild restrictions on \thinspace h \thinspace (say, \thinspace h\to \infty \thinspace and \thinspace h=o(N), when \thinspace N\to \infty).
