We find some modularity criterion for a product of Klein forms of the congruence subgroup \Gamma_1(N) and, as its application, construct a basis of the space of modular forms for \Gamma_1(13) of weight 2. In the process we face with an interesting property about the coefficients of certain theta function from a quadratic form and prove it conditionally by applying Hecke operators.
