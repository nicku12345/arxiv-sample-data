In the 1980s B\"ocherer formulated a conjecture relating the central value of the quadratic twists of the spinor L-function attached to a Siegel modular form F to the coefficients of F . He proved the conjecture when F is a Saito-Kurokawa lift. Later Kohnen and Kuss gave numerical evidence for the conjecture in the case when F is a rational eigenform that is not a Saito-Kurokawa lift. In this paper we develop a conjecture relating the central value of the quadratic twists of the spinor L-function attached to a paramodular form and the coefficients of the form. We prove the conjecture in the case when the form is a Gritsenko lift and provide numerical evidence when it is not a lift.
