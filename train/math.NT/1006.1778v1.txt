The strong recurrence is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. On the other hand, the generalized strong recurrence holds for any irrational number. In this paper, we show the generalized strong recurrence for all non-zero rational numbers. Moreover, we prove that the generalized strong recurrence in the region of absolute convergence holds for any real number.
