We discuss the relation between crystalline Dieudonne theory and Dieudonne displays, with special emphasis on the case p=2. The theory of Dieudonne displays is extended to this case without restriction, which implies that the classification of finite flat group schemes by Breuil-Kisin modules holds for p=2 as well.
