We consider certain double series of Eisenstein type involving hyperbolic-sine functions. We define certain generalized Hurwitz numbers, in terms of which we evaluate those double series. Our main results can be regarded as a certain generalization of well-known results of Hurwitz, Herglotz, Katayama and so on. Our results also include recent formulas of the third-named author which are double analogues of the formulas of Cauchy, Mellin, Ramanujan, Berndt and so on, about certain Dirichlet series involving hyperbolic functions. As an application, we give some evaluation formulas for q-zeta functions at positive integers.
