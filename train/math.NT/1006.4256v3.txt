Let q be a positive integer, \chi a nontrivial character mod q, \mathcal{I} an interval of length not exceeding q. In this paper we shall study the character sum analogue of the well-known Kloosterman sum,\[\sum_{\substack{a\in\mathcal{I}   \gcd(a,q)=1}}\chi(ma+n\overline{a}),\] where \overline{a} is the multiplicative inverse of a\bmod q. The mean square values and bilinear forms for such sums are proved.
