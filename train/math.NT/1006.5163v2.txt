This paper is a sequel to our earlier paper "Wach modules and Iwasawa theory for modular forms" (arXiv: 0912.1263), where we defined a family of Coleman maps for a crystalline representation of the Galois group of Qp with nonnegative Hodge-Tate weights. In this paper, we study these Coleman maps using Perrin-Riou's p-adic regulator L_V. Denote by H(\Gamma) the algebra of Qp-valued distributions on \Gamma = Gal(Qp(\mu (p^\infty) / Qp). Our first result determines the H(\Gamma)-elementary divisors of the quotient of D_{cris}(V) \otimes H(\Gamma) by the H(\Gamma)-submodule generated by (\phi * N(V))^{\psi = 0}, where N(V) is the Wach module of V. By comparing the determinant of this map with that of L_V (which can be computed via Perrin-Riou's explicit reciprocity law), we obtain a precise description of the images of the Coleman maps. In the case when V arises from a modular form, we get some stronger results about the integral Coleman maps, and we can remove many technical assumptions that were required in our previous work in order to reformulate Kato's main conjecture in terms of cotorsion Selmer groups and bounded p-adic L-functions.
