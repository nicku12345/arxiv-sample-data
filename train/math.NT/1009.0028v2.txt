This paper studies the Fourier expansion of Hecke-Maass eigenforms for GL(2, \mathbb Q) of arbitrary weight, level, and character at various cusps. Translating well known results in the theory of adelic automorphic representations into classical language, a multiplicative expression for the Fourier coefficients at any cusp is derived. In general, this expression involves Fourier coefficients at several different cusps. A sufficient condition for the existence of multiplicative relations among Fourier coefficients at a single cusp is given. It is shown that if the level is 4 times (or in some cases 8 times) an odd squarefree number then there are multiplicative relations at every cusp. We also show that a local representation of GL(2, \mathbb Q_p) which is isomorphic to a local factor of a global cuspidal automorphic representation generated by the adelic lift of a newform of arbitrary weight, level N, and character \chi\pmod{N} cannot be supercuspidal if \chi is primitive. Furthermore, it is supercuspidal if and only if at every cusp (of width m and cusp parameter = 0) the mp^\ell Fourier coefficient, at that cusp, vanishes for all sufficiently large positive integers \ell. In the last part of this paper a three term identity involving the Fourier expansion at three different cusps is derived.
