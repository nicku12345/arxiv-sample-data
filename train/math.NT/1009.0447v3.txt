We give an affirmative answer to the following question by Jarden and Narkiewicz: Is it true that every number field has a finite extension L such that the ring of integers of L is generated by its units (as a ring)? As a part of the proof, we generalize a theorem by Hinz on power-free values of polynomials in number fields.
