We consider digital expansions to the base of \tau, where \tau is an algebraic integer. For a w \geq 2, the set of admissible digits consists of 0 and one representative of every residue class modulo \tau^w which is not divisible by \tau. The resulting redundancy is avoided by imposing the width w-NAF condition, i.e., in an expansion every block of w consecutive digits contains at most one non-zero digit. Such constructs can be efficiently used in elliptic curve cryptography in conjunction with Koblitz curves.   The present work deals with analysing the number of occurrences of a fixed non-zero digit. In the general setting, we study all w-NAFs of given length of the expansion. We give an explicit expression for the expectation and the variance of the occurrence of such a digit in all expansions. Further a central limit theorem is proved.   In the case of an imaginary quadratic \tau and the digit set of minimal norm representatives, the analysis is much more refined: We give an asymptotic formula for the number of occurrence of a digit in the w-NAFs of all elements of \Z[\tau] in some region (e.g. a disc). The main term coincides with the full block length analysis, but a periodic fluctuation in the second order term is also exhibited. The proof follows Delange's method.   We also show that in the case of imaginary quadratic \tau and w \geq 2, the digit set of minimal norm representatives leads to w-NAFs for \emph{all} elements of \Z[\tau]. Additionally some properties of the fundamental domain are stated.
