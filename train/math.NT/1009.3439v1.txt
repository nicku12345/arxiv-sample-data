Recently, Kim proposed interesting q-extension of Bernstein polynomials and positive linear operators on C[0,1] which are different Phillips' q-Bernstein polynomials. From Kim's q-Bernstein polynomials, we investigate some interesting properties of q-Bernstein polynomials associated with q-stirling numbers and Carlitz's q-Bernoulli numbers
