We prove that there exist arbitrarily small positive real numbers \epsilon such that every integral power (1 + \vepsilon)^n is at a distance greater than 2^{-17} \epsilon |\log \vepsilon|^{-1} to the set of rational integers. This is sharp up to the factor 2^{-17} |\log \epsilon|^{-1}. We also establish that the set of real numbers \alpha > 1 such that the sequence of fractional parts (\{\alpha^n\})_{n \ge 1} is not dense modulo 1 has full Hausdorff dimension.
