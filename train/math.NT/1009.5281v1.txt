We give a detailed study of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of r-even arithmetic functions, which form a subspace of the space of r-periodic arithmetic functions. We consider the DFT of sequences of r-even functions, their mean values and Dirichlet series. Our results generalize properties of the Ramanujan sum. We show that some known properties of r-even functions and of the Ramanujan sum can be obtained in a simple manner via the DFT.
