This is an expository article, based on a lecture course given at CRM Barcelona in December 2009. The purpose of these notes is to prove, in a reasonably self-contained way, that finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group implies the parity conjecture for elliptic curves over number fields. Along the way, we review local and global root numbers of elliptic curves and their classification, and discuss some peculiar consequences of the parity conjecture.
