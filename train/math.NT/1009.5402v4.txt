For any integer x, let T_x denote the triangular number \frac{x(x+1)}{2}. In this paper we give a complete characterization of all the triples of positive integers (\alpha, \beta, \gamma) for which the ternary sums \alpha x^2 +\beta T_y + \gamma T_z represent all but finitely many positive integers. This resolves a conjecture of Kane and Sun \cite[Conjecture 1.19(i)]{KS08} and complete the characterization of all almost universal ternary mixed sums of squares and triangular numbers.
