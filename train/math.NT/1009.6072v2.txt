In this paper, we consider mod \ell Galois representations of \mathbb{Q}. In particular, we obtain an effective criterion to distinguish two semisimple 2-dimensional, odd mod \ell Galois representations up to isomorphism. Serre's conjecture (Khare-Wintenberger's theorem), Sturm's theorem, and its modification by Kohnen are used in our proof.
