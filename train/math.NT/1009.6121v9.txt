We prove a kind of "almost all symmetry" result for the primes, i.e. we give non-trivial bounds for the "symmetry integral", say I_{\Lambda}(N,h), of the von Mangoldt function \Lambda(n) (:= \log p for prime-powers n=p^r, 0 otherwise). We get I_{\Lambda}(N,h)\ll NhL^5+Nh^{21/20}L^2, with L:=\log N; as a Corollary, we bound non-trivially the Selberg integral of the primes, i.e. the mean-square of \sum_{x<n\le x+h}\Lambda(n)-h, over x\in [N,2N], to get the "Prime Number Theorem in almost all short intervals" of (log-powers!) length h\ge L^{11/2+\epsilon}. We trust here in the improvement of the exponent, say c<11/2.
