I present a new property of prime numbers that leads to a generalization of Cramer's conjecture. The study of the gap between consecutive primes is treated as a special case of the gap between consecutive terms of sequences having a certain property called pseudo equidistribution. Both rigorous as well as heuristic arguments are given in support of the generalized Cramer's conjectures.
