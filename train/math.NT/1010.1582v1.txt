Let k be a perfect field of virtual cohomological dimension \leq 2. Let G be a connected linear algebraic group over k such that G^{sc} satisfies a Hasse principle over k. Let X be a principal homogeneous space under G over k. We show that if X admits a zero cycle of degree one, then X has a k-rational point.
