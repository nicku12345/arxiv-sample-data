In this paper we consider weakly holomorphic modular forms (i.e. those meromorphic modular forms for which poles only possibly occur at the cusps) of weight 2-k\in 2\Z for the full modular group \SL_2(\Z). The space has a distinguished set of generators f_{m,2-k}. Such weakly holomorphic modular forms have been classified in terms of finitely many Eisenstein series, the unique weight 12 newform \Delta, and certain Faber polynomials in the modular invariant j(z), the Hauptmodul for \SL_2(\Z). We employ the theory of harmonic weak Maass forms and (non-holomorphic) Maass-Poincar\'e series in order to obtain the asymptotic growth of the coefficients of these Faber polynomials. Along the way, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the partial derivatives of the Maass-Poincar\'e series with respect to y as well as extending an asymptotic for the growth of the \ell-th repeated integral of the Gauss error function at x to include \ell\in \R and a wider range of x.
