Fix a sequence of integers Q=\{q_n\}_{n=1}^\infty such that q_n is greater than or equal to 2 for all n. In this paper, we improve upon results by J. Galambos and F. Schweiger showing that almost every (in the sense of Lebesgue measure) real number in [0,1) is Q-normal with respect to the Q-Cantor series expansion for sequences Q that satisfy a certain condition. We also provide asymptotics describing the number of occurrences of blocks of digits in the Q-Cantor series expansion of a typical number. The notion of strong Q-normality, that satisfies a similar typicality result, is introduced. Both of these notions are equivalent for the b-ary expansion, but strong normality is stronger than normality for the Cantor series expansion. In order to show this, we provide an explicit construction of a sequence Q and a real number that is Q-normal, but not strongly Q-normal. We use the results in this paper to show that under a mild condition on the sequence Q, a set satisfying a weaker notion of normality, studied by A. R\'enyi in \cite{Renyi}, will be dense in [0,1).
