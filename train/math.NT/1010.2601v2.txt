A well-known open problem is to show that the cubic form x^3+y^3+2z^3 represents all integers. An obvious variant of this problem is whether every integer can be {\em primitively} represented by x^3+y^3+2z^3. In other words, given an integer n, are there coprime integers x, y, z such that x^3+y^3+2z^3=n? In this note we answer this variant question negatively. Indeed, we use cubic reciprocity to show that for every integral solution to x^3+y^3+2z^3=8^m,the unknowns x, y, z are divisible by 2^m.
