Let C be a smooth projective absolutely irreducible curve of genus g \geq 2 over a number field K of degree d, and denote its Jacobian by J. Denote the Mordell--Weil rank of J(K) by r. We give an explicit and practical Chabauty-style criterion for showing that a given subset \cK \subseteq C(K) is in fact equal to C(K). This criterion is likely to be successful if r \leq d(g-1). We also show that the only solutions to the equation x^2+y^3=z^{10} in coprime non-zero integers is (x,y,z)=(\pm 3, -2, \pm 1). This is achieved by reducing the problem to the determination of K-rational points on several genus 2 curves where K=\Q or \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}), and applying the method of this paper.
