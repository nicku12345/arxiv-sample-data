Let Q=(q_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} be a sequence of integers greater than or equal to 2. We say that a real number x in [0,1) is {\it Q-distribution normal} if the sequence (q_1q_2... q_n x)_{n=1}^{\infty} is uniformly distributed mod 1. In \cite{Lafer}, P. Lafer asked for a construction of a Q-distribution normal number for an arbitrary Q. Under a mild condition on Q, we construct a set \Theta_Q of Q-distribution normal numbers. This set is perfect and nowhere dense. Additionally, given any \alpha in [0,1], we provide an explicit example of a sequence Q such that the Hausdorff dimension of \Theta_Q is equal to \alpha. Under a certain growth condition on q_n, we provide a discrepancy estimate that holds for every x in \Theta_Q.
