We prove a p-adic analogue of W\"ustholz's analytic subgroup theorem. We apply this result to show that a curve embedded in its Jacobian intersects the p-adic closure of the Mordell-Weil group transversely whenever the latter has rank equal to 1. This allows us to give some theoretical justification to Chabauty techniques applied to finding rational points on curves whose Jacobian has Mordel-Weil group of rank 1.
