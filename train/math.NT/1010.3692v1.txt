Define \theta(x)=(x-1)/3 if x\geq 1, and \theta(x)=2x/(1-x) if x<1. We conjecture that the orbit of every positive rational number ends in 0. In particular, there does not exist any positive rational fixed point for a map in the semigroup \Omega generated by the maps 3x+1 and x/(x+2). In this paper, we prove that the asymptotic density of the set of elements in \Omega that have rational fixed points is zero.
