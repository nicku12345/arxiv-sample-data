We say a polynomial f having integer coefficients is strongly coefficient convex if the set of coefficients of f consists of consecutive integers only. We establish various results suggesting that the divisors of x^n-1 with integer coefficients have the tendency to be strongly coefficient convex and have small coefficients. The case where n=p^2*q with p and q primes is studied in detail.
