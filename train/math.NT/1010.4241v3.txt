We produce an integral model for the modular curve X(Np^m) over the ring of integers of a sufficiently ramified extension of \mathbf{Z}_p whose special fiber is a {\em semistable curve} in the sense that its only singularities are normal crossings. This is done by constructing a semistable covering (in the sense of Coleman) of the supersingular part of X(Np^m), which is a union of copies of a Lubin-Tate curve. In doing so we tie together nonabelian Lubin-Tate theory to the representation-theoretic point of view afforded by Bushnell-Kutzko types.   For our analysis it was essential to work with the Lubin-Tate curve not at level p^m but rather at infinite level. We show that the infinite-level Lubin-Tate space (in arbitrary dimension, over an arbitrary nonarchimedean local field) has the structure of a perfectoid space, which is in many ways simpler than the Lubin-Tate spaces of finite level.
