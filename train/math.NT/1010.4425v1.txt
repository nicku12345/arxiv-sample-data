In this paper we define a new type of continued fraction expansion for a real number x \in I_m:=[0,m-1], m\in N_+, m\geq 2: \[x = \frac{m^{-b_1(x)}}{\displaystyle 1+\frac{m^{-b_2(x)}}{1+\ddots}}:=[b_1(x), b_2(x), ...]_m. \] Then, we derive the basic properties of this continued fraction expansion, following the same steps as in the case of the regular continued fraction expansion. The main purpose of the paper is to prove the convergence of this type of expansion, i.e. we must show that \[x= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}[b_1(x), b_2(x), ..., b_n(x)]_m. \]
