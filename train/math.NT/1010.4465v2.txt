The nearest integer continued fraction of a real number x from [-1/2, 1/2) is defined. Some metrical properties of these expansions are presented. We define the approximation coefficients and give an important result on them. The main result consists in obtaining a stationary state for the transformation \tau_{1/2} which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.
