Let \Lambda be a maximal \mathbb{F}_q[T]-order in a division quaternion algebra over \mathbb{F}_q(T) which is split at the place \infty. The present article gives an algorithm to compute a fundamental domain for the action of the group of units \Lambda^* on the Bruhat-Tits tree \mathcal{T} associated to PGL_2(\mathbb{F}_q((1/T))). This action is a function field analog of the action of a co-compact Fuchsian group on the upper half plane. The algorithm also yields an explicit presentation of the group \Lambda^* in terms of generators and relations. Moreover we determine an upper bound for its running time using that \Lambda^*\backslash\mathcal{T} is {\em almost} Ramanujan.
