Let p be an odd prime number and K be a p-adic field. In this paper, we develop an analogue of Fontaine's theory of (phi,Gamma)-modules replacing the p-cyclotomic extension by the extension K_infty obtained by adding to K a compatible system of p^n-th roots of a fixed uniformizer pi of K. As a result, we obtain a new classification of p-adic representations of G_K = Gal(Kbar/K) by some (phi, \tau)-modules. We then make a link between the theory of (phi,tau)-modules discussed above and the so-called theory of (phi,N_nabla)-modules developped by Kisin. As a corollary, we answer a question of Tong Liu: we prove that, if K is a finite extension of Q_p, every representation of G_K of E(u)-finite height is potentially semi-stable.
