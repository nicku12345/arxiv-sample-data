Let G be a finite abelian group. The Erd{\H o}s--Ginzburg--Ziv constant \mathsf s (G) of G is defined as the smallest integer l \in \mathbb N such that every sequence \ S \ over G of length |S| \ge l \ has a zero-sum subsequence T of length |T| = \exp (G). If G has rank at most two, then the precise value of \mathsf s (G) is known (for cyclic groups this is the Theorem of Erd{\H o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv). Only very little is known for groups of higher rank. In the present paper, we focus on groups of the form G = C_n^r, with n, r \in \N and n \ge 2, and we tackle the study of \mathsf s (G) with a new approach, combining the direct problem with the associated inverse problem.
