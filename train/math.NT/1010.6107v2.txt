Let A be a finite multiset of integers. If B be a multiset such that A and B are t-complementing multisets of integers, then B is periodic. We obtain the Biro-type upper bound for the smallest such period of B: Let \epsilon>0. We assume that \textrm{diam}(A)\ge n_0(\epsilon) and that \sum_{a\in A}w_A(a)\leq (\textrm{diam}(A)+1)^{c}, where c is any constant such that c< 100\log2-2. Then B is periodic with period \[\log k\leq (\textrm{diam}(A)+1)^{1/3+\epsilon}. \]
