We consider positional numeration system with negative base, as introduced by Ito and Sadahiro. In particular, we focus on algebraic properties of negative bases -\beta for which the corresponding dynamical system is sofic, which happens, according to Ito and Sadahiro, if and only if the (-\beta)-expansion of -\frac{\beta}{\beta+1} is eventually periodic. We call such numbers \beta Ito-Sadahiro numbers and we compare their properties with Parry numbers, occurring in the same context for R\'enyi positive base numeration system.
