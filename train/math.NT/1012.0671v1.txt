Recall that an integer is t-free iff it is not divisible by p^t for some prime p. We give a method to check Robin inequality \sigma(n) < e^\gamma n\log\log n, for t-free integers n and apply it for t=6,7. We introduce \Psi_t, a generalization of Dedekind \Psi function defined for any integer t\ge 2 by \Psi_t(n):=n\prod_{p | n}(1+1/p+...+1/p^{t-1}). If n is t-free then the sum of divisor function \sigma(n) is  \le \Psi_t(n). We characterize the champions for x \mapsto \Psi_t(x)/x, as primorial numbers. Define the ratio R_t(n):=\frac{\Psi_t(n)}{n\log\log n}. We prove that, for all t, there exists an integer n_1(t), such that we have R_t(N_n)< e^\gamma for n\ge n_1, where N_n=\prod_{k=1}^np_k. Further, by combinatorial arguments, this can be extended to R_t(N)\le e^\gamma for all N\ge N_n, such that n\ge n_1(t). This yields Robin inequality for t=6,\,7. For t varying slowly with N, we also derive R_t(N)< e^\gamma.
