Let p>2 be a rational prime and K/Q_p be an extension of complete discrete valuation fields. Let G be a truncated Barsotti-Tate group of level n, height h and dimension d over O_K with 0<d<h. In this paper, we show that an upper ramification subgroup G^j+ is free of rank d over Z/p^nZ if the Hasse invariant of G is less than 1/(2p^(n-1)). We also prove the usual properties as the canonical subgroup.
