Given integers a and m\ge 2, let \Hm be the following set of integral points  \Hm= \{(x,y) \ : \ xy \equiv a \pmod m,\ 1\le x,y \le m-1\}  We improve several previously known upper bounds on v_a(m), the number of vertices of the convex closure of \Hm, and show that uniformly over all a with \gcd(a,m)=1 we have v_a(m) \le m^{1/2 + o(1)} and furthermore, we have v_a(m) \le m^{5/12 + o(1)} for m which are almost squarefree.
