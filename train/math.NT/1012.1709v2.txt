We establish new combinatorial transcendence criteria for continued fraction expansions. Let \alpha = [0; a_1, a_2,...] be an algebraic number of degree at least three. One of our criteria implies that the sequence of partial quotients (a_{\ell})_{\ell \ge 1} of \alpha cannot be generated by a finite automaton, and that the complexity function of (a_{\ell})_{\ell \ge 1} cannot increase too slowly.
