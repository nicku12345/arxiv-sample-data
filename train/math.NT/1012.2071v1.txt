In this paper we prove inequalities for multiplicative analogues of Diophantine exponents, similar to the ones known in the classical case. Particularly, we show that a matrix is badly approximable if and only if its transpose is badly approximable and establish some inequalities connecting multiplicative exponents with ordinary ones.
