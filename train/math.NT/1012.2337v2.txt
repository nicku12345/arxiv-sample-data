Lehmer's totient problem consists of determining the set of positive integers n such that \varphi(n)|n-1 where \varphi is Euler's totient function. In this paper we introduce the concept of k-Lehmer number. A k-Lehmer number is a composite number such that \varphi(n)|(n-1)^k. The relation between k-Lehmer numbers and Carmichael numbers leads to a new characterization of Carmichael numbers and to some conjectures related to the distribution of Carmichael numbers which are also k-Lehmer numbers.
