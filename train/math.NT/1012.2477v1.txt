Let A be an abelian variety of positive dimension defined over a number field K and let Kbar be a fixed algebraic closure of K. For each element sigma of the absolute Galois group Gal(Kbar/K), let Kbar(sigma) be the fixed field of sigma in Kbar. We shall prove that the torsion subgroup of A(Kbar(sigma)) is infinite for all sigma in Gal(Kbar/K) outside of some set of Haar measure zero. This proves the number field case of a conjecture of Geyer and Jarden from 1978.
