Let p and q be two distinct prime numbers, and X^{pq}/w_q be the quotient of the Shimura curve of discriminant pq by the Atkin-Lehner involution w_q. We describe a way to verify in wide generality a criterion of Parent and Yafaev to prove that if p and q satisfy some explicite congruence conditions, known as the conditions of the non ramified case of Ogg, and if p is large enough compared to q, then the quotient X^{pq}/w_q has no rational point, except possibly special points.
