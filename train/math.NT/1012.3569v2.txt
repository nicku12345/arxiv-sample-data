Let Q(x,y) be a quadratic form with discriminant D\neq 0. We obtain non trivial upper bound estimates for the number of solutions of the congruence Q(x,y)\equiv\lambda \pmod{p}, where p is a prime and x,y lie in certain intervals of length M, under the assumption that Q(x,y)-\lambda is an absolutely irreducible polynomial modulo p. In particular we prove that the number of solutions to this congruence is M^{o(1)} when M\ll p^{1/4}. These estimates generalize a previous result by Cilleruelo and Garaev on the particular congruence xy\equiv \lambda \pmod{p}.
