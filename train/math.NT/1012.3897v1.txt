Let A_n denote the height of cyclotomic polynomial \Phi_n, where n is a product of k distinct odd primes. We prove that A_n \le \epsilon_k\phi(n)^{k^{-1}2^{k-1}-1} with -\log\epsilon_k\sim c2^k, c>0. The same statement is true for the height C_n of the inverse cyclotomic polynomial \Psi_n.   Additionally, we improve on a bound of Kaplan for the maximal height of divisors of x^n-1, denoted by B_n. We show that B_n<\eta_k n^{(3^k-1)/(2k)-1}, with -\log \eta_k \sim c3^k and the same c.
