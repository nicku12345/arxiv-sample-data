The Galois representation associated to a p-divisible group over a complete noetherian normal local ring with perfect residue field is described in terms of its Dieudonn\'e display. As a corollary we deduce in arbitrary characteristic Kisin's description of the Galois representation associated to a commutative finite flat p-group scheme over a p-adic discrete valuation ring in terms of its Breuil-Kisin module. This was obtained earlier by W. Kim by a different method.
