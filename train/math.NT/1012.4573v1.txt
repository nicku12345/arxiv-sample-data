In a paper published in 1959, Shimura presented an elegant calculation of the critical values of L-functions attached to elliptic modular forms using the first cohomology group. We will show that a similar calculation is possible for Hilbert modular forms over real quadratic fields using the second cohomology group. We present explicit numerical examples calculated by this method.
