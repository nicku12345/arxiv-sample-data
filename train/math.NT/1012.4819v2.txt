We prove, under mild hypotheses, that there are no irreducible two-dimensional_even_ Galois representations of \Gal(\Qbar/\Q) which are de Rham with distinct Hodge--Tate weights. This removes the "ordinary" hypothesis required in previous work of the author. We construct examples of irreducible two-dimensional residual representations that have no characteristic zero geometric (= de Rham) deformations.
