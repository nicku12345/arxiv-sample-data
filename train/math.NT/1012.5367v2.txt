Let F be a finite field and l a prime not equal to the characteristic of F. Let K be the function field of a surface over F. Assume that K contains a primitive lth root of unity. In the paper we prove a certain local-global principle for elements of H^3(K, {\mu}_l) in terms of symbols in H^2(K, {\mu}_l) with respect to discrete valuations of K. We also show that this local global principle is equivalent to the vanishing of certain unramified cohomology groups of 3-folds over finite fields. Using this local-global principle we show that every element in H^3(F, {\mu}_l) is a symbol. The vanishing of the unramified cohomology groups has consequences in the study of integral Tate conjecture and Brauer-Manin obstruction for existence of zero-cycles.
