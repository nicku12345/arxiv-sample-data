Let f be an arithmetical function. The matrix [f(i,j)]_{n\times n} given by the value of f in greatest common divisor of (i,j), f\big((i,j)\big) as its i,\; j entry is called the greatest common divisor (GCD) matrix. We consider the generalization of this matrix where the elements are in the form f\big(i,(i,j)\big).
