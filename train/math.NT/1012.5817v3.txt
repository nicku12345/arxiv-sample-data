Let f and g, of weights k'>k\geq 2, be normalised newforms for \Gamma_0(N), for square-free N>1, such that, for each Atkin-Lehner involution, the eigenvalues of f and g are equal. Let \lambda\mid\ell be a large prime divisor of the algebraic part of the near-central critical value L(f\otimes g,\frac{k+k'-2}{2}). Under certain hypotheses, we prove that \lambda is the modulus of a congruence between the Hecke eigenvalues of a genus-two Yoshida lift of (Jacquet-Langlands correspondents of) f and g (vector-valued in general), and a non-endoscopic genus-two cusp form. In pursuit of this we also give a precise pullback formula for a genus-four Eisenstein series, and a general formula for the Petersson norm of a Yoshida lift.   Given such a congruence, using the 4-dimensional \lambda-adic Galois representation attached to a genus-two cusp form, we produce, in an appropriate Selmer group, an element of order \lambda, as required by the Bloch-Kato conjecture on values of L-functions.
