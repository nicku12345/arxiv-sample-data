The aim of this paper is to introduce a new family of elliptic curves with positive ranks. These elliptic curves have been constructed with certain rational numbers, namely a, b, and c as sides of Heron triangles having rational areas k. It turned out that the torsion groups of this family are of the form \frac{\Bbb{Z}}{2\Bbb{Z}}\times \frac{\Bbb{Z}}{2\Bbb{Z}} and also the rank is positive.
