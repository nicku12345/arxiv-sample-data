A cusp form f(z) of weight k for \SL_{2}(\Z) is determined uniquely by its first \ell := \dim S_{k} Fourier coefficients. We derive an explicit bound on the nth coefficient of f in terms of its first \ell coefficients. We use this result to study the non-negativity of the coefficients of the unique modular form of weight k with Fourier expansion \[F_{k,0}(z) = 1 + O(q^{\ell + 1}).\] In particular, we show that k = 81632 is the largest weight for which all the coefficients of F_{0,k}(z) are non-negative. This result has applications to the theory of extremal lattices.
