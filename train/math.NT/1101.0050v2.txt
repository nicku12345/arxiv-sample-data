Let f(n,k) be the largest number of positive integers not exceeding n from which one cannot select k+1 pairwise coprime integers, and let E(n,k) be the set of positive integers which do not exceed n and can be divided by at least one of p_1, p_2,..., p_k, where p_i is the i-th prime. In 1962, P. Erd\H os conjectured that f(n,k)=|E(n,k)| for all n\ge p_k. In 1973, S. L. G. Choi proved that the conjecture is true for k=3. In 1994, Ahlswede and Kachatrian disproved the conjecture for k=212. In this paper we prove that, for n\ge 49, if A(n,4) is a set of positive integers not exceeding n from which one cannot select 5 pairwise coprime integers and |A(n,4)|\ge |E(n,4)|, then A(n,4)=E(n,4). In particular, the conjecture is true for k=4. Several open problems and conjectures are posed for further research.
