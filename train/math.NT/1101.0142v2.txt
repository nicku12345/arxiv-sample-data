For relatively prime positive integers u_0 and r, we consider the least common multiple L_n:=\mathrm{lcm}(u_0,u_1,\ldots, u_n) of the finite arithmetic progression \{u_k:=u_0+kr\}_{k=0}^n. We derive new lower bounds on L_n which improve upon those obtained previously when either u_0 or n is large. When r is prime, our best bound is sharp up to a factor of n+1 for u_0 properly chosen, and is also nearly sharp as n\to\infty.
