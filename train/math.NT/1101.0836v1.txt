Fix an integer r\geq 3. Let q be a large positive integer and a_1,...,a_r be distinct residue classes modulo q that are relatively prime to q. In this paper, we establish an asymptotic formula for the logarithmic density \delta_{q;a_1,...,a_r} of the set of real numbers x such that \pi(x;q,a_1)>\pi(x;q,a_2)>...>\pi(x;q,a_r), as q\to\infty; conditionally on the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis GRH and the Grand Simplicity Hypothesis GSH. Several applications concerning these prime number races are then deduced. Indeed, comparing with a recent work of D. Fiorilli and G. Martin for the case r=2, we show that these densities behave differently when r\geq 3. Another consequence of our results is the fact that, unlike two-way races, biases do appear in races involving three of more squares (or non-squares) to large moduli. Furthermore, we establish a conjecture of M. Rubinstein and P. Sarnak (on biased races) in certain cases where the a_i are assumed to be fixed and q is large. We also prove that a conjecture of A. Feuerverger and G. Martin concerning "bias factors" (which follows from the work of Rubinstein and Sarnak for r=2) does not hold when r\geq 3. Finally, we use a variant of our method to derive Fiorilli and Martin asymptotic formula for the densities in two-way races.
