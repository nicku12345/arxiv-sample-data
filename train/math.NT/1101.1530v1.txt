Given a properly normalized parametrization of a genus-0 modular curve, the complex multiplication points map to algebraic numbers called singular moduli. In the classical case, the maps can be given analytically. However, in the Shimura curve cases, no such analytical expansion is possible. Fortunately, in both cases there are known algorithms for algebraically computing the rational norms of the singular moduli. We demonstrate a method of using these norm algorithms to algebraically determine the minimal polynomial of the singular moduli below a discriminant threshold. We then use these minimal polynomials to compute the algebraic abc-ratios for the singular moduli.
