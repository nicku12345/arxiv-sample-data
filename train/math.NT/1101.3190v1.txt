Harmonic weak Maass forms of half-integral weight are the subject of many recent works. They are closely related to Ramanujan's mock theta functions, their theta lifts give rise to Arakelov Green functions, and their coefficients are often related to central values and derivatives of Hecke L-functions. We present an algorithm to compute harmonic weak Maass forms numerically, based on the automorphy method due to Hejhal and Stark. As explicit examples we consider harmonic weak Maass forms of weight 1/2 associated to the elliptic curves 11a1, 37a1, 37b1. We made extensive numerical computations and the data we obtained is presented in the final section of the paper. We expect that experiments based on our data will lead to a better understanding of the arithmetic properties of the Fourier coefficients.
