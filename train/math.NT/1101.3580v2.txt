This paper is a first attempt at getting information on a symmetric power representation of a GL_2 automorphic form via a trace formula that is beyond endoscopic techniques. In particular, we study the symmetric third power representation for all forms over \Q adjoined the cube roots of unity. A key tool needed in the study is an identity relating cubic exponential sums to Kloosterman sums. This very same identity is crucial to the fundamental lemma of a trace formula comparison in work of Mao and Rallis.
