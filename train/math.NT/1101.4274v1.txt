Following an idea of Rowland we give a conjectural way to generate increasing sequences of primes using algorithms involving the gcd. These algorithms seem not so useless for searching primes since it appears we found sometime primes much more greater than the number of required iterations. In an other hand we propose new formulations of famous conjectures from the additive theory of numbers (the weak twin prime conjecture, the Polignac conjecture, the Goldbach conjecture or the very general Schinzel's hypothesis H). For the moment these are experimental results obtained using pari-gp.
