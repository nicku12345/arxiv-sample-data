Let p be an irregular prime and K=\Q(\zeta) the p-cyclotomic field. Let \sigma be a \Q-isomorphism of K generating Gal(K/\Q). Let S/K be a cyclic unramified extension of degree p, defined by S= K(A^{1/p}) where A\in K\backslash K^p, A\Z_K=\mk a^p with \mk a non-principal ideal of \Z_K, A^{\sigma-\mu}\in K^p and \mu\in{\bf F}_p. We compute explicitly the decomposition of the prime p in the subfields M of S of degree [M:\Q]=p.
