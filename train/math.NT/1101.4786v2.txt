We give a representation of the classical Riemann \zeta-function in the half plane \Re s>0 in terms of a Mellin transform involving the real part of the dilogarithm function with an argument on the unit circle (associated Clausen Gl_2-function). We also derive corresponding representations involving the derivatives of the Gl_2-function. A generalized symmetrized M\"untz-type formula is also derived. For a special choice of test functions it connects to our integral representation of the \zeta-function, providing also a computation of a concrete Mellin transform. Certain formulae involving series of zeta functions and gamma functions are also derived.
