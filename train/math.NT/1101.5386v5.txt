For any positive integer n and variables a and x we define the generalized Legendre polynomial P_n(a,x)=\sum_{k=0}^n\b ak\b{-1-a}k(\frac{1-x}2)^k. Let p be an odd prime. In the paper we prove many congruences modulo p^2 related to P_{p-1}(a,x). For example, we show that P_{p-1}(a,x)\e (-1)^{<a>_p}P_{p-1}(a,-x)\mod {p^2}, where <a>_p is the least nonnegative residue of a modulo p. We also generalize some congruences of Zhi-Wei Sun, and determine \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\binom{2k}k\binom{3k}k{54^{-k}} and \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\binom ak\binom{b-a}k\mod {p^2}, where [x] is the greatest integer function. Finally we pose some supercongruences modulo p^2 concerning binary quadratic forms.
