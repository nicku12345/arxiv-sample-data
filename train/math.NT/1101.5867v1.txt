The present paper is in a sense a continuation of \cite{PLS}, it relies on the notation and some results. The problem tackled in both papers is the nature of the continued fraction expansion of \sqrt[3]{2}: are the partial quotients bounded or not. Numerical experiments suggest an even stronger result on the lines of Kuzmin statistics. Here we apply different sets of bases for the vector space V, where the adjunction ring \ZZ\lbrack \sqrt[3]{2} \rbrack lives. And as a result we get a criterion for continued fraction convergents in terms of the coefficient vector from a lattice.
