Given a prime number l and a finite set of integers S=\{a_1,...,a_m\} we find out the exact degree of the extension \mathbb{Q}(a_1^{\frac{1}{l}},...,a_m^{\frac{1}{l}})/\mathbb{Q}. We give two different ways to compute this degree. The first method is using ramifiaction theory. The second proof follwos from our study of the distribution of primes p for which all of a_i are l^{th} power residue simultaneously.
