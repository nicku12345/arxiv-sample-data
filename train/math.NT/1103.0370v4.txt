A natural question about Dedekind sums is to find conditions on the integers a_1, a_2, and b such that s(a_1,b) = s(a_2, b). We prove that if the former equality holds then  b \ | \ (a_1a_2-1)(a_1-a_2). Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge such statements have not appeared in the literature. A similar theorem is proved for the more general Dedekind-Rademacher sums as well, namely that for any fixed non-negative integer n, a positive integer modulus b, and two integers a_1 and a_2 that are relatively prime to b, the hypothesis r_n (a_1,b)= r_n (a_2,b) implies that   b \ | \ (6n^2+1-a_1a_2)(a_2-a_1).
