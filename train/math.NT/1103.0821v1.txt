Sturm obtained the bounds for the number of the first Fourier coefficients of elliptic modular form f to determine vanishing of f modulo a prime p. In this paper, we study analogues of Sturm's bound for Siegel modular forms of genus 2. We show the resulting bound is sharp. As an application, we study congruences involving Atkin's U(p)-operator for the Fourier coefficients of Siegel mdoular forms of genus 2.
