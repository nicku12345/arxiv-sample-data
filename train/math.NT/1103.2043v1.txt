In this paper, a new method for generation of infinite series of symmetric identities written for exponential sums in real numbers is proposed. Such systems have numerous applications in theory of numbers, chaos theory, algorithmic complexity, dynamic systems, etc. Properties of generated identities are studied. Relations of the introduced method for generation of symmetric exponential sums to the Morse-Hedlund sequence and to the theory of magic squares are established.
