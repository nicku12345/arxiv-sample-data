We prove that if W and W' are two B-pairs whose tensor product is crystalline (or semi-stable or de Rham or Hodge-Tate), then there exists a character \mu such that W(\mu^{-1}) and W'(\mu) are crystalline (or semi-stable or de Rham or Hodge-Tate). We also prove that if W is a B-pair and F is a Schur functor (for example \Sym^n(-) or \Lambda^n(-)) such that F(W) is crystalline (or semi-stable or de Rham or Hodge-Tate) and if the rank of W is sufficiently large, then there is a character \mu such that W(\mu^{-1}) is crystalline (or semi-stable or de Rham or Hodge-Tate). In particular, these results apply to p-adic representations.
