We prove an unconditional power saving for the dimension of the space of cohomological automorphic forms of fixed level and growing weight on GL_2 over any number field which is not totally real. Our proof involves the theory of p-adically completed cohomology developed by Calegari and Emerton, and a bound for the growth of coinvariants in certain finitely generated non-commutative Iwasawa modules.
