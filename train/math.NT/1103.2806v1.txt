We show that certain p-adic Eisenstein series for quaternionic modular groups of degree 2 become "real" modular forms of level p in almost all cases. To prove this, we introduce a U(p) type operator. We also show that there exists a p-adic Eisenstein series of the above type that has transcendental coefficients. Former examples of p-adic Eisenstein series for Siegel and Hermitian modular groups are both rational (i.e., algebraic).
