In 1950 G. Giuga studied the congruence \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} j^{n-1} \equiv -1 (mod n) and conjectured that it was only satisfied by prime numbers. In this work we generalize Giuga's ideas considering, for each k \in \mathbb{N}, the congruence \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} j^{k(n-1)} \equiv -1 (mod n). It particular, it is proved that a pair (n,k)\in \mathbb{N}^2 (with composite n) satisfies the congruence if and only if n is a Giuga Number and  \lambda(n)/\gcd(\lambda(n),n-1) divides k. In passing, we establish some new characterizations of Giuga Numbers.
