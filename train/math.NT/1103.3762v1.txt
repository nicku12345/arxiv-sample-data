In this paper, we define a new product over \mathbb{R}^{\infty}, which allows us to obtain a group isomorphic to \mathbb R^* with the usual product. This operation unexpectedly offers an interpretation of the R\'edei rational functions, making more clear some of their properties, and leads to another product, which generates a group structure over the Pell hyperbola. Finally, we join together these results, in order to evaluate solutions of Pell equation in an original way.
