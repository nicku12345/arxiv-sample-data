We give again the proof of several classical results concerning the cyclotomic approach to Fermat's last theorem using exclusively class field theory (essentially the reflection theorems), without any calculations. The fact that this is possible suggests a part of the logical inefficiency of the historical investigations. We analyze the significance of the numerous computations of the literature, to show how they are probably too local to get any proof of the theorem. However we use the derivation method of Eichler as a prerequisite for our purpose, a method which is also local but more effective. Then we propose some modest ways of study in a more diophantine context using radicals; this point of view would require further nonalgebraic investigations.
