Let \mathcal{M} be a differential module, whose coefficients are analytic elements on an open annulus I (\subset \bR_{>0}) in a valued field, complete and algebraically closed of inequal characteristic, and let R(\mathcal{M}, r) be the radius of convergence of its solutions in the neighbourhood of the generic point t_r of absolute value r, with r\in I. Assume that R(\mathcal{M}, r)<r on I and, in the logarithmic coordinates, the function r\longrightarrow R(\ mathcal{M}, r) has only one slope on I.   In this paper, we prove that for any r\in I, all the solutions of \mathcal{M} in the neighborhood of t_r are analytic and bounded in the disk D(t_r,R(\mathcal{M},r)^-).
