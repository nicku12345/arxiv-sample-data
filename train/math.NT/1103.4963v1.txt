Let  p  be a prime lager than 3. Let k be a number field, which does not contain the subfield of \mathbb{Q} (\zeta_{p^2}) of degree p over \mathbb{Q}. Suppose that \mathcal{E} is an elliptic curve defined over k. We prove that the existence of a counterexample to the local-global divisibility by p^2 in \mathcal{E}, assures the existence of a k-rational point of exact order p in \mathcal{E}. Using the Merel Theorem, we then shrunk the known set of primes for which there could be a counterexample to the local-global divisibility by p^2.
