We solve the Diophantine equations x^5 + y^5 = dz^p with d=2, 3 for a set of prime numbers of density 1/4, 1/2, respectively. The method consists in relating a possible solution to another Diophantine equation and solving the later by using Q-curves and a generalized modular technique as in work of Ellenberg and Dieulefait-Jimenez along with some new techniques for eliminating newforms.
