We propose a conjectural explicit isogeny from the Jacobians of hyperelliptic Drinfeld modular curves to the Jacobians of hyperelliptic modular curves of \mathcal{D}-elliptic sheaves. The kernel of the isogeny is a subgroup of the cuspidal divisor group constructed by examining the canonical maps from the cuspidal divisor group into the component groups.
