We prove that some of the basic differential functions appearing in the (unramified) theory of arithmetic differential equations, especially some of the basic differential modular forms in that theory, arise from a "ramified situation". This property can be viewed as a special kind of overconvergence property. One can also go in the opposite direction by using differential functions that arise in a ramified situation to construct "new" (unramified) differential functions.
