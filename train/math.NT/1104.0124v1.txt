For a fixed prime we prove structure theorems for the kernel and the image of the map that attaches to any differential modular function its differential Fourier expansion. The image of this map, which is the ring of differential Fourier expansions, plays the role of ring of functions on a "differential Igusa curve". Our constructions are then used to perform an analytic continuation between isogeny covariant differential modular forms on the differential Igusa curves belonging to different primes.
