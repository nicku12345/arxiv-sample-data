A description is given of all primitive differential series mod p of order 1 which are eigenvectors of all the Hecke operators and which are differential Fourier expansions of differential modular forms of arbitrary order and given weight; this set of differential series is shown to be in a natural one-to-one correspondence with the set of series mod p (of order 0) which are eigenvectors of all the Hecke operators and which are Fourier expansions of (classical) modular forms of appropriate weight.
