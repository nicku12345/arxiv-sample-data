We present a dimension formula for spaces of vector-valued modular forms of integer weight in case the associated multiplier system has finite image, and discuss the weight distribution of the module generators of holomorphic and cusp forms, as well as the duality relation between cusp forms and holomorphic forms for the contragredient.
