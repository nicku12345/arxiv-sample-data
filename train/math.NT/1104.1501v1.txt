The present paper deals with multiplication formulas for the Apostol-Genocchi polynomials of higher order and deduces some explicit recursive formulas. Some earlier results of Carlitz and Howard in terms of Genocchi numbers can be deduced. We introduce the 2-variable Apostol-Genocchi polynomials and then we consider the multiplication theorem for 2-variable Genocchi polynomials. Also we introduce generalized Apostol-Genocchi polynomials with a; b; c parameters and we obtain several identities on generalized Apostol-Genocchi polynomials with a; b; c parameters
