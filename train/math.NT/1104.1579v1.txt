Let \epsilon\in \{-1,1\}. A sequence of prime numbers p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., such that p_i=2p_{i-1}+\epsilon for all i, is called a {\it Cunningham chain} of the first or second kind, depending on whether \epsilon =1 or -1 respectively. If k is the smallest positive integer such that 2p_k+\epsilon is composite, then we say the chain has length k. Although such chains are necessarily finite, it is conjectured that for every positive integer k, there are infinitely many Cunningham chains of length k. A sequence of polynomials f_1(x), f_2(x), ..., such that f_i(x)\in \Z[x], f_1(x) has positive leading coefficient, f_i(x) is irreducible in \Q[x], and f_i(x)=xf_{i-1}(x)+\epsilon for all i, is defined to be a {\it polynomial Cunningham chain} of the first or second kind, depending on whether \epsilon =1 or -1 respectively. If k is the least positive integer such that f_{k+1}(x) is reducible over \Q, then we say the chain has length k. In this article, for chains of each kind, we explicitly give infinitely many polynomials f_1(x), such that f_{k+1}(x) is the only term in the sequence \{f_i(x)\}_{i=1}^{\infty} that is reducible. As a first corollary, we deduce that there exist infinitely many polynomial Cunningham chains of length k of both kinds, and as a second corollary, we have that, unlike the situation in the integers, there exist infinitely many polynomial Cunningham chains of infinite length of both kinds.
