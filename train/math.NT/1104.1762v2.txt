We give a refinement of the local class field theory of Serre and Hazewinkel. This refinement allows the theory to treat extensions that are not necessarily totally ramified. Such a refinement was obtained and used in the authors' paper on Fontaine's property (Pm), where the explanation had to be rather brief. In this paper, we give a complete account, from necessary knowledge of an appropriate Grothendieck site to the details of the proof. We start by reviewing the local class field theory of Serre and Hazewinkel.
