We find new hypergeometric identities which, in a certain aspect, are stron-ger than others of the same style found by the author in a previous paper. The identities in Section \ref{section-pi} are related to some Ramanujan-type series for 1/\pi. We derive them by using WZ-pairs associated to some interesting formulas by Wenchang Chu. The identities we prove in Section \ref{section-pi2} are of the same style but related to Ramanujan-like series for 1/\pi^2.
