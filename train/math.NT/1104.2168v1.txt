Let E be an elliptic curve over \mathbb{Q} with good supersingular reduction at a prime p\geq 3 and a_p=0. We generalise the definition of Kobayashi's plus/minus Selmer groups over \mathbb{Q}(\mu_{p^\infty}) to p-adic Lie extensions K_\infty of \mathbb{Q} containing \mathbb{Q}(\mu_{p^\infty}), using the theory of (\phi,\Gamma)-modules and Berger's comparison isomorphisms. We show that these Selmer groups can be equally described using the "jumping conditions" of Kobayashi via the theory of overconvergent power series. Moreover, we show that such an approach gives the usual Selmer groups in the ordinary case.
