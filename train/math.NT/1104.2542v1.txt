The goal of this article is to study the discrepancy of the distribution of arithmetic sequences in arithmetic progressions. We will fix a sequence \A=\{\a(n)\}_{n\geq 1} of non-negative real numbers in a certain class of arithmetic sequences. For a fixed integer a\neq 0, we will be interested in the behaviour of \A over the arithmetic progressions a \bmod q, on average over q. Our main result is that for certain sequences of arithmetic interest, the value of a has a significant influence on this distribution, even after removing the first term of the progressions.
