For a prime p and an integer u with \gcd(u,p)=1, we define Fermat quotients by the conditions  q_p(u) \equiv \frac{u^{p-1} -1}{p} \pmod p, \qquad 0 \le q_p(u) \le p-1.  D. R. Heath-Brown has given a bound of exponential sums with N consecutive Fermat quotients that is nontrivial for N\ge p^{1/2+\epsilon} for any fixed \epsilon>0. We use a recent idea of M. Z. Garaev together with a form of the large sieve inequality due to S. Baier and L. Zhao, to show that on average over p one can obtain a nontrivial estimate for much shorter sums starting with N\ge p^{\epsilon}. We also obtain lower bounds on the image size of the first N consecutive Fermat quotients and use it to prove that there is a positive integer n\le p^{3/4 + o(1)} such that q_p(n) is a primitive root modulo p.
