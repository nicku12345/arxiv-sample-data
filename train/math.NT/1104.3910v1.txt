We improve an estimate of A.Granville (1987) on the number of vanishing Fermat quotients q_p(\ell) modulo a prime p when \ell runs through primes \ell \le N. We use this bound to obtain an unconditional improvement of the conditional (under the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis) estimate of Y. Ihara (2006) on a certain sum, related to vanishing Fermat quotients. In turn this sum appears in the study of the index of certain subfields of of cyclotomic fields \Q(\exp(2 \pi i/p^2)).
