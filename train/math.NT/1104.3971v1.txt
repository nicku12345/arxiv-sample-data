Let R be an order in an algebraic number field. If R is a principal order, then many explicit results on its arithmetic are available. Among others, R is half-factorial if and only if the class group of R has at most two elements. Much less is known for non-principal orders. Using a new semigroup theoretical approach, we study half-factoriality and further arithmetical properties for non-principal orders in algebraic number fields.
