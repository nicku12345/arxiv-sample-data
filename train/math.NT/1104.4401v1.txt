In this paper, we construct two ternary linear codes associated with the symplectic groups Sp(2,q) and Sp(4,q). Here q is a power of three. Then we obtain recursive formulas for the power moments of Kloosterman sums with square arguments and for the even power moments of those in terms of the frequencies of weights in the codes. This is done via Pless power moment identity and by utilizing the explicit expressions of "Gauss sums" for the symplectic groups Sp(2n,q).
