Let K be a number field. The \textit{integral trace form} is the integral quadratic form given by \text{tr}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(x^2)|_{O_{K}}. In this article we study the existence of non-conjugated number fields with equivalent integral trace forms. As a corollary of one of the main results of this paper, we show that any two non-totally real number fields with the same signature and same prime discriminant have equivalent integral trace forms. Additionally, based on previous results obtained by the author and the evidence presented here, we conjecture that any two totally real quartic fields of fundamental discriminant have equivalent trace zero forms if and only if they are conjugated.
