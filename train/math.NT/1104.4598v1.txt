Given a nonzero integer d, we know by Hermite's Theorem that there exist only finitely many cubic number fields of discriminant d. However, it can happen that two non-isomorphic cubic fields have the same discriminant. It is thus natural to ask whether there are natural refinements of the discriminant which completely determine the isomorphism class of the cubic field. Here we consider the trace form q_K:\text{tr}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(x^2)|_{O^{0}_{K}} as such a refinement. For a cubic field of fundamental discriminant d we show the existence of an element T_K in Bhargava's class group \Cl(\mathbb{Z}^{2}\otimes\mathbb{Z}^{2}\otimes\mathbb{Z}^{2}; -3d) such that q_K is completely determined by T_K. By using one of Bhargava's composition laws, we show that q_K is a complete invariant whenever K is totally real and of fundamental discriminant
