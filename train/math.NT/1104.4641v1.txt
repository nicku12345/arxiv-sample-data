We show how the recent isogeny bounds due to \'E. Gaudron and G. R\'emond allow to obtain the triviality of X_0^+ (p^r)(Q), for r>1 and p a prime exceeding 2.10^{11}. This includes the case of the curves X_split (p). We then prove, with the help of computer calculations, that the same holds true for p in the range 10 < p < 10^{14}, p\neq 13. The combination of those results completes the qualitative study of such sets of rational points undertook in previous papers, with the exception of p=13.
