Let p be a prime number and let  k  be a number field, which does not contain the field \mathbb{Q} (\zeta_p + \bar{\zeta_p}). Let \mathcal{E} be an elliptic curve defined over k. We prove that if there are no k-rational torsion points of exact order p on \E, then the local-global principle holds for divisibility by p^n, with n a natural number. As a consequence of the deep theorem of Merel, for p larger than a constant depending only on the degree of k, there are no counterexamples to the local-global divisibility principle. Nice and deep works give explicit small constants for elliptic curves defined over a number field of degree at most 5 over \mathbb{Q}.
