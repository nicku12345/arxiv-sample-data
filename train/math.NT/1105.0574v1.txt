The beta-conjugates of a base of numeration \beta > 1, \beta being a Parry number, were introduced by Boyd, in the context of the R\'enyi-Parry dynamics of numeration system and the beta-transformation. These beta-conjugates are canonically associated with \beta. Let \beta > 1 be a real algebraic number. A more general definition of the beta-conjugates of \beta is introduced in terms of the Parry Upper function f_{\beta}(z) of the beta-transformation. We introduce the concept of a germ of curve at (0,1/\beta) \in \mathbb{C}^{2} associated with f_{\beta}(z) and the reciprocal of the minimal polynomial of \beta. This germ is decomposed into irreducible elements according to the theory of Puiseux, gathered into conjugacy classes. The beta-conjugates of \beta, in terms of the Puiseux expansions, are given a new equivalent definition in this new context. If \beta is a Parry number the (Artin-Mazur) dynamical zeta function \zeta_{\beta}(z) of the beta-transformation, simply related to f_{\beta}(z), is expressed as a product formula, under some assumptions, a sort of analog to the Euler product of the Riemann zeta function, and the factorization of the Parry polynomial of \beta is deduced from the germ.
