Given a prime number l and a finite set of integers S=\{a_1,...,a_m\} we find out the exact degree of the extension \mathbb{Q}(a_1^{\frac{1}{l}},...,a_m^{\frac{1}{l}})/\mathbb{Q}. We give an algorithm to compute this degree and then further relate it to the study of the distribution of primes p for which all of a_i assume a preassigned l^{th} power residue simultaneously. Also we relate this degree to rank of a matrix obtained from S=\{a_1,...,a_m\}. This latter arguement enable one to describe the degree \mathbb{Q}(a_1^{\frac{1}{l}},...,a_m^{\frac{1}{l}})/\mathbb{Q} in much simpler terms.
