This paper gives examples of function fields K_0 over a finite field \mathbb{F}_q of p power order ramified only at one finite regular prime over \mathbb{F}_q(t), which admit infinite Hilbert p-class field towers. Such a K_0 can be taken as an extension of a cyclotomic function field \mathbb{F}_q(t)(\lambda_{\mathfrak{p}^m}) for a certain regular prime \mathfrak{p} in \mathbb{F}_q[t].
