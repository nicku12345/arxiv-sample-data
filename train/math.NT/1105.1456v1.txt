Let p be a prime number, p=2^nq+1, where q is odd. D. Shanks described an algorithm to compute square roots \pmod{p} which needs O(\log q + n^2) modular multiplications. In this note we describe two modifications of this algorithm. The first needs only O(\log q + n^{3/2}) modular multiplications, while the second is a parallel algorithm which needs n processors and takes O(\log q+n) time.
