In this paper we develop some of the ideas belonging to W.Schmidt and L.Summerer to define intermediate Diophantine exponents and split Dyson's transference inequality into a chain of inequalities for intermediate exponents. This splitting generalizes the analogous result of M.Laurent and Y.Bugeaud for Khintchine's transference inequalities.
