We prove the compatibility at places dividing l of the local and global Langlands correspondences for the l-adic Galois representations associated to regular algebraic essentially (conjugate) self-dual cuspidal automorphic representations of GL_n over an imaginary CM or totally real field. We prove this compatibility up to semisimplification in all cases, and up to Frobenius semisimplification in the case of Shin-regular weight.
