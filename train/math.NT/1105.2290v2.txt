Given an indefinite binary quaternionic Hermitian form f with coefficients in a maximal order of a definite quaternion algebra over \mathbb Q, we give a precise asymptotic equivalent to the number of nonequivalent representations, satisfying some congruence properties, of the rational integers with absolute value at most s by f, as s tends to +\infty. We compute the volumes of hyperbolic 5-manifolds constructed by quaternions using Eisenstein series. In the Appendix, V. Emery computes these volumes using Prasad's general formula. We use hyperbolic geometry in dimension 5 to describe the reduction theory of both definite and indefinite binary quaternionic Hermitian forms.
