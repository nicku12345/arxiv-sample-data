We study the value distribution of the Epstein zeta function E_n(L,s) for 0<s<\frac{n}{2} and a random lattice L of large dimension n. For any fixed c\in(1/4,1/2) and n\to\infty, we prove that the random variable V_n^{-2c}E_n(\cdot,cn) has a limit distribution, which we give explicitly (here V_n is the volume of the n-dimensional unit ball). More generally, for any fixed \ve>0 we determine the limit distribution of the random function c\mapsto V_n^{-2c}E_n(\cdot,cn), c\in[1/4 +\ve, 1/2-\ve]. After compensating for the pole at c=\frac12 we even obtain a limit result on the whole interval [\frac14+\ve,\frac12], and as a special case we deduce the following strengthening of a result by Sarnak and Str\"ombergsson concerning the height function h_n(L) of the flat torus \R^n/L: The random variable n\big\{h_n(L)-(\log(4\pi)-\gamma+1)\big\}+\log n has a limit distribution as n\to\infty, which we give explicitly. Finally we discuss a question posed by Sarnak and Str\"ombergsson as to whether there exists a lattice L\subset\R^n for which E_n(L,s) has no zeros in (0,\infty).
