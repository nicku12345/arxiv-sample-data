Let S be a sphere in R^n such that S\capQ^n\neq\emptyset and let Cl denote the closure operator in the Euclidean topology of R^n. If the center of S is in Q^n, then Cl(S\capQ^n) is S, as is easily proved. If the center of S is not in Q^n, then what is Cl(S\capQ^n)? This question, which was answered partially in the author's paper [Proc. Japan Acad. Ser. A Math. Sci. 80 (2004), no. 7, 146--149], is answered completely in this paper by representing Cl(S\capQ^n) in terms of the group of Q-automorphisms of the algebraic closure of Q(\gamma_1,...,\gamma_n) in C, where \gamma_1,...,\gamma_n denote the coordinates of the center of S.
