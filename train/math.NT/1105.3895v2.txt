We present a new result on counting primes p<N=2^n for which r (arbitrarily placed) digits in the binary expansion of p are specified. Compared with earlier work of Harman and Katai, the restriction on r is relaxed to r< c\Big(\frac n{\log n}\Big)^{4/7}. This condition results from the estimates of Gallagher and Iwaniec on zero-free regions of L-functions with `powerful' conductor.
