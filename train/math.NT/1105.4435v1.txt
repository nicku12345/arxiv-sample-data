We prove that there are only finitely many complex numbers a and b with 4a^3+27b^2\not=0 such that the three points (1,*),(2,*), and (3,*) are simultaneously torsion on the elliptic curve defined in Weierstrass form by y^2=x^3+ax+b. This gives an affirmative answer to a question raised by Masser and Zannier. We thus confirm a special case in two dimensions of the relative Manin-Mumford Conjecture formulated by Pink and Masser-Zannier.
