The conjecture of Leopoldt states that the p - adic regulator of a number field does not vanish. It was proved for the abelian case in 1967 by Brumer, using Baker theory. We prove this conjecture for CM number fields \K. The proof uses Iwasawa's methods -- especially Takagi Theory -- for deriving his skew symmetric pairing, together with Kummer- and Class Field Theory.
