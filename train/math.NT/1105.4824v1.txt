For an even integer k, let r_{2k}(n) be the number of representations of n as a sum of 2k squares. The quantity r_{2k}(n) is appoximated by the classical singular series \rho_{2k}(n) \asymp n^{k-1}. Deligne's bound on the Fourier coefficients of Hecke eigenforms gives that r_{2k}(n) = \rho_{2k}(n) + O(d(n) n^{\frac{k-1}{2}}). We determine the optimal implied constant in this estimate provided that either k/2 or n is odd. The proof requires a delicate positivity argument involving Petersson inner products.
