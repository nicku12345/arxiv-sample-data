In this paper we deal with Drinfeld modular forms, defined and taking values in complete fields of positive characteristic. Our aim is to study a sequence of families of Drinfeld modular forms depending on a parameter t that produces, for certain values of t, several kinds of Eisenstein series considered by Gekeler. We obtain formulas involving these functions. To obtain our results, we introduce and discuss tau-linear recurrent sequences and deformations of vectorial modular forms in this setting.
