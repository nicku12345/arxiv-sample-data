This paper is a sequel to our previous paper arXiv:1105.1554, where we defined two types of intermediate Diophantine exponents, connected them to Schmidt exponents and split Dyson's transference inequality into a chain of inequalities for intermediate exponents. Here we present splitting of some other transference inequalities involving both regular and uniform Diophantine exponents.
