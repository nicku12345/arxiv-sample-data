We first show a deterministic algorithm for taking r-th roots over \F_q without being given any r-th nonresidue, where \F_q is a finite field with q elements and r is a small prime such that r^2 divides of q-1. As applications, we illustrate deterministic algorithms over \F_q for constructing r-th nonresidues, constructing primitive elements, solving polynomial equations and computing elliptic curve "n-th roots", and a deterministic primality test for the generalized Proth numbers. All algorithms are proved without assuming any unproven hypothesis. They are efficient only if all the factors of q-1 are small and some primitive roots of unity can be constructed efficiently over \F_q. In some cases, they are the fastest among the known deterministic algorithms.
