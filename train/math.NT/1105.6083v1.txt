Let k denote an algebraically closed field. We revisit a construction of the author of families of elliptic curves over the rational function field k(t). Combining a combinatorial analysis with a rank formula of Ulmer we prove that, for all but finitely many families of these curves, the Mordell-Weil groups over k(t^{1/d}) have rank zero, as d ranges over positive integers prime to the characteristic of k.
