We present an accelerated Schoof-type point-counting algorithm for curves of genus 2 equipped with an efficiently computable real multiplication endomorphism. Our new algorithm reduces the complexity of genus 2 point counting over a finite field (\F_{q}) of large characteristic from (\widetilde{O}(\log^8 q)) to (\widetilde{O}(\log^5 q)). Using our algorithm we compute a 256-bit prime-order Jacobian, suitable for cryptographic applications, and also the order of a 1024-bit Jacobian.
