Let k be a finite field extension of the function field \bfF_p(T) and \bar{k} its algebraic closure. We count points in projective space \Bbb P ^{n-1}(\bar{k}) with given height and of fixed degree d over the field k. If n>2d+3 we derive an asymptotic estimate for their number as the height tends to infinity. As an application we also deduce asymptotic estimates for certain decomposable forms.
