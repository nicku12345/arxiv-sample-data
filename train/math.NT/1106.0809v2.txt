We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a few classes of known circulant graphs and/or digraphs to be singular. The above graph classes are generalized to (r,s,t)-digraphs for non-negative integers r,s and t, and the digraph C_n^{i,j,k,l}, with certain restrictions. We also obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the digraphs C_n^{i,j,k,l} to be singular. Some necessary conditions are given under which the (r,s,t)-digraphs are singular.
