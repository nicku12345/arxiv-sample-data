We derive a lower bound for a second moment of the reciprocal of the derivative of the Riemann zeta-function averaged over the zeros of the zeta-function that is half the size of the conjectured value. Our result is conditional upon the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis and the conjecture that the zeros of the zeta-function are simple.
