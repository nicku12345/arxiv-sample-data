Let k be a number field, f(x)\in k[x] a polynomial over k with f(0)\neq 0, and \O_{k,S}^* the group of S-units of k, where S is an appropriate finite set of places of k. In this note, we prove that outside of some natural exceptional set T\subset \O_{k,S}^*, the prime ideals of \O_k dividing f(u), u\in \O_{k,S}^*\setminus T, mostly have degree one over \Q; that is, the corresponding residue fields have degree one over the prime field. We also formulate a conjectural analogue of this result for rational points on an elliptic curve over a number field, and deduce our conjecture from Vojta's Conjecture. We prove this conjectural analogue in certain cases when the elliptic curve has complex multiplication.
