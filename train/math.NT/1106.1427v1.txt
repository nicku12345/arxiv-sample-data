This paper contains a proof of a conjecture of Breuil and Schneider, on the existence of an invariant norm on any locally algebraic representation of \GL(n), with integral central character, whose smooth part is given by a generalized Steinberg representation. In fact, we prove the analogue for any connected reductive group G. This is done by passing to a global setting, using the trace formula for an \R-anisotropic model of G. The ultimate norm comes from classical p-adic modular forms.
