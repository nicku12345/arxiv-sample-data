Let \K be a finite extension of a characteristic zero field \F. We say that the pair of n\times n matrices (A,B) over \F represents \K if \K \cong \F[A]/< B > where \F[A] denotes the smallest subalgebra of M_n(\F) containing A and < B > is an ideal in \F[A] generated by B. In particular, A is said to represent the field \K if there exists an irreducible polynomial q(x)\in \F[x] which divides the minimal polynomial of A and \K \cong \F[A]/< q(A) >. In this paper, we identify the smallest circulant-matrix representation for any subfield of a cyclotomic field. Furthermore, if p is any prime and \K is a subfield of the p-th cyclotomic field, then we obtain a zero-one circulant matrix A of size p\times p such that (A,\J) represents \K, where \J is the matrix with all entries 1. In case, the integer n has at most two distinct prime factors, we find the smallest 0-1 companion-matrix that represents the n-th cyclotomic field. We also find bounds on the size of such companion matrices when n has more than two prime factors.
