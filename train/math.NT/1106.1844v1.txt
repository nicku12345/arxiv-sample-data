For a real number x, \| x\| = \min \{|x-p|: p\in Z\} is the distance of x to the nearest integer. We say that two real numbers \theta, \theta' are \pm equivalent if their sum or difference is an integer. Let \theta be irrational and put \[\phi(\theta) = \inf \{q \,\| q \theta\| : q \in N \}. \] We will prove: If \phi(\theta)> 1/3, then \theta is \pm equivalent to a root of f_m (x,1) = 0, where f_m is a Markoff form. Conversely, if \theta is \pm equivalent to a root of f_m(x,1)=0, then \[\phi(\theta) = m \| m\theta \| = \frac{2}{3+\sqrt{9-4m^{-2}}} > 1/3. \]
