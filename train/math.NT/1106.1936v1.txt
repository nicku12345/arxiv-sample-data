We study the asymptotic growth of the p-primary component of the Shafarevich-Tate group in the cyclotomic direction at any odd prime of good supersingular reduction, generalizing work of Kobayashi. This explains formulas obtained by Kurihara, Perrin-Riou, and Nasybullin in terms of Iwasawa invariants of modified Selmer groups.
