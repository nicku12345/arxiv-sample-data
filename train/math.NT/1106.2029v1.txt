In 1960, Sierpi\'nski proved that there exist infinitely many odd positive integers k such that k\cdot 2^n+1 is composite for all positive integers n. In this paper, we prove some generalizations of Sierpi\'nski's theorem with 2^n replaced by expressions involving certain Lucas sequences U_n(\alpha,\beta). In particular, we show the existence of infinitely many Lucas pairs (\alpha,\beta), for which there exist infinitely many positive integers k, such that k (U_n(\alpha,\beta)+(\alpha-\beta)^2)+1 is composite for all integers n\ge 1. Sierpi\'nski's theorem is the special case of \alpha=2 and \beta=1. Finally, we establish a nonlinear version of this result by showing that there exist infinitely many rational integers \alpha>1, for which there exist infinitely many positive integers k, such that k^2 (U_n(\alpha,1)+(\alpha-1)^2)+1 is composite for all integers n\ge 1.
