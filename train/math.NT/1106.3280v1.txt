We consider the following two closed sets in C^n. One is the diagonal D given by  (z, z, z,...z_). The other is A = \{(z_1,z_2,z_3,...z_n):. .e^{z_1} + e^{z_2} +e^{z_3} +...+ e^{z_n}=0\}. Clearly D \cap A is empty. One can ask what is the distance between them.   In this connection, Stolarsky [1] proved that the distance d is given by d^2 = (\log \ n)^2 + O (1). Some simple calculations will make one believe that the point (k, 0, 0,..0) with k = \log \ (n-1) + \pi i which lies on A is one of the closest point to the diagaonal. We prove that this is indeed the case, atleast for sufficiently large n. This gives d^2 = |k|^2 (1-1/n).
