We study the rank of the p-Selmer group Sel_p(A/k) of an abelian variety A/k, where k is a function field. If K/k is a quadratic extension and F/k is a dihedral extension and the \mathbb{Z}_p-corank of Sel_p (A/K) is odd, we show that the \mathbb{Z}_p-corank of Sel_p(A/F) \geq [F:K]. The result uses the theory of local constants developed by Mazur-Rubin for elliptic curves over number fields.
