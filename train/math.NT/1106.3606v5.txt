From a result of Waldspurger, it is known that the normalized Fourier coefficients a(m) of a half-integral weight holomorphic cusp eigenform \f are, up to a finite set of factors, one of \pm \sqrt{L(1/2, f, \chi_m)} when m is square-free and f is the integral weight cusp form related to \f by the Shimura correspondence. In this paper we address a question posed by Kohnen: which square root is a(m)? In particular, if we look at the set of a(m) with m square-free, do these Fourier coefficients change sign infinitely often? By partially analytically continuing a related Dirichlet series, we are able to show that this is so.
