We construct a p-adic Eisenstein measure with values in the space of p-adic automorphic forms on certain unitary groups. Using this measure, we p-adically interpolate certain special values of both holomorphic and non-holomorphic Eisenstein series, as both the archimedean and the p-adic weights of the Eisenstein series vary.
