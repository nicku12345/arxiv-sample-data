In 2007, Tachiya gave necessary and sufficient conditions for the transcendence of certain infinite products involving Fibonacci numbers F_k and Lucas numbers L_k. In the present note, we explicitly evaluate two classes of his algebraic examples. Special cases are\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1+\frac{1}{F_{2^n+1}})=\frac{3}{\phi}, \qquad \prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1+\frac{1}{L_{2^n+1}})=3-\phi\, ,where \phi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2 is the golden ratio.
