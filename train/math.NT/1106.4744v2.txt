We obtain a new upper bound for \sum_{h\le H}\Delta_k(N,h) for 1\le H\le N, k\in \N, k\ge3, where \Delta_k(N,h) is the (expected) error term in the asymptotic formula for \sum_{N < n\le2N}d_k(n)d_k(n+h), and d_k(n) is the divisor function generated by \zeta(s)^k. When k=3 the result improves, for H\ge N^{1/2}, the bound given in the recent work \cite{[1]} of Baier, Browning, Marasingha and Zhao, who dealt with the case k=3.
