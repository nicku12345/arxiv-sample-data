Let X_0^{\star}(k,n,s) denote the sum of all multiple zeta-star values of weight k, depth n and height s. Kaneko and Ohno conjecture that for any positive integers m,n,s with m,n\geqslant s, the difference (-1)^mX_0^{\star}(m+n+1,n+1,s)-(-1)^nX_0^{\star}(m+n+1,m+1,s) can be expressed as a polynomial of zeta values with rational coefficients. We give a proof of this conjecture in this paper.
