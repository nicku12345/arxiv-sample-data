In this work, we consider the rational points on elliptic curves over finite fields F_{p}. We give results concerning the number of points on the elliptic curve y^2{\equiv}x^3+a^3(mod p)where p is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 6. Also some results are given on the sum of abscissae of these points. We give the number of solutions to y^2{\equiv}x^3+a^3(modp), also given in ([1], p.174), this time by means of the quadratic residue character, in a different way, by using the cubic residue character. Using the Weil conjecture, one can generalize the results concerning the number of points in F_{p} to F_{p^{r}}.
