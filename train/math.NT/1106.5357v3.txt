We prove a simple explicit formula for the local Katz-Radon transform of an l-adic representation of the Galois group of the fraction field of a strictly henselian discrete valuation ring with positive residual characteristic, which can be defined as the local additive convolution with a fixed tame character. The formula is similar to one proved by D. Arinkin in the D-module setting, and answers a question posed by N. Katz.
