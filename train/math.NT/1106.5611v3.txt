Let \pi be the automorphic representation of \GSp_4(\A) generated by a full level cuspidal Siegel eigenform that is not a Saito-Kurokawa lift, and \tau be an arbitrary cuspidal, automorphic representation of \GL_2(\A). Using Furusawa's integral representation for \GSp_4\times\GL_2 combined with a pullback formula involving the unitary group \GU(3,3), we prove that the L-functions L(s,\pi\times\tau) are "nice". The converse theorem of Cogdell and Piatetski-Shapiro then implies that such representations \pi have a functorial lifting to a cuspidal representation of \GL_4(\A). Combined with the exterior-square lifting of Kim, this also leads to a functorial lifting of \pi to a cuspidal representation of \GL_5(\A). As an application, we obtain analytic properties of various L-functions related to full level Siegel cusp forms. We also obtain special value results for \GSp_4\times\GL_1 and \GSp_4\times\GL_2.
