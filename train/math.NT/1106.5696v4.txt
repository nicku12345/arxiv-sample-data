We prove a non-trivial result for the,say,modified Selberg integral \modSel_3(N,h), of the divisor function d_3(n):= \sum_{a}\sum_{b}\sum_{c, abc=n}1; this integral is a slight modification of the corresponding Selberg integral, that gives the expected value of the function in short intervals. We get, in fact, \modSel_3(N,h)\ll Nh^2L^2, where L:=\log N; furthermore, as a byproduct, we obtain indications on the way in which it may be proved the weak sixth moment of the Riemann zeta function.(This was OLD abstract)
