We study an analog of Serre's conjecture over imaginary quadratic fields. In particular, we ask whether the weight recipe of Buzzard, Diamond and Jarvis will hold in this setting. Using a program written by the author, we provide computational evidence that this is in fact the case. In order to justify the method used in the program, we prove that a modular symbols method will work for arbitrary weights over imaginary quadratic fields.
