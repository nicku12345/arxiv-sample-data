A hypothesis is put forward regarding the function \pi_2(x) which describes the distribution of twin primes in the set of natural numbers. The function \pi_2(x) is tested by evaluation and an empirical \pi_2^{\ast}(x) is arrived at, which is shown to be highly accurate. Several other questions are also addressed.
