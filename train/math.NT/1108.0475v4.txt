In 1845, Bertrand conjectured that for all integers x\ge2, there exists at least one prime in (x/2, x]. This was proved by Chebyshev in 1860, and then generalized by Ramanujan in 1919. He showed that for any n\ge1, there is a (smallest) prime R_n such that \pi(x)- \pi(x/2) \ge n for all x \ge R_n. In 2009 Sondow called R_n the nth Ramanujan prime and proved the asymptotic behavior R_n \sim p_{2n} (where p_m is the mth prime). In the present paper, we generalize the interval of interest by introducing a parameter c \in (0,1) and defining the nth c-Ramanujan prime as the smallest integer R_{c,n} such that for all x\ge R_{c,n}, there are at least n primes in (cx,x]. Using consequences of strengthened versions of the Prime Number Theorem, we prove that R_{c,n} exists for all n and all c, that R_{c,n} \sim p_{\frac{n}{1-c}} as n\to\infty, and that the fraction of primes which are c-Ramanujan converges to 1-c. We then study finer questions related to their distribution among the primes, and see that the c-Ramanujan primes display striking behavior, deviating significantly from a probabilistic model based on biased coin flipping; this was first observed by Sondow, Nicholson, and Noe in the case c = 1/2. This model is related to the Cramer model, which correctly predicts many properties of primes on large scales, but has been shown to fail in some instances on smaller scales.
