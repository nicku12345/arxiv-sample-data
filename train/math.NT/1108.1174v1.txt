In this paper we prove that for any prime p\ge 11 holds    {2p-1\choose p-1}\equiv 1 -2p \sum_{k=1}^{p-1}\frac{1}{k} +4p^2\sum_{1\le i<j\le p-1}\frac{1}{ij}\pmod{p^7}.    This is a generalization of the famous Wolstenholme's theorem which asserts that {2p-1\choose p-1} \equiv 1 \,\,(\bmod\,\,p^3) for all primes p\ge 5. Our proof is elementary and it does not use a standard technique involving the classic formula for the power sums in terms of the Bernoulli numbers. Notice that the above congruence reduced modulo p^6, p^5 and p^4 yields related congruences obtained by R. Tauraso, J. Zhao and J.W.L. Glaisher, respectively.
