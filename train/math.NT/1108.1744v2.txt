Let K be a complete discrete valuation field of characteristic zero with residue field k_K of characteristic p>0. Let L/K be a finite Galois extension with Galois group G=\Gal(L/K) and suppose that the induced extension of residue fields k_L/k_K is separable. Let \mathbb{W}_n(\cdot) denote the ring of p-typical Witt vectors of length n. Hesselholt conjectured that the pro-abelian group \{H^1(G,\mathbb{W}_n(\mathcal{O}_L))\}_{n\geq 1} is isomorphic to zero. Hogadi and Pisolkar have recently provided a proof of this conjecture. In this paper, we provide an alternative proof of Hesselholt's conjecture which is simpler in several respects.
