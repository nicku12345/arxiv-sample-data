We give an explicit characterization of all minimal value set polynomials in \F_q[x] whose set of values is a subfield \F_{q'} of \F_{q}. We show that the set of such polynomials, together with the constants of \F_{q'}, is an \F_{q'}-vector space of dimension 2^{[\F_{q}:\F_{q'}]}. Our approach not only provides the exact number of such polynomials, but also yields a construction of new examples of minimal value set polynomials for some other fixed value sets. In the latter case, we also derive a non-trivial lower bound for the number of such polynomials.
