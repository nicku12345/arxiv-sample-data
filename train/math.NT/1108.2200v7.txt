In this paper, we show that the twisted partial exterior-square L-function has a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane with only two possible simple poles at s=1 and s=0. We do this by establishing the nonvanishing of the local zeta integrals defined by Jacquet and Shalika for any fixed s_0. The even case is treated in detail. The odd case is treated briefly, in which case, the L-function is shown to be entire.
