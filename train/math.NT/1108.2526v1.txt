We give a short determination of the distribution of the number of \F_q-rational points on a random trigonal curve over \F_q, in the limit as the genus of the curve goes to infinity. In particular, the expected number of points is q+2-\frac{1}{q^2+q+1}, contrasting with recent analogous results for cyclic p-fold covers of \mathbb P^1 and plane curves which have an expected number of points of q+1 (by work of Kurlberg, Rudnick, Bucur, David, Feigon and Lal\'in) and curves which are complete intersections which have an expected number of points <q+1 (by work of Bucur and Kedlaya). We also give a conjecture for the expected number of points on a random n-gonal curve with full S_n monodromy based on function field analogs of Bhargava's heuristics for counting number fields.
