Let \Bbb Z be the set of integers, and let (m,n) be the greatest common divisor of integers m and n. Let p\equiv 1\mod 4 be a prime, q\in\Bbb Z, 2\nmid q and p=c^2+d^2=x^2+qy^2 with c,d,x,y\in\Bbb Z and c\e 1\mod 4. Suppose that (c,x+d)=1 or (d,x+c) is a power of 2. In the paper, by using the quartic reciprocity law we determine q^{[p/8]}\mod p in terms of c,d,x and y, where [\cdot] is the greatest integer function. We also determine \big(\frac{b+\sqrt{b^2+4^{\alpha}}}2\big)^{\frac{p-1}4}\mod p for odd b and (2a+\sqrt{4a^2+1})^{\f{p-1}4}\mod p for a\in\Bbb Z. As applications we obtain the congruence for U_{\f{p-1}4}\mod p and the criterion for p\mid U_{\frac{p-1}8} (if p\equiv 1\mod 8), where \{U_n\} is the Lucas sequence given by U_0=0,\ U_1=1 and U_{n+1}=bU_n+U_{n-1}\ (n\ge 1), and b\not\equiv 2\mod 4. Hence we partially solve some conjectures posed by the author in two previous papers.
