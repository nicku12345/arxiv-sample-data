We study the groups in the unit filtration of a finite abelian extension K of the field of p-adic numbers. We determine explicit generators of these groups as modules over the pro-p group ring of the Galois group of K over the p-adic numbers. We work in eigenspaces for powers of the Teichmueller character, first at the level of the field of norms for the extension of K by p-power roots of unity and then at the level of K.
