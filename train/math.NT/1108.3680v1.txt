For any real x and any integer k\ge1, we say that a set \mathcal{D}_{k} of k distinct integers is a k-tuple jumping champion if it is the most common differences that occurs among k+1 consecutive primes less than or equal to x. For k=1, it's known as the jumping champion introduced by J. H. Conway. In 1999 A. Odlyzko, M. Rubinstein, and M. Wolf announced the Jumping Champion Conjecture that the jumping champions greater than 1 are 4 and the primorials 2, 6, 30, 210, 2310,.... They also made a weaker and possibly more accessible conjecture that any fixed prime p divides all sufficiently large jumping champions. These two conjectures were proved by Goldston and Ledoan under the assumption of appropriate forms of the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture recently. In the present paper we consider the situation for any k\ge2 and prove that any fixed prime p divides every element of all sufficiently large k-tuple jumping champions under the assumption that the Hardy-Littlewood prime k+1-tuple conjecture holds uniformly for \mathcal{D}_k\subset[2,\log^{k+1}x]. With a stronger form of the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture, we also proved that, for any sufficiently large k-tuple jumping champion, the gcd of elements in it is square-free.
