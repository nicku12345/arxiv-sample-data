We show that the twisted traces of CM values of weak Maass forms of weight 0 are Fourier coefficients of vector valued weak Maass forms of weight 3/2. These results generalize work by Zagier on traces of singular moduli. We utilize a twisted version of the theta lift considered by Bruinier and Funke.
