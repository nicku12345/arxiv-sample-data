A prime number p is said to be a Wolstenholme prime if it satisfies the congruence {2p-1\choose p-1} \equiv 1 \,\,(\bmod{\,\,p^4}). For such a prime p, we establish the expression for {2p-1\choose p-1}\,\,(\bmod{\,\,p^8}) given in terms of the sums R_i:=\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}1/k^i (i=1,2,3,4,5,6). Further, the expression in this congruence is reduced in terms of the sums R_i (i=1,3,4,5). Using this congruence, we prove that for any Wolstenholme prime,  {2p-1\choose p-1}\equiv 1 -2p \sum_{k=1}^{p-1}\frac{1}{k} -2p^2\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}\frac{1}{k^2}\pmod{p^7}.    Moreover, using a recent result of the author \cite{Me}, we prove that the above congruence implies that a prime p necessarily must be a Wolstenholme prime.   Applying a technique of Helou and Terjanian \cite{HT}, the above congruence is given as the expression involving the Bernoulli numbers.
