We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the integrality of the Taylor coefficients at the origin of formal power series q_i({\mathbf z})=z_i\exp(G_i({\mathbf z})/F({\mathbf z})), with {\mathbf z}=(z_1,...,z_d) and where F({\mathbf z}) and G_i({\mathbf z})+\log(z_i)F({\mathbf z}), i=1,...,d are particular solutions of certain A-systems of differential equations. This criterion is based on the analytical properties of Landau's function (which is classically associated with the sequences of factorial ratios) and it generalizes the criterion in the case of one variable presented in "Crit\`ere pour l'int\'egralit\'e des coefficients de Taylor des applications miroir" [J. Reine Angew. Math.]. One of the techniques used to prove this criterion is a generalization of a version of a theorem of Dwork on the formal congruences between formal series, proved by Krattenthaler and Rivoal in "Multivariate p-adic formal congruences and integrality of Taylor coefficients of mirror maps" [arXiv:0804.3049v3, math.NT]. This criterion involves the integrality of the Taylor coefficients of new univariate mirror maps listed in "Tables of Calabi--Yau equations" [arXiv:math/0507430v2, math.AG] by Almkvist, van Enckevort, van Straten and Zudilin.
