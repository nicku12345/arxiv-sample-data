Let  F be an imaginary quadratic field and \mathcal{O} its ring of integers. Let  \mathfrak{n} \subset \mathcal{O}  be a non-zero ideal and let  p> 5 be a rational inert prime in F and coprime with \mathfrak{n}. Let  V be an irreducible finite dimensional representation of  \bar{\mathbb{F}}_{p}[{\rm GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{p^2})]. We establish that a system of Hecke eigenvalues appearing in the cohomology with coefficients in  V already lives in the cohomology with coefficients in  \bar{\mathbb{F}}_{p}\otimes det^e for some  e \geq 0; except possibly in some few cases.
