We study relations between the multizeta values for function fields introduced by D. Thakur. The product \zeta(a)\zeta(b) is a linear combination of multizeta values. For q=2, a full conjectural description of how the product of two zeta values can be described as the sum of multizetas was given by Thakur. The recursion part of this recipe was generalized by the author. In this paper, the main conjecture formulated by the author, as well as some conjectures of Thakur are proved. Moreover, for general q, we prove closed formulas as well as a recursive recipe to express \zeta(a)\zeta(b) as a sum of multizeta values.
