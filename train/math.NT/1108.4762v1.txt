We investigate the properties of arithmetic differentiation, an attempt to adapt the notion of differentiation to the integers by preserving the Leibniz rule, (ab)' = a'b + ab'. This has proved to be a very rich topic with many different aspects and implications to other fields of mathematics and specifically to various unproven conjectures in additive prime number theory. Our paper consists of a self-contaited introduction to the topic, along with a couple of new theorems, several of them related to arithmetic differentiation of rational numbers, a topic almost unexplored until now.
