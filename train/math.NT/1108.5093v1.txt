We construct a binary linear code C(O(3,q)), associated with the orthogonal group O(3,q). Here q is a power of two. Then we obtain a recursive formula for the odd power moments of Kloosterman sums with trace one arguments in terms of the frequencies of weights in the codes C(O(3,q)) and C(Sp(2,q)). This is done via Pless power moment identity and by utilizing the explicit expressions of Gauss sums for the orthogonal groups.
