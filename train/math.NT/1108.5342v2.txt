Under certain plausible assumptions, M. Rubinstein and P. Sarnak solved the Shanks--R\'enyi race problem, by showing that the set of real numbers x\geq 2 such that \pi(x;q,a_1)>\pi(x;q,a_2)>...>\pi(x;q,a_r) has a positive logarithmic density \delta_{q;a_1,...,a_r}. Furthermore, they established that if r is fixed, \delta_{q;a_1,...,a_r}\to 1/r! as q\to \infty. In this paper, we investigate the size of these densities when the number of contestants r tends to infinity with q. In particular, we deduce a strong form of a recent conjecture of A. Feuerverger and G. Martin which states that \delta_{q;a_1,...,a_r}=o(1) in this case. Among our results, we prove that \delta_{q;a_1,...,a_r}\sim 1/r! in the region r=o(\sqrt{\log q}) as q\to\infty. We also bound the order of magnitude of these densities beyond this range of r. For example, we show that when \log q\leq r\leq \phi(q), \delta_{q;a_1,...,a_r}\ll_{\epsilon} q^{-1+\epsilon}.
