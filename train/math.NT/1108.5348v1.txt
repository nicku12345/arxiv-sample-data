The problem of constructing a perfect cuboid is related to a certain class of univariate polynomials with three integer parameters a, b, and u. Their irreducibility over the ring of integers under certain restrictions for a, b, and u would mean the non-existence of perfect cuboids. This irreducibility is conjectured and then verified numerically for approximately 10000 instances of a, b, and u.
