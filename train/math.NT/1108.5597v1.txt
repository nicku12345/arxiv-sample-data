Let G be a wreath product of the form C_2 \wr H, where C_2 is the cyclic group of order 2. Under mild conditions for H we determine the asymptotic behavior of the counting functions for number fields K/k with Galois group G and bounded discriminant. Those counting functions grow linearly with the norm of the discriminant and this result coincides with a conjecture of Malle. Up to a constant factor these groups have the same asymptotic behavior as the conjectured one for symmetric groups.
