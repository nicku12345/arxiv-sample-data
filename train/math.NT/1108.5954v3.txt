In this paper, we define a two-variable analogue of Perrin-Riou's p-adic regulator map for the Iwasawa cohomology of a crystalline representation of the absolute Galois group of \mathbf{Q}_p, over a Galois extension of \mathbf{Q}_p whose Galois group is an abelian p-adic Lie group of dimension 2.   We use this regulator map to study p-adic representations of global Galois groups over certain abelian extensions of number fields whose localisation at the primes above p are extensions of the above type. In the example of the restriction to an imaginary quadratic field of the representation attached to a modular form, we formulate a conjecture on the existence of a "zeta element", whose image under the regulator map is a p-adic L-function. We show that this conjecture implies the known properties of the 2-variable p-adic L-functions constructed by Perrin-Riou and Kim.
