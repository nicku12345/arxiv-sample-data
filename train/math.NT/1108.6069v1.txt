In this article we will describe a surprising observation that occurred in the construction of quadratic unramified extensions of a family of pure cubic number fields. Attempting to find an explanation will lead us on a magical mystery tour through the land of pure cubic number fields, Hilbert class fields, and elliptic curves.
