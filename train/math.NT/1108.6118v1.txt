Let T_o(k) denote the number of solutions of \sum_{i=1}^k\frac 1{x_i}=1 in odd numbers 1<x_1<x_2<...<x_k. It is clear that T_o(2k)=0. For distinct primes p_1, p_2,..., p_t, let S(p_1, p_2,..., p_t)=\{p_1^{\alpha_1}...p_t^{\alpha_t}\mid \alpha_i\in \mathbb{N}_0, i=1,2,..., t}. Let T_k(p_1,..., p_t) be the number of solutions \sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac 1{x_i}=1 with 1<x_1<x_2<...<x_{k} and x_i\in S(p_1, p_2,..., p_t). It is clear that if T_k(p_1,..., p_t)\not= 0 for some k, then the inverse sum of all elements s_j>1 in S(p_1, p_2,..., p_t) is more than 1.   In this paper we study T_o(k) and T_k(p_1,..., p_t). Three of our results are:   1) T_o(2k+1)\ge (\sqrt 2)^{(k+1)(k-4)} for all k\ge 4;   2) if the inverse sum of all elements s_j>1 in S(p_1, p_2,..., p_t) is more than 1, then T_k(p_1,..., p_t)\not= 0 for infinitely many k and the set of these k is the union of finitely many arithmetic progressions;   3) there exists two constants k_0=k_0(p_1,..., p_t)>1 and c=c(p_1,..., p_t)>1 such that for any k>k_0 we have either T_k(p_1,..., p_t)= 0 or T_k(p_1,..., p_t)>c^k.
