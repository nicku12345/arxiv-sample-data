The existence of a Landau-Siegel zero leads to the Deuring-Heilbronn phenomenon, here appearing in the 1-level density in a family of quadratic twists of a fixed genus character L-function. We obtain explicit lower order terms describing the vertical distribution of the zeros, and realize the influence of the Landau-Siegel zero as a resonance phenomenon.
