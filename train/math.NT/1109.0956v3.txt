This article deals with a conjecture generalizing the second case of Fermat's Last Theorem, called SFLT2 conjecture: {\it Let p>3 be a prime, K:=\Q(\zeta) the pth cyclotomic field and \Z_K its ring of integers. The diophantine equation (u+v\zeta)\Z_K=\mk w_1^p, with u,v\in\Z\backslash\{0\} coprime, uv\equiv 0 \bmod p and \mk w_1 ideal of \Z_K, has no solution.} Assuming that SFLT2 fails for (p,u,v), let q be an odd prime not dividing uv, n the order of \frac{v}{u}\bmod q, \xi a primitive nth root of unity and M:=\Q(\xi,\zeta). The aim of this complement of the article [GQ] of G. Gras and R. Qu\^eme on the same topic, is to exhibit some strong properties of the decomposition of the primes \mk Q of \Z_M over q in certain Kummer p-extensions of the field M, to derive from them a weak conjecture which implies that the SFLT2 equation can always take the reduced form u+\zeta v\in K^{\times p} and to set a conjecture implying SFLT2.
