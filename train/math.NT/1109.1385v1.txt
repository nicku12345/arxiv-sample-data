If  \Delta(x) \;:=\; \sum_{n\leqslant x}c_n - Cx\qquad(C>0)  denotes the error term in the classical Rankin-Selberg problem, then we obtain a non-trivial upper bound for the mean square of \Delta(x+U) - \Delta(x) for a certain range of U = U(X). In particular, under the Lindel\"of hypothesis for \zeta(s), it is shown that  \int_X^{2X} \Bigl(\Delta(x+U)-\Delta(x)\Bigr)^2\,{\roman d} x \;\ll_\epsilon\; X^{9/7+\epsilon}U^{8/7},  while under the Lindel\"of hypothesis for the Rankin-Selberg zeta-function the integral is bounded by X^{1+\epsilon}U^{4/3}. An analogous result for the discrete second moment of \Delta(x+U)-\Delta(x) also holds.
