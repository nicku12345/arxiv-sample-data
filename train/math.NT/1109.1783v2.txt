We consider the logarithm of the central value \log L(1/2) in the orthogonal family {L(s,f)}_{f \in H_k} where H_k is the set of weight k Hecke-eigen cusp form for SL_2(\mathbb{Z}), and in the symplectic family {L(s,\chi_{8d})}_{d \asymp D} where \chi_{8d} is the real character associated to fundamental discriminant 8d. Unconditionally, we prove that the two distributions are asymptotically bounded above by Gaussian distributions, in the first case of mean -\frac{1}{2} \log \log k and variance \log \log k, and in the second case of mean \frac{1}{2}\log \log D and variance \log \log D. Assuming both the Riemann and Zero Density Hypotheses in these families we obtain the full normal law in both families, confirming a conjecture of Keating and Snaith.
