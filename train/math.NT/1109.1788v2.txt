Let L(s,\chi) be a fixed Dirichlet L-function. Given a vertical arithmetic progression of T points on the line \Re(s)=1/2, we show that \gg T \log T of them are not zeros of L(s,\chi). This result provides some theoretical evidence towards the conjecture that all ordinates of zeros of Dirichlet L-functions are linearly independent over the rationals. We also establish an upper bound (depending upon the progression) for the first member of the arithmetic progression that is not a zero of L(s,\chi).
