In this article, we continue with our investigation of the Diophantine equation \frac{a}n=\frac1x+\frac1y and in particular its number of solutions R(n;a) for fixed a. We prove a couple of mean value theorems for the second moment (R(n;a))^2 and from which we deduce \log R(n;a) satisfies a certain Gaussian distribution with mean \log 3\log\log n and variance (log 3)^2\log\log n, which is an analog of the classical theorem of Erd\H os and Kac. And finally these results in all suggest that the behavior of R(n;a) resembles the divisor function d(n^2) in various aspects.
