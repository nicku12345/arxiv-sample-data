In this paper, after reviewing known results on functions over Bruhat-Tits trees and the theory of characteristic p valued modular forms, we present some structure of the tempered distributions on the projective space {\P1}(\bk_\infty) over a complete function field \bk_\infty of characteristic p, and calculate the characteristic p valued measure associated to the Drinfeld discriminant and the characteristic p valued measure associated to the Poinca\'e series.
