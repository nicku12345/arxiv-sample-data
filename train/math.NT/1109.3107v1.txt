Let \lambda (n) denote the Liouville function. Complementary to the prime number theorem, Chowla conjectured that \vspace{1mm} \noindent {\bf Conjecture (Chowla).} {\em \begin{equation} \label{a.1} \sum_{n\le x} \lambda (f(n)) =o(x) \end{equation} for any polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients which is not of form bg(x)^2. } \vspace{1mm} \noindent The prime number theorem is equivalent to \eqref{a.1} when f(x)=x. Chowla's conjecture is proved for linear functions but for the degree greater than 1, the conjecture seems to be extremely hard and still remains wide open. One can consider a weaker form of Chowla's conjecture, namely, \vspace{1mm} \noindent {\bf Conjecture 1 (Cassaigne, et al).} {\em If f(x) \in \Z [x] and is not in the form of bg^2(x) for some g(x)\in \Z[x], then \lambda (f(n)) changes sign infinitely often.}   Clearly, Chowla's conjecture implies Conjecture 1. Although it is weaker, Conjecture 1 is still wide open for polynomials of degree >1. In this article, we study Conjecture 1 for the quadratic polynomials. One of our main theorems is   {\bf Theorem 1.} {\em Let f(x) = ax^2+bx +c  with a>0 and l be a positive integer such that al is not a perfect square. Then if the equation f(n)=lm^2  has one solution (n_0,m_0) \in \Z^2, then it has infinitely many positive solutions (n,m) \in \N^2.}   As a direct consequence of Theorem 1, we prove some partial results of Conjecture 1 for quadratic polynomials are also proved by using Theorem 1.
