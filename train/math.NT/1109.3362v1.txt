We provide formulas for traces of p-th Hecke operators in level 1 in terms of values of finite field 2F1-hypergeometric functions, extending previous work of the author to all odd primes p, instead of only those p=1 (mod 12). We first give a general level 1 trace formula in terms of the trace of Frobenius on a family of elliptic curves, and then we draw on recent work of Lennon to produce level 1 trace formulas in terms of hypergeometric functions for all primes p >3.
