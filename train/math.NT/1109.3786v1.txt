The even weight period polynomial relations in the double shuffle Lie algebra \mathfrak{ds} were discovered by Ihara, and completely classified by the second author by relating them to restricted even period polynomials associated to cusp forms on \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}). In an article published in the same year, Gangl, Kaneko and Zagier displayed certain linear combinations of odd-component double zeta values which are equal to scalar multiples of simple zeta values in even weight, and also related them to restricted even period polynomials. In this paper, we relate the two sets of relations, showing how they can be deduced from each other by duality.
