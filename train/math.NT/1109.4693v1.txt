Let q = p^s be a power of a prime number p and let \mathbb{F}_q be the finite field with q elements. In this paper we obtain the explicit factorization of the cyclotomic polynomial \Phi_{2^nr} over \mathbb{F}_q where both r \geq 3 and q are odd, \gcd(q,r) = 1, and n\in \mathbb{N}. Previously, only the special cases when r = 1,\ 3,\ 5 had been achieved. For this we make the assumption that the explicit factorization of \Phi_r over \mathbb{F}_q is given to us as a known. Let n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}... p_s^{e_s} be the factorization of n \in \mathbb{N} into powers of distinct primes p_i,\ 1\leq i \leq s. In the case that the orders of q modulo all these prime powers p_i^{e_i} are pairwise coprime we show how to obtain the explicit factors of \Phi_{n} from the factors of each \Phi_{p_i^{e_i}}. We also demonstrate how to obtain the factorization of \Phi_{mn} from the factorization of \Phi_n when q is a primitive root modulo m and \gcd(m,n) = \gcd(\phi(m),\ord_n(q)) = 1. Here \phi is the Euler's totient function, and \ord_n(q) denotes the multiplicative order of q modulo n. Moreover, we present the construction of a new class of irreducible polynomials over \mathbb{F}_q and generalize a result due to Varshamov (1984) \cite{Varshamov}.
