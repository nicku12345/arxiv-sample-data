We establish an aysmptotic formula for the number of points with coordinates in \mb{F}_q[t] on a complete intersection of degree d defined over \mb{F}_q[t], with explicit error term, provided that the characteristic of \mb{F}_q is greater than d, the codimension of the singular locus of the complete intersection is large enough, and this intersection has a non-singular point at each place of \mb{F}_q[t]. In particular, when this complete intersection is non-singular, we show that it satisfies weak approximation.
