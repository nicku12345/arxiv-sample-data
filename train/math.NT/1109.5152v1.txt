For a fixed 1\le p<+\infty denote by \Vert\cdot\Vert_p the usual norm in the space l_p (or L_p). In this paper we prove that for all real numbers p and q such that 2\le p\le q holds    2(\Vert x\Vert_p^q+\Vert y\Vert_p^q)\le \Vert x+y\Vert_p^q +\Vert x-y\Vert_p^q    for all nonnegative sequences x=\{x_n\},y=\{y_n\} in l_p (or nonnegative functions x,y in L_p). Note that the above inequality with p=q\ge 2 reduces to the well known Clarkson's inequality. If in addition, holds x_i\ge y_i for each i=1,2,... (or x\ge y a.e. in L_p), then we establish an improvement of the above inequality.
