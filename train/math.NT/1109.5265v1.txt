In this paper, we compute irreducible components which appear in the stable reduction of the Lubin-Tate curve of level two, in the mixed characteristic case.   We also compute the action of the central division algebra of invariant 1/2, the action of {\rm GL}_2, and the inertia action explicitly. As a result, in a sense, we observe that, in the cohomology group of the stable reduction of the Lubin-Tate curve for {\rm GL}_2, the local Langlands correspondence and the local Jacquet-Langlands correspondence for {\rm GL}_2 are realized for the cuspidal representations of level 1 or 1/2.
