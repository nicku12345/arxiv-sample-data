In this paper we generalize the work of Harris-Soudry-Taylor and construct the compatible systems of two-dimensional Galois representations attached to cuspidal automorphic representations of cohomological type on GL_2 over a CM field with a suitable condition on their central characters. We also prove a local-global compatibility statement, up to semisimplification.
