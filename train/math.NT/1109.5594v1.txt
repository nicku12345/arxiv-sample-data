We study the representations of large integers n as sums p_1^2 + ... + p_s^2, where p_1,..., p_s are primes with | p_i - (n/s)^{1/2} | \le n^{\theta/2}, for some fixed \theta < 1. When s = 5 we use a sieve method to show that all sufficiently large integers n \equiv 5 \pmod {24} can be represented in the above form for \theta > 8/9. This improves on earlier work by Liu, L\"{u} and Zhan, who established a similar result for \theta > 9/10. We also obtain estimates for the number of integers n satisfying the necessary local conditions but lacking representations of the above form with s = 3, 4. When s = 4 our estimates improve and generalize recent results by L\"{u} and Zhai, and when s = 3 they appear to be first of their kind.
