Let E be an elliptic curve defined over the rationals without complex multiplication. The field F generated by all torsion points of E is an infinite, non-abelian Galois extension of the rationals which has unbounded, wild ramification above all primes. We prove that the absolute logarithmic Weil height of an element of F is either zero or bounded from below by a positive constant depending only on E. We also show that the N\'eron-Tate height has a similar gap on E(F) and use this to determine the structure of the group E(F).
