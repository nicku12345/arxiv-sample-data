Given elliptic modular forms f and g satisfying certain conditions on their weights and levels, we prove (a quantitative version of the statement) that there exist infinitely many imaginary quadratic fields K and characters chi of the ideal class group Cl_K such that L(1/2, f_K \times chi) \neq 0 and L(1/2, g_K \times chi) \neq 0. The proof is based on a non-vanishing result for Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms combined with the theory of Yoshida liftings.
