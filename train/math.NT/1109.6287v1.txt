Let A be an abelian variety defined over a number field K. If \mathfrak{p} is a prime of K of good reduction for A, let A(K)_\mathfrak{p} denote the image of the Mordell-Weil group via reduction modulo \mathfrak{p}. We prove in particular that the size of A(K)_\mathfrak{p}, by varying \mathfrak{p}, encodes enough information to determine the K-isogeny class of A, provided that the following necessary condition is satisfied: B(K) has positive rank for every non-trivial abelian subvariety B of A. This is the analogue to a result by Faltings of 1983 considering instead the Hasse-Weil zeta function of the special fibers A_\mathfrak{p}.
