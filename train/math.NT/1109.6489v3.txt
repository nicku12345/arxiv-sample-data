The function \epsilon(x)=\mbox{li}(x)-\pi(x) is known to be positive up to the (very large) Skewes' number. Besides, according to Robin's work, the functions \epsilon_{\theta}(x)=\mbox{li}[\theta(x)]-\pi(x) and \epsilon_{\psi}(x)=\mbox{li}[\psi(x)]-\pi(x) are positive if and only if Riemann hypothesis (RH) holds (the first and the second Chebyshev function are \theta(x)=\sum_{p \le x} \log p and \psi(x)=\sum_{n=1}^x \Lambda(n), respectively, \mbox{li}(x) is the logarithmic integral, \mu(n) and \Lambda(n) are the M\"obius and the Von Mangoldt functions). Negative jumps in the above functions \epsilon, \epsilon_{\theta} and \epsilon_{\psi} may potentially occur only at x+1 \in \mathcal{P} (the set of primes). One denotes j_p=\mbox{li}(p)-\mbox{li}(p-1) and one investigates the jumps j_p, j_{\theta(p)} and j_{\psi(p)}. In particular, j_p<1, and j_{\theta(p)}>1 for p<10^{11}. Besides, j_{\psi(p)}<1 for any odd p \in \mathcal{\mbox{Ch}}, an infinite set of so-called {\it Chebyshev primes } with partial list \{109, 113, 139, 181, 197, 199, 241, 271, 281, 283, 293, 313, 317, 443, 449, 461, 463, \ldots\}. We establish a few properties of the set \mathcal{\mbox{Ch}}, give accurate approximations of the jump j_{\psi(p)} and relate the derivation of \mbox{Ch} to the explicit Mangoldt formula for \psi(x). In the context of RH, we introduce the so-called {\it Riemann primes} as champions of the function \psi(p_n^l)-p_n^l (or of the function \theta(p_n^l)-p_n^l ). Finally, we find a {\it good} prime counting function S_N(x)=\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{\mu(n)}{n}\mbox{li}[\psi(x)^{1/n}], that is found to be much better than the standard Riemann prime counting function.
