We fix a maximal order \mathcal O in \F=\R,\C or \mathbb{H}, and an \F-hermitian form Q of signature (n,1) with coefficients in \mathcal O. Let k\in\N. By applying a lattice point theorem on the \F-hyperbolic space, we give an asymptotic formula with an error term, as t\to+\infty, for the number N_t(Q,-k) of integral solutions x\in\mathcal O^{n+1} of the equation Q[x]=-k satisfying |x_{n+1}|\leq t.
