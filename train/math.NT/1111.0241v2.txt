We show that for almost every polynomial P(x,y) with complex coefficients, the difference of the logarithmic Mahler measures of P(x,y) and P(x,x^n) can be expanded in a type of formal series similar to an asymptotic power series expansion in powers of 1/n. This generalizes a result of Boyd. We also show that such an expansion is unique and provide a formula for its coefficients. When P has algebraic coefficients, the coefficients in the expansion are linear combinations of polylogarithms of algebraic numbers, with algebraic coefficients.
