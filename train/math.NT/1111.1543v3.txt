We introduce several new methods to obtain upper bounds on the number of solutions of the congruences f(x) \equiv y \pmod p and f(x) \equiv y^2 \pmod p, with a prime p and a polynomial f, where (x,y) belongs to an arbitrary square with side length M. We use these results and methods to derive non-trivial upper bounds for the number of hyperelliptic curves Y^2=X^{2g+1} + a_{2g-1}X^{2g-1} +...+ a_1X+a_0 over the finite field \F_p of p elements, with coefficients in a 2g-dimensional cube  (a_0,..., a_{2g-1})\in [R_0+1,R_0+M]\times...\times [R_{2g-1}+1,R_{2g-1}+M] that are isomorphic to a given curve and give an almost sharp lower bound on the number of non-isomorphic hyperelliptic curves with coefficients in that cube. Furthermore, we study the size of the smallest box that contain a partial trajectory of a polynomial dynamical system over \F_p.
