For fixed integer a\ge3, we study the binary Diophantine equation \frac{a}n=\frac1x+\frac1y and in particular the number E_a(N) of n\le N for which the equation has no positive integer solutions in x, y. The asymptotic formula E_a(N)\sim C(a) \frac{N(\log\log N)^{2^{m-1}-1}}{(\log N)^{1-1/2^m}} as N goes to infinity, is established in this article, and this improves the best result in the literature dramatically. The proof depends on a very delicate analysis of the underlying group structure.
