In this paper, we prove a quantitative version of the statement that every nonempty finite subset of \mathbb{N}^+ is a set of quadratic residues for infinitely many primes of the form [n^c] with 1\leqslant c\leqslant243/205. Correspondingly, we can obtain a similar result for the case of quadratic non-residues under reasonable assumptions. These results generalize the previous ones obtained by S. Wright in certain aspects.
