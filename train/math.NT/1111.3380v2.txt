We show by an inclusion-exclusion argument that the prime k-tuple conjecture of Hardy and Littlewood provides an asymptotic formula for the number of consecutive prime numbers which are a specified distance apart. This refines one aspect of a theorem of Gallagher that the prime k-tuple conjecture implies that the prime numbers are distributed in a Poisson distribution around their average spacing.
