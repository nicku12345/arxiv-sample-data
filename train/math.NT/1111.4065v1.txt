In this paper, we present k sequences of Generalized Van der Laan Polynomials and Generalized Perrin Polynomials using Genaralized Fibonacci and Lucas Polynomials. We give some properties of these polynomials. We also obtain generalized order-k Van der Laan Numbers, k sequences of generalized order-k Van der Laan Numbers, generalized order-k Perrin Numbers and k sequences of generalized order-k Perrin Numbers. In addition, we examine the relationship between them.
