In this paper, we give some determinantal and permanental representations of generalized bivariate Fibonacci p-polynomials by using various Hessenberg matrices. The results that we obtained are important since generalized bivariate Fibonacci p-polynomials are general form of, for example, bivariate Fibonacci and Pell p-polynomials, second kind Chebyshev polynomials, bivariate Jacobsthal polynomials etc.
