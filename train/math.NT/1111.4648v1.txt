We prove a formula of Petersson's type for Fourier coefficients of Siegel cusp forms of degree 2 with respect to congruence subgroups, and as a corollary, show upper bound estimates of individual Fourier coefficient. The method in this paper is essentially a generalization of Kitaoka's previous work which studied the full modular case, but some modification is necessary to obtain estimates which are sharp with respect to the level aspect.
