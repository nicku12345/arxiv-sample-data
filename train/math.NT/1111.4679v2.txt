Cohen and Lenstra have given a heuristic which, for a fixed odd prime p, leads to many interesting predictions about the distribution of p-class groups of imaginary quadratic fields. We extend the Cohen-Lenstra heuristic to a non-abelian setting by considering, for each imaginary quadratic field K, the Galois group of the p-class tower of K, i.e. G_K:=\mathrm{Gal}(K_\infty/K) where K_\infty is the maximal unramified p-extension of K. By class field theory, the maximal abelian quotient of G_K is isomorphic to the p-class group of K. For integers c\geq 1, we give a heuristic of Cohen-Lentra type for the maximal p-class c quotient of \G_K and thereby give a conjectural formula for how frequently a given p-group of p-class c occurs in this manner. In particular, we predict that every finite Schur \sigma-group occurs as G_K for infinitely many fields K. We present numerical data in support of these conjectures.
