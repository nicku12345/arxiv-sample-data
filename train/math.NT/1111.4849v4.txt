The aim of this paper is to give a new approach to modified q-Bernstein polynomials for functions of several variables. By using these polynomials, the recurrence formulas and some new interesting identities related to the second Stirling numbers and generalized Bernoulli polynomials are derived. Moreover, the generating function, interpolation function of these polynomials of several variables and also the derivatives of these polynomials and their generating function are given. Finally, we get new interesting identities of modified q-Bernoulli numbers and q-Euler numbers applying p-adic q-integral representation on \mathbb {Z}_p and p-adic fermionic q-invariant integral on \mathbb {Z}_p, respectively, to the inverse of q-Bernstein polynomials.
