In this paper we prove the equidistribution of certain families of special subvarieties in Kuga varieties, which is a special case of the general Andre-Oort conjecture formulated for mixed Shimura varieties proposed by R.Pink. Our approach is parallel to the pure case treated in the works of L.Clozel, E.Ullmo, and A.Yafaev using tools from ergodic theory.
