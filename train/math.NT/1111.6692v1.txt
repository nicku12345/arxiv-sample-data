We prove an analogue of a result by Goldston, Pintz and Yildirim for small gaps between primes that split completely in an abelian number field. We prove both a conditional result assuming the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture, and an unconditional result. We also give another proof of the same result in the special case of a quadratic extension of class number 1, which relies on a generalization of the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem for quadratic number fields.
