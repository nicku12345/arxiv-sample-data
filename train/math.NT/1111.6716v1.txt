For a family of real quadratic fields \{K_n=\FQ(\sqrt{f(n)})\}_{n\in \FN}, a Dirichlet character \chi modulo q and prescribed ideals \{\fb_n\subset K_n\}, we investigate the linear behaviour of the special value of partial Hecke's L-function L_{K_n}(s,\chi_n:=\chi\circ N_{K_n},\fb_n) at s=0. We show that for n=qk+r, L_{K_n}(0,\chi_n,\fb_n) can be written as \frac{1}{12q^2}(A_{\chi}(r)+kB_{\chi}(r)), where A_{\chi}(r),B_{\chi}(r)\in \FZ[\chi(1),\chi(2),..., \chi(q)] if a certain condition on \fb_n in terms of its continued fraction is satisfied. Furthermore, we write precisely A_{\chi}(r) and B_{\chi}(r) using values of the Bernoulli polynomials. We describe how the linearity is used in solving class number one problem for some families and recover the proofs in some cases. Finally, we list some families of real quadratic fields with the linearity.
