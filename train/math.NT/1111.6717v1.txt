We compute the special values of partial zeta function at s=0 for family of real quadratic fields K_n and ray class ideals \fb_n such that \fb_n^{-1} = [1,\delta(n)] where the continued fraction expansion of \delta(n) is purely periodic and each terms are polynomial in n of bounded degree d. With an additional assumptions, we prove that the special values of partial zeta function at s=0 behaves as quasi-polynomial. We apply this to obtain that the special values the Hecke's L-functions at s=0 for a family of for a Dirichlet character \chi behave as quasi-polynomial as well. We compute out explicitly the coefficients of the quasi-polynomials. Two examples satisfying the condition are presented and for these families the special values of the partial zeta functions at s=0.
