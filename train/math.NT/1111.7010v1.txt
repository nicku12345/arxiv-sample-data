Let f be a classical holomorphic cusp form for SL_2(Z) of weight k which is a normalized eigenfunction for the Hecke algebra, and let \lambda(n) be its eigenvalues. In this paper we study "shifted convolution sums" of the eigenvalues \lambda(n) after averaging over many shifts h and obtain asymptotic estimates. The result is somewhat surprising: one encounters a transition region depending on the ratio of the square of the length of the average over h to the length of the shifted convolution sum. The phenomenon is similar to that encountered by Conrey, Farmer and Soundararajan in their 2000 paper Transition Mean Values of Real Characters, and the connection of both results to Eisenstein series and multiple Dirichlet series is discussed.
