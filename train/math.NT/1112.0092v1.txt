In this article, we first briefly introduce the history of the Weil-\'etale cohomology theory of arithmetic schemes and review some important results established by Lichtenbaum, Flach and Morin. Next we generalize the Weil-etale cohomology to S-integers and compute the cohomology for constant sheaves \mathbb{Z} or \mathbb{R}. We also define a Weil-\'etale cohomology with compact support H_c(Y_W, -) for Y=Spec \mathcal{O}_{F,S} where F is a number field, and computed them. We verify that these cohomology groups satisfy the axioms state by Lichtenbaum. As an application, we derive a canonical representation of Tate sequence from RGamma_c(Y_W,\mathbb{Z}). Motivated by this result, in the final part, we define an \'etale complex RGm, such that the complexes \mathbb{Z}-dual of the complex \RG(U_{et},R\Gm),\,\mathbb{Z})[2] is canonically quasi-isomorphic to \tau^{\leq 3}\RG_c(U_W,\mathbb{Z}) for arbitrary \'etale U over Spec \mathcal{O}_{F}. This quasi-isomorphism provides a possible approach to define the Weil-etale cohomology for higher dimensional arithmetic schemes, as the Weil groups are not involved in the definition of R\Gm.
