Erdos and Niven proved that for any positive integers m and d, there are only finitely many positive integers n for which one or more of the elementary symmetric functions of 1/m,1/(m+d), ..., 1/(m+nd) are integers. Recently, Chen and Tang proved that if n\ge 4, then none of the elementary symmetric functions of 1,1/2, ..., 1/n is an integer. In this paper, we show that if n\ge 2, then none of the elementary symmetric functions of 1, 1/3, ..., 1/(2n-1) is an integer.
