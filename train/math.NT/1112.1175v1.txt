For each nonprincipal Dirichlet character \chi, let n_\chi be the least n with \chi(n) \notin \{0,1\}. We show that as the average of n_\chi over all nonprincipal characters \chi modulo q is \ell(q) + o(1), where \ell(q) denotes the least prime not dividing q. Moreover, if one averages over all nonprincipal characters of modulus at most x, the average approaches a particular limiting value 2.5350541804. We also prove a result of this type for cubic number fields: If one averages over all cubic fields K, ordered by the absolute value of their discriminant, then the mean value of the least rational prime that does not split completely in K is another particular constant 2.1211027269.
