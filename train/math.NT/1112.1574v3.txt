In this article, we follow Hida's approach to study the mu-invariant of the anticyclotomic projection of p-adic Hecke L-functions for CM fields along a branch character. We prove a conjecture of Gillard on the vanishing of the mu-invariant and give an exact mu-invariant formula for self-dual branch characters.
