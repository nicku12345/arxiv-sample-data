In this article, we prove an explicit Waldspurger formula for the toric Hilbert modular forms. As an application, we construct a class of anticyclotomic p-adic Rankin-Selberg L-functions for Hilbert modular forms, generalizing the construction of Bertolini, Darmon and Prasanna in the elliptic case. Moreover, building on works of Hida, we give a necessary and sufficient condition when the Iwasawa mu-invariant of this p-adic L-function vanishes and prove a result on the non-vanishing modulo p of central Rankin-Selberg L-values with anticyclotomic twists.
