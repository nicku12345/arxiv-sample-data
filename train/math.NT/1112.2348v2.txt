In this research paper, relationship between every Mersenne prime and certain Natural numbers is explored. We begin by proving that every Mersenne prime is of the form {4n + 3,for some integer 'n'} and generalize the result to all powers of 2. We also tabulate and show their relationship with other whole numbers up to 10. A number of minor results are also proved. Based on these results, approaches to determine the cardinality of Mersenne primes are discussed.
