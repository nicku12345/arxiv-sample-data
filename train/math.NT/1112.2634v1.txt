In this paper we prove the equidistribution of \Cbf-special subvarieties in certain Kuga varieties, which implies a special case of the general Andr\'e-Oort conjecture formulated for mixed Shimura varieties proposed by R.Pink. The main idea is to reduce the equidistribution to a theorem of Szpiro-Ullmo-Zhang on small points of abelian varieties and a theorem on the equiditribution of C-special subvarieties of Kuga varieties of rigid type treated by the author in a previous paper.
