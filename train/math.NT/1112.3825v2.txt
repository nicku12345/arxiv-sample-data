This note shows how to use the framework of Euler characteristic formulae to study Selmer groups of abelian varieties in certain dihedral or anticyclotomic extensions of CM fields via Iwasawa main conjectures, and in particular how to verify the p-part of the refined Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture in this setting. When the Selmer group is cotorsion with respect to the associated Iwasawa algebra, we obtain the p-part of formula predicted by the refined Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. When the Selmer group is not cotorsion with respect to the associated Iwasawa algebra, we give a conjectural description of the Euler characteristic of the cotorsion submodule, and explain how to deduce inequalities from the associated main conjecture divisibilities of Perrin-Riou and Howard.
