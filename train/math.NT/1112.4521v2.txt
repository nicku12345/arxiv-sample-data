In this paper we prove that equations of the form x^{13} + y^{13} = Cz^{p} have no non-trivial primitive solutions (a,b,c) such that 13 \nmid c if p > 4992539 for an infinite family of values for C. Our method consists in relating a solution (a,b,c) to the previous equation to a solution (a,b,c_1) of another Diophantine equation with coefficients in \Q(\sqrt{13}). We then construct Frey-curves associated with (a,b,c_1) and we prove modularity of them in order to apply the modular approach via Hilbert cusp forms over \Q(\sqrt{13}). We also prove a modularity result for elliptic curves over totally real cyclic number fields of interest by itself.
