We consider the real part \Re(\zeta(s)) of the Riemann zeta-function \zeta(s) in the half-plane \Re(s) \ge 1. We show how to compute accurately the constant \sigma_0 = 1.19\ldots which is defined to be the supremum of \sigma such that \Re(\zeta(\sigma+it)) can be negative (or zero) for some real t. We also consider intervals where \Re(\zeta(1+it)) \le 0 and show that they are rare. The first occurs for t approximately 682112.9, and has length about 0.05. We list the first fifty such intervals.
