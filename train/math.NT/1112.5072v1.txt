Let \C{G}(z):=\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{2^n}(1-z^{2^n})^{-1} denote the generating function of the ruler function, and \C{F}(z):=\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{2^n}(1+z^{2^n})^{-1}; note that the special value \C{F}(1/2) is the sum of the reciprocals of the Fermat numbers F_n:=2^{2^n}+1. The functions \C{F}(z) and \C{G}(z) as well as their special values have been studied by Mahler, Golomb, Schwarz, and Duverney; it is known that the numbers \C{F}(\ga) and \C{G}(\ga) are transcendental for all algebraic numbers \ga which satisfy 0<\ga<1.   For a sequence \mathbf{u}, denote the Hankel matrix H_n^p(\mathbf{u}):=(u({p+i+j-2}))_{1\leqslant i,j\leqslant n}. Let \ga be a real number. The {\em irrationality exponent} \mu(\ga) is defined as the supremum of the set of real numbers \mu such that the inequality |\ga-p/q|<q^{-\mu} has infinitely many solutions (p,q)\in\B{Z}\times\B{N}.   In this paper, we first prove that the determinants of H_n^1(\mathbf{g}) and H_n^1(\mathbf{f}) are nonzero for every n\geqslant 1. We then use this result to prove that for b\geqslant 2 the irrationality exponents \mu(\C{F}(1/b)) and \mu(\C{G}(1/b)) are equal to 2; in particular, the irrationality exponent of the sum of the reciprocals of the Fermat numbers is 2.
