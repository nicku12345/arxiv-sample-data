Given an integer t\ge 1, a rational number g and a prime p\equiv 1({\rm mod} t) we say that g is a near-primitive root of index t if \nu_p(g)=0, and g is of order (p-1)/t modulo p. In the case g is not minus a square we compute the density, under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), of such primes explicitly in the form \rho(g)A, with \rho(g) a rational number and A the Artin constant. We follow in this the approach of Wagstaff, who had dealt earlier with the case where g is not minus a square. The outcome is in complete agreement with the recent determination of the density using a very different, much more algebraic, approach due to Hendrik Lenstra, the author and Peter Stevenhagen.
