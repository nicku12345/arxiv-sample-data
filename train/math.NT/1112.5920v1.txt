Let X be a smooth projective curve over a finite field \mathbb{F} with q elements. For m\geq 1, let X_m be the curve X over the finite field \mathbb{F}_m, the m-th extension of \mathbb{F}. Let K_n(m) be the K-group K_n(X_m) of the smooth projective curve X_m.   In this paper, we study the structure of the groups K_n(m). If l is a prime, we establish an analogue of Iwasawa theorem in algebraic number theory for the orders of the l-primary part K_n(l^m)\{l\} of K_n(l^m). In particular, when X is an elliptic curve E defined over \mathbb{F}, our method determines the structure of K_n(E). Our results can be applied to construct an efficient {\bf DL} system in elliptic cryptography.
