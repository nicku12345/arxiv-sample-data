Let f\in S_k(N,\psi) be a newform, and let \chi be a primitive character of conductor q^{\ell}. Assume that q is a prime and \ell>1. In this paper we describe a method to establish convexity breaking bounds of the form  L(\tfrac{1}{2},\Sym f\otimes\chi)\ll_{f,\varepsilon} q^{3/4\ell-\delta_{\ell}+\varepsilon}  for some \delta_{\ell}>0 and any \varepsilon>0. In particular, for \ell=3 we show that the bound holds with \delta_{\ell}=1/4.
