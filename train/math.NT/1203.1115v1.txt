In this paper, we present some identities for multiple zeta-star values with indices obtained by inserting 3 or 1 into the string 2,...,2. Our identities give analogues of Zagier's evaluation of \zeta(2,...,2,3,2,..., 2) and examples of a kind of duality of multiple zeta-star values. Moreover, their generalizations give partial solutions of conjectures proposed by Imatomi, Tanaka, Wakabayashi and the first author.
