In the present paper, we prove that self-approximation of \log \zeta (s) with d=0 is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. Next, we show self-approximation of \log \zeta (s) with respect to all nonzero real numbers d. Moreover, we partially filled a gap existing in "The strong recurrence for non-zero rational parameters" and prove self-approximation of \zeta(s) for 0 \ne d=a/b with |a-b|\ne 1 and \gcd(a,b)=1.
