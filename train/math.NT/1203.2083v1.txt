A geometric-arithmetic progression of primes is a set of k primes (denoted by GAP-k) of the form p_1 r^j + j d for fixed p_1, r and d and consecutive j, {\it i.e}, \{p_1, \, p_1 r + d, \, p_1 r^2 + 2 d, \, p_1 r^3 + 3 d, \,...}. We study the conditions under which, for k \ge 2, a GAP-k is a set of k primes in geometric-arithmetic progression. Computational data (along with the MATHEMATICA codes) containing progressions up to GAP-13 is presented. Integer sequences for the sets of differences d corresponding to the GAPs of orders up to 11 are also presented.
