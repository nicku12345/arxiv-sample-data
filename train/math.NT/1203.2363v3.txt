A classic question in analytic number theory is to find asymptotics for \sigma_{k}(x) and \pi_{k}(x), the number of integers n\leq x with exactly k prime factors, where \pi_{k}(x) has the added constraint that all the factors are distinct. This problem was originally resolved by Landau in 1900, and much work was subsequently done where k is allowed to vary. In this paper we look at a similar question about integers with a specific prime factorization. Given \boldsymbol{\alpha}\in\mathbb{N}^{k}, \boldsymbol{\alpha}=(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},...,\alpha_{k}) let \sigma_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(x) denote the number of integers of the form n=p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}... p_{k}^{\alpha_{k}} where the p_{i} are not necessarily distinct, and let \pi_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(x) denote the same counting function with the added condition that the factors are distinct. Our main result is asymptotics for both of these functions.
