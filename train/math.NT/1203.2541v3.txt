We prove that, for a p-divisible group with additional structures over a complete valuation ring of rank one O_K with mixed characteristic (0,p), if the Newton polygon and the Hodge polygon of its special fiber possess a non trivial contact point, which is a break point for the Newton polygon, then it admits a "Hodge-Newton filtration" over O_K. The proof is based on the theories of Harder-Narasimhan filtration of finite flat group schemes and admissible filtered isocrystals. We then apply this result to the study of some larger class of Rapoport-Zink spaces and Shimura varieties than those studied previously by Mantovan, and confirm some new cases of Harris's conjecture.
