This is my talk delivered at the workshop 'Automorphic L-Functions and related prpblems' (March 10--13, 2012, Tokyo University). We showed an instance of applications of the theory of automorphic representations to a genuinely traditional problem in the theory of the zeta and allied functions. We restricted ourselves to very basic issues and results, because of the purpose of the workshop.
