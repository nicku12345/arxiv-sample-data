We prove that for any s,t\ge0 with s+t=1 and any \theta\in\mathbb{R} with \inf_{q\in\mathbb{N}}q^{\frac{1}{s}}\|q\theta\|>0, the set of y\in\mathbb{R} for which (\theta,y) is (s,t)-badly approximable is 1/2-winning for Schmidt's game. As a consequence, we remove a technical assumption in a recent theorem of Badziahin-Pollington-Velani on simultaneous Diophantine approximation.
