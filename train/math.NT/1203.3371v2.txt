We describe a strategy to attack infinitely many Fermat-type equations of signature (r,r,p), where r \geq 7 is a fixed prime and p is a prime allowed to vary. We use a variant of the modular method over totally real subfields of \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_r). In particular, to a solution (a,b,c) of x^r + y^r =Cz^p we will attach several Frey curves E=E_{(a,b)}. We prove modularity of all the Frey curves and the exsitence of a constant constant M_r, depending only on r, such that for all p>M_r the representations \bar{\rho}_{E,p} are absolutely irreducible. Along the way, we also prove modularity of certain elliptic curves that are semistable at all v \mid 3.\par Finally, we illustrate our methods by proving arithmetic statements about equations of signature (7,7,p). Among which we emphasize that, using a multi-Frey technique, we show there is some constant M such that if p > M then the equation x^7 + y^7 = 3z^p has no non-trivial primitive solutions.
