We study sums of additively twisted Fourier coefficients of a holomorphic cusp form, a Maass cusp form, and the symmetric-square lift of a holomorphic cusp form. We obtain bounds that are uniform with respect to both the form and the terms of the additive twist. We also improve a bound on a sum of additively twisted Fourier coefficients of a holomorphic cusp form that have also been twisted by a nonlinear exponential term. This last bound is uniform with respect to the terms of the additive twist but it is not uniform with respect to the form.
