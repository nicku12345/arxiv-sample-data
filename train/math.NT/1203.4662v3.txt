Let \ell and p be odd primes. For a positive integer \mu let k_\mu be the ray class field of k=\mathbb{Q}(e^{2\pi i/\ell}) modulo 2p^\mu. We present certain class fields K_\mu of k such that k_\mu\leq K_\mu\leq k_{\mu+1}, and find the degree of K_\mu/k_\mu explicitly. And we also construct, in the sense of Hilbert, primitive generators of the field K_\mu over k_\mu by using Shimura's reciprocity law and special values of theta constants.
