The Carmichael lambda function \lambda(n) is defined to be the smallest positive integer m such that a^m \equiv 1 \pmod{n} for all (a,n)=1. \lambda_k(n) is defined to be the kth iterate of \lambda(n). Let L(n) be the smallest k for which \lambda_k(n)=1. It's easy to show that L(n) \ll \log n. It's conjectured that L(n)\asymp \log\log n, but previously it was not known to be o(\log n) for almost all n. We will show that L(n) \ll (\log n)^{\delta} for almost all n, for some \delta <1. We will also show L(n) \gg \log\log n for almost all n and conjecture a normal order for L(n).
