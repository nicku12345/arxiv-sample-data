In lectures at the Newton Institute in June of 1993, Andrew Wiles announced a proof of a large part of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture and, as a consequence, Fermat's Last Theorem. This report for nonexperts discusses the mathematics involved in Wiles' lectures, including the necessary background and the mathematical history.
