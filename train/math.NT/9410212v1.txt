For a positive integer k and an arbitrary integer h, the Dedekind sum s(h,k) was first studied by Dedekind because of the prominent role it plays in the transformation theory of the Dedekind eta-function, which is a modular form of weight 1/2 for the full modular group SL_2(Z). There is an extensive literature about the Dedekind sums. Rademacher [8] has written an introductory book on the subject.
