As we have shown several years ago [Y2], zeros of L(s, \Delta ) and L^(2)(s, \Delta ) can be calculated quite efficiently by a certain experimental method. Here \Delta denotes the cusp form of weight 12 with respect to SL(2, Z) and L(s, \Delta ) (resp. L^(2)(s, \Delta )) denotes the standard (resp. symmetric square) L-function attached to \Delta. The purpose of this paper is to show that this method can be applied to a wide class of L-functions so that we can obtain precise numerical values of their zeros.
