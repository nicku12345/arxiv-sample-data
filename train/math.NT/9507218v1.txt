We compute the central critical value of the triple product L-function associated to three cusp forms f_1,f_2,f_3 with trivial character for groups \Gamma_0(N_i) with square free levels N_i not all of which are 1 and weights k_i satisfying k_1\ge k_2\ge k_3 and k_1<k_2+k_3. This generalizes work of Gross and Kudla and gives an alternative classical proof of their results in the case N_1=N_2=N_3 with k_1=k_2=k_3=2.
