We discuss the equation a^p + 2^\a b^p + c^p =0 in which a, b, and c are non-zero relatively prime integers, p is an odd prime number, and \a is a positive integer. The technique used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem shows that the equation has no solutions with \a>1 or b even. When \a=1 and b is odd, there are the two trivial solutions (\pm 1, \mp 1, \pm 1). In 1952, D\'enes conjectured that these are the only ones. Using methods of Darmon, we prove this conjecture for p\equiv1 mod~4. We link the case p\equiv3 mod~4 to conjectures of Frey and Darmon about elliptic curves over~\Q with isomorphic mod~p Galois representations.
