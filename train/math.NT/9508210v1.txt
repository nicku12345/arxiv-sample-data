Let C be an algebraically closed field containing the finite field F_q and complete with respect to an absolute value |\;|. We prove that under suitable constraints on the coefficients, the series f(z) = \sum_{n \in \Z} a_n z^{q^n} converges to a surjective, open, continuous F_q-linear homomorphism C \rightarrow C whose kernel is locally compact. We characterize the locally compact sub-F_q-vector spaces G of C which occur as kernels of such series, and describe the extent to which G determines the series.   We develop a theory of Newton polygons for these series which lets us compute the Haar measure of the set of zeros of f of a given valuation, given the valuations of the coefficients. The ``adjoint'' series f^\ast(z) = \sum_{n \in \Z} a_n^{1/q^n} z^{1/q^n} converges everywhere if and only if f does, and in this case there is a natural bilinear pairing  \ker f \times \ker f^\ast \rightarrow F_q  which exhibits \ker f^\ast as the Pontryagin dual of \ker f. Many of these results extend to non-linear fractional power series. We apply these results to construct a Drinfeld module analogue of the Weil pairing, and to describe the topological module structure of the kernel of the adjoint exponential of a Drinfeld module.
