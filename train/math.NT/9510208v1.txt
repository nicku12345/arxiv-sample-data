We continue our study of Yoshida's lifting, which associates to a pair of automorphic forms on the adelic multiplicative group of a quaternion algebra a Siegel modular form of degree 2. We consider here the case that the automorphic forms on the quaternion algebra correspond to modular forms of arbitrary even weights and square free levels; in particular we obtain a construction of Siegel modular forms of weight 3 attached to a pair of elliptic modular forms of weights 2 and 4.
