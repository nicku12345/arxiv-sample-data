This paper gives an expository account of our experiments concerning relations between modular forms for congruence subgroups of SL(3,Z) and three dimensional Galois representations. The main new result presented here is a calculation of the variations of the Hodge structure corresponding to the motives we consider in realizing the Galois representations. It turns out that the period spaces for the Hodge structures are four dimensional, while the geometric realizations of such Hodge structures can appear in subspaces of dimension at most one.
