S. Lang conjectured in 1974 that a hyperbolic algebraic variety defined over a number field has only finitely many rational points, and its analogue over function fields. We discuss the Nevanlinna-Cartan theory over function fields of arbitrary dimension and apply it for Diophantine property of hyperbolic projective hypersurfaces (homogeneous Diophantine equations) constructed by Masuda-Noguchi. We also deal with the finiteness property of S-units points of those Diophantine equations over number fields.
