In an earlier work, the authors have determined all possible weights n for which there exists a vanishing sum \zeta_1+\cdots +\zeta_n=0 of mth roots of unity \zeta_i in characteristic 0. In this paper, the same problem is studied in finite fields of characteristic p. For given m and p, results are obtained on integers n_0 such that all integers n\geq n_0 are in the ``weight set'' W_p(m). The main result (1.3) in this paper guarantees, under suitable conditions, the existence of solutions of x_1^d+\cdots+x_n^d=0 with all coordinates not equal to zero over a finite field.
