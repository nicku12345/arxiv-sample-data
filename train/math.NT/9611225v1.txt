For each prime \ell, let |\cdot|_\ell be an extension to \bar \Q of the usual \ell-adic absolute value on \Q. Suppose g(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c(n)q^n \in M_{k+\half}(N) is an eigenform whose Fourier coefficients are algebraic integers. Under a mild condition, for all but finitely many primes \ell there are infinitely many square-free integers m for which |c(m)|_\ell = 1. Consequently we obtain indivisibility results for ``algebraic parts'' of central critical values of modular L-functions and class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields. These results partially answer a conjecture of Kolyvagin regarding Tate-Shafarevich groups of modular elliptic curves. Similar results were obtained earlier by Jochnowitz by a completely different method. Our method uses standard facts about Galois representations attached to modular forms, and pleasantly uncovers surprising Kronecker-style congruences for L-function values. For example if \Delta(z) is Ramanujan's cusp form and g(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c(n)q^n is the cusp form for which L(\Delta_D,6)=\fracwithdelims(){\pi}{D}^6\frac{\sqrt{D}}{5!}\frac{< \Delta(z),\Delta(z)>} {< g(z),g(z)>}\cdot c(D)^2, for fundamental discriminants D>0, then for N\geq 1 \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty c(N-k^2) \equiv \half \sum_{d|N}(\chi_{-1}(d)+\chi_{-1}(N/d))d^6 \pmod {61}. \tag{0}
