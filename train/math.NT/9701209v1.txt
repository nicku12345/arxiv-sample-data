Based on results obtained in a companion paper [MSRI preprint 1997-002], we construct groups of special S--units for function fields of characteristic p>0, and show that they satisfy Gras--type Conjectures. We use these results in order to give a new proof of Chinburg's \Omega_3--Conjecture on the Galois module structure of the group of S--units, for cyclic extensions of prime degree of function fields.
