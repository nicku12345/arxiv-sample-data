In this paper, we give explicit descriptions of Hyodo and Kato's Frobenius and Monodromy operators on the first p-adic de Rham cohomology groups of curves and Abelian varieties with semi-stable reduction over local fields of mixed characteristic. This paper was motivated by the first author's paper "A p-adic Shimura isomorphism and periods of modular forms," where conjectural definitions of these operators for curves with semi-stable reduction were given.
