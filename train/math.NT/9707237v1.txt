In this paper, we prove an unconditionnal bound for the analytic rank (i.e the order of vanishing at the critical point of the L function) of the new part J^n_0(q), of the jacobian of the modular curve X_0(q). Our main resultis the following upper bound: for q prime, one has rank_a(J_0^n(q))\ll \dim J_0^n(q) where the implied constant is absolute. All previously known non trivials bounds of rank_a(J_0^n(q)) assumed the generalized Riemann hypothesis; here, our proof is unconditionnal, and is based firstly on the construction by Perelli and Pomykala of a new test function in the context of Riemann-Weil explicit formulas, and secondly on a density theorem for the zeros of L functions attached to new forms.
