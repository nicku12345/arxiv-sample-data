Let \k be a global function field in 1-variable over a finite extension of \Fp, p prime, \infty a fixed place of \k, and \A the ring of functions of \k regular outside of \infty. Let E be a Drinfeld module or T-module. Then, as in \cite{go1}, one can construct associated characteristic p L-functions based on the classical model of abelian varieties {\it once} certain auxiliary choices are made. Our purpose in this paper is to show how the well-known concept of ``maximal separable (over the completion \k_\infty) subfield'' allows one to construct from such L-functions certain separable extensions which are independent of these choices. These fields will then depend only on the isogeny class of the original T-module or Drinfeld module and y\in \Zp, and should presumably be describable in these terms. Moreover, they give a very useful framework in which to view the ``Riemann hypothesis'' evidence of \cite{w1}, \cite{dv1}, \cite{sh1}. We also establish that an element which is {\it separably} algebraic over \k_\infty can be realized as a ``multi-valued operator'' on general T-modules. This is very similar to realizing 1/2 as the multi-valued operator x\mapsto \sqrt{x} on \C^\ast. Simple examples show that this result is false for non-separable elements. This result may eventually allow a ``two T's'' interpretation of the above extensions in terms of multi-valued operators on E and certain tensor twists.
