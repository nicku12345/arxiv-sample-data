Let A be an abelian variety defined over a number field K and let Kab be the maximal abelian extension of K. We show that there only finitely many torsion points of A which are defined over Kab iff A has no abelian subvariety with complex multiplication over K. We use this to give another proof of Ribet's result that A has only finitely many torsion points which are defined over the cyclotomic extension of K.
