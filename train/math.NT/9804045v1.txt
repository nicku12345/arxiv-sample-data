Every positive rational number has representations as Egyptian fractions (sums of reciprocals of distinct positive integers) with arbitrarily many terms and with arbitrarily large denominators. However, such representations normally use a very sparse subset of the positive integers up to the largest demoninator. We show that for every positive rational there exist Egyptian fractions whose largest denominator is at most N and whose denominators form a positive proportion of the integers up to N, for sufficiently large N; furthermore, the proportion is within a small factor of best possible.
