Let K/F be a finite Galois extension of number fields with Galois group G, let A be an abelian variety defined over F, and let {\cyr W}(A_{^{/ K}}) and {\cyr W}(A_{^{/ F}}) denote, respectively, the Tate-Shafarevich groups of A over K and of A over F. Assuming that these groups are finite, we derive, under certain restrictions on A and K/F, a formula for the order of the subgroup of {\cyr W}(A_{^{/ K}}) of G-invariant elements. As a corollary, we obtain a simple formula relating the orders of {\cyr W}(A_{^{/ K}}), {\cyr W}(A_{^{/ F}}) and {\cyr W}(A_{^{/ F}}^{\chi}) when K/F is a quadratic extension and A^{\chi} is the twist of A by the non-trivial character \chi of G.
