We compute the universal deformation ring of an odd Galois two dimensional representation of Gal(M/Q) with an upper triangular image, where M is the maximal abelian pro-p-extension of F_{\infty} unramified outside a finite set of places S, F_{\infty} being a free pro-p-extension of a subextension F of the field K fixed by the kernel of the representation. We establish a link between the latter universal deformation ring and the universal deformation ring of the representation of Gal(K_S/Q), where K_S is the maximal pro-p-extension of K unramified outside S. We then give some examples.   This paper was accepted for publication in the Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge philosophical society (May 99).
