This note formulates a conjecture generalizing both the abc conjecture of Masser-Oesterl\'e and the author's diophantine conjecture for algebraic points of bounded degree. It also shows that the new conjecture is implied by the earlier conjecture.   As with most of the author's conjectures, this new conjecture stems from analogies with Nevanlinna theory; in this case it corresponds to a Second Main Theorem in Nevanlinna theory with truncated counting functions. The original abc conjecture of Masser and Oesterl\'e corresponds to the Second Main Theorem with truncated counting functions on P^1 for the divisor [0]+[1]+[\infty].
