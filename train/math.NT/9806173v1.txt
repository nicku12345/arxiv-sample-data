Let p be a prime number such that the modular curve X_0(p) has genus at least two. We show that the only points of the reduction mod p of X_0(p) with image in the reduction mod p of J_0(p) in the cuspidal group are the two cusps. This answers a question of Robert Coleman. For the proof we give a description of the special fibre of the N\'eron model of the jacobian of a semi-stable curve in terms of divisors. We also study to what extent the morphism from a semistable curve with given base point to the N\'eron model of its jacobian is a closed immmersion. Implicitly, logarithmic structures intervene, and a well-known modular form of weight p+1 on supersingular elliptic curves plays an important role.
