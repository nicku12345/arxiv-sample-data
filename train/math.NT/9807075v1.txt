We define analogues of higher derivatives for F_q-linear functions over the field of formal Laurent series with coefficients in F_q. This results in a formula for Taylor coefficients of a F_q-linear holomorphic function, a definition of classes of F_q-linear smooth functions which are characterized in terms of coefficients of their Fourier-Carlitz expansions. A Volkenborn-type integration theory for F_q-linear functions is developed; in particular, an integral representation of the Carlitz logarithm is obtained.
