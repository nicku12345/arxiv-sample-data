We study this subject by first proving that the p-primary subgroup of the classical Selmer group for an elliptic curve with good, ordinary reduction at a prime p has a very simple and elegant description which involves just the Galois module of p-power torsion points. We then prove theorems of Mazur, Schneider, and Perrin-Riou on the basis of this description. The final section, which is half of this long paper, contains a number of results and examples including a thorough study of the mu-invariant.
