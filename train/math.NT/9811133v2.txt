Let G be a reductive algebraic group associated to a self-adjoint homogeneous cone defined over Q, and let G' be an appropriate neat arithmetic subgroup of G. We present two algorithms to compute the action of the Hecke operators on the integral cohomology of G'. This simultaneously generalizes the modular algorithm of Ash-Rudolph to a larger class of groups, and provides techniques to compute the Hecke-module structure of previously inaccessible cohomology groups.
