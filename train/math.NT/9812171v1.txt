Let p be an odd prime, n an odd positive integer and C the p-Sylow subgroup the class group of the p-cyclotomic extension of the rationals. When log(p) is bigger than n**(224n**4), we prove that the eigenspace on C attached to the (p-n)-th power of the Teichmuller character is trivial. The proof uses the K-theory of the integers and the Voronoi reduction theory of quadratic forms.
