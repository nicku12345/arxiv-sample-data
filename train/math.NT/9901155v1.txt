We bound Selmer groups attached to Grossencharacters of CM elliptic curves by the appropriate L-value. Our method is to use Kato's explicit reciprocity law and the Main Conjecture as proved by Rubin. These results are then used together with work of Han and fundamental results of Nekovar to bound the torsion in the image of the p-adic cycle class map for self products of CM elliptic curves. Our results are valid for Chow groups of arbitrary codimension for almost all p.
