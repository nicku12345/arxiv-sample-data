In a series of articles published in the C.R. Paris more than a century ago, T. P\'epin announced a list of ``theorems'' concerning the solvability of diophantine equations of the type ax^4 + by^4 = z^2. In this article, we show how to prove these claims using the structure of 2-class groups of imaginary quadratic number fields. We will also look at a few related results (including FLT for n = 7) from a modern point of view.
