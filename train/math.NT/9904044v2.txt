We establish Connes's local trace formula   (related to the explicit formulae of number theory) for the quaternions. This is done as an application of a study of the central operator H = log(|x|) + log(|y|) in the context of invariant harmonic analysis. The multiplicative analysis of the additive Fourier transform gives a spectral interpretation to generalized ``Tate Gamma functions'' (closely akin to the Godement-Jacquet ``\gamma(s,\pi,\psi)'' functions.) The analysis of H leads furthermore to a spectral interpretation for the logarithmic derivatives of these Gamma functions (which are involved in ``explicit formulae''.)
