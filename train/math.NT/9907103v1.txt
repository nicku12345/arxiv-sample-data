This note adds three annexes to my previous paper math/9904044   Annex 1. A sufficient condition for self-adjointness   Annex 2. Invariant closed operators on locally compact abelian groups   Annex 3. The trace of Connes for quaternions   This last item is a minor variation on the evaluation of Connes's trace (math/9811068), which is explained here in the setting of quaternions and can be applied also to any abelian local field.
