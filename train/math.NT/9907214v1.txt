This paper considers a higher-dimensional generalization of the notion of Ramanujan graphs, defined by Lubotzky, Phillips, and Sarnak. Specifically the Ramanujan property is studied for cubical complexes which are uniformized by an ordered product of regular trees. We construct explicit arithmetic examples using quaternion algebras over totally real fields. Here we reduce the Ramanujan property to special cases of the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture for holomorphic Hilbert modular forms, many of which are known.
