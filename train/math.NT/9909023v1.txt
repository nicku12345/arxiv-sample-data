Let G be the semidirect product \A^1\ltimes \A of the adeles and the norm 1 ideles. Let \Ga be the discrete subgroup \Q^\times\ltimes\Q. In this paper the trace formula for this setting is established and used to give the complete decomposition of the G-representation on L^2(\Ga\bs G). It turns out that every character of the norm-1 idele class group gives a one dimensional isotype and the complement of those consists of one irreducible representation.
