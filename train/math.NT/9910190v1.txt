Let K be a global field of characteristic p>0. We study the cohomology of arithmetic subgroups \Gamma  of SL_{n+1}(K) (with respect to a fixed place of K), under the hypothesis that these groups have no p'-torsion (any arithmetic group possesses a normal subgroup of finite index without p'-torsion). We define the cohomology of \Gamma  with compact supports and values in {\Bbb Z}[1/p], and we relate it to spaces of harmonic cocycles, also with compact supports (\S 3). We give a description of the locus of these supports, in particular by introducing a notion of cusp in dimension n\geq 1 (\S 4) and we calculate "geometrically" the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic of this cohomology, up to torsion (\S 5).
