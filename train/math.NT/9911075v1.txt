We study certain classes of equations for F_q-linear functions, which are the natural function field counterparts of linear ordinary differential equations. It is shown that, in contrast to both classical and p-adic cases, formal power series solutions have positive radii of convergence near a singular point of an equation. Algebraic properties of the ring of F_q-linear differential operators are also studied.
