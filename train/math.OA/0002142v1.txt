Let A be a separable C^*-algebra and let B be a stable C^*-algebra with a strictly positive element. We consider the (semi)group \Ext^{as}(A,B) (resp. \Ext(A,B)) of homotopy classes of asymptotic (resp. of genuine) homomorphisms from A to the corona algebra M(B)/B and the natural map i:\Ext(A,B)\ar\Ext^{as}(A,B). We show that if A is a suspension then \Ext^{as}(A,B) coincides with E-theory of Connes and Higson and the map i is surjective. In particular any asymptotic homomorphism from SA to M(B)/B is homotopic to some genuine homomorphism.
