Given a C*-algebra A, a discrete abelian group X and a homomorphism \Theta: X\to OutA defining the dual action group \Gamma\subset autA, the paper contains results on existence and characterization of Hilbert \{A,\Gamma\}, where the action is given by \hat{X}. They are stated at the (abstract) C*-level and can therefore be considered as a refinement of the extension results given for von Neumann algebras for example by Jones [Mem.Am.Math.Soc. 28 Nr 237 (1980)] or Sutherland [Publ.Res.Inst.Math.Sci. 16 (1980) 135]. A Hilbert extension exists iff there is a generalized 2-cocycle. These results generalize those in [Commun.Math.Phys. 15 (1969) 173], which are formulated in the context of superselection theory, where it is assumed that the algebra A has a trivial center, i.e. Z=C1. In particular the well-known ``outer characterization'' of the second cohomology H^2(X,{\cal U}(Z),\alpha_X) can be reformulated: there is a bijection to the set of all A-module isomorphy classes of Hilbert extensions. Finally, a Hilbert space representation (due to Sutherland in the von Neumann case) is mentioned. The C*-norm of the Hilbert extension is expressed in terms of the norm of this representation and it is linked to the so-called regular representation appearing in superselection theory.
