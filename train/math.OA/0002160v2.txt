We generalize the Serre-Swan theorem to non-commutative C^{*}-algebras. For a Hilbert C^{*}-module X over a C^{*}-algebra {\cal A}, we introduce a hermitian vector bundle \exx associated to X. We show that there is a linear subspace \Gamma_{X} of the space of all holomorphic sections of {\cal E}_{X} and a flat connection D on {\cal E}_{X} with the following properties: (i) \Gamma_{X} is a Hilbert {\cal A}-module with the action of {\cal A} defined by D, (ii) the C^{*}-inner product of \Gamma_{X} is induced by the hermitian metric of {\cal E}_{X}, (iii) {\cal E}_{X} is isomorphic to an associated bundle of an infinite dimensional Hopf bundle, (iv) \Gamma_{X} is isomorphic to X.
