Let \G be a group of type rotating automorphisms of an affine building \cB of type \wt A_2. If \G acts freely on the vertices of \cB with finitely many orbits, and if \Omega is the (maximal) boundary of \cB, then C(\Om)\rtimes \G is a p.i.s.u.n. C^*-algebra. This algebra has a structure theory analogous to that of a simple Cuntz-Krieger algebra and is the motivation for a theory of higher rank Cuntz-Krieger algebras, which has been developed by T. Steger and G. Robertson. The K-theory of these algebras can be computed explicitly in the rank two case. For the rank two examples of the form C(\Om)\rtimes \G which arise from boundary actions on \wt A_2 buildings, the two K-groups coincide.
