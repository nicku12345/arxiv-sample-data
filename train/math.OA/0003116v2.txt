We define N-theory being some analogue of K-theory on the category of von Neumann algebras such that K_0(A)\subset N_0(A) for any von Neumann algebra A. Moreover, it turns out to be possible to construct the extension of the Chern character to some homomorphism from N_0(A) to even Banach cyclic homology of A. Also, we define generalized Lefschetz numbers for an arbitrary unitary endomorphism U of an A-elliptic complex. We study them in the situation when U is an element of a representation of some compact Lie group.
