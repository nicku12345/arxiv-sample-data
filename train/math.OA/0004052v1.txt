Let n be a positive integer. We introduce a concept, which we call the n-filling property, for an action of a group on a separable unital C^*-algebra A. If A=C(\Omega) is a commutative unital C^*-algebra and the action is induced by a group of homeomorphisms of \Omega then the n-filling property reduces to a weak version of hyperbolicity. The n-filling property is used to prove that certain crossed product C^*-algebras are purely infinite and simple. A variety of group actions on boundaries of symmetric spaces and buildings have the n-filling property. An explicit example is the action of \Gamma=SL_n({\bf Z}) on the projective n-space.
