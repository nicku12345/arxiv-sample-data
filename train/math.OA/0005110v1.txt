Let E be an operator algebra on a Hilbert space with finite-dimensional generated C*-algebra. A classification is given of the locally finite algebras and the operator algebras obtained as limits of direct sums of matrix algebras over E with respect to star-extendible homomorphisms. The invariants in the algebraic case consist of an additive semigroup, with scale, which is a right module for the semiring V_E = Hom_u(E \otimes \sK, E \otimes \sK) of unitary equivalence classes of star-extendible homomorphisms. This semigroup is referred to as the dimension module invariant. In the operator algebra case the invariants consist of a metrized additive semigroup with scale and a contractive right module V_E-action. Subcategories of algebras determined by restricted classes of embeddings, such as 1-decomposable embeddings between digraph algebras, are also classified in terms of simplified dimension module invariants.
