Given a commuting d-tuple \bar T=(T_1,...,T_d) of otherwise arbitrary nonnormal operators on a Hilbert space, there is an associated Dirac operator D_{\bar T}. Significant attributes of the d-tuple are best expressed in terms of D_{\bar T}, including the Taylor spectrum and the notion of Fredholmness.   In fact, {\it all} properties of \bar T derive from its Dirac operator. We introduce a general notion of Dirac operator (in dimension d=1,2,...) that is appropriate for multivariable operator theory. We show that every abstract Dirac operator is associated with a commuting d-tuple, and that two Dirac operators are isomorphic iff their associated operator d-tuples are unitarily equivalent.   By relating the curvature invariant introduced in a previous paper to the index of a Dirac operator, we establish a stability result for the curvature invariant for pure d-contractions of finite rank. It is shown that for the subcategory of all such \bar T which are a) Fredholm and and b) graded, the curvature invariant K(\bar T) is stable under compact perturbations. We do not know if this stability persists when \bar T is Fredholm but ungraded, though there is concrete evidence that it does.
