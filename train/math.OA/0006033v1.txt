We show that the Elliott invariant is a classifying invariant for the class of C^*-algebras that are simple unital infinite dimensional inductive limits of sequences of finite direct sums of building blocks of the form  \{f\in C(\T)\otimes M_n: f(x_i)\in M_{d_i}, i=1,2,...,N\},  where x_1,x_2,...,x_N\in\T, d_1,d_2,...,d_N are integers dividing n, and M_{d_i} is embedded unitally into M_n. Furthermore we prove existence and uniqueness theorems for *-homomorphisms between such algebras and we identify the range of the invariant.
