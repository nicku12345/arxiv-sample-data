We use free probability techniques to compute borders of spectra of non hermitian operators in finite von Neumann algebras which arise as `free sums' of `simple' operators. To this end, the resolvent is analyzed with the aid of the Haagerup inequality. Concrete examples coming from reduced C*-algebras of free product groups and leading to systems of polynomial equations illustrate the approach.
