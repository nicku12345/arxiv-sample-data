We study the space of functions \phi\colon \NN\to \CC such that there is a Hilbert space H, a power bounded operator T in B(H) and vectors \xi,\eta in H such that \phi(n) = < T^n\xi,\eta>. This implies that the matrix (\phi(i+j))_{i,j\ge 0} is a Schur multiplier of B(\ell_2) or equivalently is in the space (\ell_1 \buildrel {\vee}\over {\otimes} \ell_1)^*. We show that the converse does not hold, which answers a question raised by Peller [Pe]. Our approach makes use of a new class of Fourier multipliers of H^1 which we call ``shift-bounded''. We show that there is a \phi which is a ``completely bounded'' multiplier of H^1, or equivalently for which (\phi(i+j))_{i,j\ge 0} is a bounded Schur multiplier of B(\ell_2), but which is not ``shift-bounded'' on H^1. We also give a characterization of ``completely shift-bounded'' multipliers on H^1.
