We give a construction of a nuclear C^\ast-algebra associated with an amalgamated free product of groups, generalizing Spielberg's construction of a certain Cuntz-Krieger algebra associated with a finitely generated free product of cyclic groups. Our nuclear C^\ast-algebras can be identified with certain Cuntz-Krieger-Pimsner algebras. We will also show that our algebras can be obtained by the crossed product construction of the canonical actions on the hyperbolic boundaries, which proves a special case of Adams' result about amenability of the boundary action for hyperbolic groups. We will also give an explicit formula of the K-groups of our algebras. Finally we will investigate the relationship between the KMS states of the generalized gauge actions on our C^\ast algebras and random walks on the groups.
