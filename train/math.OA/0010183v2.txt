W. Arveson has described a cocycle conjugacy class U(\alpha) of E_0-semigroup \alpha on B(H) which is a factor of type \rm I. Under some conditions on \alpha, there is a E_0-semigroup \beta \in U(\alpha) being a flow of shifts in the sence of R.T. Powers. We study quasifree endomorphisms semigroups \alpha on the hyperfinite factor M=\pi (A(K))'' generated by the representations \pi of the algebra of canonical anticommutation relations A(K) over a separable Hilbert space K. The type of M can be \rm I, \rm II or \rm III depending on \pi. The cocycle conjugacy class U(\alpha) is described in the terms of initial isometrical semigroups in K and an analogue of the Arveson result for the hyperfinite factors M of the type \rm II_1 and \rm III_{\lambda}, 0<\lambda <1, is introduced.
