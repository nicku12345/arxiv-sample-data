By utilizing an irreducible inclusion of type III_{q^{2}}  factors coming from a free-product type action of the quantum group  SU_{q}(2) , we show that the free group factor  L(\mathbb {F}_{\infty})  possesses irreducible subfactors of arbitrary index  >4 . Combined with earlier results of Radulescu, this shows that  L(\mathbb {F}_{\infty})  has irreducible subfactors with any index value in  \{4\cos ^{2}(\pi /n):n\geq 3\}\cup [4,+\infty) .
