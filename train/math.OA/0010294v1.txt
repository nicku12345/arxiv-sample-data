We define a notion of dynamical pressure at a self-adjoint element for a contractive completely positive self-map of an exact C*-algebra which adopts Voiculescu's approximation approach to noncommutative entropy and extends the Voiculescu-Brown topological entropy and Neshveyev-Stormer unital-nuclear pressure. A variational inequality bounding the pressure below by the free energies with respect to the Sauvageot-Thouvenot entropy is established in two stages via the introduction of a local state approximation entropy, whose associated free energies function as an intermediate term.   Pimsner C*-algebras furnish a framework for investigating the variational principle, which asserts the equality of the pressure and the supremum of the free energies over all dynamically invariant states. In one direction we extend Brown's result on the constancy of the Voiculescu-Brown entropy upon passing to the crossed product, and in another we show that the pressure of a self-adjoint element over the Markov subshift underlying the canonical map on a Cuntz-Kreiger algebra is equal to its classical pressure. The latter result is extended to a more general setting comprising an expanded class of Cuntz-Krieger-type Pimsner algebras, leading to the variational principle for self-adjoint elements in a diagonal subalgebra. Equilibrium states are constructed from KMS states under certain conditions in the case of Cuntz-Krieger algebras.
