For an inclusion of the form \Bbb C\subseteq M_n(\Bbb C), where M_n(\Bbb C) is endowed with a state with diagonal weights \lambda=(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n), we use Popa's construction, for non-tracial states, to obtain an irreducible inclusion of II_1 factors, N^\lambda(Q)\subseteq M^\lambda(Q)  of index \sum \frac{1}{\lambda_i}. M^\lambda(Q) is identified with a subfactor inside the centralizer algebra of the canonical free product state on Q\star M_N(\Bbb C). Its structure is described by ``infinite'' semicircular elements as in \cite{Ra3}. The irreducible subfactor inclusions obtained by this method are similar to the first irreducible subfactor inclusions, of index in [4,\infty) constructed in \cite {Po1}, starting with the Jones' subfactors inclusion R^s\subseteq R, s>4. In the present paper, since the inclusion we start with has a simpler structure, it is easier to control the algebra structure of the subfactor inclusions.
