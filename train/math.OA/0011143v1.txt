We show that the family of nest algebras with r non-zero nest projections is stable, in the sense that an approximate containment of one such algebra within another is close to an exact containment. We use this result to give a local characterisation of limits formed from this family. We then consider quite general regular limit algebras and characterise these algebras using a local condition which reflects the assumed regularity of the system.
