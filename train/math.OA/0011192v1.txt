Let \Gamma be a torsion free lattice in G = \PGL(n+1,\FF), where n\ge 1 and \FF is a non-archimedean local field. Then \Gamma acts on the Furstenberg boundary G/P, where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup of G. The identity element \id in the crossed product C^*-algebra C(G/P)\rtimes \Gamma generates a class [\id] in the K_0 group of C(G/P)\rtimes \Gamma. It is shown that [\id] is a torsion element of K_0 and there is an explicit bound for the order of [\id]. The result is proved more generally for groups acting on affine buildings of type \tA_n. For n=1, 2 the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic \chi(\Gamma) annihilates the class [\id].
