We extend in this paper several results of E. Kirchberg, S. Wassermann and the author dealing with continuous fields of C*--algebras to the semi-continuous case. We provide a new characterisation of separable lower semi-continuity C*--bundles and we present exactness criteria for C(X)-algebras and unital bisimplifiable Hopf \cst-algebras.
