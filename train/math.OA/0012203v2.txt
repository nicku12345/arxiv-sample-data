In a noncommutative torus, effect of perturbation by inner derivation on the associated quantum stochastic process and geometric parameters like volume and scalar curvature have been studied. Cohomological calculations show that the above perturbation produces new spectral triples. Also for the Weyl C^*-algebra, the Laplacian associated with a natural stochastic process is obtained and associated volume form is calculated. Keywords: noncommutative torus, Laplacian, Dixmier trace, quantum stochastic process.
