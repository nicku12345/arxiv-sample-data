We define the notion of von Neumann spectral triple and consider the associated index problem. We compute the analytic Chern-Connes character of such a von Neumann spectral triple and prove the corresponding local formula for its Hochschild class. This formula involves the Dixmier trace for II_{\infty} von Neumann algebras. In the case of foliations, we identify this Dixmier trace with the corresponding measured Wodzicki residue.
