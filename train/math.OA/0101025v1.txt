We introduce the concept of ``R-cyclic family'' of matrices with entries in a non-commutative probability space; the definition consists in asking that only the ``cyclic'' non-crossing cumulants of the entries of the matrices are allowed to be non-zero.   Let A_{1}, ..., A_{s} be an R-cyclic family of d \times d matrices over a non-commutative probability space. We prove a convolution-type formula for the explicit computation of the joint distribution of A_{1}, ..., A_{s} (considered in M_{d} (\A) with the natural state), in terms of the joint distribution (considered in the original space) of the entries of the s matrices. Several important situations of families of matrices with tractable joint distributions arise by application of this formula.   Moreover, let A_{1}, ..., A_{s} be a family of d \times d matrices over a non-commutative probability space, let \D \subset M_{d} (\A) denote the algebra of scalar diagonal matrices, and let {\cal C} be the subalgebra of M_{d} (\A) generated by \{A_{1}, ..., A_{s} \} \cup \D. We prove that the R-cyclicity of A_{1}, ..., A_{s} is equivalent to a property of {\cal C} -- namely that {\cal C} is free from M_{d} (\C), with amalgamation over \D.
