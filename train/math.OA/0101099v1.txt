The notion of extension of a given C^*-category C by a C^*-algebra A is introduced. In the commutative case A = C(\Omega), the objects of the extension category are interpreted as fiber bundles over \Omega of objects belonging to the initial category. It is shown that the Doplicher-Roberts algebra (DR-algebra in the following) associated to an object in the extension of a strict tensor C^*-category is a continuous field of DR-algebras coming from the initial one. In the case of the category of the hermitian vector bundles over \Omega the general result implies that the DR-algebra of a vector bundle is a continuous field of Cuntz algebras. Some applications to Pimsner C^*-algebras are given.
