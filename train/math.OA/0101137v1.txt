We extend Voiculescu's microstates-free definitions of free Fisher information and free entropy to the non-tracial framework. We explain the connection between these quantities and free entropy with respect to certain completely positive maps acting on the core of the non-tracial non-commutative probability space. We give a condition on free Fisher information of an infinite family of variables, which guarantees factoriality of the von Neumann algebra they generate.
