We prove the following results for a unital simple direct limit A of recursive subhomogeneous algebras with no dimension growth:   (1) A has stable rank 1.   (2) The projections in M_{\infty} (A) satisfy cancellation: if e \oplus q \sim f \oplus q, then e \sim f.   (3) A satisfies Blackadar's Second Fundamental Comparability Question: if p, q \in M_{\infty} (A) are projections such that \tau (p) < \tau (q) for all normalized traces \tau on A, then p is equivalent to a subprojection of q.   (4) K_0 (A) is unperforated for the strict order: if \eta \in K_0 (A) and there is n > 0 such that n \eta > 0, then \eta > 0.   The last three of these results hold under certain weaker dimension growth conditions and without assuming simplicity.   We use these results to obtain previously unknown information on the ordered K-theory of the crossed product C^* (Z, X, h) obtained from a minimal homeomorphism of an infinite finite dimensional compact metric space X. Specifically, K_0 (C^* (Z, X, h)) is unperforated for the strict order, and satisfies the following K-theoretic version of Blackadar's Second Fundamental Comparability Question: if \eta \in K_0 (A) satisfies \tau_* (\et) > 0 for all normalized traces \tau on A, then there is a projection p \in M_{\infty} (A) such that \eta = [p].
