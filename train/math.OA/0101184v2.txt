Motivated by the search for new examples of "noncommutative manifolds", we study the noncommutative geometry of the group C*-algebras of various discrete groups. The examples we consier are the infinite dihedral group   {\bf Z} \times_{\sigma} {\bf Z}_2 and the semidirect product {\bf Z} \times_{\sigma} {\bf Z}. We present a unified treatment of the K-homology and cyclic cohomology of these algebras.
