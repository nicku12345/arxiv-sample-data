For a row-finite graph G with no sinks and in which every loop has an exit, we construct an isomorphism between Ext(C*(G)) and coker(A-I), where A is the vertex matrix of G. If c is the class in Ext(C*(G)) associated to a graph obtained by attaching a sink to G, then this isomorphism maps c to the class of a vector which describes how the sink was added. We conclude with an application in which we use this isomorphism to produce an example of a row-finite transitive graph with no sinks whose associated C*-algebra is not semiprojective.
