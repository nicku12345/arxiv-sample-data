I give a survey about my work on combinatorial and probabilistic aspects of free probability theory. In particular, I present the combinatorial description of freeness in terms of free cumulants and I give some ideas of the main results of my joint work with Philippe Biane on a stochastic integration theory for free Brownian motion.
