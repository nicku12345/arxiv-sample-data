We give a survey of cyclic homology/cohomology theory including a detailed discussion of cyclic theories for various classes of topological algebras. We show how to associate cyclic classes with Fredholm modules and K-theory classes and how to construct a completely general bivariant Chern-Connes character from bivariant K-theory to bivariant cyclic theory.
