We study properties of C*-algebraic deformations of homogeneous spaces G/\Gamma which are equivariant in the sense that they preserve the natural action of G by left translation. The center is shown to be isomorphic to C(G/G_\rho^0) for a certain subgroup G_\rho^0 of G, and there is a 1-1 correspondence between normalised traces and probability measures on G/G_\rho^0. This makes it possible to represent the deformed algebra as operators over L^2(G/\Gamma). Applications to K-theory are also mentioned.
