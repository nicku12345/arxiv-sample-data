We prove that the pure state space is homogeneous under the action of the automorphism group (or a certain smaller group of approximately inner automorphisms) for a fairly large class of simple separable nuclear C*-algebras, including the approximately homogeneous C*-algebras and the class of purely infinite C*-algebras which has been recently classified by Kirchberg and Phillips. This extends the known results for UHF algebras and AF algebras by Powers and Bratteli.
