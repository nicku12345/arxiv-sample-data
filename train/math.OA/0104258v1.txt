We prove that the pure state space is homogeneous under the action of the group of asymptotically inner automorphisms for all the separable simple nuclear C*-algebras. If simplicity is not assumed for the C*-algebras, the set of pure states whose GNS representations are faithful is homogeneous for the above action.
