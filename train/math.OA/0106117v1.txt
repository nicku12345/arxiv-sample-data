We prove that if a conditional expectation from a simple C^*-algebra onto its C^*-subalgebra satisfies the Pimsner-Popa inequality, there exists a quasi-basis. As an application, we establish the Galois correspondence for outer actions of finite groups (and more generally finite dimensional Kac algebras) on simple C^*-algebras. We also introduce the notion of sectors for stable simple C^*-algebras and purely infinite simple C^*-algebras in the Cuntz standard form, and discuss several applications, including their relationship to K-theory.
