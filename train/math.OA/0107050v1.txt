In this paper it is demonstrated that the Kasparov pairing is continuous with respect to the natural topology on the Kasparov groups, so that a KK-equivalence is an isomorphism of topological groups. In addition, we demonstrate that the groups have a natural pseudopolonais structure, and we prove that various KK-structural maps are continuous.
