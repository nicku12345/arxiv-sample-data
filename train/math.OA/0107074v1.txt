We investigate approximation properties for C^*-algebras and their crossed products by actions and coactions by locally compact groups. We show that Haagerup's approximation constant is preserved for crossed products by arbitrary amenable groups, and we show why this is not always true in the non-amenable case. We also examine similar questions for other forms of the approximation property.
