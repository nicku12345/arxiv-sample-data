The main result of this paper is that the k^{\rm th} continuous Hochschild cohomology groups H^k(\cl M,\cl M) and H^k(\cl M,B(H)) of a von Neumann factor {\cl M}\subseteq B(H) of type {\rm II}_1 with property Gamma are zero for all positive integers k. The method of proof involves the construction of hyperfinite subfactors with special properties and a new inequality of Grothendieck type for multilinear maps. We prove joint continuity in the \|\cdot\|_2-norm of separately ultraweakly continuous multilinear maps, and combine these results to reduce to the case of completely bounded cohomology which is already solved.
