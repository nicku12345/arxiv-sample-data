Jordan isomorphisms of rings are defined by two equations. The first one is the equation of additivity while the second one concerns multiplicativity with respect to the so-called Jordan product. In this paper we present results showing that on standard operator algebras over spaces with dimension at least 2, the bijective solutions of that second equation are automatically additive.
