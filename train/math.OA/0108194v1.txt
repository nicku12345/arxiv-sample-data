Let A be a separable unital C*-algebra and let \pi : A \ra \Lc(\Hf) be a faithful representation of A on a separable Hilbert space \Hf such that \pi(A) \cap \Kc(\Hf) = \{0 \}. We show that \Oc_E, the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra associated to the Hilbert A-bimodule E = \Hf \ot_{\C} A, is simple and purely infinite. If A is nuclear and belongs to the bootstrap class to which the UCT applies, then the same applies to \Oc_E. Hence by the Kirchberg-Phillips Theorem the isomorphism class of \Oc_E only depends on the K-theory of A and the class of the unit.
