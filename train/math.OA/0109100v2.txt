We introduce a concept of the bounded rank (with respect to a positive constant) for unital C*-algebras as a modification of the usual real rank and present a series of conditions insuring that bounded and real ranks coincide. These observations are then used to prove that for a given n and K > 0 there exists a separable unital C*-algebra Z_{n}^{K} such that every other separable unital C*-algebra of bounded rank with respect to K at most n is a quotient of Z_{n}^{K}.
