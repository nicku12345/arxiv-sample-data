Using simple operator-valued analytic function considerations several general analytic subordination results for a freely Markovian triple of operator algebras are derived from the analytic subordination result for generalized resolvents in the case of a free increment with amalgamation. This includes a generalization of Biane's subordination result in the case of a unitary free multiplicative increment.
