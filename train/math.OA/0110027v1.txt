We consider a family of Hecke C*-algebras which can be realised as crossed products by semigroups of endomorphisms. We show by dilating representations of the semigroup crossed product that the category of representations of the Hecke algebra is equivalent to the category of continuous unitary representations of a totally disconnected locally compact group.
