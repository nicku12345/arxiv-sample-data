We investigate crossed products of Cuntz algebras by quasi-free actions of abelian groups. We prove that our algebras are AF-embeddable when actions satisfy a certain condition. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition that our algebras become simple and purely infinite, and consequently our algebras are either purely infinite or AF-embeddable when they are simple.
