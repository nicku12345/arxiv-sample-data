We continue our study of the concepts of amenability and co-amenability for algebraic quantum groups in the sense of A. Van Daele and our investigation of their relationship with nuclearity and injectivity. One major tool for our analysis is that every non-degenerate *-representation of the universal C*-algebra associated to an algebraic quantum qroup has a unitary generator which may be described in a concrete way.
