Let G be a locally compact group. We use the canonical operator space structure on the spaces L^p(G) for p \in [1,\infty] introduced by G. Pisier to define operator space analogues OA_p(G) of the classical Figa-Talamanca-Herz algebras A_p(G). If p \in (1,\infty) is arbitrary, then A_p(G) \subset OA_p(G) such that the inclusion is a contraction; if p = 2, then OA_2(G) \cong A(G) as Banachspaces spaces, but not necessarily as operator spaces. We show that OA_p(G) is a completely contractive Banach algebra for each p \in (1,\infty), and that OA_q(G) \subset OA_p(G) completely contractively for amenable G if 1 < p \leq q \leq 2 or 2 \leq q \leq p < \infty. Finally, we characterize the amenability of G through the existence of a bounded approximate identity in OA_p(G) for one (or equivalently for all) p \in (1,\infty).
