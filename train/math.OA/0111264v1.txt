We prove that non-commutative martingale transforms are of weak type (1,1). More precisely, there is an absolute constant C such that if \M is a semi-finite von Neumann algebra and (\M_n)_{n=1}^\infty is an increasing filtration of von Neumann subalgebras of \M then for any non-commutative martingale x=(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty in L^1(\M), adapted to (\M_n)_{n=1}^\infty, and any sequence of signs (\epsilon_n)_{n=1}^\infty, \left\Vert \epsilon_1 x_1 + \sum_{n=2}^N \epsilon_n(x_n -x_{n-1}) \right\Vert_{1,\infty} \leq C \left\Vert x_N \right\Vert_1  for N\geq 2. This generalizes a result of Burkholder from classical martingale theory to non-commutative setting and answers positively a question of Pisier and Xu. As applications, we get the optimal order of the UMD-constants of the Schatten class S^p when p \to \infty. Similarly, we prove that the UMD-constant of the finite dimensional Schatten class S_n^{1} is of order \log(n+1). We also discuss the Pisier-Xu non-commutative Burkholder-Gundy inequalities.
