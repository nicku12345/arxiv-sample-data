We study stability properties of amenable locally compact quantum groups under the bicrossed product construction. We obtain as our main result an equivalence between amenability of the bicrossed product and amenability of the matched quantum groups used as building ingredients of the bicrossed product. Finally, we give examples of non-amenable locally compact quantum groups obtained by a bicrossed product construction.
