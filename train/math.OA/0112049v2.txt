An action of {\mathbb Z}^k is associated to a higher rank graph \Lambda satisfying a mild assumption. This generalises the construction of a topological Markov shift arising from a nonnegative integer matrix. We show that the stable Ruelle algebra of \Lambda is strongly Morita equivalent to C^*(\Lambda). Hence, if \Lambda satisfies the aperiodicity condition, the stable Ruelle algebra is simple, stable and purely infinite.
