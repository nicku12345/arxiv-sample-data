The C^*-algebra associated with the twisted CCR constructed by W. Pusz and S.L. Woronowicz is considered. It is proved that the C^*-algebras corresponding to different values of parameter 0<=\mu<1 are isomorphic. It is proved that Fock representation is faithful on both *-algebra and C^*-algebra levels.
