Let \alpha:G --> G be an endomorphism of a discrete amenable group such that [G:\alpha(G)]<infinity. We study the structure of the C^* algebra generated by the left convolution operators acting on the left regular representation space, along with the isometry of the space induced by the endomorphism.
