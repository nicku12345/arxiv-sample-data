We classify spectrum-preserving endomorphisms of stable continuous-trace C^*-algebras up to inner automorphism by a surjective multiplicative invariant taking values in finite dimensional vector bundles over the spectrum. Specializing to automorphisms, this gives a different approach to results of Phillips and Raeburn.
