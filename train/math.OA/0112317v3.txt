The irreducible *-representations of the polynomial algebra O(S^3_{pq}) of the quantum 3-sphere introduced by Calow and Matthes are classified. The K-groups of its universal C*-algebra are shown to coincide with their classical counterparts. The U(1)-action on O(S^3_{pq}) corresponding for p=1=q to the classical Hopf fibration is proven to be Galois (free). The thus obtained locally trivial Hopf-Galois extension is shown to be relatively projective (admitting a strong connection) and non-cleft. The latter is proven by determining an appropriate Chern-Connes pairing.
