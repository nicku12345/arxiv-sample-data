Binary operations on algebras of observables are studied in the quantum as well as in the classical case. It is shown that certain natural compatibility conditions with the associative product imply the properties which usually are additionally required. In particular, it is proved that locality of a Loday bracket on sections of a one-dimensional vector bundle forces skew-symmetry, i.e. a local Lie algebra structure in the sense of A.A.Kirillov.
