Let F_n, n\geq2, be the free group with n generators, denoted by U_1,U_2,...,U_n. Let C*(F_n) be the full C^*-algebra of F_n. Let \mathcal{X} be the vector subspace of the algebraic tensor product C^*(F_n) \otimes C^*(F_n), spanned by 1\otimes1,U_1\otimes1,...,U_n\otimes1,1\otimes U_1,...,1\otimes U_n. Let || \cdot ||_{\min} and || \cdot ||_{\max} be the minimal and maximal C^* tensor norms on C^*(F_n) \otimes C^*(F_n), and use the same notation for the corresponding (matrix) norms induced on M_k(\mathbb{C})\otimes\mathcal{X}. Identifying \mathcal{X} with the subspace of C^*(F_{2n}) obtained by mapping U_1\otimes1,...,1\otimes U_n into the 2n generators and the identity into the identity, we get a matrix norm || \cdot ||_{C^*(F_{2n})} which dominates the || \cdot ||_{\max} norm, on M_k(\mathbb{C})\otimes\mathcal{X}. In this paper we prove that, with N=2n+1=\dim\mathcal{X}, we have ||X||_{\max} \leq ||X||_{C^*(F_{2n})} \leq (N^2-N)^{1/2} ||X||_{\min}, X\in M_k(\mathbb{C})\otimes\mathcal{X}.
