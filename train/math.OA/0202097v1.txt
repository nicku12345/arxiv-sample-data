Motivated by wavelet analysis, we prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the following data: Solutions to R(h)=h where R is a certain non-positive Ruelle transfer operator; Operators that intertwine a certain class of representations of the C^*-algebra \mathfrak{A}_N on two unitary generators U, V subject to the relation UVU^{-1}=V^N This correspondence enables us to give a criterion for the biorthogonality of a pair of scaling functions and calculate all solutions of the equation R(h)=h in some concrete cases.
