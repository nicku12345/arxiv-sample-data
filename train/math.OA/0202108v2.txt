Given a spectral triple (A,D,H), the functionals on A of the form a -> tau_omega(a|D|^(-t)) are studied, where tau_omega is a singular trace, and omega is a generalised limit. When tau_omega is the Dixmier trace, the unique exponent d giving rise possibly to a non-trivial functional is called Hausdorff dimension, and the corresponding functional the (d-dimensional) Hausdorff functional.   It is shown that the Hausdorff dimension d coincides with the abscissa of convergence of the zeta function of |D|^(-1), and that the set of t's for which there exists a singular trace tau_omega giving rise to a non-trivial functional is an interval containing d. Moreover, the endpoints of such traceability interval have a dimensional interpretation. The corresponding functionals are called Hausdorff-Besicovitch functionals.   These definitions are tested on fractals in R, by computing the mentioned quantities and showing in many cases their correspondence with classical objects. In particular, for self-similar fractals the traceability interval consists only of the Hausdorff dimension, and the corresponding Hausdorff-Besicovitch functional gives rise to the Hausdorff measure. More generally, for any limit fractal, the described functionals do not depend on the generalized limit omega.
