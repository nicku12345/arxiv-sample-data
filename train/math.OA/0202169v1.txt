We characterize the pairs of operator spaces which occur as pairs of Morita equivalence bimodules between non-selfadjoint operator algebras in terms of the mutual relation between the spaces. We obtain a characterization of the operator spaces which are completely isometrically isomorphic to imprimitivity bimodules between some strongly Morita equivalent (in the sense of Rieffel) C*-algebras. As corollaries, we give representation results for such operator spaces.
