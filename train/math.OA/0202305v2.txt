Let A be a Banach algebra. The flip on A \otimes A^\op is defined through A \otimes A^\op \ni a \tensor b \mapsto b \tensor a. If A is ultraprime, \El(A), the algebra of all elementary operators on A, can be algebraically identified with A \otimes A^\op, so that the flip is well defined on \El(\A). We show that the flip on \El(A) is discontinuous if A = K(E) for a reflexive Banach space E with the approximation property.
