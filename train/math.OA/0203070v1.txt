In [BEZ] the notion of a complete one-sided M-ideal for an operator space X was introduced as a generalization of Alfsen and Effros' notion of an M-ideal for a Banach space [AE72]. In particular, various equivalent formulations of complete one-sided M-projections were given. In this paper, some sharper equivalent formulations are given in the special situation that X = \mathcal{A}, a C^*-algebra (in which case the complete left M-projections are simply left multiplication on \mathcal{A} by a fixed orthogonal projection in \mathcal{A} or its multiplier algebra). The proof of the first equivalence makes use of a technique which is of interest in its own right--a way of ``solving'' multi-linear equations in von Neumann algebras. This technique is also applied to show that preduals of von Neumann algebras have no nontrivial complete one-sided M-ideals. In addition, we show that in a C^*-algebra, the intersection of finitely many complete one-sided M-summands need not be a complete one-sided M-summand, unlike the classical situation.
