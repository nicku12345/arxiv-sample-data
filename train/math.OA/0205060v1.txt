Let \delta be a nondegenerate coaction of G on a C*-algebra B, and let H be a closed subgroup of G. The dual action of H on B\times_\delta G is proper and saturated in the sense of Rieffel, and the generalised fixed-point algebra is the crossed product of B by the homogeneous space G/H. The resulting Morita equivalence is a version of Mansfield's imprimitivity theorem which requires neither amenability nor normality of H.
