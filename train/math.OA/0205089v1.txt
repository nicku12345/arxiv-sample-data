We prove a recursion formula for generating functions of certain renormalizations of *-moments of the DT(\delta_0,1)-operator T, involving an operation \odot on formal power series and a transformation E that converts \odot to usual multiplication. This recursion formula is used to prove that all of these generating functions are rational functions, and to find a few of them explicitly.
