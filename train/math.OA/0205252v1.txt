It is known that the generator of a strictly continuous one parameter unitary group in the multiplier algebra of a C^{*}-algebra is affiliated to that C^{*}-algebra . We show that under natural non degeneracy conditions, this self adjoint unbounded operator lies indeed in the (unbounded) multiplier algebra of the Pedersen's ideal of the C^{*}-algebra.
