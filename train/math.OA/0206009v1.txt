In this paper, we study the duality theory of Hopf C^*-algebras in a general ``Hilbert-space-free'' framework. Our particular interests are the ``full duality'' and the ``reduced duality''. In order to study the reduced duality, we define the interesting notion of Fourier algebra of a general Hopf C^*-algebra.
