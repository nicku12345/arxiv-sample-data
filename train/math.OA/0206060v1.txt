Let 1 < p < \infty. It is shown that if G is a discrete group with the approximation property introduced by Haagerup and Kraus, then the non-commutative L_p(VN(G)) space has the operator space approximation property. If, in addition, the group von Neumann algebra VN(G) has the QWEP, i.e. is a quotient of a C^*-algebra with Lance's weak expectation property, then L_p(VN(G)) actually has the completely contractive approximation property and the approximation maps can be chosen to be finite-rank completely contractive multipliers on L_p(VN(G)). Finally, we show that if G is a countable discrete group having the approximation property and VN(G) has the QWEP, then L_p(VN(G)) has a very nice local structure, i.e. it is a \mathcal C\OL_p space and has a completely bounded Schauder basis.
