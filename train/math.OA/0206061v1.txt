We study the local operator space structure of nuclear C^*-algebras. It is shown that a C^*-algebra is nuclear if and only if it is an \OL_{\infty, \la} space for some (and actually for every) \la > 6. The \OL_\infty constant \lambda provides an interesting invariant \[ \OL_\infty (\A) = \inf\{\la: ~ \A ~{\rm is ~ an} ~ {\OL}_{\infty, \la} ~ {\rm space}\} \] for nuclear C^*-algebras. Indeed, if \A is a nuclear C^*-algebra, then we have 1\le \OL_\infty (\A) \le 6, and if \A is a unital nuclear C^*-algebra with \OL_{\infty} (\A) \le (\frac {1+{\sqrt 5}}2)^{\frac 12}, we show that \A must be stably finite.   We also investigate the connection between the rigid \OL_{\infty, 1^+} structure and the rigid complete order \OL_{\infty, 1^+} structure on C^*-algebras, where the latter structure has been studied by Blackadar and Kirchberg in their characterization of strong NF C^*-algebras. Another main result of this paper is to show that these two local structrues are actually equivalent on unital nuclear C^*-algebras. We obtain this by showing that if a unital (nuclear) C^*-algebra is a rigid {\OL}_{\infty, 1^+} space, then it is inner quasi-diagonal, and thus is a strong NF algebra. It is also shown that if a unital (nuclear) C^*-algebra is an {\OL}_{\infty, 1^+} space, then it is quasi-diagonal, and thus is an NF algebra.
