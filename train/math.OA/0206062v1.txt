Let 1\le p<\8 and (x_n)_{\nen} be a sequence of positive elements in a non-commutative L_p space and (E_n)_{\nen} be an increasing sequence of conditional expectations, then the L_p norm of \sum_n E_n(x_n) can be estimated by c_p times the L_p norm of \sum_n x_n. This inequality is due to Burkholder, Davis and Gundy in the commutative case. By duality, we obtain a version of Doob's maximal inequality for 1<p\le \8.
