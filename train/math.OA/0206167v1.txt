We establish connections between the lattices of non-crossing partitions of type B introduced by V. Reiner, and the framework of the free probability theory of D. Voiculescu.   Lattices of non-crossing partitions (of type A, up to now) have played an important role in the combinatorics of free probability, primarily via the non-crossing cumulants of R. Speicher. Here we introduce the concept of {\em non-crossing cumulant of type B;} the inspiration for its definition is found by looking at an operation of ``restricted convolution of multiplicative functions'', studied in parallel for functions on symmetric groups (in type A) and on hyperoctahedral groups (in type B).   The non-crossing cumulants of type B live in an appropriate framework of ``non-commutative probability space of type B'', and are closely related to a type B analogue for the R-transform of Voiculescu (which is the free probabilistic counterpart of the Fourier transform). By starting from a condition of ``vanishing of mixed cumulants of type B'', we obtain an analogue of type B for the concept of free independence for random variables in a non-commutative probability space.
