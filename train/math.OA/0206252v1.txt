In this paper we give a criterion for an ideal of a TAF algebra to be meet irreducible. We show that an ideal J of A is meet irreducile if and only if the C^*-envelope of the quotient A/J is primitive. In that case, A/J admits a nest representation which extends to a *-representation of the C^*-envelope for A/J. We also characterize the meet irreducible ideals as the kernels of nest representations; this settles the question of whether the n-primitive and meet irreducible ideals coincide.
