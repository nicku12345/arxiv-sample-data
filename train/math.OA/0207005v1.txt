For each 1<s<\infty, a Popa algebra A_s is constructed that embeds as a weakly dense C*-subalgebra of the interpolated free group factor L(F_s). Certain approximation properties for A_s are shown. It follows that L(F_s) has the weak expectation property of Lance with respect to A_s. In the course of the demonstration, it is proved that under certain conditions, full amalgamated free products of matrix algebras are residually finite dimensional.
