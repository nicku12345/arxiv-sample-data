Motivated by existence problems for dissipative systems arising naturally in lattice models from quantum statistical mechanics, we consider the following C^{\ast}-algebraic setting: A given hermitian dissipative mapping \delta is densely defined in a unital C^{\ast}-algebra \mathfrak{A}. The identity element in {\frak A} is also in the domain of \delta. Completely dissipative maps \delta are defined by the requirement that the induced maps, (a_{ij})\to (\delta (a_{ij})), are dissipative on the n by n complex matrices over {\frak A} for all n. We establish the existence of different types of maximal extensions of completely dissipative maps. If the enveloping von Neumann algebra of {\frak A} is injective, we show the existence of an extension of \delta which is the infinitesimal generator of a quantum dynamical semigroup of completely positive maps in the von Neumann algebra. If \delta is a given well-behaved *-derivation, then we show that each of the maps \delta and -\delta is completely dissipative.
