In the present paper we continue the study of the structure of a Banach algebra B(A, T_g) generated by a certain Banach algebra A of operators acting in a Banach space D and a group {T_g}_{g \in G} of isometries of D such that T_g A T^{-1}_g = A. We investigate the interrelations between the existence of the expectation of B(A, T_g) onto A, metrical freedom of the automorphisms of A induced by T_g and the dual action of the group G on B(A, T_g). The results obtained are applied to the description of the structure of Banach algebras generated by 'weighted composition operators' acting in Lebesgue spaces.
