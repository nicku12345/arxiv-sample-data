We prove that a type II_1 factor M can have at most one Cartan subalgebra A satisfying a combination of rigidity and compact approximation properties. We use this result to show that within the class \Cal H \Cal T of factors M having such Cartan subalgebras A \subset M, the Betti numbers of the standard equivalence relation associated with A \subset M ([G2]), are in fact isomorphism invariants for the factors M, \beta^{^{HT}}_n(M), n\geq 0. The class \Cal H\Cal T is closed under amplifications and tensor products, with the Betti numbers satisfying \beta^{^{HT}}_n(M^t)= \beta^{^{HT}}_n(M)/t, \forall t>0, and a K{\"u}nneth type formula. An example of a factor in the class \Cal H\Cal T is given by the group von Neumann factor M=L(\Bbb Z^2 \rtimes SL(2, \Bbb Z)), for which \beta^{^{HT}}_1(M) = \beta_1(SL(2, \Bbb Z)) = 1/12. Thus, M^t \not\simeq M, \forall t \neq 1, showing that the fundamental group of M is trivial. This solves a long standing problem of R.V. Kadison. Also, our results bring some insight into a recent problem of A. Connes and answer a number of open questions on von Neumann algebras.
