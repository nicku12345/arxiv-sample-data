The Bratteli diagram is an infinite graph which reflects the structure of projections in a C*-algebra. We prove that every strictly ergodic unimodular Bratteli diagram of rank 2g+m-1 gives rise to a minimal geodesic lamination with the m-component principal region on a surface of genus g greater or equal to 1. The proof is based on the Morse theory of the recurrent geodesics on the hyperbolic surfaces.
