Suppose B is an ultraproduct of finite dimensional C^\ast-algebras. We consider mapping and injectability properties for separable C^\ast-algebras into B. In the case of approximately finite C^\ast-algebras, we obtain a classification of these mappings up to inner conjugacy. Using a Theorem of Voiculescu, we show that for nuclear C^\ast-algebras injectability into an ultraproduct of finite dimensional C^\ast-algebras is equivalent to quasidiagonality.
