A Krishnan-Sunder subfactor R_U \ss R of index k^2 is constructed from a permutation biunitary matrix U\in M_p(\mathbb{C})\otimes M_k(\mathbb{C}), i.e. the entries of U are either 0 or 1 and both U and its block transpose are unitary. The author previously showed that every irreducible Krishnan-Sunder subfactor has an intermediate subfactor by exhibiting the associated Bisch projection. The author has also shown in a separate paper that the principal and dual graphs of the intermediate subfactor are the same as those of the subfactor R^{\grp} \ss R^{H}, where H\ss \grp is an inclusion of finite groups with an outer action on R. In this paper we give a direct proof that the intermediate subfactor is isomorphic to R^{\grp} \ss R^{H}.
