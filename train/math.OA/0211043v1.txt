We introduce notions of dimension and dynamical entropy for unital C*-algebras ``metrized'' by means of c-Lip-norms, which are complex-scalar versions of the Lip-norms constitutive of Rieffel's compact quantum metric spaces. Our examples involve UHF algebras and noncommutative tori. In particular we show that the entropy of a noncommutative toral automorphism with respect to the canonical c-Lip-norm coincides with the topological entropy of its commutative analogue.
