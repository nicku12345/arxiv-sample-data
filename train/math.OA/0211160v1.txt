We construct a new bivariant theory, that we call KE-theory, which is intermediate between the KK-theory of G. G. Kasparov, and the E-theory of A. Connes and N. Higson. For each pair of separable graded C^*-algebras A and B, acted upon by a locally compact \sigma-compact group G, we define an abelian group KE_G(A,B). We show that there is an associative product KE_G(A,D) \otimes KE_G(D,B) \to KE_G(A,B). Various functoriality properties of the KE-theory groups and of the product are presented. The new theory has a simpler product than KK-theory and there are natural transformations KK_G \to KE_G and KE_G \to E_G. The complete description of these maps will form the substance of a second paper.
