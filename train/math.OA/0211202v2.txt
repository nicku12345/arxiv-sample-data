We summarize and deepen recent results on systems of orthogonal pure states on operator algebras. Especially, we focus on noncommutative generalizations of some principles of topology of locally compact spaces such as exposining points by continuous functions, separating sets by continuous functions, and multiplicativity of pure states.
