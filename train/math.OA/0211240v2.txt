On a 6-dimensional, conformal, oriented, compact manifold M without boundary, we compute a whole family of differential forms \Omega_6(f,h) of order 6, with f,h \in C^\infty(M). Each of these forms will be symmetric on f, and h, conformally invariant, and such that \int_M f_0 \Omega_6(f_1,f_2) defines a Hochschild 2-cocycle over the algebra C^\infty(M). In the particular 6-dimensional conformally flat case, we compute the unique one satisfying \Wres(f_0[F,f][F,h]) = \int_M f_0\Omega_6(f,h) for (\cH,F) the Fredholm module associated by A. Connes \cite{Con1} to the manifold M, and \Wres the Wodzicki residue.
