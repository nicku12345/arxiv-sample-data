Let G be a locally compact group. We show that its Fourier algebra A(G) is amenable if and only if G has an abelian subgroup of finite index, and that its Fourier-Stieltjes algebra B(G) is amenable if and only if G has a compact, abelian subgroup of finite index. We then show that A(G) is weakly amenable if the component of the identity of G is abelian, and we prove some partial results towards the converse.
