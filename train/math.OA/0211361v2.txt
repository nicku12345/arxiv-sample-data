For a pseudodifferential operator S of order 0 acting on sections of a vector bundle B on a compact manifold M without boundary, we associate a differential form of order dimension of M acting on C^\infty(M)\times C^\infty(M). This differential form \Omega_{n,S} is given in terms of the Wodzicki 1-density \wres([S,f][S,h]). In the particular case of an even dimensional, compact, conformal manifold without boundary, we study this differential form for the case (B,S)=(\cH,F), that is, the Fredholm module associated by A. Connes to the manifold M. We give its explicit expression in the flat case and then we address the general case.
