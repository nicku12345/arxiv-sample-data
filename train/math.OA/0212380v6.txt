Let F\subseteq H\subseteq G be closed subgroups of a locally compact group. In response to a 1972 question by Eymard, we construct an example where the homogeneous factor-space G/F is amenable in the sense of Eymard-Greenleaf, while H/F is not. (In our example, G is discrete.) As a corollary which answers a 1990 question by Bekka, the induced representation \ind_H^G(\rho) can be amenable in the sense of Bekka even if \rho is not amenable. The second example, answering another question by Bekka, shows that \ind_H^G(\rho) need not be amenable even if both the representation \rho and the coset space G/H are amenable.
