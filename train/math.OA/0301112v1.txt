We previously introduced the class of DT--operators, which are modeled by certain upper triangular random matrices, and showed that if the spectrum of a DT-operator is not reduced to a single point, then it has a nontrivial, closed, hyperinvariant subspace. In this paper, we prove that also every DT-operator whose spectrum is concentrated on a single point has a nontrivial, closed, hyperinvariant subspace. In fact, each such operator has a one-parameter family of them. It follows that every DT-operator generates the von Neumann algebra L(F_2) of the free group on two generators.
