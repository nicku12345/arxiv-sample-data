We consider the topological entropy of state space and quasi-state space homeomorphisms induced from C*-algebra automorphisms. Our main result asserts that, for automorphisms of separable exact C*-algebras, zero Voiculescu-Brown entropy implies zero topological entropy on the quasi-state space (and also more generally on the entire unit ball of the dual). As an application we obtain a simple description of the topological Pinsker algebra in terms of local Voiculescu-Brown entropy.
