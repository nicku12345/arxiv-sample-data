We show that Ozawa's recent results on solid von Neumann algebras imply that there are free Araki-Woods factors, which fail to have free absorption. We also show that a free Araki-Woods factors \Gamma (\mu, n) associated to a measure and a multiplicity function n may non-trivially depend on the multiplicity function.
