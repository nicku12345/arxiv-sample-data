Let A be a separable unital nuclear purely infinite simple C*-algebra satisfying the Universal Coefficient Theorem, and such that the K_0-class of the identity is zero. We prove that every automorphism of order two of the K-theory of A is implemented by an automorphism of A of order two. As a consequence, we prove that every countable Z/2Z-graded module over the representation ring of Z/2Z is isomorphic to the equivariant K-theory for some action of Z/2Z on a separable unital nuclear purely infinite simple C*-algebra.   Along the way, we prove that every not necessarily finitely generated module over the group ring of Z/2Z which is free as an abelian group has a direct sum decomposition with only three kinds of summands, namely the group ring itself and Z on which the nontrivial element of Z/2Z acts either trivially or by multiplication by -1.
