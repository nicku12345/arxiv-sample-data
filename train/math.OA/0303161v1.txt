We characterize positive topological entropy for quasi-state space homeomorphisms induced from C^*-algebra automorphisms in terms of dynamically generated subspaces isomorphic to \ell_1. This geometric condition is also used to give a description of the topological Pinsker algebra. In particular we obtain a geometric characterization of positive entropy for topological dynamical systems, as well as an analogue for completely positive topological entropy of Glasner and Weiss's combinatorial characterization of completely positive Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.
