Column and row operator spaces - which we denote by COL and ROW, respectively - over arbitrary Banach spaces were introduced by the first-named author; for Hilbert spaces, these definitions coincide with the usual ones. Given a locally compact group G and p,p' \in (1,\infty) with \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{p'} = 1, we use the operator space structure on CB(COL(L^{p'}(G))) to equip the Figa-Talamanca-Herz algebra A_p(G) with an operator space structure, turning it into a quantized Banach algebra. Moreover, we show that, for p \leq q \leq 2 or 2 \leq q \leq p and amenable G, the canonical inclusion A_q(G) \subset A_p(G) is completely bounded (with cb-norm at most K_G^2, where K_G is Grothendieck's constant). As an application, we show that G is amenable if and only if A_p(G) is operator amenable for all - and equivalently for one - p \in (1,\infty); this extends a theorem by Z.-J. Ruan.
