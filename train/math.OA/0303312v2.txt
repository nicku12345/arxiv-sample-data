We study the set S_{ann-nc} of permutations of \{1, ..., p+q \} which are non-crossing in an annulus with p points marked on its external circle and q points marked on its internal circle. The algebraic approach to S_{ann-nc} goes by identifying three possible crossing patterns in an annulus, and by defining a permutation to be annular non-crossing when it does not display any of these patterns. We prove the annular counterpart for a ``geodesic condition'' shown by Biane to characterize non-crossing permutations in a disc. We point out that, as a consequence, annular non-crossing permutations appear in the description of the second order asymptotics for the joint moments of certain families (Wishart and GUE) of random matrices. We examine the relation between S_{ann-nc} and the set NC_{ann} of annular non-crossing partitions of \{1, ..., p+q \}, and observe that (unlike in the disc case) the natural map from S_{ann-nc} onto NC_{ann} has a pathology which prevents it from being injective.
