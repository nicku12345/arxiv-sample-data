This paper formulates Young-type inequalities for singular values (or s-numbers) and traces in the context of von Neumann algebras. In particular, it shown that if \t(\cdot) is a faithful semifinite normal trace on a semifinite von Neumann algebra M and if p and q are positive real numbers for which p^{-1}+q^{-1}=1, then, for all positive operators a,b\in M, \t(|ab|)\le p^{-1}\t(a^p)+ q^{-1}\t(b^q), with equality holding (in the cases where p^{-1}\t(a^p)+ q^{-1}\t(b^q)<\infty) if and only if b^q=a^p.
