An inclusion of II_1 factors N \subset M with finite Jones index gives rise to a powerful set of invariants that can be approached successfully in a number of different ways. We describe Jones' pictorial description of the standard invariant of a subfactor as a so-called planar algebra and show how this point of view leads to new structure results for subfactors.
