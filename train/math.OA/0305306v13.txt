We consider cross-product II_1 factors M = N\rtimes_{\sigma} G, with G discrete ICC groups that contain infinite normal subgroups with the relative property (T) and \sigma: G \to {\text{\rm Aut}}N trace preserving actions of G on finite von Neumann algebras N that are ``malleable'' and mixing. Examples are the weighted Bernoulli and Bogoliubov shifts. We prove a rigidity result for such factors, showing the uniqueness of the position of L(G) inside M. We use this to calculate the fundamental group \mycal F(M) in terms of the weights of the shift, for certain arithmetic groups G such as G=\Bbb Z^2 \rtimes SL(2, \Bbb Z). We deduce that for any countable group S \subset \Bbb R_+^* there exist II_1 factors M with \mycal F(M)=S, thus bringing new light to a longstanding problem of Murray and von Neumann.
