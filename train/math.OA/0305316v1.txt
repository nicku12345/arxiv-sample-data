The main thrust of present note is a volume formula for hyperbolic surface bundle with the fundamental group G.   The novelty consists in a purely algebraic approach to the above problem. Initially, we concentrate on the Baum-Connes morphism m(G): K(BG)--> K(C*G) for our class of manifolds, and then classify m(G) in terms of the ideals in the ring of integers of a quadratic number field K. Next, we extract the topological data (e.g. volume of the orbifold H/G) from the arithmetic of field K.
