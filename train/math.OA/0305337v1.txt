Partial actions of discrete abelian groups can be used to construct both groupoid C*-algebras and partial crossed product algebras. In each case there is a natural notion of an analytic subalgebra. We show that for countable subgroups of the real numbers and free partial actions, these constructions yield the same C*-algebras and the same analytic subalgebras. We also show that under suitable hypotheses an analytic partial crossed product preserves all the information in the dynamical system in the sense that two analytic partial crossed products are isomorphic as Banach algebras if, and only if, the partial actions are conjugate.
