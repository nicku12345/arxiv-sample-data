Using free random varaibles we find an embedding of the operator space OH in the predual of a von Neumann algebra. The properties of this embedding allow us to determined the projection constant of OH_n, i.e. there exists a projection P:B(\ell_2)\to OH_n whose completely bounded norm behaves as n^{1/2}/(1+ln n)^{1/2}. According to recent results of Pisier/Shlyahtenko, the lower bound holds for every projection. Improving a previous estimate of order (1+ ln n) of the author, Pisier/Shlyahtenko obtained a `logarithmic little Grothendieck inequality'. We find a second proof of this inequality which explains why the factor \sqrt{1+\ln n} is indeed necessary. In particular the operator space version of the `little Grothendieck inequality' fails to hold. This `logarithmic little Grothendieck' inequality characterizes C^*-algebras with the weak expectation property of Lance.
