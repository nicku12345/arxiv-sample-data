We consider two von Neumann subalgebras \cl B_0 and \cl B of a type {\rm{II}}_1 factor \cl N. For a map \phi on \cl N, we define \[\|\phi \|_{\infty,2}=\sup\{\|\phi(x)\|_2\colon \|x\| \leq 1\},\] and we measure the distance between \cl B_0 and \cl B by the quantity \|{\bb E}_{\cl B_0}-{\bb E}_{\cl B}\|_{\infty,2}. Under the hypothesis that the relative commutant in \cl N of each algebra is equal to its center, we prove that close subalgebras have large compressions which are spatially isomorphic by a partial isometry close to 1 in the \|\cdot \|_2--norm. This hypothesis is satisfied, in particular, by masas and subfactors of trivial relative commutant. A general version with a slightly weaker conclusion is also proved. As a consequence, we show that if \cl A is a masa and u\in\cl N is a unitary such that \cl A and u\cl Au^* are close, then u must be close to a unitary which normalizes \cl A. These qualitative statements are given quantitative formulations in the paper.
