For each 2 \leq n \leq \infty, we construct an uncountable family of free ergodic measure preserving actions \alpha_t of the free group \Bbb F_n on the standard probability space (X, \mu) such that any two are non orbit equivalent (in fact, not even stably orbit equivalent). These actions are all ``rigid'' (in the sense of [Po01]), with the II_1 factors L^\infty(X, \mu)\rtimes_{\alpha_t} \Bbb F_n mutually non stably isomorphic (even non-stably isomorphic) and in the class \Cal H\Cal T_{_{s}}.
