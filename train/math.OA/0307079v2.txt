For an operator bimodule X over von Neumann algebras A\subseteq\bh and B\subseteq\bk, the space of all completely bounded A,B-bimodule maps from X into \bkh, is the bimodule dual of X. Basic duality theory is developed with a particular attention to the Haagerup tensor product over von Neumann algebras. To X a normal operator bimodule \nor{X} is associated so that completely bounded A,B-bimodule maps from X into normal operator bimodules factorize uniquely through \nor{X}. A construction of \nor{X} in terms of biduals of X, A and B is presented. Various operator bimodule structures are considered on a Banach bimodule admitting a normal such structure.
