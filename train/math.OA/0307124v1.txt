We study that natural inclusions C^b(X) \tensor A into C^b(X,A) and C^b(X, C^b(Y)) into C^b(X \times Y). In particular, excepting trivial cases, both these maps are isomorphisms only when X and Y are pseudocompact. This implies a result of Glicksberg showing that the Stone-Cech compactificiation \beta(X \times Y) is naturally identified with \beta X \times \beta Y if and only if X and Y are pseudocompact.
