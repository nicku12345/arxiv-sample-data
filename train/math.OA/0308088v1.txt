Given a von Neumann algebra M and a W^{\ast}-correspondence E over M, we construct an algebra H^{\infty}(E) that we call the Hardy algebra of E. When M=\mathbb{C}=E, then H^{\infty}(E) is the classical Hardy space H^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}) of bounded analytic functions on the unit disc. We show that given any faithful normal representation \sigma of M on a Hilbert space H there is a natural correspondence E^{\sigma} over the commutant \sigma(M)^{\prime}, called the \sigma-dual of E, and that H^{\infty}(E) can be realized in terms of (B(H)-valued) functions on the open unit ball \mathbb{D}((E^{\sigma})^{\ast}) in the space of adjoints of elements in E^{\sigma}. We prove analogues of the Nevanlinna-Pick theorem in this setting and discover other aspects of the value ``distribution theory'' for elements in H^{\infty}(E). We also analyze the ``boundary behavior'' of elements in H^{\infty}(E) and obtain generalizations of the Sz.-Nagy--Foia\c {s} functional calculus. The correspondence E^{\sigma} has a dual that is naturally isomorphic to E and the commutants of certain, so-called induced representations of H^{\infty}(E) can be viewed as induced representations of H^{\infty}(E^{\sigma}). For these induced representations a double commutant theorem is proved.
