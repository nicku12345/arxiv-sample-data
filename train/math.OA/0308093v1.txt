We give an general estimate for the non-microstates free entropy dimension \delta ^{*}(X_{1},..., X_{n}). If X_{1},..., X_{n} generate a diffuse von Neumann algebra, we prove that \delta ^{*}(X_{1},..., X_{n})\geq 1. In the case that X_{1},..., X_{n} are q-semicircular variables as introduced by Bozejko and Speicher and q^{2}n<1, we show that \delta ^{*}(X_{1},..., X_{n})>1. We also show that for |q|<\sqrt{2}-1, the von Neumann algebras generated by a finite family of q-Gaussian random variables satisfy a condition of Ozawa and are therefore solid: the relative commutant of any diffuse subalgebra must be hyperfinite. In particular, when these algebras are factors, they are prime and do not have property \Gamma .
