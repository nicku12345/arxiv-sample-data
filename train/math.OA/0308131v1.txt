Several years ago, O. Bratelli and P. Jorgensen developed the concept of m-systems of filters for dilation by a positive integer N>1 on L^2(R). They constructed a loop group action on m-systems. By work of Mallat and Meyer, these m-systems are important in constructing multi-resolution analyses and wavelets associated to dilation by N and translation by Z on L^2(R). In this paper, we discuss an extension of this loop-group construction to generalized filter systems, which we will call ``M-systems,'' associated with generalized multiresolution analyses. In particular, we show that every multiplicity function has an associated generalized loop group which acts freely and transitively on the set of M-systems corresponding to the multiplicity function. The results of Bratteli and Jorgensen correspond to the case where the multiplicity function is identically equal to 1.
