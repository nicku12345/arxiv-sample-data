We define the notion of "projective" multiresolution analyses, for which, by definition, the initial space corresponds to a finitely generated projective module over the algebra C(\btn) of continuous complex-valued functions on an n-torus. The case of ordinary multi-wavelets is that in which the projective module is actually free. We discuss the properties of projective multiresolution analyses, including the frames which they provide for L^2(\brn). Then we show how to construct examples for the case of any diagonal 2 \times 2 dilation matrix with integer entries, with initial module specified to be any fixed finitely generated projective C(\mathbb T^2)-module. We compute the isomorphism classes of the corresponding wavelet modules.
