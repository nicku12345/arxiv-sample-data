The Fourier and Fourier-Stieltjes algebras A(G) and B(G) of a locally compact group G are introduced and studied in 60's by Piere Eymard in his PhD thesis. If G is a locally compact abelian group, then A(G)\simeq L^1(\hat{G}), and B(G)\simeq M(\hat{G}), via the Fourier and Fourier-Stieltjes transforms, where \hat{G} is the Pontryagin dual of G. Recently these algebras are defined on a (topological or measured) groupoid and have shown to share many common features with the group case. This is the last in a series of papers in which we have investigated a "restricted" form of these algebras on a unital inverse semigroup S.
