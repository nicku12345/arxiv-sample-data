The theory of one-sided M-ideals and multipliers of operator spaces is simultaneously a generalization of classical M-ideals, ideals in operator algebras, and aspects of the theory of Hilbert C^*-modules and their maps. Here we give a systematic exposition of this theory; a reference tool for `noncommutative functional analysts' who may encounter a one-sided M-ideal or multiplier in their work.
