Iteration of a rational function R gives a complex dynamical system on the Riemann sphere. We introduce a C^*-algebra {\mathcal O}_R associated with R as a Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of a Hilbert bimodule over the algebra A = C(J_R) of continuous functions on the Julia set J_R of R. The algebra {\mathcal O}_R is a certain analog of the crossed product by a boundary action. We show that if the degree of R is at least two, then C^*-algebra {\mathcal O}_R is simple and purely infinite. For example if R(z) = z^2 - 2, then the Julia set J_R = [-2,2] and the restriction R : J_R \to J_R is topologically conjugate to the tent map on [0,1]. The algebra {\mathcal O}_{z^2 - 2} is isomorphic to the Cuntz algebra {\mathcal O}_{\infty}. We also show that the Lyubich measure associated with R gives a unique KMS state on the C^*-algebra {\mathcal O}_R for the gauge action at inverse temperature \log (\deg R) if the Julia set contains no critical points.
