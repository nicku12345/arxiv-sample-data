We study the ideal structure of C^*-algebras arising from C^*-correspondences. We prove that gauge-invariant ideals of our C^*-algebras are parameterized by certain pairs of ideals of original C^*-algebras. We show that our C^*-algebras have a nice property which should be possessed by generalization of crossed products. Applications to crossed products by Hilbert C^*-bimodules and relative Cuntz-Pimsner algebras are also discussed.
