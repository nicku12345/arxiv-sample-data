We define the notion of L^2 homology and L^2 Betti numbers for a tracial von Neumann algebra, or, more generally, for any involutive algebra with a trace. The definition of these invariants is obtained from the definition of L^2 homology for groups, using the ideas from the theory of correspondences. For the group algebra of a discrete group, our Betti numbers coincide with the L^2 Betti numbers of the group. We find a link between the first L^2 Betti number and free entropy dimension, which points to the non-vanishing of L^2 homology for the von Neumann algebra of a free group.
