We show that the representations of the Cuntz C^\ast-algebras O_n which arise in wavelet analysis and dilation theory can be classified through a simple analysis of completely positive maps on finite-dimensional space. Based on this analysis, an application in quantum information theory is obtained; namely, a structure theorem for the fixed point set of a unital quantum channel. We also include some open problems motivated by this work.
