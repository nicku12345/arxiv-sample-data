A free semigroupoid algebra is the weak operator topology closed algebra generated by the left regular representation of a directed graph. We establish lattice isomorphisms between ideals and invariant subspaces, and this leads to a complete description of the weak operator topology closed ideal structure for these algebras. We prove a distance formula to ideals, and this gives an appropriate version of the Caratheodory interpolation theorem. Our analysis rests on an investigation of predual properties, specifically the A_n properties for linear functionals, together with a general Wold Decomposition for n-tuples of partial isometries. A number of our proofs unify proofs for subclasses appearing in the literature.
