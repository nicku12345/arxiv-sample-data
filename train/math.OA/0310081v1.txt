In this paper we obtain a multivariable commutator lifting inequality, which extends to several variables a recent result of Foias, Frazho, and Kaashoek. The inequality yields a multivariable lifting theorem generalizing the noncommutative commutant lifting theorem. This is used to solve new operator-valued interpolation problems of Schur-Caratheodory, Nevanlinna-Pick, and Sarason type on Fock spaces. Some consequences to norm constrained analytic interpolation in the unit ball of C^n are also considered.
