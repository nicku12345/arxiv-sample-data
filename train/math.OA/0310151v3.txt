Let G be a locally compact group, and let WAP(G) denote the space of weakly almost periodic functions on G. We show that, if G is a [SIN]-group, but not compact, then the dual Banach algebra WAP(G)^\ast does not have a normal, virtual diagonal. Consequently, whenever G is an amenable, non-compact [SIN]-group, WAP(G)^\ast is an example of a Connes-amenable, dual Banach algebra without a normal,virtual diagonal.
