H^2\zProd denotes the Hardy space of square integrable functions analytic in each variable separately. Let P^{\ominus} be the natural projection of L^2\zProd onto \z8{H^2\zProd}. A Hankel operator with symbol b is the linear operator from H^2\zProd to \z8{H^2\zProd} given by H_b \zvf=P^{\ominus}\bar b \zvf. We show that \md0 \norm H_b ..\simeq \norm P^{\oplus}b.BMO\zProd., \emd where the right hand norm is S.-Y. Chang and R. Fefferman product BMO. This fact has well known equivalences in terms of commutators and the weak factorization of H^1\zProd. In the case of two complex variables, this is due to Ferguson and Lacey \cite{MR1961195}. While the current proof is inductive, and one can take the one complex variable case as the basis step, it is heavily influenced by the methods of Ferguson and Lacey.   The induction is carried out with a particular form of a lemma due to Journ\'e \cite{MR87g:42028}, which occurs implicitly in the work of J. Pipher \cite{MR88a:42019}.
