We consider C*-algebras generated by a single Hilbert bimodule (Pimsner-Toeplitz algebras) and by a product systems of Hilbert bimodules. We give a new proof of a theorem of Pimsner, which states that any representation of the generating bimodule gives rise to a representation of the Pimsner-Toeplitz algebra. Our proof does not make use of the conditional expectation onto the subalgebra invariant under the dual action of the circle group. We then prove the analogous statement for the case of product systems, generalizing a theorem of Arveson from the case of product systems of Hilbert spaces.
