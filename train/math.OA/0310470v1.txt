We formulate a version of Baum-Connes' conjecture for a discrete quantum group, building on our earlier work (\cite{GK}). Given such a quantum group \cla, we construct a directed family \{\cle_F \} of C^*-algebras (F varying over some suitable index set), borrowing the ideas of \cite{cuntz}, such that there is a natural action of \cla on each \cle_F satisfying the assumptions of \cite{GK}, which makes it possible to define the "analytical assembly map", say \mu^{r,F}_i, i=0,1, as in \cite{GK}, from the \cla-equivariant K-homolgy groups of \cle_F to the K-theory groups of the "reduced" dual \hat{\cla_r} (c.f. \cite{GK} and the references therein for more details). As a result, we can define the Baum-Connes' maps \mu^r_i : \stackrel{\rm lim}{\longrightarrow} KK_i^\cla(\cle_F,\IC) \raro K_i(\hat{\cla_r}), and in the classical case, i.e. when \cla is C_0(G) for a discrete group, the isomorphism of the above maps for i=0,1 is equivalent to the Baum-Connes' conjecture. Furthermore, we verify its truth for an arbitrary finite dimensional quantum group and obtain partial results for the dual of SU_q(2).
