We consider the semigroup Ext(A,B) of extensions of a separable C*-algebra A by a stable C*-algebra B modulo unitary equivalence and modulo asymptotically split extensions. This semigroup contains the group Ext^{-1/2}(A,B) of invertible elements (i.e. of semi-invertible extensions). We show that the functor Ext^{1/2}(A,B) is homotopy invariant and that it coincides with the functor of homotopy classes of asymptotic homomorphisms from C(\mathbb T)\otimes A to M(B) that map SA\subseteq C(\mathbb T)\otimes A into B.
