Let A, B be C*-algebras; A separable, B \sigma-unital and stable. We introduce a notion of translation invariance for asymptotic homomorphisms from SA=C_0(\mathbb R)\otimes A to B and show that the Connes-Higson construction applied to any extension of A by B is homotopic to a translation invariant asymptotic homomorphism. In the other direction we give a construction which produces extensions of A by B out of such a translation invariant asymptotic homomorphism. This leads to our main result; that the homotopy classes of extensions coincide with the homotopy classes of translation invariant asymptotic homomorphisms.
