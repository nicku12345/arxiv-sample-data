We give a systematic study on the Hardy spaces of functions with values in the non-commutative L^p-spaces associated with a semifinite von Neumann algebra {\cal}M. This is motivated by the works on matrix valued Harmonic Analysis (operator weighted norm inequalities, operator Hilbert transform), and on the other hand, by the recent development on the non-commutative martingale inequalities. Our non-commutative Hardy spaces are defined by the non-commutative Lusin integral function.
