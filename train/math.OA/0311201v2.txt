As a generalization of the free semigroup algebras considered by Davidson and Pitts, and others, the second author and D.W. Kribs initiated a study of reflexive algebras associated with directed graphs. A free semigroupoid algebra L_G is generated by a family of partial isometries, and initial projections, acting on a generalized Fock space spawned from the directed graph G. We show that if the graph is finite then the algebra L_G is hyper-reflexive.
