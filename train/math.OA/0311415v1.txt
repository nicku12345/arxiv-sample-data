We show that unital simple C*-algebras with tracial topological rank zero which are locally approximated by subhomogeneous C^-algebras can be classified by their ordered K-theory. We apply this classification result to show that certain simple crossed products are isomorphic if they have the same ordered K-theory. In particular, irrational higher dimensional non-commutative tori of the form C({\mathbb T}^k)\times_{\theta}{\mathbb Z} are in fact inductive limits of circle algebras.
