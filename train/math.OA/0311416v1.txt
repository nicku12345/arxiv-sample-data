The basic notion of the article is a pair (A,U), where A is a commutative C*-algebra and U is a partial isometry such that mapping U()U* is an endomorphism of A and U*U belongs to A. We give a description of the maximal ideal space of the smallest coefficient C*-algebra of the algebra C*(A,U) generated by the system (A,U).
