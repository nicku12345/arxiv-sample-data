Let 1 \in A \subset B be an inclusion of C*-algebras of C*-index-finite type with depth 2. We try to compute topological stable rank of B (= \tsr(B)) when A has topological stable rank one. We show that \tsr(B) \leq 2 when A is a tsr boundedly divisible algebra, in particular, A is a C*-minimal tensor product UHF \otimes   D with \tsr(D) = 1. When G is a finite group and \alpha is an action of G on UHF, we know that a crossed product algebra UHF \rtimes_\alpha G has topological stable rank less than or equal to two.   These results are affirmative datum to a generalization of a question by B. Blackadar in 1988.
