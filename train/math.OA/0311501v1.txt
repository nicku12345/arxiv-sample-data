We show that, if a simple C^{*}-algebra A is topologically finite-dimensional in a suitable sense, then not only K_{0}(A) has certain good properties, but A is even accessible to Elliott's classification program. More precisely, we prove the following results: If A is simple, separable and unital with finite decomposition rank and real rank zero, then K_{0}(A) is weakly unperforated. If A has finite decomposition rank, real rank zero and the space of extremal tracial states is compact and zero-dimensional, then A has stable rank one and tracial rank zero. As a consequence, if B is another such algebra, and if A and B have isomorphic Elliott invariants and satisfy the Universal coefficient theorem, then they are isomorphic. In the case where A has finite decomposition rank and the space of extremal tracial states is compact and zero-dimensional, we also give a criterion (in terms of the ordered K_{0}-group) for A to have real rank zero. As a byproduct, we show that there are examples of simple, stably finite and quasidiagonal C^{*}-algebras with infinite decomposition rank.
