We present and study C*-algebras generated by "periodic weighted creation operators" on the Fock space associated with an automorphism \alpha on a C*-algebra A. These algebras can be viewed as generalized Bunce-Deddens algebras associated with the automorphism and can be written as a certain direct limit. We prove a crossed product presentation for such an algebra and find a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be simple. In the case where the automorphism is induced by an irrational rotation (on C(\mathbb{T})) we compute the K-theory groups and obtain a complete classification of these algebras.
