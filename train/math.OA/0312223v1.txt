For a selfadjoint element x in a tracial von Neumann algebra and \alpha = \delta_0(x) we compute bounds for \mathbb H^{\alpha}(x), where \mathbb H^{\alpha}(x) is the free Hausdorff \alpha-entropy of x. The bounds are in terms of \int \int_{\mathbb R^2 -D} \log |y-z| d\mu(y) d\mu(z) where \mu is the Borel measure on the spectrum of x induced by the trace and D \subset \mathbb R^2 is the diagonal. We compute similar bounds for the free Hausdorff entropy of a free family of selfadjoints.
