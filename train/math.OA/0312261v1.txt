The L2-norm closure of the algebra of all zero-order classical (or polyhomogeneous) pseudodifferential operators on a closed manifold X is proven not to contain H\"ormander's class \Psi^0(X). A set of generators (for that closed algebra) smaller than all zero-order classical pseudos is also described.
