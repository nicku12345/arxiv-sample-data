Let \gamma = (\gamma_1,...,\gamma_N), N \geq 2, be a system of proper contractions on a complete metric space. Then there exists a unique self-similar non-empty compact subset K. We consider the union {\mathcal G} = \cup_{i=1}^N \{(x,y) \in K^2 ; x = \gamma_i(y)\} of the cographs of \gamma _i. Then X = C({\mathcal G}) is a Hilbert bimodule over A = C(K). We associate a C^*-algebra {\mathcal O}_{\gamma}(K) with them as a Cuntz-Pimsner algebra {\mathcal O}_X. We show that if a system of proper contractions satisfies the open set condition in K, then the C^*-algebra {\mathcal O}_{\gamma}(K) is simple and purely infinite, which is not isomorphic to a Cuntz algebra in general.
