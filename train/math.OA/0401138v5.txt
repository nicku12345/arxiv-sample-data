We prove that II_1 factors M have a unique (up to unitary conjugacy) cross-product type decomposition around ``core subfactors'' N \subset M satisfying the property HT and a certain ``torsion freeness'' condition. In particular, this shows that isomorphism of factors of the form L_\alpha(\Bbb Z^2) \rtimes \Gamma, for torsion free, non-amenable subgroups \Gamma\subset SL(2, \Bbb Z) and \alpha = e^{2\pi i t}, t \not\in \Bbb Q, implies isomorphism of the corresponding groups \Gamma.
