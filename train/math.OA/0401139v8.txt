We consider \text{\rm II}_1 factors L_\mu(G) arising from 2-cocyles \mu \in \text{\rm H}^2(G,\Bbb T) on groups G containing infinite normal subgroups H \subset G with the relative property \text{\rm(T)} (i.e. G {\it w-rigid}).   We prove that given any separable \text{\rm II}_1 factor M, the set of 2-cocycles \mu_{|H}\in \text{\rm H}^2(H,\Bbb T) with the property that L_\mu(G) is embeddable into M is at most countable. We use this result, the relative property (T) of \Bbb Z^2 \subset \Bbb Z^2 \rtimes \Gamma for \Gamma \subset SL(2,\Bbb Z) non-amenable and the fact that every cocycle \mu_\alpha \in {\text{\rm H}}^2(\Bbb Z^2,\Bbb T)\simeq \Bbb T extends to a cocycle on \Bbb Z^2 \rtimes SL(2,\Bbb Z), to show that the one parameter family of II_1 factors M_\alpha(\Gamma)=L_{\mu_{\alpha}}(\Bbb Z^2 \rtimes \Gamma), \alpha \in \Bbb T, are mutually non-isomorphic, modulo countable sets, and cannot all be embedded into the same separable II_1 factor. Other examples and applications are discussed.
