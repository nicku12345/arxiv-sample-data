The hyperbolic algebra A_h, studied recently by Katavolos and Power, is the weak star closed operator algebra on L^2(R) generated by H^\infty(R), as multiplication operators, and by the dilation operators V_t, t \geq 0, given by V_t f(x) = e^{t/2} f(e^t x). We show that A_h is a reflexive operator algebra and that the four dimensional manifold Lat A_h (with the natural topology) is the reflexive hull of a natural two dimensional subspace.
