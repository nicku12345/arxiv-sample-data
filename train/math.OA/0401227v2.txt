We formulate and study a new coarse (co-)assembly map. It involves a modification of the Higson corona construction and produces a map dual in an appropriate sense to the standard coarse assembly map. The new assembly map is shown to be an isomorphism in many cases. For the underlying metric space of a group, the coarse co-assembly map is closely related to the existence of a dual Dirac morphism and thus to the Dirac dual Dirac method of attacking the Novikov conjecture.
