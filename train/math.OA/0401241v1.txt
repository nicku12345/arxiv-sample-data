Let A be an amenable separable \CA and B be a non-unital but \sigma-unital simple \CA with continuous scale. We show that two essential extensions \tau_1 and \tau_2 of A by B are approximately unitarily equivalent if and only if  [\tau_1]=[\tau_2] {\rm in} KL(A, M(B)/B).  If A is assumed to satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem, there is a bijection from approximate unitary equivalence classes of the above mentioned extensions to KL(A, M(B)/B). Using KL(A, M(B)/B), we compute exactly when an essential extension is quasidiagonal. We show that quasidiagonal extensions may not be approximately trivial. We also study the approximately trivial extensions.
