Let A be a unital separable amenable \CA and C be a unital \CA with certain infinite property. We show that two full monomorphisms h_1, h_2: A\to C are approximately unitarily equivalent if and only if [h_1]=[h_2] in KL(A,C). Let B be a non-unital but \sigma-unital \CA for which M(B)/B has the certain infinite property. We prove that two full essential extensions are approximately unitarily equivalent if and only if they induce the same element in KL(A, M(B)/B). The set of approximately unitarily equivalence classes of full essential extensions forms a group. If A satisfies the Universal Coefficient Theorem, it is can be identified with KL(A, M(B)/B).
