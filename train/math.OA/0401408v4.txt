We describe a method for associating a C^{*}-correspondence to a Mauldin-Williams graph and show that the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of this C^{*}-correspondence is isomorphic to the C^{*}-algebra of the underlying graph. In addition, we analyze certain ideals of these C^{*}-algebras.   We also investigate Mauldin-Williams graphs and fractal C^{*}-algebras in the context of the Rieffel metric. This generalizes the work of Pinzari, Watatani and Yonetani. Our main result here is a {}``no go'' theorem showing that such algebras must come from the commutative setting.
