In applications, choices of orthonormal bases in Hilbert space H may come about from the simultaneous diagonalization of some specific abelian algebra of operators. It was noticed recently that there is a certain finite set of non-commuting operators F_i, first introduced by engineers in signal processing, which helps to clarify this connection, and at the same time throws light on decomposition possibilities for wavelet packets used in pyramid algorithms. While the operators F_i were originally intended for quadrature mirror filters of signals, recent papers have shown that they are ubiquitous in a variety of modern wavelet constructions, and in particular in the selection of wavelet packets from libraries of bases. These are constructions which make a selection of a basis with the best frequency concentration in signal or data-compression problems. While the algebra A generated by the F_i-system is non-abelian, and goes under the name "Cuntz algebra" in C*-algebra theory, each of its representations contains a canonical maximal abelian subalgebra, i.e., the subalgebra is some C(X) for a Gelfand space X. A given representation of A, restricted to C(X), naturally induces a projection-valued measure on X, and each vector in H induces a scalar-valued measure on X. We prove a structure theorem for certain classes of induced scalar measures. In the applications, X may be the unit interval, or a Cantor set; or it may be an affine fractal, or even one of the more general iteration limits involving iterated function systems consisting of conformal maps.
