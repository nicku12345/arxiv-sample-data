Let A be a unital separable simple \CA with \tr(A)\le 1 and \alpha be an automorphism. We show that if \alpha satisfies the tracially cyclic Rokhlin property then \tr(A\rtimes_{\alpha}\Z)\le 1. We also show that whenever A has a unique tracial state and \alpha^m is uniformly outer for each m (\not= 0) and \alpha^r is approximately inner for some r>0, \alpha satisfies the tracial cyclic Rokhlin property. By applying the classification theory of nuclear \CA s, we use the above result to prove a conjecture of Kishimoto: if A is a unital simple A{\mathbb T}-algebra of real rank zero and \alpha\in \Aut(A) which is approximately inner and if \alpha satisfies some Rokhlin property, then the crossed product A\rtimes_{\alpha}\Z is again an A{\mathbb T} -algebra of real rank zero. As a by-product, we find that one can construct a large class of simple \CA s with tracial rank one (and zero) from crossed products.
