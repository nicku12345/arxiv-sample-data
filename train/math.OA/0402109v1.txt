We obtain an estimate of free entropy of generators in a type {II}_1-factor \mc{M} which has a subfactor \mc{N} of finite index with a subalgebra \mc{P}=\mc{P}_1\vee\mc{P}_2\subset\mc{N} where \mc{P}_1=\mc{R}_1'\cap\mc{P}, \mc{P}_2=\mc{R}_2'\cap\mc{P} are diffuse, \mc{R}_1,\mc{R}_2\subset\mc{P} are mutually commuting hyperfinite subfactors, and an abelian subalgebra \mc{A}\subset\mc{N} such that the correspondence _\mc{P}L^2(\mc{N},\tau)_\mc{A} is \mc{M}-weakly contained in a subcorrespondence _\mc{P}H_\mc{A} of _\mc{P}L^2(\mc{M},\tau)_\mc{A}, generated by v vectors. The (modified) free entropy dimension of any generating set of \mc{M} is \leq 2r+2v+4, where r is the integer part of the index. As a consequence, the interpolated free group subfactors of finite index do not have regular non-prime subfactors or regular diffuse hyperfinite subalgebras.
