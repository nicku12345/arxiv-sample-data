Given a k-graph \Lambda and an element p of \NN^k, we define the dual k-graph, p\Lambda. We show that when \Lambda is row-finite and has no sources, the C^*-algebras C^*(\Lambda) and C^*(p\Lambda) coincide. We use this isomorphism to apply Robertson and Steger's results to calculate the K-theory of C^*(\Lambda) when \Lambda is finite and strongly connected and satisfies the aperiodicity condition.
