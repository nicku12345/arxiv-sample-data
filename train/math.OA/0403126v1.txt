In this paper, we first characterize reflexive one-sided \a-submodules \u of a unital operator algebra \a in \bh completely. Furthermore we investigate the invariant subspace lattice \lat\r and the reflexive hull \ref\r, where \r is the submodule generated by rank-one operators in \u; in particular, if \l is a subspace lattice, we obtain when the rank-one algebra \r of \alg\l is big enough to determined \alg\l in the following senses: \alg\l=\alg\lat\r and \alg\l=\ref\r.
