We prove a factorization of completely bounded maps from a C^*-algebra A (or an exact operator space E\subset A) to \ell_2 equipped with the operator space structure of (C,R)_\theta (0<\theta<1) obtained by complex interpolation between the column and row Hilbert spaces. More precisely, if F denotes \ell_2 equipped with the operator space structure of (C,R)_\theta, then u: A \to F is completely bounded iff there are states f,g on A and C>0 such that \[ \forall a\in A\quad \|ua\|^2\le C f(a^*a)^{1-\theta}g(aa^*)^{\theta}.\] This extends the case \theta=1/2 treated in a recent paper with Shlyakhtenko. The constants we obtain tend to 1 when \theta \to 0 or \theta\to 1. We use analogues of "free Gaussian" families in non semifinite von Neumann algebras. As an application, we obtain that, if 0<\theta<1, (C,R)_\theta does not embed completely isomorphically into the predual of a semifinite von Neumann algebra. Moreover, we characterize the subspaces S\subset R\oplus C such that the dual operator space S^* embeds (completely isomorphically) into M_* for some semifinite von neumann algebra M: the only possibilities are S=R, S=C, S=R\cap C and direct sums built out of these three spaces. We also discuss when S\subset R\oplus C is injective, and give a simpler proof of a result due to Oikhberg on this question. In the appendix, we present a proof of Junge's theorem that OH embeds completely isomorphically into a non-commutative L_1-space. The main idea is similar to Junge's, but we base the argument on complex interpolation and Shlyakhtenko's generalized circular systems (or ``generalized free Gaussian"), that somewhat unifies Junge's ideas with those of our work with Shlyakhtenko.
