Let A be a unital separable \CA and B=C\otimes {\cal K}, where C is a unital \CA. Let \tau: A\to M(B)/B be a weakly unital full essential extensions of A by B. We show that there is a bijection between a quotient group of K_0(B) onto the set of strong unitary equivalence classes of weakly unital full essential extensions \sigma such that [\sigma]=[\tau] in KK^1(A, B). Consequently, when this group is zero, unitarily equivalent full essential extensions are strongly unitarily equivalent. When B is a non-unital but \sigma-unital simple \CA with continuous scale, we also study the problem when two approximately unitarily equivalent essential extensions are strongly approximately unitarily equivalent. A group is used to compute the strongly approximate unitary equivalence classes in the same approximate unitary equivalent class of essential
