Let M be a closed enlargeable spin manifold. We show non-triviality of the universal index obstruction in the K-theory of the maximal C^*-algebra of the fundamental group of M. Our proof is independent from the injectivity of the Baum-Connes assembly map for the fundamental group of M and relies on the construction of a certain infinite dimensional flat vector bundle out of a sequence of finite dimensional vector bundles on M whose curvatures tend to zero.   Besides the well known fact that M does not carry a metric with positive scalar curvature, our results imply that the classifying map M \to B \pi_1(M) sends the fundamental class of M to a nontrivial homology class in H_n(B \pi_1(M) ; \Q). This answers a question of Burghelea (1983).
