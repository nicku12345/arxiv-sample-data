We study the equivalence relation R_N generated by the (non-free) action of the generalized Thompson group F_N on the unit interval. We show that this relation is a standard, quasipreserving ergodic equivalence relation. Using results of Feldman-Moore, Krieger and Connes we prove that the von Neumann algebra M(R_N) associated to R_N is the hyperfinite type III_{\lambda} factor, with \lambda=1/N.
