Let A be a unital simple C*-algebra with tracial rank zero and X be a compact metric space. Suppose that h_1, h_2: C(X)\to A are two unital monomorphisms. We show that h_1 and h_2 are approximately unitarily equivalent if and only if  [h_1]=[h_2] {\rm in} KL(C(X),A) {\rm and} \tau\circ h_1(f)=\tau\circ h_2(f)  for every f\in C(X) and every trace \tau of A. Adopting a theorem of Tomiyama, we introduce a notion of approximate conjugacy for minimal dynamical systems. Let X be a compact metric space and \alpha, \beta: X\to X be two minimal homeomorphisms. Using the above mentioned result, we show that two dynamical systems are approximately conjugate in that sense if and only if a K-theoretical condition is satisfied. In the case that X is the Cantor set, this notion coincides with strong orbit equivalence of Giordano, Putnam and Skau and the K-theoretical condition is equivalent to saying that the associate crossed product C*-algebras are isomorphic.   Another application of the above mentioned result is given for C^*-dynamical systems related to a problem of Kishimoto. Let A be a unital simple AH-algebra with no dimension growth and with real rank zero, and let \alpha\in Aut(A). We prove that if \alpha^r fixes a large subgroup of K_0(A) and has the tracial Rokhlin property then A\rtimes_{\alpha}\Z is again a unital simple AH-algebra with no dimension growth and with real rank zero.
