We study a factorization of bounded linear maps from an operator space A to its dual space A^*. It is shown that T : A \longrightarrow A^* factors through a pair of a column Hilbert spaces \mathcal{H}_c and its dual space if and only if T is a bounded linear form on A \otimes A by the canonical identification equipped with a numerical radius type Haagerup norm. As a consequence, we characterize a bounded linear map from a Banach space to its dual space, which factors through a pair of Hilbert spaces.
