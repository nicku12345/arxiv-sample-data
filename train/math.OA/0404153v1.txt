We introduce a numerical radius operator space (X, \mathcal{W}_n). The conditions to be a numerical radius operator space are weaker than the Ruan's axiom for an operator space (X, \mathcal{O}_n). Let w(\cdot) be the numerical radius norm on \mathbb{B}(\mathcal{H}). It is shown that if X admits a norm \mathcal{W}_n(\cdot) on the matrix space \mathbb{M}_n(X) which satisfies the conditions, then there is a complete isometry, in the sense of the norms \mathcal{W}_n(\cdot) and w_n(\cdot), from (X, \mathcal{W}_n) into (\mathbb{B}(\mathcal{H}), w_n). We study the relationship between the operator space (X, \mathcal{O}_n) and the numerical radius operator space (X, \mathcal{W}_n). The category of operator spaces can be regarded as a subcategory of numerical radius operator spaces.
