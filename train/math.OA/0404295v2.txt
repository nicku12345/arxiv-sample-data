Two spectral triples are introduced for a class of fractals in R^n. The definitions of noncommutative Hausdorff dimension and noncommutative tangential dimensions, as well as the corresponding Hausdorff and Hausdorff-Besicovitch functionals considered in math.OA/0202108, are studied for the mentioned fractals endowed with these spectral triples, showing in many cases their correspondence with classical objects. In particular, for any limit fractal, the Hausdorff-Besicovitch functionals do not depend on the generalized limit procedure.
