In this paper we study the asymptotic distribution of the moments of (non-normalized) traces \Tr (w_1), \Tr(w_2), ..., \Tr(w_r), where  w_1, w_2, >..., w_r are reduced words in unitaries in the group \cU(N). We prove that as N\to \infty these variables are distributed as normal gaussian variables \sqrt {j_1} Z_1, ..., \sqrt{Z_r}, where j_1, ..., j_r are the number of cyclic rotations of the words w_1, ..., w_s leaving them invariant. This extends a previous result by Diaconis (\cite{Diac}), where this it was proved, that \Tr(U), \Tr(U^2), ..., \Tr(U^p) are asymptotically distributed as Z_1, \sqrt 2 Z_2, ..., \sqrt p Z_p.   We establish a combinatorial formula for \int |\Tr (w_1)|^2...| \Tr(w_p)|^2. In our computation we reprove some results from \cite{BC}.
