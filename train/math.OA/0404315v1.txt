In this paper we study canonical models for representations of the Hardy algebras that generalize the model theory of Sz.-Nagy and Foias for contraction operators.   The Hardy algebras are non selfadjoint operator algebras associated with W^*-correspondences. This class includes the classical H^{\infty} algebra, free semigroup algebras, quiver algebras and other classes of algebras studied in the literature.
