This is primarily an exposition of our work on Hardy algebras associated with W^*-correspondences with an emphasis on interpolation results (a generalized Nevanlinna-Pick theorem) and the concepts of Schur class operator functions (and realizations). We describe in detail the construction of the Hardy algebras, its representations and the important concepts of duality and point evaluation. Many examples are provided.
