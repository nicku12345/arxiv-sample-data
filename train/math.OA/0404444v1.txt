Resolvents of quasi-linear operators and operator algebras in Banach spaces over the quaternion field are investigated. Spectral theory of unbounded nonlinear operators in quaternion Banach spaces is studied. Strongly continuous semigroups of quaternion quasi-linear operators are investigated and the polar decomposition theorem for them is proved.
