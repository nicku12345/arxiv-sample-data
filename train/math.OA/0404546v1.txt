The algebra \Psi(M) of order zero pseudodifferential operators on a compact manifold M defines a well-known C^*-extension of the algebra C(S^*M) of continuous functions on the cospherical bundle S^*M\subset T^*M by the algebra \K of compact operators. In his proof of the index theorem, Higson defined and used an asymptotic homomorphism T from C_0(T^*M) to \K, which plays the role of a deformation for the commutative algebra C_0(T^*M). Similar constructions exist also for operators and symbols with coefficients in a C^*-algebra. We show that the image of the above extension under the Connes--Higson construction is T and that this extension can be reconstructed out of T. This explains, why the classical approach to the index theory coincides with the one based on asymptotic homomorphisms.
