Well known results related to the compactness of Hankel operators of one complex variable are extended to little Hankel operators of two complex variables. Critical to these considerations is the result of Ferguson and Lacey characterizing the boundedness of the little Hankel operators in terms of the product BMO of S.-Y. Chang and R. Fefferman.
