In this paper, we will consider a noncommutative probability space, (T,E), over a Toeplitz matricial algebra B=\QTR{cal}{C}^{N}, for N\in \QTR{Bbb}{N}, induced by a (scalar-valued) noncommutative probability space, (A,\QTR{cal}{\phi}), with a suitable B-functional, E:T\to B, defined by \phi . On this framework, we will observe amalgamated R-transform calculus with respect to a B-functional, E. The technique and idea are came from those in [12] and Free Probability of type B studied in [31].
