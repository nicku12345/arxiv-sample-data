064<p type="texpara" tag="Body Text" et="abstract" bin="clone" >In this paper, we will consider an example of a (scalar-valued) moment series, under the compatibility. Suppose that we have an amalgamated free product of free group algebras, L(F_{2})*_{L(F_{1})}L(F_{2})=L(<a,b>)*_{L(<h>)}L(<c,d>)   064<p type="texpara" tag="Body Text" et="abstract" bin="clone" >We will provide the method how to find the moment series of a+b+a^{-1}+b^{-1}+c+d+c^{-1}+d^{-1}. Amalgamated freeness of a+b+a^{-1}+b^{-1} and c+d+c^{-1}+d^{-1} over L(F_{1}) is used and some combinatorial functions (to explain the recurrence relations) are used to figure out the n-th moment of this element.
