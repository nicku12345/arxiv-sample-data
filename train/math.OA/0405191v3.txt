We extend the relation between random matrices and free probability theory from the level of expectations to the level of fluctuations. We introduce the concept of "second order freeness" and derive the global fluctuations of Gaussian and Wishart random matrices by a general limit theorem for second order freeness. By introducing cyclic Fock space, we also give an operator algebraic model for the fluctuations of our random matrices in terms of the usual creation, annihilation, and preservation operators. We show that orthogonal families of Gaussian and Wishart random matrices are asymptotically free of second order.
