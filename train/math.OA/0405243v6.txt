We calculate the twisted Hochschild and cyclic homology (in the sense of Kustermans, Murphy and Tuset) of all Podles quantum spheres relative to arbitary automorphisms. Our calculations are based on a free resolution due to Masuda, Nakagami and Watanabe. The dimension drop in Hochschild homology can be overcome by twisting by automorphisms induced from the canonical modular automorphism associated to the Haar state on quantum SU(2). We specialize our results to the standard quantum sphere, and identify the class in twisted cyclic cohomology of the 2-cocycle discovered by Schmuedgen and Wagner corresponding to the distinguished covariant differential calculus found by Podles.
