We show that the method to construct C^*-algebras from topological graphs, introduced in our previous paper, generalizes many known constructions. We give many ways to make new topological graphs from old ones, and study the relation of C^*-algebras constructed from them. We also prove that our C^*-algebras have a certain characterization. This gives us another definition of our C^*-algebras.
