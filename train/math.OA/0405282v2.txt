We give a new formulation of some of our recent results on the following problem: if all uniformly bounded representations on a discrete group G are similar to unitary ones, is the group amenable? In \S 5, we give a new proof of Haagerup's theorem that, on non-commutative free groups, there are Herz-Schur multipliers that are not coefficients of uniformly bounded representations. We actually prove a refinement of this result involving a generalization of the class of Herz-Schur multipliers, namely the class M_d(G) which is formed of all the functions f\colon G\to {\bb C} such that there are bounded functions \xi_i\colon G\to B(H_i, H_{i-1}) (H_i Hilbert) with H_0 = {\bb C}, H_d ={\bb C} such that f(t_1t_2... t_d) = \xi_1(t_1) \xi_2(t_2)... \xi_d(t_d).\qquad \forall t_i\in G We prove that if G is a non-commutative free group, for any d\ge 1, we have M_d(G)\not= M_{d+1}(G), and hence there are elements of M_d(G) which are not coefficients of uniformly bounded representations. In the case d=2, Haagerup's theorem implies that M_2(G)\not= M_{4}(G).
