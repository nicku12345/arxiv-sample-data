A topological group G is called extremely amenable if every continuous action of G on a compact space has a fixed point. This concept is linked with geometry of high dimensions (concentration of measure). We show that a von Neumann algebra is approximately finite-dimensional if and only if its unitary group with the strong topology is the product of an extremely amenable group with a compact group, which strengthens a result by de la Harpe. As a consequence, a C^\ast-algebra A is nuclear if and only if the unitary group U(A) with the relative weak topology is strongly amenable in the sense of Glasner. We prove that the group of automorphisms of a Lebesgue space with a non-atomic measure is extremely amenable with the weak topology and establish a similar result for groups of non-singular transformations. As a consequence, we prove extreme amenability of the groups of isometries of L^p(0,1), 1\leq p<\infty, extending a classical result of Gromov and Milman (p=2). We show that a measure class preserving equivalence relation \mathcal R on a standard Borel space is amenable if and only if the full group [{\mathcal R}], equipped with the uniform topology, is extremely amenable. Finally, we give natural examples of concentration to a nontrivial space in the sense of Gromov occuring in the automorphism groups of injective factors of type III.
