Let  \mathcal D be a dense linear manifold in a Hilbert space \mathcal H and let L^+(\mathcal D) be the *-algebra of all linear operators A such that A \mathcal D \subset \mathcal D, A^* \mathcal D \subset \mathcal D. Denote by F(\mathcal D) the *-ideal of L^+(\mathcal D) consisting of all finite-rank operators. A characterization of the structure of additive mappings of F(\mathcal D) preserving operators of rank one or projections of rank one is given. The corresponding results for algebras of bounded operators on Banach spaces were given by P. \u{S}emrl.
