Let T be the quasi-nilpotent DT-operator. By use of Voiculescu's amalgamated R-transform we compute the moments of (T-\lambda 1)^*(T-\lambda 1), where \lambda \in \mathbb C, and the Brown-measure of T+\sqrt{\epsilon} Y, where Y is a circular element *-free from T for \epsilon>0. Moreover we give a new proof of \'Sniady's formula for the moments \tau(((T^*)^k T^k)^n) for k,n\in \mathbb N.
