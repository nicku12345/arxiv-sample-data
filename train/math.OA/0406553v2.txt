Let \mathcal A and \mathcal B be two (complex) algebras. A linear map \phi:{\mathcal A}\to{\mathcal B} is called n-homomorphism if \phi(a_{1}... a_{n})=\phi(a_{1})...\phi(a_{n}) for each a_{1},...,a_{n}\in{\mathcal A}. In this paper, we investigate n-homomorphisms and their relation to homomorphisms. We characterize n-homomorphisms in terms of homomorphisms under certain conditions. Some results related to continuity and commutativity are given as well.
