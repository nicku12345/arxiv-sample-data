We prove that any isomorphism \theta:M_0\simeq M of group measure space II_1 factors, M_0=L^\infty(X_0, \mu_0) \rtimes_{\sigma_0} G_0, M=L^\infty(X, \mu) \rtimes_{\sigma} G, with G_0 containing infinite normal subgroups with the relative property (T) of Kazhdan-Margulis (i.e. G_0 {\it w-rigid}) and G an ICC group acting by Bernoulli shifts \sigma, essentially comes from an isomorphism of probability spaces which conjugates the actions. Moreover, any isomorphism \theta of M_0 onto a ``corner'' pMp of M, for p\in M an idempotent, forces p=1. In particular, all group measure space factors associated with Bernoulli shift actions of w-rigid ICC groups have trivial fundamental group and all isomorphisms between such factors come from isomorphisms of the corresponding groups. This settles a ``group measure space version'' of Connes rigidity conjecture, shown in fact to hold true in a greater generality than just for ICC property (T) groups. We apply these results to ergodic theory, establishing new strong rigidity and superrigidity results for orbit equivalence relations.
