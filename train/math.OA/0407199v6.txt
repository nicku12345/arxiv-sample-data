For each group G having an infinite normal subgroup with the relative property (T) (for instance G = H \times K where H is infinite with property (T) and K is arbitrary), and any countable abelian group \Lambda we construct free ergodic measure preserving actions \sigma_\Lambda of G on the probability space such that the 1'st cohomology group of \sigma_\Lambda, H^1(\sigma_\Lambda), is equal to Char(G) \times \Lambda. We deduce that G has uncountably many non stably orbit equivalent actions. We also calculate 1-cohomology groups and show existence of ``many'' non stably orbit equivalent actions for free products of groups as above.
