Partial dynamical systems (X,alpha) arise naturally when dealing with commutative C*-dynamical system (A,delta). We associate with every pair (X,alpha), or (A,delta), a covariance C*-algebra C*(X,alpha)=C*(A,delta) which agrees with a partial crossed product - in case alpha is injective, and a crossed product by a monomorphism - in case alpha is onto. The relevance between (X,alpha) and C*(X,alpha) is deeply investigated. In particular, the notions of topological freedom and invariance of a set are generalized, and as a consequence a version of Isomorphism Theorem and a description of ideals of C*(X,alpha) are obtained.
