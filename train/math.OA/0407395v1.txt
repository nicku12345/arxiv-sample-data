We prove that the classical integrability condition for almost complex structures on finite-dimensional smooth manifolds also works in infinite dimensions in the case of almost complex structures that are real analytic on real analytic Banach manifolds. As an application, we extend some known results concerning existence of invariant complex structures on homogeneous spaces of Banach-Lie groups.
