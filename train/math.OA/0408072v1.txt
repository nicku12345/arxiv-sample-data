We characterize, in terms of elementary properties, the abelian monoids which are direct limits of finite direct sums of monoids of the form (Z/nZ)\sqcup\{0\} (where 0 is a new zero element), for positive integers n. The key properties are the Riesz refinement property and the requirement that each element x has finite order, that is, (n+1)x=x for some positive integer n. Such monoids are necessarily semilattices of abelian groups, and part of our approach yields a characterization of the Riesz refinement property among semilattices of abelian groups. Further, we describe the monoids in question as certain submonoids of direct products \Lambda\times G for semilattices \Lambda and torsion abelian groups G. When applied to the monoids V(A) appearing in the non-stable K-theory of C*-algebras, our results yield characterizations of the monoids V(A) for C* inductive limits A of sequences of finite direct products of matrix algebras over Cuntz algebras O_n. In particular, this completely solves the problem of determining the range of the invariant in the unital case of R{\o}rdam's classification of inductive limits of the above type.
