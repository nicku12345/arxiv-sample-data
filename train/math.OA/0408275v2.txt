A self-adjoint element in a finite AW*-factor is spectrally symmetric, if its spectral measure under the quasitrace is invariant under the change of variables t\longmapsto -t. We show that if \mathcal{A} is an AW*-factor of type II_1, a self-djoint element in \mathcal{A}, without full support, has quasitrace zero, if and only if it can be written as a sum of at most three commuting spectrally symmetric elements.
