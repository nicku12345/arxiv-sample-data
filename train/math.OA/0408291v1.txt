Let X be an infinite compact metric space with finite covering dimension and let h be a minimal homeomorphism of X. Let A be the associated crossed product C*-algebra. We show that A has tracial rank zero whenever the image of K_0 (A) in the affine functions on the tracial state space of A is dense. As a consequence, we show that these crossed product C*-algebras are in fact simple AH algebras with real rank zero. When X is connected and h is further assumed to be uniquely ergodic, then the above happens if and only if the rotation number associated to h has irrational values.   By applying the classification theorem for nuclear simple C*-algebras with tracial rank zero, we show that two such dynamical systems have isomorphic crossed products if and only if they have isomorphic scaled ordered K-theory.
