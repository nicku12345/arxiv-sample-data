We describe a method for associating some non-self-adjoint algebras to Mauldin-Williams graphs and we study the Morita equivalence and isomorphism of these algebras.   We also investigate the relationship between the Morita equivalence and isomorphism class of the C^{\ast} -correspondences associated with Mauldin-Williams graphs and the dynamical properties of the Mauldin-Williams graphs.
