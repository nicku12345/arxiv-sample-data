We construct a generalized version for the free product of unital C*-algebras over a family of unital C*-subalgebras, starting from the group-analogue. When all the subalgebras are the same, we recover the free product with amalgamation over a common subalgebra. We reduce the problem to the study of minimal amalgams. We specialize to triangles of algebras and subalgebras, study freeness in this context, and give some examples of constructions of minimal amalgams derived from triangles of operator algebras.
