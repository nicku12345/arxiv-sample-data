An abelian self-commutator in a C*-algebra \mathcal{A} is an element A that can be written as A=X^*X-XX^*, with X\in\mathcal{A} such that X^*X and XX^* commute. It is shown that, given a finite AW*-factor \mathcal{A}, there exists another finite AW*-factor \mathcal{M} of same type as \mathcal{A}, that contains \mathcal{A} as an AW*-subfactor, such that any self-adjoint element X\in\mathcal{M} of quasitrace zero is an abelian self-commutator in \mathcal{M}.
