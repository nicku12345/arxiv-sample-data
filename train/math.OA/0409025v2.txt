In this paper we collect a few results about exchangeability systems in which crossing cumulants vanish, which we call noncrossing exchangeability systems. The main result is a free version of De Finetti's theorem, characterising amalgamated free products as noncrossing exchangeability systems which satisfy a so-called weak singleton condition. The main tool in the proof is an L^p-inequality with uniformly bounded constants for i.i.d. sequences in noncrossing exchangeability systems.
