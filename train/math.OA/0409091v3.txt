We show that a C^*-algebra A is nuclear iff there is a constant K and \alpha<3 such that, for any bounded homomorphism u\colon A \to B(H), there is an isomorphism \xi\colon H\to H satisfying \|\xi^{-1}\|\|\xi\| \le K\|u\|^\alpha and such that  \xi^{-1} u(.) \xi is a *-homomorphism. In other words, an infinite dimensional A is nuclear iff its length (in ths sense of our previous work on the Kadison similarity problem) is equal to 2.
