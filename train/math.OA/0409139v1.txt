We prove a weak-type (1,1) inequality for square functions of non-commutative martingales that are simultaneously bounded in L^2 and L^1. More precisely, the following non-commutative analogue of a classical result of Burkholder holds: there exists an absolute constant K>0 such that if \cal{M} is a semi-finite von Neumann algebra and (\cal{M}_n)^{\infty}_{n=1} is an increasing filtration of von Neumann subalgebras of \cal{M} then for any given martingale x=(x_n)^{\infty}_{n=1} that is bounded in L^2(\cal{M})\cap L^1(\cal{M}), adapted to (\cal{M}_n)^{\infty}_{n=1}, there exist two \underline{martingale difference} sequences, a=(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty and b=(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty, with dx_n = a_n + b_n for every n\geq 1, \[ | (\sum^\infty_{n=1} a_n^*a_n)^{{1}/{2}}|_{2} + | (\sum^\infty_{n=1} b_nb_n^*)^{1/2}|_{2} \leq 2| x |_2, \] and \[ | (\sum^\infty_{n=1} a_n^*a_n)^{{1}/{2}}|_{1,\infty} + | (\sum^\infty_{n=1} b_nb_n^*)^{1/2}|_{1,\infty} \leq K| x |_1. \] As an application, we obtain the optimal orders of growth for the constants involved in the Pisier-Xu non-commutative analogue of the classical Burkholder-Gundy inequalities.
