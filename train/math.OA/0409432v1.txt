We begin the study of a new class of operator algebras that arise from higher rank graphs. Every higher rank graph generates a Fock space Hilbert space and creation operators which are partial isometries acting on the space. We call the weak operator topology closed algebra generated by these operators a 'higher rank semigroupoid algebra'. A number of examples are discussed in detail, including the single vertex case and higher rank cycle graphs. In particular the cycle graph algebras are identified as matricial multivariable function algebras. We obtain reflexivity for a wide class of graphs and characterize semisimplicity in terms of the underlying graph.
