Surjective isometries between unital C*-algebras were classified in 1951 by Kadison. In 1972 Paterson and Sinclair handled the nonunital case by assuming Kadison's theorem and supplying some supplementary lemmas. Here we combine an observation of Paterson and Sinclair with variations on the methods of Yeadon and the author, producing a fundamentally new proof of the structure of surjective isometries between (nonunital) C*-algebras. In the final section we indicate how our techniques may be applied to classify surjective isometries of noncommutative Lp spaces, extending some recent results of the author to 0 < p leq 1.
