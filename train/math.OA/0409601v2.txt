A gauge-invariant C*-system is obtained as the fixed point subalgebra of the infinite tensor product of full matrix algebras under the tensor product unitary action of a compact group. In the paper, thermodynamics is studied on such systems and the chemical potential theory developed by Araki, Haag, Kastler and Takesaki is used. As a generalization of quantum spin system, the equivalence of the KMS condition, the Gibbs condition and the variational principle is shown for translation-invariant states. The entropy density of extremal equilibrium states is also investigated in relation to macroscopic uniformity.
