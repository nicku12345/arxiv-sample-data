We define and study an equivariant E-theory with respect to coactions of Hopf C^*-algebras; we prove the Baaj-Skandalis duality in this setting. We show that the corresponding equivariant KK-theory of Baaj and Skandalis enjoys an universal property. In the appendix, we look at the different ways of expressing equivariant stability for a functor, and prove an equivariant Brown-Green-Rieffel stabilization result.
