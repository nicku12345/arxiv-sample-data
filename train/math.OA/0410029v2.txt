By working with several specific Poisson-Lie groups arising from Heisenberg Lie bialgebras and by carrying out their quantizations, a case is made for a useful but simple method of constructing locally compact quantum groups. The strategy is to analyze and collect enough information from a Poisson-Lie group, and using it to carry out a ``cocycle bicrossed product construction''. Constructions are done using multiplicative unitary operators, obtaining C*-algebraic, locally compact quantum (semi-)groups.
