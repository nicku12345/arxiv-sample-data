The operator spaces H_n^k 1\le k\le n, generalizing the row and column Hilbert spaces, and arising in the authors' previous study of contractively complemented subspaces of C^*-algebras, are shown to be homogeneous and completely isometric to a space of creation operators on a subspace of the anti-symmetric Fock space. The completely bounded Banach-Mazur distance from H_n^k to row or column space is explicitly calculated.
