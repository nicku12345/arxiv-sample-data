This paper is a comprehensive study of the nest representations for the free semigroupoid algebra \flgee of countable directed graph G as well as its norm-closed counterpart, the tensor algebra \T^{+}(G).   We prove that the finite dimensional nest representations separate the points in \flgee, and a fortiori, in \T^{+}(G). The irreducible finite dimensional representations separate the points in \flgee if and only if G is transitive in components (which is equivalent to being semisimple). Also the upper triangular nest representations separate points if and only if for every vertex x \in \V(G) supporting a cycle, x also supports at least one loop edge.   We also study \textit{faithful} nest representations. We prove that \flgee (or \T^{+}(G)) admits a faithful irreducible representation if and only if G is strongly transitive as a directed graph. More generally, we obtain a condition on G which is equivalent to the existence of a faithful nest representation. We also give a condition that determines the existence a faithful nest representation for a maximal type \bN nest.
