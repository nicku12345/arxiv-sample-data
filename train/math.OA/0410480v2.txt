A Mauldin-Williams graph \mathcal{M} is a generalization of an iterated function system by a directed graph. Its invariant set K plays the role of the self-similar set. We associate a C^{*}-algebra \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}}(K) with a Mauldin-Williams graph \mathcal{M} and the invariant set K laying emphasis on the singular points. We assume that the underlying graph G has no sinks and no sources. If \mathcal{M} satisfies the open set condition in K and G is irreducible and is not a cyclic permutation, then the associated C^{*}-algebra \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}}(K) is simple and purely infinite. We calculate the K-groups for some examples including the inflation rule of the Penrose tilings.
