We present an operator space version of Rieffel's theorem on the agreement of the metric topology, on a subset of the Banach space dual of a normed space, from a seminorm with the weak*-topology. As an application we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the matrix metric from an unbounded Fredholm module to give the BW-topology on the matrix state space of the C^*-algebra. Motivated by recent results we formulate a non-commutative Lipschitz seminorm on a matrix order unit space and characterize those matrix Lipschitz seminorms whose matrix metric topology coincides with the BW-topology on the matrix state space.
