We present a short and elegant proof of the complete theory of strict representations of the algebra B^a(E) of all adjointable operators on a Hilbert B-module E by operators on a Hilbert C-module F. Aanalogue for W*-modules and normal representations is also proved. As an application we furnish a new proof of Blecher's Eilenberg-Watts theorem.
