We consider a new orbit equivalence invariant for measure-preserving actions of groups on the probability space, \sigma:G\to Aut(X,\mu), denoted \chi_0(\sigma;G) and defined as the "intersection" of the 1-cohomology group, H^1(\sigma,G), with Connes' \chi(M) invariant of the cross product von Neumann algebra, M=L^\infty(X,\mu)\rtimes_\sigma G. We calculate \chi_0(\sigma;G) for certain actions of groups of the form G=H\times K with H non-amenable and K infinite amenable and we deduce that any such group has uncountably many orbit inequivalent actions.
