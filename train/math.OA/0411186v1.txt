We extend the results by Froelich and Spronk and Turowska on the connection between operator synthesis and spectral synthesis for A(G) to second countable locally compact groups G. This gives us another proof that one-point subset of G is a set of spectral synthesis and that any closed subgroup is a set of local spectral synthesis. Furthermore we show that ``non-triangular'' sets are strong operator Ditkin sets and we establish a connection between operator Ditkin sets and Ditkin sets. These results are applied to prove that any closed subgroup of G is a local Ditkin set.
