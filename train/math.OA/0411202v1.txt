We continue the analysis of nontrivial examples of quantum Markov processes. This is done by applying the construction of entangled Markov chains obtained from classical Markov chains with infinite state--space. The formula giving the joint correlations arises from the corresponding classical formula by replacing the usual matrix multiplication by the Schur multiplication. In this way, we provide nontrivial examples of entangled Markov chains on \bar{\cup_{J\subset Z} \bar{\otimes}_{J}F}^{C^{*}}, F being any infinite dimensional type I factor, J a finite interval of Z, and the bar the von Neumann tensor product between von Neumann algebras. We then have new nontrivial examples of quantum random walks which could play a r\^ole in quantum information theory.   In view of applications to quantum statistical mechanics too, we see that the ergodic type of an entangled Markov chain is completely determined by the corresponding ergodic type of the underlying classical chain, provided that the latter admits an invariant probability distribution. This result parallels the corresponding one relative to the finite dimensional case.   Finally, starting from random walks on discrete ICC groups, we exhibit examples of quantum Markov processes based on type II_1 von Neumann factors.
