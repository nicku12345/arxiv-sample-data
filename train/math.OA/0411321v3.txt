Enveloping C^*-algebras for some finitely generated *-algebras are considered. It is shown that all of the considered algebras are identically defined by their dual spaces. The description in terms of matrix-functions is given. Keywords : algebraic bundles, finitely represented C^*-algebras, dual spaces.
