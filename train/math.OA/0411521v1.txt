A contractive n-tuple A=(A_1,...,A_n) has a minimal joint isometric dilation S=(S_1,...,S_n) where the S_i's are isometries with pairwise orthogonal ranges. This determines a representation of the Cuntz-Toeplitz algebra. When A acts on a finite dimensional space, the \wot-closed nonself-adjoint algebra \mathfrak{S} generated by S is completely described in terms of the properties of A. This provides complete unitary invariants for the corresponding representations. In addition, we show that the algebra \mathfrak{S} is always hyper-reflexive. In the last section, we describe similarity invariants. In particular, an n-tuple B of d\times d matrices is similar to an irreducible n-tuple A if and only if a certain finite set of polynomials vanish on B.
