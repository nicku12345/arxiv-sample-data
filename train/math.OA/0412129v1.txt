Let X be the Cantor set and \phi be a minimal homeomorphism on X\times\T. We show that the crossed product C^*-algebra C^*(X\times\T,\phi) is a simple A\T-algebra provided that the associated cocycle takes its values in rotations on \T. Given two minimal systems (X\times\T,\phi) and (Y\times\T,\psi) such that \phi and \psi arise from cocycles with values in isometric homeomorphisms on \T, we show that two systems are approximately K-conjugate when they have the same K-theoretical information.
