We extend in a noncommutative setting the individual ergodic theorem of Nevo and Stein concerning measure preserving actions of free groups and averages on spheres s_{2n} of even radius. Here we study state preserving actions of free groups on a von Neumann algebra A and the behaviour of (s_{2n}(x)) for x in noncommutative spaces L^p(A). For the Ces\`aro means \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} s_k and p = +\infty, this problem was solved by Walker. Our approach is based on ideas of Bufetov. We prove a noncommutative version of Rota ``Alternierende Verfahren'' theorem. To this end, we introduce specific dilations of the powers of some noncommutative Markov operators.
