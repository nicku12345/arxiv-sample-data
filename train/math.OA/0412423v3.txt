If N \subset P,Q \subset M are type II_1 factors with N' \cap M = C id and [M:N] finite we show that restrictions on the standard invariants of the elementary inclusions N \subset P, N \subset Q, P \subset M and Q \subset M imply drastic restrictions on the indices and angles between the subfactors. In particular we show that if these standard invariants are trivial and the conditional expectations onto P and Q do not commute, then [M:N] is 6 or 6 + 4\sqrt 2. In the former case N is the fixed point algebra for an outer action of S_3 on M and the angle is \pi/3, and in the latter case the angle is cos^{-1}(\sqrt 2-1) and an example may be found in the GHJ subfactor family. The techniques of proof rely heavily on planar algebras.
