Geometric realizations for the restrictions of GNS representations to unitary groups of C^*-algebras are constructed. These geometric realizations use an appropriate concept of reproducing kernels on vector bundles. To build such realizations in spaces of holomorphic sections, a class of complex coadjoint orbits of the corresponding real Banach-Lie groups are described and some homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles that are naturally associated with the coadjoint orbits are constructed.
