Let G be a locally compact group, and let A_\cb(G) denote the closure of A(G), the Fourier algebra of G, in the space of completely bounded multipliers of A(G). If G is a weakly amenable, discrete group such that \cstar(G) is residually finite-dimensional, we show that A_\cb(G) is operator amenable. In particular, A_\cb(F_2) is operator amenable even though F_2, the free group in two generators, is not an amenable group. Moreover, we show that, if G is a discrete group such that A_\cb(G) is operator amenable, a closed ideal of A(G) is weakly completely complemented in A(G) if and only if it has an approximate identity bounded in the cb-multiplier norm.
