We define the notion of \varphi-perturbation of a densely defined adjointable mapping and prove that any such mapping f between Hilbert {\mathcal A}-modules over a fixed C^*-algebra {\mathcal A} with densely defined corresponding mapping g is {\mathcal A}-linear and adjointable in the classical sense with adjoint g. If both f and g are everywhere defined then they are bounded. Our work concerns with the concept of Hyers--Ulam--Rassias stability originated from the Th.M. Rassias' stability theorem that appeared in his paper [On the stability of the linear mapping in Banach spaces, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 72 (1978), 297--300]. We also indicate interesting complementary results in the case where the Hilbert C^*-modules admit non-adjointable C^*-linear mappings.
