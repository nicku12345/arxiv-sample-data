Let X be an infinite compact metric space with finite covering dimension. Let \afhpa,\bt: X\to X be two minimal homeomorphisms. Suppose that the range of K_0-groups of both crossed product C*-algebras s are dense in the space of real affine continuous functions. We show that \af and \bt are approximately conjugate uniformly in measure if and only if they have affine homeomorphic invariant probability measure spaces.
