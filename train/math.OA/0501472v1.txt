Let A and B be separable C^*-algebras, A unital and B stable. It is shown that there is a natural six-terms exact sequence which relates the group which arises by considering all semi-split extensions of A by B to the group which arises by restricting the attention to \emph{unital} semi-split extensions of A by B. The six-terms exact sequence is an unpublished result of G. Skandalis.
