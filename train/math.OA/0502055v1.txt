We consider algebras e_i \Pi^\lambda(Q) e_i obtained from deformed preprojective algebra of affine type \Pi^\lambda(Q) and an idempotent e_i for certain concrete value of the vector \lambda which corresponds to the traces of -1\in SU(2, C) in irreducible representations of finite subgroups of SU(2, C). We give a certain realization of these algebras which allows us to construct the C^*-enveloping algebras for them. Some well-known results, including description of four projections with sum 2 happen to be a particular case of this picture.
