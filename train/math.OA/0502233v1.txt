In 1990, Lind, Schmidt and Ward gave a formula for the entropy of certain \mathbb{Z}^n-dynamical systems attached to Laurent polynomials P, in terms of the (logarithmic) Mahler measure of P. We extend the expansive case of their result to the noncommutative setting where \mathbb{Z}^n gets replaced by suitable discrete amenable groups. Generalizing the Mahler measure, Fuglede-Kadison determinants from the theory of group von Neumann algebras appear in the entropy formula.
