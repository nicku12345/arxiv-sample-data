We consider two operator space versions of type and cotype, namely S_p-type, S_q-cotype and type (p,H), cotype (q,H) for a homogeneous Hilbertian operator space H and 1\leq p \leq 2 \leq q\leq \infty, generalizing "OH-cotype 2" of G. Pisier. We compute type and cotype of some Hilbertian operator spaces and L_p spaces, and we investigate the relationship between a homogeneous Hilbertian space H and operator spaces with cotype (2,H). As applications we consider operator space versions of generalized little Grothendieck's theorem and Maurey's extension theorem in terms of these new notions.
