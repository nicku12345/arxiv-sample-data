Recently an operator space version of type and cotype, namely type (p,H) and cotype (q,H) of operator spaces for 1\leq p \leq 2\leq q \leq \infty and a subquadratic and homogeneous Hilbetian operator space H were introduced and investigated by the author. In this paper we define weak type (2,H) (resp. weak cotype (2,H)) of operator spaces, which lies strictly between type (2,H) (resp. cotype (2,H)) and type (p,H) for all 1\leq p <2 (resp. cotype (q,H) for all 2<q \leq \infty). This is an analogue of weak type 2 and weak cotype 2 in the Banach space case, so we develop analogous equivalent formulations. We also consider weak-H space, spaces with weak type (2,H) and weak cotype (2,H^*) simultaneously and establish corresponding equivalent formulations.
