In this paper, we define the first topological (\sigma,\tau)-cohomology group and examine vanishing of the first (\sigma,\tau)-cohomology groups of certain triangular Banach algebras. We apply our results to study the (\sigma,\tau)-weak amenability and (\sigma,\tau)-amenability of triangular Banach algebras.
