We study completely contractive representations of product systems of C^*-correspondences over semigroups. For a product system of C^*-correspondences over the semigroup \mathbb{N}^2, we prove that every such representation can be dilated to an isometric (or Toeplitz) representation. We use it to prove that every pair of commuting CP maps on a von Neumann algebra M can be dilated to a commuting pair of endomorphisms (on a larger von Neumann algebra).
