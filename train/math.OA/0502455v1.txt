We continue the study of the rich family of norm-closed, automorphism invariant ideals of a continuous nest algebra. First we present a unified framework which captures all stable ideals as the kernels of limits of diagonal compressions. We then characterize when two such limits give rise to the same ideal, and we obtain detailed information of the structure of sums and intersections of ideals.
