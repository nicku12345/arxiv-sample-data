We present an illustrative example of an inverse limit space and a shift map associated with an F_2^n unimodal mapping consisting of two hyperbolae. Topologically, in case n=0 the limit space is an interval, in case n=1,2, it is a sin(1/x)-continuum, and in case n=3 it is a certain continuum endowed with a specific geometrical beauty. The dynamics of the shift map is also described. Operator algebraists may regard the constructed space as a spectrum of a commutative coefficient C*-algebra - an object which plays a role in crossed-product theory.
