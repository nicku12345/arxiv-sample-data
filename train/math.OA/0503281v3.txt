In this paper, we present a new class of strongly singular maximal abelian subalgebras living inside the k-folded tensor product of the free group factor (on N>1 generators). A. Sinclair and R. Smith introduced the class of strongly singular maximal abelian von Neumann algebras (MASA) of type II_1 factors. One of their examples was the Laplacian subalgebra of the free group factor, known to be a singularMASA. Using the techniques presented by A. Sinclair and R.Smith, we show that the Laplacian subalgebra of the k-folded tensor product of the free group factor with itself is a strongly singular MASA.
