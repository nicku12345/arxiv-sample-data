A quantized metric space is a matrix order unit space equipped with an operator space version of Rieffel's Lip-norm. We develop for quantized metric spaces an operator space version of quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance. We show that two quantized metric spaces are completely isometric if and only if their quantized Gromov-Hausdorff distance is zero. We establish a completeness theorem. As applications, we show that a quantized metric space with 1-exact underlying matrix order unit space is a limit of matrix algebras with respect to quantized Gromov-Hausdorff distance, and that matrix algebras converge naturally to the sphere for quantized Gromov-Hausdorff distance.
