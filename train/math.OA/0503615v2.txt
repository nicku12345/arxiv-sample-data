We investigate the generalized derivations and show that every generalized derivation on a simple Hilbert C^*-module either is closable or has a dense range. We also describe dynamical systems on a full Hilbert C^*-module {\mathcal M} over a C^*-algebra {\mathcal A} as a one-parameter group of unitaries on {\mathcal M} and prove that if \alpha: \R\to U({\mathcal M}) is a dynamical system, where U({\mathcal M}) denotes the set of all unitary operator on {\mathcal M}, then we can correspond a C^*-dynamical system \alpha^{'} on {\mathcal A} such that if \delta and d are the infinitesimal generators of \alpha and \alpha^{'} respectively, then \delta is a d-derivation.
