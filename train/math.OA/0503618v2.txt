Let A be a Banach algebra and M be a Banach right A-module. A linear map \delta : M\to M is called a generalized derivation if there exists a derivation d : A \to A such that \delta(xa)=\delta(x)a + x d(a) \quad (a \in A, x \in M). In this paper, we associate a triangular Banach algebra {\mathcal T} to Banach A-module M and investigate the relation between generalized derivations on M and derivations on {\mathcal T}. In particular, we prove that the so-called generalized first cohomology group of M is isomorphic to the first cohomology group of {\mathcal T}.
