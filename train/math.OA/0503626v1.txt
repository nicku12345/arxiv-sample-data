It is known that given a directed graph E and a subset X of vertices, the sum of the projections associated to the vertices in X in the C*-algebra of E converges strictly in the multiplier algebra to a projection P. Here we give a construction which, in certain cases, produces a directed graph F whose C*-algebra is isomorphic to the corner P(C*(E))P. Corners of this type arise naturally as the fixed point algebras of discrete coactions on graph algebras related to labellings. We prove this fact, and show that our construction is applicable to such a case whenever the labelling satisfies an analogue of Kirchhoff's voltage law.
