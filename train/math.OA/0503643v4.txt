We study a class of matrix function algebras, here denoted \mathcal{T}^{+}(\mathcal{C}_n). We introduce a notion of point derivations, and classify the point derivations for certain finite dimensional representations of \mathcal{T}^{+}(\mathcal{C}_n). We use point derivations and information about n \times n matrices to show that every \mathcal{T}^{+}(\mathcal{C}_n)-valued derivation on \mathcal{T}^{+}(\mathcal{C}_n) is inner.
