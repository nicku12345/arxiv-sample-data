Consider a compact locally symmetric space M of rank r, with fundamental group \Gamma. The von Neumann algebra \vn(\Gamma) is the convolution algebra of functions f\in\ell_2(\Gamma) which act by left convolution on \ell_2(\Gamma). Let T^r be a totally geodesic flat torus of dimension r in M and let \Gamma_0\cong\bb Z^r be the image of the fundamental group of T^r in \Gamma. Then \vn(\Gamma_0) is a maximal abelian \star-subalgebra of \vn(\Gamma) and its unitary normalizer is as small as possible. If M has constant negative curvature then the Puk\'anszky invariant of \vn(\Gamma_0) is \infty.
