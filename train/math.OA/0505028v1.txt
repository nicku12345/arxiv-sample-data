Let \alpha and \beta be two Furstenberg transformations on 2-torus associated with irrational numbers \theta_1, \theta_2, integers d_1, d_2 and Lipschitz functions f_1 and f_2. We show that \alpha and \beta are approximately conjugate in a measure theoretical sense if (and only if) \bar{\theta_1\pm \theta_2}=0 in \R/\Z. Closely related to the classification of simple amenable C^*-algebras, we show that \alpha and \beta are approximately K-conjugate if (and only if) \bar{\theta_1\pm \theta_2}=0 in \R/\Z and |d_1|=|d_2|. This is also shown to be equivalent to that the associated crossed product C^*-algebras are isomorphic.
