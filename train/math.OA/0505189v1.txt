We define a notion of Property (T) for an arbitrary C^*-algebra A admitting a tracial state. We extend this to a notion of Property (T) for the pair (A,B), where B is a C^*-subalgebra of A. Let \Gamma be a discrete group and C^*_r(\Gamma) its reduced algebra. We show that C^*_r(\Gamma) has Property (T) if and only if the group \Gamma has Property (T) . More generally, given a subgroup \Lambda of \Gamma, the pair (C^*_r(\Gamma),C^*_r(\Lambda)) has Property (T) if and only if the pair of groups (\Gamma, \Lambda) has Property (T).
