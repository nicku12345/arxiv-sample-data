We consider contractive homomorphisms of a planar algebra {\mathcal A}(\Omega) over a finitely connected bounded domain \Omega \subseteq \C and ask if they are necessarily completely contractive. We show that a homomorphism \rho:{\mathcal A}(\Omega) \to {\mathcal B}(\mathcal H) for which \dim({\mathcal A}(\Omega)/\ker \rho) = 2 is the direct integral of homomorphisms \rho_T induced by operators on two dimensional Hilbert spaces via a suitable functional calculus \rho_T: f \mapsto f(T), f\in {\mathcal A}(\Omega). It is well-known that contractive homomorphisms \rho_T, induced by a linear transformation T:\C^2 \to \C^2 are necessarily completely contractive. Consequently, using Arveson's dilation theorem for completely contractive homomorphisms, one concludes that such a homomorphism \rho_T possesses a dilation. In this paper, we construct this dilation explicitly. In view of recent examples discovered by Dritschel and McCullough, we know that not all contractive homomorphisms \rho_T are completely contractive even if T is a linear transformation on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We show that one may be able to produce an example of a contractive homomorphism \rho_T of {\mathcal A}(\Omega) which is not completely contractive if an operator space which is naturally associated with the problem is not the MAX space. Finally, within a certain special class of contractive homomorphisms \rho_T of the planar algebra {\mathcal A}(\Omega), we construct a dilation.
