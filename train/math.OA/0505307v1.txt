We prove that a quotient of subspace of C_p\oplus_pR_p (1\le p<2) embeds completely isomorphically into a noncommutative L_p-space, where C_p and R_p are respectively the p-column and p-row Hilbertian operator spaces. We also represent C_q and R_q (p<q\le2) as quotients of subspaces of C_p\oplus_pR_p. Consequently, C_q and R_q embed completely isomorphically into a noncommutative L_p(M). We further show that the underlying von Neumann algebra M cannot be semifinite.
