We apply the Evans-Kishimoto type argument for centrally free actions of discrete amenable groups on McDuff factors, and classify them.   Especially, we present a different proof that the Connes-Takesaki modules are complete cocycle conjugacy invariants for centrally free actions of discrete amenable groups on injective factors.
