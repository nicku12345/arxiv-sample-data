Let A be a unital separable C*-algebra, and D a K_1-injective strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra. We show that if A is D-absorbing, then the crossed product of A by a compact second countable group or by Z or by R is D-absorbing as well, assuming the action satisfying a Rokhlin property. In the case of a compact Rokhlin action we prove a similar statement about approximate divisibility.
