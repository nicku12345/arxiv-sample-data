By using C*-correspondences and Cuntz-Pimsner algebras, we associate to every subshift (also called a shift space) X a C*-algebra O_X, which is a generalization of the Cuntz-Krieger algebras. We show that O_X is the universal C*-algebra generated by partial isometries satisfying relations given by X. We also show that O_X is a one-sided conjugacy invariant of X.
