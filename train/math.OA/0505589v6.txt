We consider amalgamated free product II_1 factors M = M_1 *_B M_2 *_B ... and use ``deformation/rigidity'' and ``intertwining'' techniques to prove that any relatively rigid von Neumann subalgebra Q\subset M can be intertwined into one of the M_i's. We apply this to the case M_i are w-rigid II_1 factors, with B equal to either \Bbb C, to a Cartan subalgebra A in M_i, or to a regular hyperfinite II_1 subfactor R in M_i, to obtain the following type of unique decomposition results, \`a la Bass-Serre: If M = (N_1 *_C N_2 *_C ...)^t, for some t>0 and some other similar inclusions of algebras C\subset N_j then, after a permutation of indices, (B\subset M_i) is inner conjugate to (C\subset N_i)^t, \forall i. Taking B=\Bbb C and M_i = (L(\Bbb Z^2 \rtimes \Bbb F_{2}))^{t_i}, with \{t_i\}_{i\geq 1}=S a given countable subgroup of \Bbb R_+^*, we obtain continuously many non stably isomorphic factors M with fundamental group \mycal F(M) equal to S. For B=A, we obtain a new class of factors M with unique Cartan subalgebra decomposition, with a large subclass satisfying \mycal F(M)=\{1\} and Out(M) abelian and calculable. Taking B=R, we get examples of factors with \mycal F(M)=\{1\}, Out(M)=K, for any given separable compact abelian group K.
