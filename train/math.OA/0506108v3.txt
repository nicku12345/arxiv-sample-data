Suppose M is a tracial von Neumann algebra embeddable into \mathcal R^{\omega} (the ultraproduct of the hyperfinite II_1-factor) and X is an n-tuple of selfadjoint generators for M. Denote by \Gamma(X;m,k,\gamma) the microstate space of X of order (m,k,\gamma). We say that X is tubular if for any \epsilon >0 there exist m \in \mathbb N and \gamma>0 such that if (x_1,..., x_n), (y_1, ..., y_n) \in \Gamma(X;m,k,\gamma), then there exists a k \times k unitary u satisfying |ux_iu^* - y_i|_2 < \epsilon for each 1 \leq i \leq n. We show that the following conditions are equivalent: 1) M is amenable (i.e., injective). 2) X is tubular; 3) Any two embeddings of M into \mathcal R^{\omega} are conjugate by a unitary u in \mathcal R^{\omega}.
