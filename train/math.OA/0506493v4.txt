A locally compact group G is compact if and only if L^1(G) is an ideal in L^1(G)^{**}, and the Fourier algebra A(G) of G is an ideal in A(G)^{**} if and only if G is discrete. On the other hand, G is discrete if and only if C_0(G) is an ideal in C_0(G)^{**}. We show that these assertions are special cases of results on locally compact quantum groups in the sense of J. Kustermans and S. Vaes. In particular, a von Neumann algebraic quantum group (M,\Gamma) is compact if and only if M_* is an ideal in M^*, and a (reduced) C^*-algebraic quantum group (A,\Gamma) is discrete if and only if A is an ideal in A^{**}.
