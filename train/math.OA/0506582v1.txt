For a finitely aligned k-graph \Lambda with X a set of vertices in \Lambda we define a universal C*-algebra called C^*(\Lambda,X) generated by partial isometries. We show that C^*(\Lambda,X) is isomorphic to the corner P_XC^*(\Lambda)P_X, where P_X is the sum of vertex projections in X. We then prove a version of the Gauge Invariant Uniqueness Theorem for C^*(\Lambda,X), and then use the theorem to prove various results involving fullness, simplicity and Morita equivalence as well as new results involving symbolic dynamics.
