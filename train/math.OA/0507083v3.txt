A seminal result of Agler characterizes the so-called Schur-Agler class of functions on the polydisk in terms of a unitary colligation transfer function representation. We generalize this to the unit ball of the algebra of multipliers for a family of test functions over a broad class of semigroupoids. There is then an associated interpolation theorem. Besides leading to solutions of the familiar Nevanlinna-Pick and Caratheodory-Fejer interpolation problems and their multivariable commutative and noncommutative generalizations, this approach also covers more exotic examples.
