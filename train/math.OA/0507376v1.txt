A unitary equivalence class of endomorphisms of a unital C^{*}-algebra {\cal A} is called a {\it sector} of {\cal A}. We introduced permutative endomorphisms of the Cuntz algebra {\cal O}_N in the previous work. Branching laws of permutative representations of {\cal O}_N by them are computed by directed regular graphs. In this article, we classify sectors associated with permutative endomorphisms of {\cal O}_N by their graph invariants concretely.
