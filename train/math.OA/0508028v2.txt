Let A be a C^*-algebra acting on a Hilbert space H, \sigma:A\to B(H) be a linear mapping and d:A\to B(H) be a \sigma-derivation. Generalizing the celebrated theorem of Sakai, we prove that if \sigma is a continuous *-mapping then d is automatically continuous. In addition, we show the converse is true in the sense that if d is a continuous *-\sigma-derivation then there exists a continuous linear mapping \Sigma:A\to B(H) such that d is *-\Sigma-derivation. The continuity of the so-called *-(\sigma,\tau)-derivations is also discussed.
