In this paper we study the unitary equivalence between Hilbert modules over a locally C*-algebra. Also, we prove a stabilization theorem for countably generated modules over an arbitrary locally C*-algebra and show that a Hilbert module over a Frechet locally C*-algebra is countably generated if and only if the locally C*-algebra of all ''compact'' operators has an approximate unit.
