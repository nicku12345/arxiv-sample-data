We prove that a discrete group G is amenable iff it is strongly unitarizable in the following sense: every unitarizable representation \pi on G can be unitarized by an invertible chosen in the von Neumann algebra generated by the range of \pi. Analogously a C^*-algebra A is nuclear iff any bounded homomorphism u: A\to B(H) is strongly similar to a *-homomorphism in the sense that there is an invertible operator \xi in the von Neumann algebra generated by the range of u such that a\to \xi u(a) \xi^{-1} is a *-homomorphism. An analogous characterization holds in terms of derivations. We apply this to answer several questions left open in our previous work concerning the length \ell(A,B) of the maximal tensor product A\otimes_{\max} B of two unital C^*-algebras, when we consider its generation by the subalgebras A\otimes 1 and 1\otimes B. We show that if \ell(A,B)<\infty either for B=B(\ell_2) or when B is the C^*-algebra (either full or reduced) of a non Abelian free group, then A must be nuclear. We also show that \ell(A,B)\le d iff the canonical quotient map from the unital free product A\ast B onto A\otimes_{\max} B remains a complete quotient map when restricted to the closed span of the words of length \le d.
