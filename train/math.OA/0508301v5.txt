The study of harmonic functions on a locally compact group G has recently been transferred to a ``non-commutative'' setting in two different directions: C.-H. Chu and A. T.-M. Lau replaced the algebra L^\infty(G) by the group von Neumann algebra VN(G) and the convolution action of a probability measure \mu on L^\infty(G) by the canonical action of a positive definite function \sigma on \VN(G); on the other hand, W. Jaworski and the first-named author replaced L^\infty(G) by B(L^2(G)) to which the convolution action by \mu can be extended in a natural way. We establish a link between both approaches. The action of \sigma on VN(G) can be extended to B (L^2(G)). We study the corresponding space \tilde{H}_\sigma of ``\sigma-harmonic operators'', i.e., fixed points in B(L^2(G)) under the action of \sigma. We show, under mild conditions on either \sigma or G, that \tilde{H}_\sigma is in fact a von Neumann subalgebra of B (L^2(G)). Our investigation of \tilde{H}_\sigma relies, in particular, on a notion of support for an arbitrary operator in B(L^2(G)) that extends Eymard's definition for elements of VN(G). Finally, we present an approach to \tilde{H}_\sigma via ideals in T (L^2(G)) - where T(L^2(G)) denotes the trace class operators on L^2(G), but equipped with a product different from composition -, as it was pioneered for harmonic functions by G.
