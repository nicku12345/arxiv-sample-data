Assume \N is a von Neumann algebra of type II_1 with a tracial state \tau_{\N}, and \M is the von Neumann algebra of the n\times n matrices over \N with the canonical tracial state \tau_{\M}. Let \mathcal D_n be the subalgebra of \M consisting of scalar diagonal matrices in \M. In this article, we study the properties of semicircular elements in \M that are free from \mathcal D_n with respect to \tau_{\M}. Then we define a new concept "matricial distance" of two elements in \M and compute the matricial distance between two free semicircular elements in \M.
