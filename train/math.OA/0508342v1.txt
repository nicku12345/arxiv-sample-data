Let (G, X) be a second-countable transformation group with G acting freely on X. It is shown that measure-theoretic accumulation of the action and topological strength of convergence in the orbit space X/G provide equivalent ways of quantifying the extent of non-properness of the action. These notions are linked via the representation theory of the transformation-group C*-algebra.
