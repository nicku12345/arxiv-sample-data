Given C^*-algebras A and B acting cyclically on Hilbert spaces \h and \k, respectively, we characterize completely isometric A,B-bimodule maps from \bkh into operator A,B-bimodules. We determine cogenerators in some classes of operator bimodules. For an injective cogenerator X in a suitable category of operator A,B-bimodules we show: if A, regarded as a C^*-subalgebra of \al(X) (adjointable left multipliers on X), is equal to its relative double commutant in \al(X), then A must be a W^*-algebra.
