In the paper one considers the local structure of the Fredholm joint spectrum of commuting n-tuples of operators. A connection between the spatial characteristics of operators and the algebraic invariant of the corresponding coherent sheaves is investigated. A notion of Weyl joint spectrum of commuting n-tuple is introduced.
