We recapture Kuperberg's numerical invariant of 3-manifolds associated to a semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf algebra through a `planar algebra construction'. A result of possibly independent interest, used during the proof, which relates duality in planar graphs and Hopf algebras, is the subject of a final section.
