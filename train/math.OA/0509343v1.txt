This is the final one in the series of papers where we introduce and study the C^*-algebras associated with topological graphs. In this paper, we get a sufficient condition on topological graphs so that the associated C^*-algebras are simple and purely infinite. Using this result, we give one method to construct all Kirchberg algebras as C^*-algebras associated with topological graphs.
