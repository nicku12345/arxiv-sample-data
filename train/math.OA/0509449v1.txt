We provide a geometric characterization of manifolds of dimension 3 with fundamental groups of which all conjugacy classes except 1 are infinite, namely of which the von Neumann algebras are factors of type II_1: they are essentially the 3-manifolds with infinite fundamental groups on which there does not exist any Seifert fibration.   Otherwise said and more precisely, let M be a compact connected 3-manifold and let \Gamma be its fundamental group, supposed to be infinite and with at least one finite conjugacy class besides 1. If M is orientable, then \Gamma is the fundamental group of a Seifert manifold; if M is not orientable, then \Gamma is the fundamental group of a Seifert manifold modulo \Bbb P in the sense of Heil and Whitten \cite{HeWh--94}.   We make heavy use of results on 3-manifolds, as well classical results (as can be found in the books of Hempel, Jaco, and Shalen), as more recent ones (solution of the Seifert fibred space conjecture).
