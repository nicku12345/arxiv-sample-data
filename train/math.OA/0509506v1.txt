Let A be a unital C^*-algebra and \alpha be an injective, unital endomorphism of A. A covariant representation of (A,\alpha) is a pair (\pi,T) consisting of a C^*-representation \pi of A on a Hilbert space H and a contraction T in B(H) satisfying T\pi(\alpha(a))=\pi(a)T.   It follows from more general results of ours that such a covariant representation can be extended to a covariant representation (\rho,V) (on a larger space K) such that V is a coisometry and it can be dilated to a covariant representation (\sigma,U) (on a larger space K_1) with U unitary.   Our objective here is to give self-contained, elementary proofs of these results which avoid the technology of C^*-correspondences. We also discuss the non uniqueness of the extension.
