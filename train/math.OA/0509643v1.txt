In this paper, we observevd the amalgamated free probability of direct product of noncommutative probability spaces. We defined the amalgamated R-transforms, amalgamated moment series and the amalgamated boxed convolution. They maks us to do the amalgamated R-transform calculus, like the scalar-valued case.
