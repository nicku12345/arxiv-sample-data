A map \phi:M_m(\bC)\to M_n(\bC) is decomposable if it is of the form \phi=\phi_1+\phi_2 where \phi_1 is a CP map while \phi_2 is a co-CP map. It is known that if m=n=2 then every positive map is decomposable. Given an extremal unital positive map \phi:M_2(\bC)\to M_2(\bC) we construct concrete maps (not necessarily unital) \phi_1 and \phi_2 which give a decomposition of \phi. We also show that in most cases this decomposition is unique.
