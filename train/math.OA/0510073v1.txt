In this paper we prove a Radon-Nikodym type theorem for strict completely n-positive linear maps which describes the order relation on the set of all strict completely n -positive linear maps from a locally C^{\ast }-algebra A to a C^{\ast}-algebra B, in terms of a self-dual Hilbert C^{\ast}-module structure induced by each strict completely n -positive linear map. As applications of this result we characterize the pure completely n-positive linear maps from A to B and the extreme elements in the set of all identity preserving completely n-positive linear maps from A to B. Also we determine a certain class of extreme elements in the set of all identity preserving completely positive linear maps from A to M_{n}(B).
