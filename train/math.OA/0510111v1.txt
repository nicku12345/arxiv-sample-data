Let (N,\R,\theta) be a centrally ergodic W* dynamical system. When N is not a factor, we show that, for each t\not=0, the crossed product induced by the time t automorphism \theta_t is not a factor if and only if there exist a rational number r and an eigenvalue s of the restriction of \theta to the center of N, such that rst=2\pi. In the C* setting, minimality seems to be the notion corresponding to central ergodicity. We show that if (A,\R,\alpha) is a minimal unital C* dynamical system and A is either prime or commutative but not simple, then, for each t\not=0, the crossed product induced by the time t automorphism \alpha_t is not simple if and only if there exist a rational number r and an eigenvalue s of the restriction of \alpha to the center of A, such that rst=2\pi.
