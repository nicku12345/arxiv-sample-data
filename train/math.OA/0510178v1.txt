In this paper we analyze the Banach *-algebra of time-frequency shifts with absolutely summable coefficients. We prove a noncommutative version of the Wiener lemma. We also construct a faithful tracial state on this algebra which implies the algebra contains no compact operators. As a corollary we obtain a special case of the Heil-Ramanathan-Topiwala conjecture regarding linear independence of finitely many time-frequency shifts of one L^2 function.
