In this paper, we exhibit strongly singular maximal abelian subalgebras living inside certain k-folded tensors of von Neumann group factors. The two classes of groups under consideration are the free groups of rank greater than 2 and the free product of m>2 groups, all finite and having the same order p>2 (m>p-1). We prove actually more, namely that the unique trace preserving conditional expectations from these group factors onto their Laplacian subalgebras are asymptotic homomorphisms, which in turn implies that the subalgebras are strongly singular masas.
