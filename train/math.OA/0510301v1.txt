Let M be a finite von Neumann algebra with the Haagerup property, and let G be a compact group that acts continuously on M and that preserves some finite trace \tau. We prove that if \Gamma is a countable subgroup of G which has the Haagerup property, then the crossed product algebra M\rtimes\Gamma has also the Haagerup property. In particular, we study some ergodic, non-weakly mixing actions of groups with the Haagerup property on finite, injective von Neumann algebras, and we prove that the associated crossed products von Neumann algebras are \textrm{II}_1-factors with the Haagerup property. If moreover the actions have Property (\tau), then the latter factors are full.
