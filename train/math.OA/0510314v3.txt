We prove that unique ergodicity of tensor product of C^*-dynamical system implies its strictly weak mixing. By means of this result a uniform weighted ergodic theorem with respect to S-Besicovitch sequences for strictly weak mixing dynamical systems is proved. Moreover, we provide certain examples of strictly weak mixing dynamical systems.
