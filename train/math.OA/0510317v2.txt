The subject of quasidiagonality is of much interest in many places - among other things, in the classification program for simple unital separable nuclear C*-algebras. In this note, we give two characterizations of nuclearity and quasidiagonality (for simple unital separable C*-algebras).   Our first characterization is the nuclear analogue of Dadarlat's characterization of exact quasidiagonal C*-algebras. Our second characterizatiion is "dual" to the interesting (and important) Popa property first studied by Popa.
