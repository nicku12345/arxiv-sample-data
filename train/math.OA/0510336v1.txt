Akcoglu and Suchaston proved the following result: Let T:L^1(X,{\cf},\m)\to L^1(X,{\cf},\m) be a positive contraction. Assume that for z\in L^1(X,{\cf},\m) the sequence (T^nz) converges weakly in L^1(X,{\cf},\m), then either \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\|T^nz\|=0 or there exists a positive function h\in L^1(X,{\cf},\m), h\neq 0 such that Th=h. In the paper we prove an extension of this result in finite von Neumann algebra setting, and as a consequence we obtain that if a positive contraction of a noncommutative L^1-space has no non zero positive invariant element, then its mixing property implies completely mixing property one.
