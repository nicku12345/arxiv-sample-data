We extend Beurling's invariant subspace theorem, by characterizing subspaces K of the noncommutative L^p spaces which are invariant with respect to Arveson's maximal subdiagonal algebras, sometimes known as noncommutative H^\infty. It is significant that a certain subspace, and a certain quotient, of K are L^p({\mathcal D})-modules in the recent sense of Junge and Sherman, and therefore have a nice decomposition into cyclic submodules. We also give general inner-outer factorization formulae for elements in the noncommutative L^p. These facts generalize the classical ones, and should be useful in the future development of noncommutative H^p theory. In addition, these results characterize maximal subdiagonal algebras.
