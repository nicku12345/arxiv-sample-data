We introduce two nonnegative real-valued invariants for unital and stably finite C*-algebras whose minimal instances coincide with the notion of classifiability via the Elliott invariant. The first of these is defined for AH algebras, and may be thought of as a generalisation of slow dimension growth. The second invariant is defined for any unital and stably finite algebra, and may be thought of as an abstract version of the first invariant. We establish connections between both invariants and ordered K-theory, and prove that the range of the first invariant is exhausted by simple unital AH algebras. Consequently, the class of simple, unital, and non-Z-stable AH algebras is uncountable.
