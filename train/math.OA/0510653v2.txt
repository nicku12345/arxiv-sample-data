We show that if a product system comes from a quantum Markov semigroup, then it carries a natural Borel structure with respect to which the semigroup may be realized in terms of a measurable representation. We show, too, that the dual product system of a Borel product system also carries a natural Borel structure. We apply our analysis to study the order interval consisting of all quantum Markov semigroups that are subordinate to a given one.
