We give an elementary characterization of those (abelian) semigroups M that are direct limits of countable sequences of finite direct products of monoids of the form C\cup\{0\} for monogenic groups C. This characterization involves the Riesz refinement property together with lattice-theoretical properties of the collection of subgroups of M, and it makes it possible to express M as a certain submonoid of a direct product S\times G, where S is a distributive semilattice with zero and G is an abelian group. When applied to the monoids V(A) appearing in the nonstable K-theory of C*-algebras, our results yield a full description of V(A) for C*-inductive limits A of finite products of full matrix algebras over either Cuntz algebras O\_n, where 2\leq n<\infty, or corners of O\_{\infty} by projections, thus extending to the case including O\_{\infty} earlier work by the authors together with K.R.
