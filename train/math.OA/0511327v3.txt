In the paper, we study the generator problem of II_1 factors. By defining a new concept related to the number of generators of a von Neumann algebra, we are able to show that a large class of II_1 factors are singly generated, i.e., generated by two self-adjoint elements. In particular, this shows that most of II_1 factors, whose free entropy dimensions are less than or equal to one, are singly generated.
