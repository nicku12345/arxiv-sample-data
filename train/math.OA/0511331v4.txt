We study the C*-algebra crossed-product of the closed unit disk by the action of one of its conformal automorphisms. After classifying the conformal automorphisms up to topological conjugacy, we investigate, for each class, the irreducible representations of the full C*-crossed-products, and derive their spectrum and a complete desciption of the algebras.
