A family \{T_j\}_{j\in J} of commuting Hilbert space operators is said to be a spherical isometry if \sum_{j\in J}T^*_jT_j=1 in the weak operator topology. We show that every commuting family \Cal F of spherical isometries has a commuting normal extension \hat{\Cal F}. Moreover, if \hat{\Cal F} is minimal, then there exists a natural short exact sequence 0\to\Cal C\to C^*(\Cal F)\to C^*(\hat{\Cal F})\to 0 with a completely isometric cross-section, where \Cal C is the commutator ideal in C^*(\Cal F). We also show that the space of Toeplitz operators associated to \Cal F is completely isometric to the commutant of the minimal normal extension \hat{\Cal F}. Applications of these results are given for Toeplitz operators on strictly pseudoconvex or bounded symmetric domains.
