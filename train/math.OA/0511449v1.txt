Suppose G is a second countable, locally compact, Hausdorff groupoid with a fixed left Haar system. Let \go/G denote the orbit space of G and C^*(G) denote the groupoid C^*-algebra. Suppose that the isotropy groups of G are amenable. We show that C^*(G) is CCR if and only if \go/G is a T_1 topological space and all of the isotropy groups are CCR. We also show that C^*(G) is GCR if and only if \go/G is a T_0 topological space and all of the isotropy groups are GCR.
