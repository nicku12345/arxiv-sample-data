Suppose G is a second countable, locally compact, Hausdorff groupoid with a fixed left Haar system. Let \go/G denote the orbit space of G and \cs(G) denote the groupoid C^*-algebra. Suppose that G is a principal groupoid. We show that C^*(G) is CCR if and only if \go/G is a T_1 topological space, and that C^*(G) is GCR if and only if \go/G is a T_0 topological space. We also show that C^*(G) is a Fell Algebra if and only if G is a Cartan groupoid.
