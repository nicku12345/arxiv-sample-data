Let \theta be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real d by d matrix, and let A_{\theta} be the corresponding simple higher dimensional noncommutative torus. Suppose that d is odd, or that d is greater or equal to 4 and the entries of \theta are not contained in a quadratic extension of \mathbb{Q}. Then A_{\theta} is isomorphic to the transformation group C*-algebra obtained from a minimal homeomorphism of a compact connected one dimensional space locally homeomorphic to the product of the interval and the Cantor set. The proof uses classification theory of C*-algebras.
