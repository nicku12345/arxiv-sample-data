An analogue of Krein's extension theorem is proved for operator-valued positive definite functions on free groups. The proof gives also the parametrization of all extensions by means of a generalized type of Szego parameters. One singles out a distinguished completion, called central, which is related to quasi-multiplicative positive definite functions. An application is given to factorization of noncommutative polynomials.
