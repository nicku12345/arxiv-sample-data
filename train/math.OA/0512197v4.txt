We consider the Aluthge transform |T|^{1/2}U|T|^{1/2} of a Hilbert space operator T, where T=U|T| is the polar decomposition of T. We prove that the map that sends T to its Aluthge transform is continuous with respect to the norm topology and with respect to the *--SOT topology on bounded sets. We consider the special case in a tracial von Neumann algebra when U implements an automorphism of the von Neumann algebra generated by the positive part |T| of T, and we prove that the iterated Aluthge transform converges to a normal operator whose Brown measure agrees with that of T (and we compute this Brown measure). This proof relies on a theorem that is an analogue of von Neumann's mean ergodic theorem, but for sums weighted by binomial coefficients.
