We obtain some results that relate the Connes spectrum with the innerness of automorphisms in the fixed point local multiplier algebra. The results are variants and/or extensions of corresponding results of Olesen, Pedersen and Stormer [6], [7], [9] and Ara and Mathieu [1] to the case of local multiplier algebras.
