We prove that if a countable discrete group \Gamma is {\it w-rigid}, i.e. it contains an infinite normal subgroup H with the relative property (T) (e.g. \Gamma= SL(2,\Bbb Z) \ltimes \Bbb Z^2, or \Gamma = H \times H' with H an infinite Kazhdan group and H' arbitrary), and \Cal V is a closed subgroup of the group of unitaries of a finite von Neumann algebra (e.g. \Cal V countable discrete, or separable compact), then any \Cal V-valued measurable cocycle for a measure preserving action \Gamma \curvearrowright X of \Gamma on a probability space (X,\mu) which is weak mixing on H and {\it s-malleable} (e.g. the Bernoulli action \Gamma \curvearrowright [0,1]^\Gamma) is cohomologous to a group morphism of \Gamma into \Cal V. We use the case \Cal V discrete of this result to prove that if in addition \Gamma has no non-trivial finite normal subgroups then any orbit equivalence between \Gamma \curvearrowright X and a free ergodic measure preserving action of a countable group \Lambda is implemented by a conjugacy of the actions, with respect to some group isomorphism \Gamma \simeq \Lambda.
