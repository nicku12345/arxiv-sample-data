In this work we characterise the C*-algebras A generated by projections with the property that every pair of projections in A has positive angle, as certain extensions of abelian algebras by algebras of compact operators. We show that this property is equivalent to a lattice theoretic property of projections and also to the property that the set of finite-dimensional *-subalgebras of A is directed.
