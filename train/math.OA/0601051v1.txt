We study conditions on a C^*-dynamical system (A,G,\alpha) under which induction of primitive ideals (resp. irreducible representations) from stabilizers for the action of G on the primitive ideal space \Prim(A) give primitive ideals (resp. irreducible representations) of the crossed product A\rtimes_\alpha G. The results build on earlier results of Sauvageot and others, and will correct a (possibly overly optimistic) statement of the first author.
