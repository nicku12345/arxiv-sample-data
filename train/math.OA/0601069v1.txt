We show that finitely generated subhomogeneous C*-algebras have finite decomposition rank. As a consequence, any separable ASH C*-algebra can be written as an inductive limit of subhomogeneous C*-algebras each of which has finite decomposition rank. It then follows from work of H. Lin and of the second named author that the class of simple unital ASH algebras which have real rank zero and absorb the Jiang-Su algebra tensorially satisfies the Elliott conjecture.
