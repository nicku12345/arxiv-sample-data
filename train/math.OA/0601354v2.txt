We study relations between (H,\beta)--KMS states on Cuntz--Krieger algebras and the dual of the Perron--Frobenius operator \mathcal{L}_{-\beta H}^{*}. Generalising the well--studied purely hyperbolic situation, we obtain under mild conditions that for an expansive dynamical system there is a one--one correspondence between (H,\beta)--KMS states and eigenmeasures of \mathcal{L}_{-\beta H}^{*} for the eigenvalue 1. We then consider representations of Cuntz--Krieger algebras which are induced by Markov fibred systems, and show that if the associated incidence matrix is irreducible then these are \ast--isomorphic to the given Cuntz--Krieger algebra. Finally, we apply these general results to study multifractal decompositions of limit sets of essentially free Kleinian groups G which may have parabolic elements. We show that for the Cuntz--Krieger algebra arising from G there exists an analytic family of KMS states induced by the Lyapunov spectrum of the analogue of the Bowen--Series map associated with G. Furthermore, we obtain a formula for the Hausdorff dimensions of the restrictions of these KMS states to the set of continuous functions on the limit set of G. If G has no parabolic elements, then this formula can be interpreted as the singularity spectrum of the measure of maximal entropy associated with G.
