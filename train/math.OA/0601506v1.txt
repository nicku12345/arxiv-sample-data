Let \mathcal{G} be a countably infinite group of unitary operators on a complex separable Hilbert space H. Let X = \{x_{1},...,x_{r}\} and Y = \{y_{1},...,y_{s}\} be finite subsets of H, r < s, V_{0} = \bar{span} \mathcal{G}(X), V_1 = \bar{span} \mathcal{G}(Y) and  V_{0} \subset V_{1} . We prove the following result: Let W_0 be a closed linear subspace of V_1 such that V_0 \oplus W_0 = V_1 (i.e., V_0 + W_0 = V_1 and V_0 \cap W_0 = \{0 \}). Suppose that \mathcal{G}(X) and \mathcal{G}(Y) are Riesz bases for V_{0} and V_{1} respectively. Then there exists a subset \Gamma =\{z_1,..., z_{s-r}\} of W_0 such that \mathcal{G}(\Gamma) is a Riesz basis for W_0 if and only if  g(W_0) \subseteq W_0  for every g in \mathcal{G}. We first handle the case where the group is abelian and then use a cancellation theorem of Dixmier to adapt this to the non-abelian case. Corresponding results for the frame case and the biorthogonal case are also obtained.
