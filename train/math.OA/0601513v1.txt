Let A be a unital simple A\T-algebra of real rank zero. Given an isomorphism \gamma_1: K_1(A)\to K_1(A), we show that there is an automorphism \af: A\to A such that \af_{*1}=\gamma_1 which has the tracial Rokhlin property. Consequently, the crossed product A\rtimes_{\af}\Z is a simple unital AH-algebra with real rank zero. We also show that automorphism with Rokhlin property can be constructed from minimal homeomorphisms on a connected compact metric space.
