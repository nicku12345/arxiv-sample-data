A singular masa A in a \rm{II}_{1} factor N is defined by the property that any unitary w\in N for which A=wAw^* must lie in A. A strongly singular masa A is one that satisfies the inequality \| E_A- E_{wAw^*}\|_{\infty,2}\geq\|w- E_A(w)\|_2 for all unitaries w\in N, where E_A is the conditional expectation of N onto A, and \|\cdot\|_{\infty,2} is defined for bounded maps \phi :N\to N by \sup\{\|\phi(x)\|_2:x\in N, \|x\|\leq 1\}. Strong singularity easily implies singularity, and the main result of this paper shows the reverse implication.
