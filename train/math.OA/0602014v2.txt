With every Eo-semigroup (acting on the algebra of of bounded operators on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space) there is an associated Arveson system. One of the most important results about Arveson systems is that every Arveson system is the one associated with an Eo-semigroup. In these notes we give a new proof of this result that is considerably simpler than the existing ones and allows for a generalization to product systems of Hilbert module (to be published elsewhere).
