Using methods of R.J.Tauer we exhibit an uncountable family of singular masas in the hyperfinite \textrm{II}_1 factor \R all with Puk\'anszky invariant \{1\}, no pair of which are conjugate by an automorphism of R. This is done by introducing an invariant \Gamma(A) for a masa A in a \IIi factor N as the maximal size of a projection e\in A for which A e contains non-trivial centralising sequences for eN e. The masas produced give rise to a continuous map from the interval [0,1] into the singular masas in \R equiped with the d_{\infty,2}-metric.   A result is also given showing that the Puk\'anszky invariant is d_{\infty,2}-upper semi-continuous. As a consequence, the sets of masas with Puk\'anszky invariant \{n\} are all closed.
