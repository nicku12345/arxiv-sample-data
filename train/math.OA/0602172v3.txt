A family of algebras, which we call topological conjugacy algebras, is associated with each proper continuous map on a locally compact Hausdorff space. Assume that \eta_i:\X_i\to \X_i is a continuous proper map on a locally compact Hausdorff space \X_i, for i = 1,2. We show that the dynamical systems (\X_1, \eta_1) and (\X_2, \eta_2) are conjugate if and only if some topological conjugacy algebra of (\X_1, \eta_1) is isomorphic as an algebra to some topological conjugacy algebra of (\X_2, \eta_2). This implies as a corollary the complete classification of the semicrossed products C_0(\X) \times_{\eta} \bbZ^{+}, which was previously considered by Arveson and Josephson, Peters, Hadwin and Hoover and Power. We also obtain a complete classification of all semicrossed products of the form A(\bbD) \times_{\eta}\bbZ^{+}, where A(\bbD) denotes the disc algebra and \eta: \bbD \to \bbD a continuous map which is analytic on the interior. In this case, a surprising dichotomy appears in the classification scheme, which depends on the fixed point set of \eta. We also classify more general semicrossed products of uniform algebras.
