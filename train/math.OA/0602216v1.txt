We show that for a quantum L^p-martingale (X(t)), p>2, there exists a Doob-Meyer decomposition of the submartingale (|X(t)|^2). A noncommutative counterpart of a classical process continuous with probability one is introduced, and a quantum stochastic integral of such a process with respect to an L^p-martingale, p>2, is constructed. Using this construction, the uniqueness of the Doob-Meyer decomposition for a quantum martingale `continuous with probability one' is proved, and explicit forms of this decomposition and the quadratic variation process for such a martingale are obtained.
