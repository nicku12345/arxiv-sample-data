Let B be a C*-algebra with a maximal coaction of a locally compact group G, and let N and H be closed normal subgroups of G with N contained in H. We show that the process Ind_(G/H)^G which uses Mansfield's bimodule to induce representations of the crossed product of B by G from those of the restricted crossed product of B by (G/H) is equivalent to the two-stage induction process: Ind_(G/N)^G composed with Ind_(G/H)^(G/N). The proof involves a calculus of symmetric imprimitivity bimodules which relates the bimodule tensor product to the fibred product of the underlying spaces.
