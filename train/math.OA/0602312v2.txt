Kazhdan's notion of property T has recently been imported to the C^*-world by Bekka. Our objective is to extend a well known fact to this realm; we show that a nuclear C^*-algebra with property T is finite dimensional (for all intents and purposes). Though the result is not surprising, the proof is significantly more complicated than the discrete group case.
