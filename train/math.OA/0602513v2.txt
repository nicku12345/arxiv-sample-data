We study a general Kishimoto's problem for automorphisms on simple C*-algebras with tracial rank zero. Let A be a unital separable simple C*-algebra with tracial rank zero and let \alpha be an automorphism. Under the assumption that \alpha has certain Rokhlin property, we present a proof that A\rtimes_{\alpha}\Z has tracial rank zero. We also show that if the induced map \alpha_{*0} on K_0(A) fixes a "dense" subgroup of K_0(A) then the tracial Rokhlin property implies a stronger Rokhlin property. Consequently, the induced crossed product C*-algebras have tracial rank zero.
