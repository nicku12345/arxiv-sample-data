The article is devoted to quasilinear operators in spaces over quaternions and octonions. Spectral theory of bounded and unbounded operators is investigated. Analogs of C^* algebras are defined and studied. Among main results are analogs of the Gelfand-Mazur, Stone, Gelfand-Naimark-Segal, von Neumann, Kaplansky, etc. theorems, but here over the skew field of quaternions and the octonion algebra.
