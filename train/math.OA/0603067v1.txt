We provide groupoid models for Toeplitz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras of topological higher-rank graphs. Extending the groupoid models used in the theory of graph algebras and topological dynamical systems to our setting, we prove results on essential freeness and amenability of the groupoids which capture the existing theory, and extend results involving group crossed products of graph algebras.
