In this paper we study the non-amenability question of the Thompson group F from the C^{*} algebra side. Using a characterization of amenability in this framework we set about evaluating the reduced norm of the averages \frac{1}{n}\sum x_0^ix_1x_0^{-i}, where x_0 and x_1 are the generators of F in its finite presentation. We prove that when n is sufficiently large the above norm concentrates on a specific subset of F, easy to describe using the new normal form for elements in F, found by Guba and Sapir. We view this subset as the only obstruction against non-amenability.
