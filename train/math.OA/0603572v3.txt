The principal graph X of a subfactor with finite Jones index is one of the important algebraic invariants of the subfactor. If \Delta is the adjacency matrix of X we consider the equation \Delta=U+U^{-1}. When X has square norm \leq 4 the spectral measure of U can be averaged by using the map u\to u^{-1}, and we get a probability measure \epsilon on the unit circle which does not depend on U. We find explicit formulae for this measure \epsilon for the principal graphs of subfactors with index \le 4, the (extended) Coxeter-Dynkin graphs of type A, D and E. The moment generating function of \epsilon is closely related to Jones' \Theta-series.
