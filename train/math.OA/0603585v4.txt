We develop a systematic approach to the study of independence in topological dynamics with an emphasis on combinatorial methods. One of our principal aims is to combinatorialize the local analysis of topological entropy and related mixing properties. We also reframe our theory of dynamical independence in terms of tensor products and thereby expand its scope to C*-dynamics.
