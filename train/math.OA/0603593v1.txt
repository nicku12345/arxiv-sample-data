To study outer actions \a of a group G on a factor \sM of type {\threel}, 0<\la<1, we study first the cohomology group of a group with the unitary group of an abelian {\vna} as a coefficient group and establish a technique to reduce the coefficient group to the torus \T by the Shapiro mechanism based on the groupoid approach. We then show a functorial construction of outer actions of a {\cdag} on an AFD factor of type {\threel}, sharpening the result in \cite{KtT2: \S4}. The periodicity of the flow of weights on a factor \sM of type {\threel} allows us to introduce an equivariant commutative square directly related to the discrete core. But this makes it necessary to introduce an enlarged group \Aut(\sM)_\txm relative to the modulus homomorphism \txm=\mod: \Aut(\sM)\mapsto \rt'z. We then discuss the reduced {\mhjr}, which allows us to describe the invariant of outer action \a in a simpler form than the one for a general AFD factor: for example, the cohomology group \tH_{\txm, \fs}^\out(G, N, \T) of modular obstructions is a compact abelian group. Making use of these reductions, we prove the classification result of outer actions of G on an {\AFD} factor \sM of type \threel.
