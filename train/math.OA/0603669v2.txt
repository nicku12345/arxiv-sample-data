Suppose N is a diffuse, property T von Neumann algebra and X is an arbitrary finite generating set of selfadjoint elements for N. By using rigidity/deformation arguments applied to representations of N in full matrix algebras, we deduce that the microstate spaces of X are asymptotically discrete up to unitary conjugacy. We use this description to show that the free entropy dimension of X, \delta_0(X), is less than or equal to 1. It follows that when N embeds into the ultraproduct of the hyperfinite \mathrm{II}_1-factor, then \delta_0(X)=1 and otherwise, \delta_0(X)=-\infinity. This generalizes the earlier results of Voiculescu, and Ge, Shen pertaining to SL_n(\mathbb Z) as well as the results of Connes, Shlyakhtenko pertaining to group generators of arbitrary property T algebras.
