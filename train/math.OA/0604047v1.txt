Let X be a compact metric space and let \af be a homeomorphism on X. Related to a theorem of Pimsner, we show that C(X)\rtimes_{\af}\Z can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra if and only if there is a strictly positive \af-invariant Borel probability measure.   Suppose that \Lambda is a \Z^d action on X. If C(X)\rtimes_{\Lambda}\Z can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra, then there must exist a strictly positive \Lambda-invariant Borel probability measure. We show that, if in addition, there is a generator \af_1 of \Lambda such that (X, \af_1) is minimal and unique ergodic, then C(X)\rtimes_{\Lambda}\Z^d can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra with a unique tracial state.   Let A be a unital separable amenable simple \CA with tracial rank zero and with a unique tracial state which satisfies the Universal Coefficient Theorem and let G be a finitely generated discrete abelian group. Suppose \Lambda: G\to Aut(A) is a \hm. Then A\rtimes_{\Lambda} G can always be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra.
