We present a construction, which assigns two groupoids, \Gugamma and \Gmgamma, to an inverse semigroup \Gamma. By definition, \Gmgamma is a subgroupoid (even a reduction) of \Gugamma.   The construction unifies known constructions for groupoids. More precisely, the groupoid \Gugamma is shown to be isomorphic to the universal groupoid of \Gamma introduced by Paterson. For \Gamma arising from graphs resp. tilings, the groupoid \Gmgamma is the graph groupoid introduced by Kumjian et al. resp. the tiling groupoid introduced by Kellendonk.   We obtain a characterisation of open invariant sets in \Gmgamma^{(0)} in terms of certain order ideals of \Gammanull for a large class of \Gamma (including those arising from graphs and from tilings). If \Gmgamma is essentially principal this gives a characterization of the ideal structure of \Cred(\Gmgamma) by a theory of Renault. In particular, we then obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on \Gamma for simplicity of \Cred(\Gmgamma).   Our approach relies on a detailed analysis of the order structure of \Gamma.
