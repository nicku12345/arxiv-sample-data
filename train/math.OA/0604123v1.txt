We introduce "embedding dimensions" of a family of generators of a finite von Neumann algebra when the von Neumann algebra can be faithfully embedded into the ultrapower of the hyperfinite II_1 factor. These embedding dimensions are von Neumann algebra invariants, i.e., do not depend on the choices of the generators. We also find values of these invariants for some specific von Neumann algebras.
