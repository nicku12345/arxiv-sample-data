We show the uniqueness of minimal actions of a compact Kac algebra with amenable dual on the AFD factor of type II_1. This particularly implies the uniqueness of minimal actions of a compact group. Our main tools are a Rohlin type theorem, the 2-cohomology vanishing theorem, and the Evans-Kishimoto type intertwining argument.
