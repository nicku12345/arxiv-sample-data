We construct numerous continuous families of irreducible subfactors of the hyperfinite II_1 factor, which are non-isomorphic, but have all the same standard invariant. In particular, we obtain 1-parameter families of irreducible, non-isomorphic subfactors of the hyperfinite II_1 factor, which have Jones index 6 and have all the same standard invariant with property (T). We exploit the fact that property (T) groups have uncountably many non-cocycle conjugate cocycle actions on the hyperfinite II_1 factor.
