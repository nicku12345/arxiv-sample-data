We propose a weaker condition for multiplicative unitary operators related to quantum groups, than the condition of manageability introduced by S.L. Woronowicz. We prove that all the main results of the theory of manageable multiplicative unitaries remain true under this weaker condition. We also show that multiplicative unitaries arising naturally in the construction of some recent examples of non-compact quantum groups satisfy our condition, but fail to be manageable.
