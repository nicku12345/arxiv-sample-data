We introduce a non commutative analog of the Bohr compactification. Starting from a general quantum group G we define a compact quantum group bG which has a universal property such as the universal property of the classical Bohr compactification for topological groups. We study the object bG in special cases when G is a classical locally compact group, dual of a classical group, discrete or compact quantum group as well a quantum group arising from a manageable multiplicative unitary. We also use our construction to give new examples of compact quantum groups.
