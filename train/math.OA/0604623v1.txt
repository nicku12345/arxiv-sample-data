We introduce the analog of Bohr compactification for discrete quantum groups on C*-algebra level. The cases of unimodular and general C*-algebraic discrete quantum groups are treated separately. The passage from the former case to the latter is done with help of the concept of canonical Kac quotient for compact quantum groups\footnotemark. Several examples are presented and passage to the Bohr compactification is investigated.
