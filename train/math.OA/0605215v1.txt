Product systems are the classifying structures for semigroups of endomorphisms of B(H), in that two E_0-semigroups are cocycle conjugate iff their product systems are isomorphic. Thus it is important to know that every abstract product system is associated with an E_0-semigrouop. This was first proved more than fifteen years ago by rather indirect methods. Recently, Skeide has given a more direct proof. In this note we give yet another proof by an elementary construction.
