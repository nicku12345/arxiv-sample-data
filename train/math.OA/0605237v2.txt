We develop a theory of holomorphic functions in several noncommuting (free) variables and thus provide a framework for the study of arbitrary n-tuples of operators. The main topics are the following: Free holomorphic functions and Hausdorff derivations; Cauchy, Liouville, and Schwartz type results for free holomorphic functions; Algebras of free holomorphic functions; Free analytic functional calculus and noncommutative Cauchy transforms; Weierstrass and Montel theorems for free holomorphic functions; Free pluriharmonic functions and noncommutative Poisson transforms; Hardy spaces of free holomorphic functions.
