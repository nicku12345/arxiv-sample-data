In the first part of the paper the natural scheme for proving noncommutative individual ergodic theorems for multiple sequences is described and applied to obtain results on unrestricted convergence of multiaverages. In the second part convergence of ergodic averages induced by several maps satisfying specific recurrence relations, including so-called Multi Free Group Partial Sums, is proved. This is the multiindexed version of results obtained earlier jointly with V.I.Chilin and S.Litvinov.
