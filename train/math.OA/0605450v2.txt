In this article, we consider tensor products of unitary representations by irreducible non-unitary finite dimensional representations of topological groups to define a property that is a twisting of Kazhdan's Property (T). We use the uniform decay of the matrix coefficients of unitary representations, to show that for most of the real semi-simple Lie groups having Kazhdan's Property (T), any finite dimensional irreducible representation \rho of G, is isolated among representations of the form \rho\otimes\pi, where \pi ranges over the irreducible unitary representations, in a sense to be made precise.
