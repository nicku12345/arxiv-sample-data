We study the microstate free entropy of projections, and establish its basic properties similar to the self-adjoint variable case. Our main contribution is to characterize the pair-block freeness of projections by the additivity of their free entropy (Theorem 4.1), in the proof of which a transportation cost inequality plays an important role. We also briefly discuss the free pressure in relation to the microstate free entropy of projections.
