To any action of a locally compact group G on a pair (A,B) of von Neumann algebras is canonically associated a pair (\pi\_A^{\alpha}, \pi\_B^{\alpha}) of unitary representations of G. The purpose of this paper is to provide results allowing to compare the norms of the operators \pi\_A^{\alpha}(\mu) and \pi\_B^{\alpha}(\mu) for bounded measures \mu on G. We have a twofold aim. First to point out that several known facts in ergodic and representation theory are indeed particular cases of general results about (\pi\_A^{\alpha}, \pi\_B^{\alpha}). Second, under amenability assumptions, to obtain transference of inequalities that will be useful in noncommutative ergodic theory.
