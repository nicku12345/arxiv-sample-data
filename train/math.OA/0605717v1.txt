For a class of *-algebras, where *-algebra A_{\Gamma,\tau} is generated by projections associated with vertices of graph \Gamma and depends on a parameter \tau (0 < \tau \leq 1), we study the sets \Sigma_\Gamma of values of \tau such that the algebras A_{\Gamma,\tau} have nontrivial *-representations, by using the theory of spectra of graphs. In other words, we study such values of \tau that the corresponding configurations of subspaces in a Hilbert space exist.
