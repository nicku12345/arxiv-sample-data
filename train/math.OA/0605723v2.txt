We prove an entropy formula for certain expansive actions of a countable discrete residually finite group \Gamma  by automorphisms of compact abelian groups in terms of Fuglede-Kadison determinants. This extends an earlier result proved by the first author under somewhat more restrictive conditions.   The main tools for this generalization are a representation of the \Gamma -action by means of a `fundamental homoclinic point', and the description of entropy in terms of the renormalized logarithmic growth-rate of the set of \Gamma_n-fixed points, where (\Gamma_n, n\ge1) is a decreasing sequence of finite index normal subgroups of \Gamma  with trivial intersection.
