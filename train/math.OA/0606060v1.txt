We find a description of the restriction of doubly stochastic maps to separable abelian C^*-subalgebras of a II_1 factor \cM. We use this local form of doubly stochastic maps to develop a notion of joint majorization between n-tuples of mutually commuting self-adjoint operators that extends those of Kamei (for single self-adjoint operators) and Hiai (for single normal operators) in the II_1 factor case. Several characterizations of this joint majorization are obtained. As a byproduct we prove that any separable abelian C^*-subalgebra of \cM can be embedded into a separable abelian C^*-subalgebra of \cM with diffuse spectral measure.
