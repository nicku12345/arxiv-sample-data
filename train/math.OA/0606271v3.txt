We prove that certain free products of factors of type {\rm I} and other von Neumann algebras with respect to nontracial, almost periodic states are almost periodic free Araki-Woods factors. In particular, they have the free absorption property and Connes' Sd invariant completely classifies these free products. For example, for \lambda, \mu \in ]0, 1[, we show that (M_2(\C), \omega_{\lambda}) \ast (M_2(\C), \omega_{\mu}) is isomorphic to the free Araki-Woods factor whose Sd invariant is the subgroup of \R^*_+ generated by \lambda and \mu. Our proofs are based on algebraic techniques and amalgamated free products. These results give some answers to questions of Dykema and Shlyakhtenko.
