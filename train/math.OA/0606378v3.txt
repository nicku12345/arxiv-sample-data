We show that a separable purely infinite C*-algebra is of real rank zero if and only if its primitive ideal space has a basis consisting of compact-open sets and the natural map K_0(I) -> K_0(I/J) is surjective for all closed two-sided ideals J contained in I in the C*-algebra. It follows in particular that if A is any separable C*-algebra, then A tensor O_2 is of real rank zero if and only if the primitive ideal space of A has a basis of compact-open sets, which again happens if and only if A tensor O_2 has the ideal property, also known as property (IP).
