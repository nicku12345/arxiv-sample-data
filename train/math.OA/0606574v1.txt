We consider II_1 factors of the form M=\bar{\bigotimes}_{G}N\rtimes G, where either i) N is a non-hyperfinite II_1 factor and G is an ICC amenable group or ii) N is a weakly rigid II_1 factor and G is ICC group and where G acts on \bar{\bigotimes}_{G}N by Bernoulli shifts. We prove that isomorphism of two such factors implies cocycle conjugacy of the corresponding Bernoulli shift actions. In particular, the groups acting are isomorphic. As a consequence, we can distinguish between certain classes of group von Neumann algebras associated to wreath product groups.
