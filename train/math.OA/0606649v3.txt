Let \M be a von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space \H, and \N be a singular von Neumann subalgebra of \M. If \N\tensor\B(\K) is singular in \M\tensor\B(\K) for any Hilbert space \K, we say \N is \emph{completely singular} in \M. We prove that if \N is a singular abelian von Neumann subalgebra or if \N is a singular subfactor of a type II_1 factor \M, then \N is completely singular in \M. For any type II_1 factor \M, we construct a singular von Neumann subalgebra \N of \M (\N\neq \M) such that \N\tensor\B(l^2(\mathbb{N})) is regular (hence not singular) in \M\tensor \B(l^2(\mathbb{N})). If \H is separable, then \N is completely singular in \M if and only if for any \theta\in Aut(\N') such that \theta(X)=X for all X\in\M', then \theta(Y)=Y for all Y\in\N'. As an application of this characterization of completely singularity, we prove that if \M is separable (with separable predual) and \N is completely singular in \M, then \N\tensor\L is completely singular in \M\tensor \L for any separable von Neumann algebra \L.
