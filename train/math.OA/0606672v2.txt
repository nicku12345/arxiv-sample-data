Let E be a W^{\ast}-correspondence over a von Neumann algebra M and let H^{\infty}(E) be the associated Hardy algebra. If \sigma is a faithful normal representation of M on a Hilbert space H, then one may form the dual correspondence E^{\sigma} and represent elements in H^{\infty}(E) as B(H)-valued functions on the unit ball \mathbb{D}(E^{\sigma})^{\ast}. The functions that one obtains are called Schur class functions and may be characterized in terms of certain Pick-like kernels. We study these functions and relate them to system matrices and transfer functions from systems theory. We use the information gained to describe the automorphism group of H^{\infty}(E) in terms of special M\"{o}bius transformations on \mathbb{D}(E^{\sigma}). Particular attention is devoted to the H^{\infty}% -algebras that are associated to graphs.
