In this article it is proved, that every locally compact second countable group has a left invariant metric d, which generates the topology on G, and which is proper, ie. every closed d-bounded set in G is compact. Moreover, we obtain the following extension of a result due to N. Brown and E. Guentner: Every locally compact second countable G admits a proper affine action on the reflexive and strictly convex Banach space \bigoplus^{\infty}_{n=1} L^{2n}(G, d\mu), where the direct sum is taken in the l^2-sense.
