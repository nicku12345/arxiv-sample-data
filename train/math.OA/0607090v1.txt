Let \phi be a positive unital normal map of a von Neumann algebra M into itself, and assume there is a family of normal \phi-invariant states which is faithful on the von Neumann algebra generated by the image of \phi. It is shown that there exists a largest Jordan subalgebra C_\phi of M such that the restriction of \phi to C_\phi is a Jordan automorphhism, and each weak limit point of (\phi^n (a)) for a\in M belongs to C_\phi.
