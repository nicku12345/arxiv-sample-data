We first observe that the relations of the canonical generating isometries of the Cuntz algebra {\cal O}_N are naturally related to the N-colored Catalan numbers. For a directed graph G, we generalize the Catalan numbers by using the canonical generating partial isometries of the Cuntz-Krieger algebra {\cal O}_{A^G} for the transition matrix A^G of G. The generalized Catalan numbers c_n^G, n=0,1,2,... enumerate the number of Dyck paths and oriented rooted trees for the graph G. Its generating functions will be studied.
