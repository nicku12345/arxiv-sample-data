Let A be an N \times N  irreducible matrix with entries in \{0,1\}. We define the topological Markov Dyck shift D_A to be a nonsofic subshift consisting of the 2N brackets (_1,...,(_N,)_1,...,)_N with both standard bracket rule and Markov chain rule coming from A. The subshift is regarded as a subshift defined by the canonical generators S_1^*,..., S_N^*, S_1,..., S_N  of the Cuntz-Krieger algebra {\Cal O}_A. We construct an irreducible \lambda-graph system {{\frak L}^{Ch(D_A)}} that presents the subshift D_A so that we have an associated simple purely infinite C^*-algebra {\Cal O}_{{\frak L}^{Ch(D_A)}}. We prove that {\Cal O}_{{\frak L}^{Ch(D_A)}} is a universal unique C^*-algebra subject to some operator relations among 2N generating partial isometries. Some examples are presented such that they are not stably isomorphic to any Cuntz-Krieger algebra.
