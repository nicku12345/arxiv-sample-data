Let F be the Fibonacci matrix  \bigl[\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 1 1 & 0 \\ \end{smallmatrix}\bigr] . The Fibonacci Dyck shift is a subshsystem of the Dyck shift D_2 constrained by the matrix F. Let {{\frak L}^{Ch(D_F)}} be a \lambda-graph system presenting the subshift D_F, that is called the Cantor horizon \lambda-graph system for D_F. We will study the C^*-algebra {\cal O}_{{\frak L}^{Ch(D_F)}} associated with  {{\frak L}^{Ch(D_F)}} . It is simple purely infinite and generated by four partial isometries with some operator relations. We will compute the K-theory of the C^*-algebra. As a result, the C^*-algebra is simple purely infinite and not semiprojective. Hence it is not stably isomorphic to any Cuntz-Krieger algebra.
