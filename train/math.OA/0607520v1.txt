The notions of symbolic matrix system and \lambda-graph system for a subshift are generalizations of symbolic matrix and \lambda-graph (= finite symbolic matrix) for a sofic shift respectively ([Doc. Math. 4(1999), 285-340]). M. Nasu introduced the notion of textile system for a pair of graph homomorphisms to study automorphisms and endomorphisms of topological Markov shifts ([Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 546,114(1995)]). In this paper, we formulate textile systems on \lambda-graph systems and study automorphisms on subshifts. We will prove that for a forward automorphism \phi of a subshift (\Lambda,\sigma), the automorphisms \phi^k \sigma^n, k\ge 0, n\ge 1 can be explicitly realized as a subshift defined by certain symbolic matrix systems coming from both the strong shift equivalence representing \phi and the subshift (\Lambda,\sigma). As an application of this result, if an automorphism \phi of a subshift \Lambda is a simple automorphism, the dynamical system (\Lambda, \phi \circ \sigma) is topologically conjugate to the subshift (\Lambda, \sigma).
