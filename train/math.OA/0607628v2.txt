Let X be a Hilbert bimodule over a C*-algebra A and O_X= A \rtimes_X \Z. Using a finite section method we construct a sequence of completely positive contractions factoring through matrix algebras over A which act on s_{\xi} s_{\eta}^* as Schur multipliers converging to the identity. This shows immediately that for a finitely generated X the algebra O_X inherits any standard approximation property such as nuclearity, exactness, CBAP or OAP from A. We generalise this to certain general Pimsner algebras by proving semi-splitness of the Toeplitz extension under certain conditions and discuss some examples.
