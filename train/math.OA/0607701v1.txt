Given an m-tempered strongly continuous action \alpha of \R by continuous ^{*}-automorphisms of a Frechet ^{*}-algebra A, it is shown that the enveloping \hbox{\sigma-C^{*}-algebra} E(S(\R,A^{\infty},\alpha)) of the smooth Schwartz crossed product S(\R,A^{\infty},\alpha) of the Frechet algebra A^{\infty} of C^{\infty}-elements of A is isomorphic to the \hbox{\sigma-C^{*}-crossed} product C^{*}(\R,E(A),\alpha) of the enveloping \sigma-C^{*}-algebra E(A) of A by the induced action. When A is a hermitian Q-algebra, one gets K-theory isomorphism RK_{*}(S(\R,A^{\infty},\alpha)) = K_{*}(C^{*}(\R,E(A),\alpha) for the representable K-theory of Frechet algebras. An application to the differential structure of a C^{*}-algebra defined by densely defined differential seminorms is given.
