Many Hilbert modules over the polynomial ring in m variables are essentially reductive, that is, have commutators which are compact. Arveson has raised the question of whether the closure of homogeneous ideals inherit this property and provided motivation to seek an affirmative answer. Positive results have been obtained by Arveson, Guo, Wang and the author. More recently, Guo and Wang extended the results to quasi-homogeneous ideals in two variables. Building on their techniques, in this note the author extends this result to Hilbert modules over certain Reinhardt domains such as ellipsoids in two variables and analyzes extending the result to the closure of quasi-homogeneous ideals in m variables when the zero variety has dimension one.
