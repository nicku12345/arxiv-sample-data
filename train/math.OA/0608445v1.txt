Let \zeta and \eta be distinct points on the unit circle and suppose that \phi is a linear-fractional self-map of the unit disk D, not an automorphism, with \phi(\zeta)=\eta. We describe the C*-algebra generated by the associated composition operator C_{\phi} and the shift operator, acting on the Hardy space on D.
