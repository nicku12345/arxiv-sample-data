For n\geq 3, let \Gamma=SL_n(\mathbb Z). We prove the following superridigity result for \Gamma in the context of operator algebras. Let L(\Gamma) be the von Neumann algebra generated by the left regular representation of \Gamma. Let M be a finite factor and let U(M) be its unitary group. Let \pi: \Gamma\to U(M) be a group homomorphism such that \pi(\Gamma)''=M. Then   \begin{itemize}   \item[(i)] either M is finite dimensional, or   \item [(ii)] there exists a subgroup of finite index \Lambda of \Gamma such that \pi|_\Lambda extends to a homomorphism U(L(\Lambda))\to U(M).   \end{itemize}   The result is deduced from a complete description of the tracial states on the full C^*--algebra of \Gamma.   As another application, we show that the full C^*--algebra of   \Gamma has no faithful tracial state.
