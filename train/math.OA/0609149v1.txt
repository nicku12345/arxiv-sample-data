We prove a covariant version of the KSGNS (Kasparov, Stinespring, Gel'fand,Naimark,Segal) construction for completely positive linear maps between locally C^{*}-algebras. As an application of this construction, we show that a covariant completely positive linear map \rho  from a locally C^{*}-algebra A to another locally C^{*} -algebra B with respect to a locally C^{*}-dynamical system (G,A,\alpha) extends to a completely positive linear map on the crossed product A\times_{\alpha ^{{}}}G.
