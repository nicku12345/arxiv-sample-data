In this article, we will give a characterization of Banach bimodules over C^*-algebras of compact operators that arises from operator spaces as well as a characterization of (F)-Banach bundles amongst all (H)-Banach bundles over a hyper-Stonian space. These two characterizations are concerned with whether certain natural map from a Banach bimodule to its canonical bidual is isometric (we call such bimodule \emph{regular}).
