In 1960 Puk\'anszky introduced an invariant associating to every masa in a separable \mathrm{II}_1 factor a non-empty subset of \mathbb N\cup\{\infty\}. This invariant examines the multiplicity structure of the von Neumann algebra generated by the left-right action of the masa. In this paper it is shown that every non-empty subset of \mathbb N\cup\{\infty\} arises as the Puk\'anszky invariant of some masa in a separable McDuff \mathrm{II}_1 factor which contains a masa with Puk\'anszky invariant \{1\}. In particular the hyperfinite \mathrm{II}_1 factor and all separable McDuff \mathrm{II}_1 factors with a Cartan masa satisfy this hypothesis. In a general separable McDuff factor we show that every subset of \mathbb N\cup\{\infty\} containing \infty is obtained as a Puk\'anskzy invariant of some masa.
