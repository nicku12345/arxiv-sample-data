We prove the little Grothendieck theorem for any 2-convex noncommutative symmetric space. Let \M be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal faithful semifinite trace \t, and let E be an r.i. space on (0, \8). Let E(\M) be the associated symmetric space of measurable operators. Then to any bounded linear map T from E(\M) into a Hilbert space \mathcal H corresponds a positive norm one functional f\in E_{(2)}(\M)^* such that \forall x\in E(\M)\quad \|T(x)\|^2\le K^2 \|T\|^2 f(x^*x+xx^*), where E_{(2)} denotes the 2-concavification of E and K is a universal constant. As a consequence we obtain the noncommutative Khintchine inequalities for E(\M) when E is either 2-concave or 2-convex and q-concave for some q<\8. We apply these results to the study of Schur multipliers from a 2-convex unitary ideal into a 2-concave one.
