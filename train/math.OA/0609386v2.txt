For a Hecke pair (G, H) and a finite-dimensional representation \sigma of H on V_\sigma with finite range we consider a generalised Hecke algebra \H_\sigma(G, H), which we study by embedding the given Hecke pair in a Schlichting completion (G_\sigma, H_\sigma) that comes equipped with a continuous extension \sigma of H_\sigma. There is a (non-full) projection p_\sigma\in C_c(G_\sigma, {\cc B}(V_\sigma)) such that \H_\sigma(G, H) is isomorphic to p_\sigma C_c(G_\sigma, {\cc B}(V_\sigma))p_\sigma. We study the structure and properties of C^*-completions of the generalised Hecke algebra arising from this corner realisation, and via Morita-Fell-Rieffel equivalence we identify, in some cases explicitly, the resulting proper ideals of C^*(G_\sigma, {\cc B}(V_\sigma)). By letting \sigma vary, we can compare these ideals. The main focus is on the case with \dim\sigma=1 and applications include ax+b-groups and the Heisenberg group.
