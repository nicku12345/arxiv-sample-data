We define an analytical index map and a topological index map for conical pseudomanifolds. These constructions generalize the analogous constructions used by Atiyah and Singer in the proof of their topological index theorem for a smooth, compact manifold M. A main ingredient is a non-commutative algebra that plays in our setting the role of C_0(T^*M). We prove a Thom isomorphism between non-commutative algebras which gives a new example of wrong way functoriality in K-theory. We then give a new proof of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem using deformation groupoids and show how it generalizes to conical pseudomanifolds. We thus prove a topological index theorem for conical pseudomanifolds.
