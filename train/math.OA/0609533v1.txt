Let X be compact Hausdorff, and \phi: X \to X a continuous surjection. Let \mathcal{A} be the semicrossed product algebra corresponding to the relation fU = Uf\circ \phi. Then the C^*-envelope of \mathcal{A} is the crossed product of a commutative C^*-algebra which contains C(X) as a subalgebra, with respect to a homeomorphism which we construct. We also show there are``sufficiently many'' nest representations.
