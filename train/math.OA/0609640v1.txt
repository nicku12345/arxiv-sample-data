We study conditional expectations generated by an abelian  C^* -subalgebra in the centralizer of a positive functional. We formulate and prove Jensen's inequality for functions of several variables with respect to this type of conditional expectations, and we obtain as a corollary Jensen's inequality for expectation values.
