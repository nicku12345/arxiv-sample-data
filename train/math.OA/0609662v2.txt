We first use properties of the Fuglede-Kadison determinant on L^p(M), for a finite von Neumann algebra M, to give several useful variants of the noncommutative Szeg\"{o} theorem for L^p(M), including the one usually attributed to Kolmogorov and Krein. As an application, we solve the longstanding open problem concerning the noncommutative generalization, to Arveson's noncommutative H^p spaces, of the famous `outer factorization' of functions f with \log |f| integrable. Using the Fuglede-Kadison determinant, we also generalize many other classical results concerning outer functions.
