Let v be the right regular representation of a compact quantum group G. Then (S.L.Woronowicz, "Compact quantum groups") v contains all irreducible representations of G and each irreducible representation enters v with the multiplicity equal to its dimension. The result is certainly known for classical compact groups. We give a short survey on the subject and provide a different proof of Woronowicz's result above. The proof is an adaptation of the corresponding result for classical compact groups and provides a concrete decomposition of the right regular representation in irreducible components.
