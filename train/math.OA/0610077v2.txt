Let \phi be a linear-fractional self map of the open unit disk, not an automorphism, such that \phi(\zeta)=\eta for distinct points \zeta,\eta in the unit circle. We consider the question of which composition operators lie in the unital C*-algebra generated by the composition operator C_{\phi} and the ideal of compact operators, acting on the Hardy space H^2.
