We argue that weak containment is an appropriate notion of amenability for inverse semigroups. Given an inverse semigroup S and a homomorphism \phi of S onto a group G, we show, under an assumption on \ker(\phi), that S has weak containment if and only if G is amenable and \ker(\phi) has weak containment. Using Fell bundle amenability, we find a related result for inverse semigroups with zero. We show that all graph inverse semigroups have weak containment and that Nica's inverse semigroup \mcT_{G,P} of a quasi-lattice ordered group (G,P) has weak containment if and only if (G,P) is amenable.
