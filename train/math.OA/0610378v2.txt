Given a separable unital C*algebra C, let E_n denote the Hilbert module equal to the completion of the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing smooth functions from R^n to C equipped with the C-valued inner product given by integration. Let B denote the space of all smooth functions with bounded derivatives from R^n to C. For each a in B, let O(a) denote the pseudodifferential operator of symbol a. O maps B to H, the set of all adjointable operators on E_n which have smooth orbit under the canonical action of the Heisenberg group. We construct a left inverse for O, S:H\to B, and prove that S is an inverse for O if C is commutative. The case when C is the complex numbers was proven by Cordes in 1979. As a consequence, we prove, for commutative separable unital C*algebras, a characterization of a certain class of pseudodifferential operators conjectured by Rieffel in 1993.
