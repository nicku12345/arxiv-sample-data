Bichon, De Rijdt and Vaes introduced the notion of monoidally equivalent compact quantum groups. In this paper we prove that there is a natural bijective correspondence between actions of monoidally equivalent quantum groups on unital C*-algebras or on von Neumann algebras. We apply this correspondence to study the behavior of Poisson and Martin boundaries under monoidal equivalence of quantum groups.
