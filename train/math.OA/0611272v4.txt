We compute spectra and Brown measures of some non self-adjoint operators in (M_2(\cc), {1/2}Tr)*(M_2(\cc), {1/2}Tr), the reduced free product von Neumann algebra of M_2(\cc) with M_2(\cc). Examples include AB and A+B, where A and B are matrices in (M_2(\cc), {1/2}Tr)*1 and 1*(M_2(\cc), {1/2}Tr), respectively. We prove that AB is an R-diagonal operator (in the sense of Nica and Speicher \cite{N-S1}) if and only if Tr(A)=Tr(B)=0. We show that if X=AB or X=A+B and A,B are not scalar matrices, then the Brown measure of X is not concentrated on a single point. By a theorem of Haagerup and Schultz \cite{H-S1}, we obtain that if X=AB or X=A+B and X\neq \lambda 1, then X has a nontrivial hyperinvariant subspace affiliated with (M_2(\cc), {1/2}Tr)*(M_2(\cc), {1/2}Tr).
