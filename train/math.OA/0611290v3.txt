Let \M be a finite von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space \H and \AA be a transitive algebra containing \M'. In this paper we prove that if \AA is 2-fold transitive, then \AA is strongly dense in \B(\H). This implies that if a transitive algebra containing a standard finite von Neumann algebra (in the sense of [Ha1]) is 2-fold transitive, then \AA is strongly dense in \B(\H). Non-selfadjoint algebras related to free products of finite von Neumann algebras, e.g., \L{\mathbb{F}_n} and (M_2(\cc), {1/2}Tr)*(M_2(\cc), {1/2}Tr), are studied. Brown measures of certain operators in (M_2(\cc), {1/2}Tr)*(M_2(\cc), {1/2}Tr) are explicitly computed.
