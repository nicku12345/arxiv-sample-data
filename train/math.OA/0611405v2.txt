Let X be a finite dimensional compact metrizable space. We study a technique which employs semiprojectivity as a tool to produce approximations of C(X)-algebras by C(X)-subalgebras with controlled complexity. The following applications are given. All unital separable continuous fields of C*-algebras over X with fibers isomorphic to a fixed Cuntz algebra \mathcal{O}_n, n\in\{2,3,...,\infty\} are locally trivial. They are trivial if n=2 or n=\infty. For n\geq 3 finite, such a field is trivial if and only if (n-1)[1_A]=0 in K_0(A), where A is the C*-algebra of continuous sections of the field.   We give a complete list of the Kirchberg algebras D satisfying the UCT and having finitely generated K-theory groups for which every unital separable continuous field over X with fibers isomorphic to D is automatically (locally) trivial.   In a more general context, we show that a separable unital continuous field over X with fibers isomorphic to a KK-semiprojective is trivial if and only if it satisfies a K-theoretical Fell type condition.
