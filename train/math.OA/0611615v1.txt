In 1965 Tauer produced a countably infinite family of semi-regular masas in the hyperfinite \mathrm{II}_1 factor, no pair of which are conjugate by an automorphism. This was achieved by iterating the process of passing to the algebra generated by the normalisers and, for each n\in\mathbb N, finding masas for which this procedure terminates at the n-th stage. Such masas are said to have length n. In this paper we consider a transfinite version of this idea, giving rise to a notion of ordinal valued length. We show that all countable ordinals arise as lengths of semi-regular masas in the hyperfinite \mathrm{II}_1 factor. Furthermore, building on work of Jones and Popa, we obtain all possible combinations of regular inclusions of irreducible subfactors in the normalising tower.
