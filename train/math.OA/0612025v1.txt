We define a stronger property than unique ergodicity with respect to the fixed-point subalgebra previously investigated by Abadie and Dykema. Such a property is denoted as F-strict weak mixing (F stands for the Markov projection onto the fixed-point operator system). Then we show that the free shifts on the reduced C*-algebras of RD-groups, including the free group on infinitely many generators, and amalgamated free product C*-algebras, considered by Abadie and Dykema, are all strictly weak mixing and not merely uniquely ergodic.
