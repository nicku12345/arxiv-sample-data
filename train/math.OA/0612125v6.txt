Let X be a finite CW complex and let h_1, h_2: C(X)\to A be two unital \hm s, where A is a unital C*-algebra. We study the problem when h_1 and h_2 are approximately homotopic. We present a K-theoretical necessary and sufficient condition for them to be approximately homotopic under the assumption that A is a unital separable simple C*-algebra of tracial rank zero, or A is a unital purely infinite simple C*-algebra. When they are approximately homotopic, we also give a bound for the length of the homotopy. Suppose that h: C(X)\to A is a monomorphism and u\in A is a unitary (with [u]=\{0\} in K_1(A)). We prove that, for any \ep>0, and any compact subset {\cal F}\subset C(X), there exists \dt>0 and a finite subset {\cal G}\subset C(X) satisfying the following: if \|[h(f), u]\|<\dt and \text{Bott}(h,u)=\{0\}, then there exists a continuous rectifiable path \{u_t: t\in [0,1]\} such that  \|[h(g),u_t]\|<\ep, \rforal g\in {\cal F},u_0=u\andeqn u_1=1_A.  Moreover,  \text{Length}(\{u_t\})\le 2\pi+\ep.  We show that if \text{dim}X\le 1, or A is purely infinite simple, then \dt and {\cal G} are universal (independent of A or h). In the case that {\rm dim} X=1, this provides an improvement of the so-called the Basic Homotopy Lemma of Bratteli, Elliott, Evans and Kishimoto for the case that A is mentioned above.   Moreover, we show that \dt and {\cal G} can not be universal whenever   \text{dim} X\ge 2. Nevertheless, we also found that \dt can be chosen to be dependent on a measure distribution but independent of A and h.
