We consider separable C^*-dynamical systems (A,G,\alpha) for which the induced action of the group G on the spectrum \hat A of the C^*-algebra A is free. We study how the representation theory of the associated crossed-product C^*-algebra A\rtimes_\alpha G depends on the representation theory of A and the properties of the action of G on \hat A. Our main tools involve computations of upper and lower bounds on multiplicity numbers associated to irreducible representations of A\rtimes_\alpha G. We apply our techniques to give necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of A and the action of G on \hat A, for A\rtimes_{\alpha}G to be (i) a continuous-trace C^*-algebra, (ii) a Fell C^*-algebra and (iii) a bounded-trace C^*-algebra. When G is amenable, we also give necessary and sufficient conditions for the crossed-product C^*-algebra A\rtimes_{\alpha}G to be (iv) a liminal C^*-algebra and (v) a Type I C^*-algebra. The results in (i), (iii)--(v) extend some earlier special cases in which A was assumed to have the corresponding property.
