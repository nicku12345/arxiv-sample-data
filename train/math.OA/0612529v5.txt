Let A be a unital AH-algebra and let \alpha\in Aut(A) be an automorphism. A necessary condition for A\rtimes_{\alpha}\Z being embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra is the existence of a faithful tracial state. If in addition, there is an automorphism \kappa with \kappa_{*1}=-{\rm id}_{K_1(A)} such that \alpha\circ \kappa and \kappa\circ \af are asymptotically unitarily equivalent, then A\rtimes_{\af}\Z can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra. Consequently, in the case that A is a unital AH-algebra (not necessarily simple) with torsion K_1(A), A\rtimes_{\alpha}\Z can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra if and only if A admits a faithful \alpha-invariant tracial state. We also show that if A is a unital A\T-algebra then A\rtimes_{\alpha}\Z can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra if and only if A admits a faithful \af-invariant tracial state.   If X is a compact metric space and \Lambda: \Z^2\to Aut(C(X)) is a \hm then C(X)\rtimes_{\Lambda}\Z^2 can be asymptotically embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra provided that X admits a strictly positive \Lambda-invariant probability measure. Consequently C(X)\rtimes_{\Lambda}\Z^2 is quasidiagonal if X admits a strictly positive \Lambda-invariant Borel probability measure.
