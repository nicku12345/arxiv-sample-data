Let K be any field, let L_n denote the Leavitt algebra of type (1,n-1) having coefficients in K, and let {\rm M}_d(L_n) denote the ring of d \times d matrices over L_n. In our main result, we show that {\rm M}_d(L_n) \cong L_n if and only if d and n-1 are coprime. We use this isomorphism to answer a question posed in \cite{PS} regarding isomorphisms between various C*-algebras. Furthermore, our result demonstrates that data about the K_0 structure is sufficient to distinguish up to isomorphism the algebras in an important class of purely infinite simple K-algebras.
