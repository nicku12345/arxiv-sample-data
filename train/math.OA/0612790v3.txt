We introduce two kinds of quasi-inner functions. Since every rationally invariant subspace for a shift operator S_K on a vector-valued Hardy space H^{2}(\Omega,K) is generated by a quasi-inner function, we also provide relationships of quasi-inner functions by comparing rationally invariant subspaces generated by them. Furthermore, we discuss fundamental properties of quasi-inner functions, and quasi-inner divisors.
