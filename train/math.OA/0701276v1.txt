The authors have recently shown how direct limits of Hilbert spaces can be used to construct multi-resolution analyses and wavelets in L^2(\R). Here they investigate similar constructions in the context of Hilbert modules over C^*-algebras. For modules over C(\T^n), the results shed light on work of Packer and Rieffel on projective multi-resolution analyses for specific Hilbert C(\T^n)-modules of functions on \R^n. There are also new applications to modules over C(C) when C is the infinite path space of a directed graph.
