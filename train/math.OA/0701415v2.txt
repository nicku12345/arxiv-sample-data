In the present paper we consider a von Neumann algebra M with a faithful normal semi-finite trace \t, and \{\alpha_ t\}  a strongly continuous extension to L^p(M,\t) of a semigroup of absolute contractions on L^1 (M,\tau). By means of a non-commutative Banach Principle we prove for a Besicovitch function b and x\in L^p(M,\t), the averages \frac{1}{T}\int_0^Tb(t)\a_t(x)dt converge bilateral almost uniform in L^p(M,\t) as T\to 0.
