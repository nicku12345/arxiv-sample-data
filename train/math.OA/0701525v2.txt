For a locally compact group G we look at the group algebras C_0(G) and C_r^*(G), and we let f\in C_0(G) act on L^2(G) by the multiplication operator M(f). We show among other things that the following properties are equivalent:   1. G has a compact open subgroup.   2. One of the C^*-algebras has a dense multiplier Hopf ^*-subalgebra (which turns out to be unique).   3. There are non-zero elements a\in C_r^*(G) and f\in C_0(G) such that aM(f) has finite rank.   4. There are non-zero elements a\in C_r^*(G) and f\in C_0(G) such that aM(f)=M(f)a.   If G is abelian, these properties are equivalent to:   5. There is a non-zero continuous function with the property that both f and \hat f have compact support.
