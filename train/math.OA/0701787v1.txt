We study solutions to the free stochastic differential equation dX_t = dS_t - \half DV(X_t)dt, where V is a locally convex polynomial potential in m non-commuting variables. We show that for self-adjoint V, the law \mu_V of a stationary solution is the limit law of a random matrix model, in which an m-tuple of self-adjoint matrices are chosen according to the law \exp(-N \textrm{Tr}(V(A_1,...,A_m)))dA_1... dA_m. We show that if V=V_\beta depends on complex parameters \beta_1,...,\beta_k, then the law \mu_V is analytic in \beta at least for those \beta for which V_\beta is locally convex. In particular, this gives information on the region of convergence of the generating function for planar maps.   We show that the solution dX_t has nice convergence properties with respect to the operator norm. This allows us to derive several properties of C^* and W^* algebras generated by an m-tuple with law \mu_V. Among them is lack of projections, exactness, the Haagerup property, and embeddability into the ultrapower of the hyperfinite II_1 factor. We show that the microstates free entropy \chi(\tau_V) is finite.   A corollary of these results is the fact that the support of the law of any self-adjoint polynomial in X_1,...,X_n under the law \mu_V is connected, vastly generalizing the case of a single random matrix.
