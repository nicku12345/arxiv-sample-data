The entangled ergodic theorem concerns the study of the convergence in the strong, or merely weak operator topology, of the multiple Cesaro mean \frac{1}{N^{k}}\sum_{n_{1},...,n_{k}=0}^{N-1} U^{n_{\a(1)}}A_{1}U^{n_{\a(2)}}... U^{n_{\a(2k-1)}}A_{2k-1}U^{n_{\a(2k)}} , where U is a unitary operator acting on the Hilbert space H, \a:\{1,..., m\}\mapsto\{1,..., k\} is a partition of the set made of m elements in k parts, and finally A_{1},...,A_{2k-1} are bounded operators acting on H. While reviewing recent results about the entangled ergodic theorem, we provide some natural applications to dynamical systems based on compact operators. Namely, let (\mathfrak A,\alpha) be a C^{*}--dynamical system, where \mathfrak A=K(H), and \alpha=ad(U) is an automorphism implemented by the unitary U. We show that \lim_{N\to+\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\alpha^{n}=E , pointwise in the weak topology of \K(H). Here, E is a conditional expectation projecting onto the C^{*}--subalgebra \bigg(\bigoplus_{z\in\sigma_{\mathop{\rm pp}}(U)} E_{z}B(H)E_{z}\bigg)\bigcap K(H) . If in addition U is weakly mixing with \Omega\in H the unique up to a phase, invariant vector under U and \omega=<\cdot \Omega,\Omega>, we have the following recurrence result. If A\in K(H) fulfils \omega(A)>0, and 0<m_{1}<m_{2}<...<m_{l} are natural numbers kept fixed, then there exists an N_{0} such that \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\omega(A\alpha^{nm_{1}}(A)\alpha^{nm_{2}}(A)... \alpha^{nm_{l}}(A))>0 for each N>N_{0}.
