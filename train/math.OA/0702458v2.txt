Let G be a locally compact group. Consider the C^*-algebra C_0(G) of continuous complex functions on G, tending to 0 at infinity. The product in G gives rise to a coproduct \Delta_G on the C^*-algebra C_0(G). A locally compact {\it quantum} group is a pair (A,\Delta) of a C^*-algebra A with a coproduct \Delta on A, satisfying certain conditions. The definition guarantees that the pair (C_0(G),\Delta_G) is a locally compact quantum group and that conversely, every locally compact quantum group (A,\Delta) is of this form when the underlying C^*-algebra A is abelian.   Assume now that G is a locally compact group with a compact open subgroup K. The algebra of complex functions on G of {\it polynomial type} is a dense multiplier Hopf ^*-algebra with positive integrals (i.e. an algebraic quantum group}. The characteristic function of K is a group-like projection in this algebraic quantum group.   In this paper, we study group-like projections in an arbitrary algebraic quantum group. We find several associated objects that generalize the classical objects associated to a compact open subgroup of a locally compact group.
