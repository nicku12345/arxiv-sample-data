The study of modules over a finite von Neumann algebra {\mathcal A} can be advanced by the use of torsion theories. In this work, some torsion theories for {\mathcal A} are presented, compared and studied. In particular, we prove that the torsion theory (\mathrm{{\bf T}},\mathrm{{\bf P}}) (in which a module is torsion if it is zero-dimensional) is equal to both Lambek and Goldie torsion theories for {\mathcal A}.   Using torsion theories, we describe the injective envelope of a finitely generated projective {\mathcal A}-module and the inverse of the isomorphism K_0({\mathcal A})\to K_0({\mathcal U}), where {\mathcal U} is the algebra of affiliated operators of {\mathcal A}. Then, the formula for computing the capacity of a finitely generated module is obtained. Lastly, we study the behavior of the torsion and torsion-free classes when passing from a subalgebra {\mathcal B} of a finite von Neumann algebra {\mathcal A} to {\mathcal A}. With these results, we prove that the capacity is invariant under the induction of a {\mathcal B}-module.
