If G is a locally compact groupoid with a Haar system \lambda, then a positive definite function p on G has a form p(x)=< L(x)\xi(d(x)),\xi(r(x))>, where L is a representation of G on a Hilbert bundle {\h}=(G^0,\{H_u\},\mu), \mu is a quasi invariant measure on G^0 and \xi\in L^{\infty}(G^0,{\h}). [10].   In this paper firt we prove that if \mu is a quasi invariant ergodic measure on G^0, then two corresponding representations of G and C_c(G) are irreducible in the same time. Then by using the theory of positive linear functionals on C^*(G) we show that when \mu is an ergodic quasi invariant measure on G^0, for a positive definite function p which is an extreme point of {\mP}^{\mu}_1(G) the corresponding representation L is irreducible and conversely, every irreducible representation L of G on a Hilbert bundle {\h}=(G^0,\{H_u\},\mu) and every section \xi\in {\h}(\mu) with norm one, define an extreme point of {\mP}^{\mu}_1(G).
