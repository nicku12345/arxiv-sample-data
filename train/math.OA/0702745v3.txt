Motivated by Voiculescu's liberation theory, we introduce the orbital free entropy \chi_orb for non-commutative self-adjoint random variables (also for "hyperfinite random multi-variables"). Besides its basic properties the relation of \chi_orb with the usual free entropy \chi is shown. Moreover, the dimension counterpart \delta_{0,orb} of \chi_orb is discussed, and we obtain the relation of \delta_{0,orb} with the original free entropy dimension \delta_0 with applications to \delta_0 itself.
