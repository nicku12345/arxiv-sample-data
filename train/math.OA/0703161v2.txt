For the q-deformation G_q, 0<q<1, of any simply connected simple compact Lie group G we construct an equivariant spectral triple which is an isospectral deformation of that defined by the Dirac operator D on G. Our quantum Dirac operator D_q is a unitary twist of D considered as an element of U(g)\otimes Cl(g). The commutator of D_q with a regular function on G_q consists of two parts. One is a twist of a classical commutator and so is automatically bounded. The second is expressed in terms of the commutator of the associator with an extension of D. We show that in the case of the Drinfeld associator the latter commutator is also bounded.
