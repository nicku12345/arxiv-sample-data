Given a von Neumann algebra M with a faithful normal semi-finite trace \tau, we consider the non commutative Arens algebra L^{\omega}(M, \tau)=\bigcap\limits_{p\geq1}L^{p}(M, \tau) and the related algebras L^{\omega}_2(M, \tau)=\bigcap\limits_{p\geq2}L^{p}(M, \tau) and M+L^{\omega}_2(M, \tau) which are proved to be complete metrizable locally convex *-algebras. The main purpose of the present paper is to prove that any derivation of the algebra M+L^{\omega}_2(M, \tau) is inner and all derivations of the algebras L^{\omega}(M,\tau) and L^{\omega}_2(M, \tau) are spatial and implemented by elements of M+L^{\omega}_2(M, \tau).
