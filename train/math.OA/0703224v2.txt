We introduce two kinds of operator-valued norms. One of them is an L(H)-valued norm. The other one is an L(C(K))-valued norm. We characterize the completeness with respect to a bounded L(H)-valued norm. Furthermore, for a given Banach space \textbf{B}, we provide an L(C(K))-valued norm on \textbf{B}. and we introduce an L(C(K))-valued norm on a Banach space satisfying special properties.
