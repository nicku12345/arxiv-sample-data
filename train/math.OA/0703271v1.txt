We continue the analysis in [3] of matrix convex functions of a fixed order defined in a real interval by differential methods as opposed to the characterization in terms of divided differences given by Kraus [5]. We amend and improve some points in the previously given presentation, and we give a number of simple but important consequences of matrix convexity of low orders.
