Let G be a locally compact Abelian group. Following Ruy Exel, we view Fell bundles over the Pontrjagin dual of G as continuous spectral decompositions of G-actions on C*-algebras. We classify such spectral decompositions using certain dense subspaces related to Marc Rieffel's theory of square-integrability. There is a unique continuous spectral decomposition if the group acts properly on the primitive ideal space of the C*-algebra. But there are also examples of group actions without or with several inequivalent spectral decompositions.
