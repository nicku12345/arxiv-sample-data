Let M be a type I von Neumann algebra with the center Z, a faithful normal semi-finite trace \tau. Let L(M, \tau) be the algebra of all \tau-measurable operators affiliated with M and let S_0(M, \tau) be the subalgebra in L(M, \tau) consisting of all operators x such that given any \epsilon>0 there is a projection p\in\mathcal{P}(M) with \tau(p^{\perp})<\infty, xp\in M and \|xp\|<\epsilon. We prove that any Z-linear derivation of S_0(M, \tau) is spatial and generated by an element from L(M, \tau).
