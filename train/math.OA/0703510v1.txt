We show that the quadratic matrix equation VW + \eta (W)W = I, for given V with positive real part and given analytic mapping \eta with some positivity preserving properties, has exactly one solution W with positive real part. We point out the relevance of this result in the context of operator-valued free probability theory and for the determination of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of band or block random matrices. We also address the problem of a numerical determination of the solution.
