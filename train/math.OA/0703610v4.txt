Let C be a unital AH-algebra and let A be a unital separable simple \CA with tracial rank zero. Suppose that \phi_1, \phi_2: C\to A are two unital monomorphisms. We show that there is a continuous path of unitaries \{u_t: t\in [0, \infty)\} of A such that  \lim_{t\to\infty}u_t^*\phi_1(a)u_t=\phi_2(a)\tforal a\in C  if and only if [\phi_1]=[\phi_2] in KK(C,A), \tau\circ \phi_1=\tau\circ \phi_2 for all \tau\in T(A) and the rotation map {\tilde\eta}_{\phi_1,\phi_2} associated with \phi_1 and \phi_2 is zero. In particular, an automorphism \af on a unital separable simple \CA A in {\cal N} with tracial rank zero is asymptotically inner if and only if  [\af]=[{\rm id}_A] \text{in} KK(A,A)  and the rotation map {\tilde\eta}_{\phi_1, \phi_2} is zero.   Let A be a unital AH-algebra (not necessarily simple) and let \af\in Aut(A) be an automorphism. As an application, we show that the associated crossed product A\rtimes_{\af}\Z can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra if and only if A admits a strictly positive \af-invariant tracial state.
