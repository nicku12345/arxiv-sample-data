We examine the notion of \alpha-strong singularity for subfactors of a \IIi factor, which is a metric quantity that relates the distance between a unitary in the factor and a subalgebra with the distance between that subalgebra and its unitary conjugate. Through planar algebra techniques, we demonstrate the existence of a finite index singular subfactor of the hyperfinite \IIi factor that cannot be strongly singular with \alpha=1, in contrast to the case for masas. Using work of Popa, Sinclair, and Smith, we show that there exists an absolute constant 0<c<1 such that all singular subfactors are c-strongly singular. Under the hypothesis of 2-transitivity, we prove that finite index subfactors are \alpha-strongly singular with a constant that tends to 1 as the Jones Index tends to infinity and infinite index subfactors are 1-strongly singular. Finally, we give a proof that proper finite index singular subfactors do not have the weak asymptotic homomorphism property relative to the containing factor.
