The structure of the automorphism group of a simple TAI algebra is studied. In particular, we show that \frac{\bar{\mrm{Inn}} (A)}{\bar{\mrm{Inn}}_{0} (A)} is isomorphic (as a topological group) to an inverse limit of discrete abelian groups for a unital, simple, AH algebra with bounded dimension growth. Consequently, \frac{\bar{\mrm{Inn}} (A)}{\bar{\mrm{Inn}}_{0} (A)} is totally disconnected.   Another consequence of our results is the following: Suppose A is the transformation group \cstar-algebra of a minimal Furstenberg transformation (\mbb{T}^{n}, h_{n}) with a unique h_{n}-invariant probability measure on \mbb{T}^{n}. Then the automorphism group of A is an extension of a simple topological group by the discrete group \mrm{Aut} (\totalk(A))_{+,1}.
