The theme of the paper is the question of existence and basic structure of transfer operators for endomorphisms of a unital C*-algebra. We establish a complete description of non-degenerate transfer operators, characterize complete transfer operators and clarify their role in crossed product constructions. Also, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of transfer operators for commutative systems, and discuss their form for endomorphisms of B(H) which is relevant to Kadison-Singer problem.
