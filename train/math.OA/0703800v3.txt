Starting from an arbitrary endomorphism \alpha of a unital C*-algebra A we construct a bigger C*-algebra B and extend \alpha onto B in such a way that the extended endomorphism \alpha has a unital kernel and a hereditary range, i.e. there exists a unique non-degenerate transfer operator for (B,\alpha), called the complete transfer operator. The pair (B,\alpha) is universal with respect to a suitable notion of a covariant representation and depends on a choice of an ideal in A. The construction enables a natural definition of the crossed product for arbitrary \alpha.
