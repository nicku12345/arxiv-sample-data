A quadrilateral of factors is an irreducible inclusion of factors N \subset M with intermediate subfactors P and Q such that P and Q generate M and the intersection of P and Q is N. We investigate the structure of a non-commuting quadrilateral of factors with all the elementary inclusions P\subset M, Q\subset M, N\subset P, and N\subset Q 2-supertransitive. In particular we classify such quadrilaterals with the indices of the elementary subfactors less than or equal to 4. We also compute the angles between P and Q for quadrilaterals coming from \alpha-induction and asymptotic inclusions.
