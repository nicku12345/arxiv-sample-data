To any complex Hadamard matrix H one associates a spin model commuting square, and therefore a hyperfinite subfactor. The standard invariant of this subfactor captures certain "group-like" symmetries of H. To gain some insight, we compute the first few relative commutants of such subfactors for Hadamard matrices of small dimensions. Also, we show that subfactors arising from Dita type matrices have intermediate subfactors, and thus their standard invariants have some extra structure besides the Jones projections.
