A classification is given of certain separable nuclear C*-algebras not necessarily of real rank zero, namely, the class of separable simple C*-algebras which are inductive limits of continuous-trace C*-algebras whose building blocks have spectrum homeomorphic to the closed interval [0,1], or to a disjoint union of copies of this space. Also, the range of the invariant is calculated.
