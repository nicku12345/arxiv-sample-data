If a finite group action \alpha on a unital C^*-algebra M is saturated, the canonical conditional expectation E:M\to M^\alpha onto the fixed point algebra is known to be of index finite type with Index(E)=|G| in the sense of Watatani. More generally if a finite dimensional Hopf *-algebra A acts on M and the action is saturated, the same is true with Index (E)=\dim(A). In this paper we prove that the converse is true. Especially in case M is a commutative C^*-algebra C(X) and \alpha is a finite group action, we give an equivalent condition in order that the expectation E:C(X)\to C(X)^\alpha is of index finite type, from which we obtain that \alpha is saturated if and only if G acts freely on X.   Actions by compact groups are also considered to show that the gauge action \gamma on a graph C^*-algebra C^*(E) associated with a locally finite directed graph E is saturated.
