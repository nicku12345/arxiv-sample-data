Given a conditionally completely positive map \mathcal L on a unital \ast-algebra \A, we find an interesting connection between the second Hochschild cohomology of \A with coefficients in the bimodule E_{\mathcal L}=\B^a(\A \oplus M) of adjointable maps, where M is the GNS bimodule of \mathcal L, and the possibility of constructing a quantum random walk (in the sense of \cite{AP,LP,L,KBS}) corresponding to \mathcal L.
