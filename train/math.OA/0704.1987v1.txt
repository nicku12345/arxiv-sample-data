Let (\clb,\lambda_t,\psi) be a C^*-dynamical system where (\lambda_t: t \in \IT_+) be a semigroup of injective endomorphism and \psi be an (\lambda_t) invariant state on the C^* subalgebra \clb and \IT_+ is either non-negative integers or real numbers. The central aim of this exposition is to find a useful criteria for the inductive limit state \clb \raro^{\lambda_t} \clb canonically associated with \psi to be pure. We achieve this by exploring the minimal weak forward and backward Markov processes associated with the Markov semigroup on the corner von-Neumann algebra of the support projection of the state \psi to prove that Kolmogorov's property [Mo2] of the Markov semigroup is a sufficient condition for the inductive state to be pure. As an application of this criteria we find a sufficient condition for a translation invariant factor state on a one dimensional quantum spin chain to be pure. This criteria in a sense complements criteria obtained in [BJKW,Mo2] as we could go beyond lattice symmetric states.
