In this paper we consider a semigroup of completely positive maps \tau=(\tau_t,t \ge 0) with a faithful normal invariant state \phi on a type-II_1 factor \cla_0 and propose an index theory. We :achieve this via a more general Kolmogorov's type of construction for stationary Markov processes which naturally associate a nested isomorphic von-Neumann algebras. In particular this construction generalizes well known Jones construction associated with a sub-factor of type-II_1 factor.
