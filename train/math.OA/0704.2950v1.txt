In this paper we obtain the weak type (1,1) boundedness of Calderon-Zygmund operators acting over operator-valued functions. Our main tools for its solution are a noncommutative form of Calderon-Zygmund decomposition in conjunction with a pseudo-localization principle for singular integrals, which is new even in the classical setting and of independent interest. Perhaps because of the hidden role of pseudo-localization and almost orthogonality, this problem has remained open for quite some time. We also consider Calderon-Zygmund operators associated to certain operator-valued kernels.
