In the context of Free Probability Theory, we study two different constructions that provide new examples of factors of type {\rm II_1} with prescribed fundamental group. First we investigate state-preserving group actions on the almost periodic free Araki-Woods factors satisfying both a condition of mixing and a condition of free malleability in the sense of Popa. Typical examples are given by the free Bogoliubov shifts. Take an ICC w-rigid group G such that \mathcal{F}(L(G)) = \{1\} (e.g. G = \Z^2 \rtimes \SL(2, \Z)). For any countable subgroup S \subset \R^*_+, we show that there exists an action of G on L(\F_\infty) such that L(\F_\infty) \rtimes G is a type {\rm II_1} factor and its fundamental group is S. The second construction is based on a free product. Take (B(H), \psi) any factor of type {\rm I} endowed with a faithful normal state and denote by \Gamma \subset \R^*_+ the subgroup generated by the point spectrum of \psi. We show that the centralizer (L(G) \ast B(H))^{\tau \ast \psi} is a type {\rm II_1} factor and its fundamental group is \Gamma. Our proofs rely on Popa's deformation/rigidity strategy using his intertwining-by-bimodules technique.
