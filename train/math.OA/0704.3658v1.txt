Bosons and fermions are often written by elements of other algebras. M. Abe gave a recursive realization of the boson by formal infinite sums of the canonical generators of the Cuntz algebra {\cal O}_{\infty}. We show that such formal infinite sum always makes sense on a certain dense subspace of any permutative representation of {\cal O}_{\infty}. In this meaning, we can regard as if the algebra {\cal B} of bosons was a unital *-subalgebra of {\cal O}_{\infty} on a given permutative representation by keeping their unboundedness. By this relation, we compute branching laws arising from restrictions of representations of {\cal O}_{\infty} on {\cal B}. For example, it is shown that the Fock representation of {\cal B} is given as the restriction of the standard representation of {\cal O}_{\infty} on {\cal B}.
