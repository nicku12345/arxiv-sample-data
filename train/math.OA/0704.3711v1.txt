A new C*-enlargement of a C*-algebra A nested between the local multiplier algebra M_{\text{loc}}(A) of A and its injective envelope I(A) is introduced. Various aspects of this maximal C*-algebra of quotients, Q_{\text{max}}(A), are studied, notably in the setting of AW*-algebras. As a by-product we obtain a new example of a type I C*-algebra A such that M_{\text{loc}}(M_{\text{loc}}(A))\ne M_{\text{loc}}(A).
