The article discusses the interrelation between relative Cuntz-Pimsner algebras and partial isometric crossed products, and presents a procedure that reduces any given Hilbert bimodule to the "smallest" Hilbert bimodule yielding the same relative Cuntz-Pimsner algebra as the initial one. In the context of crossed products this reduction procedure corresponds to reduction of C*-dynamical systems.
