We consider normalizers of an irreducible inclusion N\subseteq M of \mathrm{II}_1 factors. In the infinite index setting an inclusion uNu^*\subseteq N can be strict, forcing us to also investigate the semigroup of one-sided normalizers. We relate these normalizers of N in M to projections in the basic construction and show that every trace one projection in the relative commutant N'\cap < M,e_N> is of the form u^*e_Nu for some unitary u\in M with uNu^*\subseteq N. This enables us to identify the normalizers and the algebras they generate in several situations. In particular each normalizer of a tensor product of irreducible subfactors is a tensor product of normalizers modulo a unitary. We also examine normalizers of irreducible subfactors arising from subgroup--group inclusions H\subseteq G. Here the normalizers are the normalizing group elements modulo a unitary from L(H). We are also able to identify the finite trace L(H)-bimodules in \ell^2(G) as double cosets which are also finite unions of left cosets.
