It is shown that all important features of a \mathrm{C}^*-algebraic quantum group (A,\Delta) defined by a modular multiplicative W depend only on the pair (A,\Delta) rather than the multiplicative unitary operator W. The proof is based on thorough study of representations of quantum groups. As an application we present a construction and study properties of the universal dual of a quantum group defined by a modular multiplicative unitary - without assuming existence of Haar weights.
