An analysis is given of *-representations of rank 2 single vertex graphs. We develop dilation theory for the non-selfadjoint algebras \A_\theta and \A_u which are associated with the commutation relation permutation \theta of a 2 graph and, more generally, with commutation relations determined by a unitary matrix u in M_m(\bC) \otimes M_n(\bC). We show that a defect free row contractive representation has a unique minimal dilation to a *-representation and we provide a new simpler proof of Solel's row isometric dilation of two u-commuting row contractions. Furthermore it is shown that the C*-envelope of \A_u is the generalised Cuntz algebra \O_{X_u} for the product system X_u of u; that for m\geq 2  and n \geq 2  contractive representations of \Ath need not be completely contractive; and that the universal tensor algebra \T_+(X_u) need not be isometrically isomorphic to \A_u.
