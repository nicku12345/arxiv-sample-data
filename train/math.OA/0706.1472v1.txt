In his thesis ([L1]), which is published in an expended and revised version ([L2]), Franck Lesieur had introduced a notion of measured quantum groupoid, in the setting of von Neumann algebras, using intensively the notion of pseudo-multiplicative unitary, which had been introduced in a previous article of the author, in collaboration with Jean-Michel Vallin [EV]. In [L2], the axioms given are very complicated and are here simplified.
