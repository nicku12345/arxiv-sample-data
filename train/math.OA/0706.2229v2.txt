Let X be a compact metric space and let \Lambda be a \Z^k (k\ge 1) action on X. We give a solution to a version of Voiculescu's problem of AF-embedding: The crossed product C(X)\rtimes_{\Lambda}\Z^k can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra if and only if X admits a strictly positive \Lambda-invariant Borel probability measure.   Let C be a unital AH-algebra, let G be a finitely generated abelian group and let \Lambda: G\to Aut(C) be a monomorphism. We show that C\rtimes_{\Lambda} G can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra if and only if C admits a faithful \Lambda-invariant tracial state.
