Anderson's paving conjectures are known to be equivalent to the Kadison-Singer problem. We prove some new equivalences of Anderson's conjectures that require the paving of smaller sets of matrices. We prove that if the strictly upper triangular operatorss are pavable, then every 0 diagonal operator is pavable. This result follows from a new paving condition for positive operators. In addition, we prove that if the upper triangular Toeplitz operators are paveable, then all Toeplitz operators are paveable.
