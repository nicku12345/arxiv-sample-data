In this paper we propose a new technical tool for analyzing representations of Hilbert C^*-product systems. Using this tool, we give a new proof that every doubly commuting representation over \mathbb{N}^k has a regular isometric dilation, and we also prove sufficient conditions for the existence of a regular isometric dilation of representations over more general subsemigroups of \mathbb{R}_+^k.
