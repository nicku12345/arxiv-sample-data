In this paper we consider the following problem: When are the preduals of two hyperfinite (=injective) factors \M and \N (on separable Hilbert spaces) cb-isomorphic (i.e., isomorphic as operator spaces)? We show that if \M is semifinite and \N is type III, then their preduals are not cb-isomorphic. Moreover, we construct a one-parameter family of hyperfinite type III_0-factors with mutually non cb-isomorphic preduals, and we give a characterization of those hyperfinite factors \M whose preduals are cb-isomorphic to the predual of the unique hyperfinite type III_1-factor. In contrast, Christensen and Sinclair proved in 1989 that all infinite dimensional hyperfinite factors with separable preduals are cb-isomorphic. More recently Rosenthal, Sukochev and the first-named author proved that all hyperfinite type III_\lambda-factors, where 0< \lambda\leq 1, have cb-isomorphic preduals.
