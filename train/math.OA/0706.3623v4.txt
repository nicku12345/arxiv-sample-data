We prove that the normalizer of any diffuse amenable subalgebra of a free group factor L(\Bbb F_r) generates an amenable von Neumann subalgebra. Moreover, any II_1 factor of the form Q \vt L(\Bbb F_r) , with Q an arbitrary subfactor of a tensor product of free group factors, has no Cartan subalgebras. We also prove that if a free ergodic measure preserving action of a free group \Bbb F_r, 2\leq r \leq \infty, on a probability space (X,\mu) is profinite then the group measure space factor L^\infty(X)\rtimes \Bbb F_r has unique Cartan subalgebra, up to unitary conjugacy.
