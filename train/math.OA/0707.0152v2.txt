The little Grothendieck theorem for Banach spaces says that every bounded linear operator between C(K) and \ell_2 is 2-summing. However, it is shown in \cite{J05} that the operator space analogue fails. Not every cb-map v : \K \to OH is completely 2-summing. In this paper, we show an operator space analogue of Maurey's theorem : Every cb-map v : \K \to OH is (q,cb)-summing for any q>2 and hence admits a factorization \|v(x)\| \leq c(q) \|v\|_{cb} \|axb\|_q with a,b in the unit ball of the Schatten class S_{2q}.
