We prove some noncommutative analogues of a theorem by Plotkin and Rudin about isometries between subspaces of Lp-spaces. Let 0<p<\infty, p not an even integer. The main result of this paper states that in the category of unital subspaces of noncommutative probability Lp-spaces, under some boundedness condition, the unital completely isometric maps come from *-isomorphisms of the underlying von Neumann algebras.   Some applications are given, including to non commutative H^p spaces.
