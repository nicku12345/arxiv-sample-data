Given a quasi-special endomorphism \rho of a C*-algebra A with nontrivial center, we study an extension problem for automorphisms of A to a minimal cross-product B of A by \rho. Exploiting some aspects of the underlying generalized Doplicher-Roberts duality theory based on Pimsner algebras, an obstruction to the existence of such extensions is found and described in terms of sections of a suitable group bundle.
