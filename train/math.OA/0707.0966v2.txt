We study indecomposable representations of quivers on separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces by bounded operators. We consider a complement of Gabriel's theorem for these representations. Let \Gamma be a finite, connected quiver. If its underlying undirected graph contains one of extended Dynkin diagrams \tilde{A_n} (n \geq 0), \tilde{D_n} (n \geq 4), \tilde{E_6},\tilde{E_7} and \tilde{E_8}, then there exists an indecomposable representation of \Gamma on separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
