Higher-rank graph generalisations of the Popescu-Poisson transform are constructed, allowing us to develop a dilation theory for higher rank operator tuples. These dilations are joint dilations of the families of operators satisfying relations encoded by the graph structure which we call \Lambda-contractions or \Lambda-coisometries. Besides commutant lifting results and characterisations of pure states on higher rank graph algebras several applications to the structure theory of non-selfadjoint graph operator algebras are presented generalising recent results in special cases.
