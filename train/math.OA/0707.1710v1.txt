For A a C^*-algebra, E_1, E_2 two Hilbert bimodules over A, and a fixed isomorphism \chi : E_1\otimes_AE_2\to E_2\otimes_AE_1, we consider the problem of computing the K-theory of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra {\mathcal O}_{E_2\otimes_A{\mathcal O}_{E_1}} obtained by extending the scalars and by iterating the Pimsner construction.   The motivating examples are a commutative diagram of Douglas and Howe for the Toeplitz operators on the quarter plane, and the Toeplitz extensions associated by Pimsner and Voiculescu to compute the K-theory of a crossed product. The applications are for Hilbert bimodules arising from rank two graphs and from commuting endomorphisms of abelian C^*-algebras.
