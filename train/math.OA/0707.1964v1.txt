In this paper, we study the weighted compositon operators on weighted Bergman spaces of bounded symmetric domains. The necessary and sufficient conditions for a weighted composition operator W_{\phi,\psi} to be bounded and compact are studied by using the Carleson measure techniques. In the last section, we study the Schatten p-class weighted composition operators.
