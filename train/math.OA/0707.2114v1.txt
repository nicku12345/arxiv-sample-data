We will prove that one-sided topological Markov shifts (X_A,\sigma_A) and (X_B,\sigma_B) for matrices A and B with entries in \{0,1\} are topologically orbit equivalent if and only if there exists an isomorphism between the Cuntz-Krieger algebras {\Cal O}_A and {\Cal O}_B keeping their commutative C^*-subalgerbas C(X_A) and C(X_B). It is also equivalent to the condition that there exists a homeomorphism from X_A to X_B intertwining their topological full groups. We will also study structure of the automorphisms of {\Cal O}_A keeping the commutative C^*-algebra C(X_A).
