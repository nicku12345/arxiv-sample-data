Equality of the second order arithmetic means of two principal ideals does not imply equality of their first order arithmetic means (second order equality cancellation). We provide fairly broad sufficient conditions on one of the principal ideals for this implication to hold true. We present also sufficient conditions for second order inclusion cancellations. These conditions are formulated in terms of the growth properties of the ratio of regularity sequence associated to the sequence of s-number of a generator of the principal ideal. These results are then extended to general ideals.
