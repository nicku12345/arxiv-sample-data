We study the universal C^*-algebras generated by n projections p_1, >..., p_n subject to the relation p_1+... p_n = \lambda 1, \lambda \in \mathbb R. The questions of when these C^*-algebras are type I, nuclear or exact are considered. It is proved also that among these algebras there is continuum of mutually nonisomorphic ones.
