The work of Dykema, Figiel, Weiss, and Wodzicki on the structure of commutators showed that arithmetic means play an important role in the study of operator ideals, and we explored their role in a multipaper project which we survey in this article. We start by presenting the notions of arithmetic mean ideals and arithmetic mean at infinity ideals. Then we explore their connections with commutator spaces, traces, elementary operators, lattice and sublattice structure of ideals, arithmetic mean ideal cancellation properties of first and second order, and softness properties - a term that we introduced but a notion ubiquitous in the literature on operator ideals. Arithmetic mean closure of ideals leads us to investigate majorization for infinite sequences and this in turn leads us to an infinite Schur-Horn majorization theorem which extends theorems by A. Neumann, by Arveson and Kadison, and by Antezana, Massey, Ruiz and Stojanoff. We also list ten open questions that we encountered in the development of this material.
