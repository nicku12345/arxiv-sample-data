We provide an exposition and proof of Renault's equivalence theorem for crossed products by locally Hausdorff, locally compact groupoids. Our approach stresses the bundle approach, concrete imprimitivity bimodules and is a preamble to a detailed treatment of the Brauer semigroup for a locally Hausdorff, locally compact groupoid.
