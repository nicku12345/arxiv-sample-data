We review the recent construction of semifinite spectral triples for graph C^*-algebras. These examples have inspired many other developments and we review some of these such as the relation between the semifinite index and the Kasparov product, examples of noncommutative manifolds, and an index theorem in twisted cyclic theory using a KMS state.
