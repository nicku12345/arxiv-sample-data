Let \M be a semi-finite factor and let \J(\M) be the set of operators T in \M such that T=ETE for some finite projection E. In this paper we obtain a representation theorem for unitarily invariant norms on \J(\M) in terms of Ky Fan norms. As an application, we prove that the class of unitarily invariant norms on \J(\M) coincides with the class of symmetric gauge norms on a classical abelian algebra, which generalizes von Neumann's classical result \cite{vN} on unitarily invariant norms on M_n(\cc). As another application, Ky Fan's dominance theorem \cite{Fan} is obtained for semi-finite factors. Some classical results in non-commutative L^p-theory (e.g., non-commutative H\ddot{\text{o}}lder's inequality, duality and reflexivity of non-commutative L^p-spaces) are extended to general unitarily invariant norms related to semi-finite factors. We also prove that up to a scale the operator norm is the unique unitarily invariant norm associated to a type {\rm III} factor.
