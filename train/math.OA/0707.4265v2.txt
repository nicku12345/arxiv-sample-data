The aim of this paper is to show that various known characterizations of traces on classical pseudodifferentials operators (PsiDOs) can actually be obtained by very elementary considerations on PsiDOs, using only basic properties of these operators. Thereby, we give a unified treatment of the determinations of the space of traces (i) on PsiDOs of noninteger orders or of regular parity-class, (ii) on integer order PsiDOs, (iii) on nonpositive order PsiDOs in dimension greather than or equal to 2, and (iv) on nonpositive order PsiDOs in dimension 1.
