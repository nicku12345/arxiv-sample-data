We show that every sum system is divisible. Combined with B. V. R. Bhat and R. Srinivasan's result, this shows that every product system arising from a sum system (and every generalized CCR flow) is either of type I or type III. A necessarily and sufficient condition for such a product system to be of type I is obtained.
