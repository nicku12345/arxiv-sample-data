An operator T acting on a Hilbert space is called (\alpha ,\beta)-normal (0\leq \alpha \leq 1\leq \beta ) if \begin{equation*} \alpha ^{2}T^{\ast }T\leq TT^{\ast}\leq \beta ^{2}T^{\ast}T. \end{equation*} In this paper we establish various inequalities between the operator norm and its numerical radius of (\alpha ,\beta)-normal operators in Hilbert spaces. For this purpose, we employ some classical inequalities for vectors in inner product spaces.
