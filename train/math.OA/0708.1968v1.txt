For each sequence \{c_n\}_n in l_{1}(\N) we define an operator A in the hyperfinite \mathrm{II}_1-factor \mathcal{R}. We prove that these operators are quasinilpotent and they generate the whole hyperfinite \mathrm{II}_1-factor. We show that they have non-trivial, closed, invariant subspaces affiliated to the von Neumann algebra and we provide enough evidence to suggest that these operators are interesting for the hyperinvariant subspace problem. We also present some of their properties. In particular, we show that the real and imaginary part of A are equally distributed, and we find a combinatorial formula as well as an analytical way to compute their moments. We present a combinatorial way of computing the moments of A^{*}A.
