Let A be a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. The left and the right integrals on A are related by means of a distinguished group-like element \delta of A. Similarly, there is this element \hat\delta in the dual Hopf algebra \hat A. Radford showed that S^4(a)=\delta^{-1}(\hat\delta\triangleright a \triangleleft \hat\delta^{-1})\delta for all a in A where S is the antipode of A and where \triangleright and \triangleleft are used to denote the standard left and right actions of \hat A on A. The formula still holds for multiplier Hopf algebras with integrals (algebraic quantum groups).   In the theory of locally compact quantum groups, an analytical form of Radford's formula can be proven (in terms of bounded operators on a Hilbert space).   In this talk, we do not have the intention to discuss Radford's formula as such, but rather to use it, together with related formulas, for illustrating various aspects of the road that takes us from the theory of Hopf algebras (including compact quantum groups) to multiplier Hopf algebras (including discrete quantum groups) and further to the more general theory of locally compact quantum groups.
