This paper addresses extensions of the complex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup to operator algebras in free probability theory. If a_1,...,a_k are \ast-free \mathscr{R}-diagonal operators in a \mathrm{II}_1 factor, then D_t(a_{i_1}... a_{i_n}) = e^{-nt} a_{i_1}... a_{i_n} defines a dilation semigroup on the non-self-adjoint operator algebra generated by a_1,...,a_k. We show that D_t extends (in two different ways) to a semigroup of completely positive maps on the von Neumann algebra generated by a_1,...,a_k. Moreover, we show that D_t satisfies an optimal ultracontractive property: \|D_t\colon L^2\to L^\infty\| \sim t^{-1} for small t>0.
