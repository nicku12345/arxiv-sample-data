To a graph \Gamma one can associate a C^*-algebra C^*(\Gamma) generated by isometries. Such C^*-algebras were studied recently by Crisp and Laca. They are a special case of the Toeplitz C^*-algebras \mathcal{T}(G, P) associated to quasi-latice ordered groups (G, P) introduced by Nica. Crisp and Laca proved that the so called "boundary quotients" C^*_q(\Gamma) of C^*(\Gamma) are simple and purely infinite. For a certain class of finite graphs \Gamma we show that C^*_q(\Gamma) can be represented as a full corner of a crossed product of an appropriate C^*-subalgebra of C^*_q(\Gamma) built by using C^*(\Gamma'), where \Gamma' is a subgraph of \Gamma with one less vertex, by the group \mathbb{Z}. Using induction on the number of the vertices of \Gamma we show that C^*_q(\Gamma) are nuclear and belong to the small bootstrap class. This also enables us to use the Pimsner-Voiculescu exact sequence to find their K-theory. Finally we use the Kirchberg-Phillips classification theorem to show that those C^*-algebras are isomorphic to tensor products of \mathcal{O}_n for 1 \leq n \leq \infty.
