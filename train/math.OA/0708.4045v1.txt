When a unital \ca A has topological stable rank one (write \tsr(A) = 1), we know that \tsr(pAp) \leq 1 for a non-zero projection p \in A. When, however, \tsr(A) \geq 2, it is generally faluse. We prove that if a unital C*-algebra A has a simple unital C*-subalgebra D of A with common unit such that D has \PSP and \sup_{p\in P(D)}\tsr(pAp) < \infty, then \tsr(A) \leq 2. As an application let A be a simple unital \ca with \tsr(A) = 1 and \PSP, \{G_k\}_{k=1}^n finite groups, \af_k actions from G_k to {\rm Aut}((...((A\times_{\af_1}G_1)\times_{\af_2} G_2)...)\times_{\af_{k-1}}G_{k-1}). (G_0 = \{1\}) Then  \tsr((... ((A\times_{\af_1}G_1)\times_{\af_2} G_2)...)\times_{\af_n}G_n) \leq 2.
