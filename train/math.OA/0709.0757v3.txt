We consider a variant of the notion of Morita equivalence appropriate to weak* closed algebras of Hilbert space operators, which we call {\em weak Morita equivalence}. We obtain new variants, appropriate to the dual algebra setting, of the basic theory of strong Morita equivalence, and new nonselfadjoint variants of aspects of Rieffel's W^*-algebraic Morita equivalence.
