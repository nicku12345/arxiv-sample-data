A \lambda-graph system {\frak L} is a generalization of a finite labeled graph and presents a subshift. We will prove that the topological dynamical systems (X_{{\frak L}_1},\sigma_{{\frak L}_1}) and (X_{{\frak L}_2},\sigma_{{\frak L}_2}) for \lambda-graph systems {\frak L}_1 and {\frak L}_2 are continuously orbit equivalent if and only if there exists an isomorphism between the associated C^*-algebras {\Cal O}_{{\frak L}_1} and {\Cal O}_{{\frak L}_2} keeping their commutative C^*-subalgebras C(X_{{\frak L}_1}) and C(X_{{\frak L}_2}). It is also equivalent to the condition that there exists a homeomorphism from X_{{\frak L}_1} to X_{{\frak L}_2} intertwining their topological full inverse semigroups. In particular, one-sided subshifts X_{\Lambda_1} and X_{\Lambda_2} are \lambda-continuously orbit equivalent if and only if there exists an isomorphism between the associated C^*-algebras {\Cal O}_{\Lambda_1} and {\Cal O}_{\Lambda_2} keeping their commutative C^*-subalgebras C(X_{\Lambda_1}) and C(X_{\Lambda_2}).
