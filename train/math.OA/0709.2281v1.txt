Inspired by the work of Paterson on C^{\ast}-algebras of directed graphs, we show how to associate a groupoid \mathfrak{G}_{\mathcal{G}} to an ultragraph \mathcal{G} in such a way that the C^*-algebra of \mathfrak{G}_{\mathcal{G}} is canonically isomorphic to Tomforde's C^*-algebra C^*(\mathcal{G}). The groupoid \mathfrak{G}_{\mathcal{G}} is built from an inverse semigroup S_{\mathcal{G}} naturally associated to \mathcal{G}.
