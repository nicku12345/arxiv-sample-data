If R and M are Hilbert modules (in the sense of R. G. Douglas and V. I. Paulsen), we study the relationship between invertible module maps X:R\to{M} and X_{z}:R/R_{z}\to{M/M_{z}}. In particular, for quasi-free Hilbert modules R and M, we provide a condition of a module map X:R\to{M}, such that if X_{z}:R/R_{z}\to{M/M_{z}} is invertible for every z in a domain \Omega in the complex plane, then X is also invertible.
