We introduce C^*-pseudo-multiplicative unitaries and (concrete) Hopf C^*-bimodules, which are C^*-algebraic variants of the pseudo-multiplicative unitaries on Hilbert spaces and the Hopf-von Neumann-bimodules studied by Enock, Lesieur, Vallin. Moreover, we associate to every regular C^*-pseudo-multiplicative unitary two Hopf-C^*-bimodules and discuss examples related to locally compact groupoids.
