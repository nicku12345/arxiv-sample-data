A finite von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M} with a faithful normal trace % \tau  has Haagerup's approximation property (relative to a von Neumann subalgebra \mathcal{N}) if there exists a net (\phi_{\alpha})_{\alpha\in \Lambda} of normal completely positive (\mathcal{N}-bimodular) maps from \mathcal{M} to \mathcal{M} that satisfy the subtracial condition % \tau \circ \phi_{\alpha}\leq \tau , the extension operators % T_{\phi_{\alpha}} are bounded compact operators (in <\mathcal{M%},e_{\mathcal{N}}>), and pointwise approximate the identity in the trace-norm, i.e., \lim_{\alpha}||\phi_{\alpha}(x)-x||_{2}=0 for all % x\in \mathcal{M}. We prove that the subtraciality condition can be removed, and provide a description of Haagerup's approximation property in terms of Connes's theory of correspondences. We show that if \mathcal{N}\subseteq \mathcal{M} is an amenable inclusion of finite von Neumann algebras and % \mathcal{N} has Haagerup's approximation property, then \mathcal{M} also has Haagerup's approximation property. This work answers two questions of Sorin Popa.
