In the present paper we develop both ideas of D. Baki\'c and B. Gulja{\v{s}} and the categorical approach to multipliers from E.C. Lance's book and publications of the second author, for the introduction and study of left multipliers of Hilbert C^*-modules. Some properties and, in particular, the property of maximality among all strictly essential extensions of a Hilbert C^*-module for left multipliers are proved. Also relations between left essential and left strictly essential extensions in different contexts are obtained. Left essential and left strictly essential extensions of matrix algebras are considered. In the final paragraph the topological approach to the left multiplier theory of Hilbert C^*-modules is worked out.
