We show that for a class of operator algebras satisfying a natural condition the C^*-envelope of the universal free product of operator algebras A_i is given by the free product of the C^*-envelopes of the A_i. We apply this theorem to, in special cases, the C^*-envelope of the semicrossed products for multivariable dynamics in terms of the single variable semicrossed products of Peters.
