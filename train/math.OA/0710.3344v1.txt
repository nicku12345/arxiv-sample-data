Given a type I von Neumann algebra M with a faithful normal semi-finite trace \tau, let L(M, \tau) be the algebra of all \tau-measurable operators affiliated with M. We give a complete description of all derivations on the algebra L(M, \tau). In particular, we prove that if M is of type I_\infty then every derivation on L(M, \tau) is inner.
