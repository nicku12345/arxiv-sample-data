Suppose that G is a groupoid acting on a small category H in the sense of \cite[Definition 4]{NOT} and H\times_\alpha G is the resulting semi-direct product category (as in \cite[Proposition 8]{NOT}). We show that there exists a subcategory H_r \subseteq H satisfying some nice property called ``regularity'' such that H_r \times_\alpha G = H\times_\alpha G. Moreover, we show that there exists a so-called ``quasi action'' (see Definition \ref{quasi}) \beta of G on C^*(H_r) (where C^*(H_r) is the semigroupoid C^*-algebra as defined in \cite{EXE}) such that C^*(H_r\times_\alpha G) = C^*(H_r)\times_\beta G (where the crossed product for \beta is as defined in Definition \ref{cross}).
