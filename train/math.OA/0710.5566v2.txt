The main result of this paper is the extension of the Schur-Horn Theorem to infinite sequences: For two nonincreasing nonsummable sequences x and y that converge to 0, there exists a compact operator A with eigenvalue list y and diagonal sequence x if and only if y majorizes x (\sum_{j=1}^n x_j \le \sum_{j=1}^n y_j for all n) if and only if x = Qy for some orthostochastic matrix Q. The similar result requiring equality of the infinite series in the case that the sequences x and y are summable is an extension of a recent theorem by Arveson and Kadison. Our proof depends on the construction and analysis of an infinite product of T-transform matrices. Further results on majorization for infinite sequences providing "intermediate" sequences generalize known results from the finite case. Majorization properties and invariance under various classes of stochastic matrices are then used to characterize arithmetic mean closed operator ideals.
