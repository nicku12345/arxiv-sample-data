Inspired by the recent work of Bekka, we study two reasonable analogues of property (T) for not necessarily unital C*-algebras. The stronger one of the two is called ``property (T)'' and the weaker one is called ``property (T_{e})''. It is shown that all non-unital C*-algebras do not have property (T) (neither do their unitalizations). Moreover, all non-unital \sigma-unital C*-algebras do not have property (T_e).
