Finite quantum groupoids can be described in many equivalent ways: In terms of the weak Hopf C*-algebras of B\"ohm, Nill, and Szlach\'anyi or the finite-dimensional Hopf-von Neumann bimodules of Vallin, and in terms of finite-dimensional multiplicative partial isometries or the finite-dimensional pseudo-multiplicative unitaries of Vallin.   In this short note, we show that in finite dimensions, the notions of a Hopf-von Neumann bimodule and of a pseudo-multiplicative unitary coincide with the notions of a concrete Hopf-C*-bimodule and of a C*-pseudo-multiplicative unitary, respectively.
