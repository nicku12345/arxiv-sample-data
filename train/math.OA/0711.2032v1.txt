We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation on the unit disk with the additional restriction that all analytic interpolating functions satisfy f'(0)=0. Alternatively, these results can be interpreted as interpolation results for H^{\infty}(V), where V is the intersection of the bidisk with an algebraic variety. We use an analysis of C*-envelopes to show that these same conditions do not suffice for matrix interpolation.
