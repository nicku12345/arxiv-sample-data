Let H be a separable Hilbert space. Given two strongly commuting CP_0-semigroups \phi and \theta on B(H), there is a Hilbert space K containing H and two (strongly) commuting E_0-semigroups \alpha and \beta such that \phi_s \circ \theta_t (P_H A P_H) = P_H \alpha_s \circ \beta_t (A) P_H for all s,t and all A in B(K).   In this note we prove that if \phi is not an automorphism semigroup then \alpha is cocycle conjugate to the minimal *-endomorphic dilation of \phi, and that if \phi is an automorphism semigroup then \alpha is also an automorphism semigroup. In particular, we conclude that if \phi is not an automorphism semigroup and has a bounded generator (in particular, if H is finite dimensional) then \alpha is a type I E_0-semigroup.
