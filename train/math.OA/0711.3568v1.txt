An overview about C*-algebra bundles with a Z-grading is presented, with particular emphasis on classification questions. In particular, we discuss the role of the representable KK(X ; -, -)-bifunctor introduced by Kasparov. As an application, we consider Cuntz-Pimsner algebras associated with vector bundles, and give a classification in terms of K-theoretical invariants in the case in which the base space is an n-sphere.
