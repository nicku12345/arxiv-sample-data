It is shown that a separable C*-algebra is inner quasidiagonal if and only if it has a separating family of quasidiagonal irreducible representations. As a consequence, a separable C*-algebra is a strong NF algebra if and only if it is nuclear and has a separating family of quasidiagonal irreducible representations. We also obtain some permanence properties of the class of inner quasidiagonal C*-algebras.
