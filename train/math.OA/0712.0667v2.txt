For an ergodic measure preserving action on a probability space, consider the corresponding crossed product von Neumann algebra. We calculate the Fuglede-Kadison determinant for a class of operators in this von Neumann algebra in terms of the Ljapunov exponents of an associated measurable cocycle. The proof is based on recent work of Dykema and Schultz. As an application one obtains formulas for the Fuglede-Kadison determinant of noncommutative polynomials in the von Neumann algebra of the discrete Heisenberg group. These had been previously obtained by Lind and Schmidt via entropy considerations.
