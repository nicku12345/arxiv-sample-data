Let \mathcal A\subseteq \mat be a unital *-subalgebra of the algebra \mat of all n\times n complex matrices and let B be an hermitian matrix. Let \U_n(B) denote the unitary orbit of B in \mat and let \mathcal E_\mathcal A denote the trace preserving conditional expectation onto \mathcal A. We give an spectral characterization of the set  \mathcal E_\mathcal A(\U_n(B))=\{\mathcal E_\mathcal A(U^* B U): U\in \mat,\ \text{unitary matrix}\}. We obtain a similar result for the contractive orbit of a positive semi-definite matrix B. We then use these results to extend the notions of majorization and submajorization between self-adjoint matrices to spectral relations that come together with extended (non-commutative) Schur-Horn type theorems.
