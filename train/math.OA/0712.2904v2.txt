Using a family of graded algebra structures on a planar algebra and a family of traces coming from random matrix theory, we obtain a tower of non-commutative probability spaces, naturally associated to a given planar algebra. The associated von Neumann algebras are II_{1} factors whose inclusions realize the given planar algebra as a system of higher relative commutants. We thus give an alternative proof to a result of Popa that every planar algebra can be realized by a subfactor.
