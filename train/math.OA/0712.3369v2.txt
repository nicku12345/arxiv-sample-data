This paper is an adaptation of a chapter from an upcoming monograph on noncommutative geometry and quantum groups. We present examples of non compact quantum groups which are deformations of low dimensional Lie groups. The paper is of expository nature and provides both particular examples and some general procedures for constructing them.
