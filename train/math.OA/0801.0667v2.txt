Let \Gamma be the fundamental group of a finite connected graph \mathcal G. Let \mathfrak M be an abelian group. A {\it distribution} on the boundary \partial\Delta of the universal covering tree \Delta is an \mathfrak M-valued measure defined on clopen sets. If \mathfrak M has no \chi(\mathcal G)-torsion then the group of \Gamma-invariant distributions on \partial\Delta is isomorphic to H_1(\mathcal G,\mathfrak M).
