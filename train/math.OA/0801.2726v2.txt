Let A_1, ... A_n be operators acting on a separable complex Hilbert space such that \sum_{i=1}^n A_i=0. It is shown that if A_1, ... A_n belong to a Schatten p-class, for some p>0, then 2^{p/2}n^{p-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \|A_i\|^p_p \leq \sum_{i,j=1}^n\|A_i\pm A_j\|^p_p for 0<p\leq 2, and the reverse inequality holds for 2\leq p<\infty. Moreover, \sum_{i,j=1}^n\|A_i\pm A_j\|^2_p \leq 2n^{2/p} \sum_{i=1}^n \|A_i\|^2_p for 0<p\leq 2, and the reverse inequality holds for 2\leq p<\infty. These inequalities are related to a characterization of inner product spaces due to E.R. Lorch.
