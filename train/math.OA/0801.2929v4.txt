Let C be a unital AH-algebra and let A be a unital separable simple C*-algebra with tracial rank no more than one. Suppose that \phi, \psi: C\to A are two unital monomorphisms. With some restriction on C, we show that \phi and \psi are approximately unitarily equivalent if and only if   [\phi]=[\psi] in KL(C,A)   \tau\circ \phi=\tau\circ \psi for all tracial states of A and   \phi^{\ddag}=\psi^{\ddag}, here \phi^{\ddag} and \psi^{\ddag} are homomorphisms from U(C)/CU(C)\to U(A)/CU(A) induced by \phi and \psi, respectively, and where CU(C) and CU(A) are closures of the subgroup generated by commutators of the unitary groups of C and B.
