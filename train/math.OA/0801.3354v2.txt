In this paper, we introduce a C^{\ast}-algebra associated with a proper primitive substitution. We show that the C^{\ast}-algebra is simple and purely infinite and contains the associated Cuntz-Krieger algebra and the crossed product C^{\ast}-algebra of the corresponding Cantor minimal system. We calculate the K-groups.
