This paper is devoted to the study of Poincar\'e duality in K-theory for general stratified pseudomanifolds. We review the axiomatic definition of a smooth stratification \fS of a topological space X and we define a groupoid T^{\fS}X, called the \fS-tangent space. This groupoid is made of different pieces encoding the tangent spaces of the strata, and these pieces are glued into the smooth noncommutative groupoid T^{\fS}X using the familiar procedure introduced by A. Connes for the tangent groupoid of a manifold. The main result is that C^{*}(T^{\fS}X) is Poincar\'e dual to C(X), in other words, the \fS-tangent space plays the role in K-theory of a tangent space for X.
