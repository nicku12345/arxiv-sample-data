We consider the L_p norm estimates for homogeneous polynomials of q-gaussian variables (-1\leq q\leq 1). When -1<q<1 the L_p estimates for 1\leq p \leq 2 are essentially the same as the free case (q=0), whilst the L_p estimates for 2\leq p \leq \infty show a strong q-dependence. Moreover, the extremal cases q = \pm 1 produce decisively different formulae.
