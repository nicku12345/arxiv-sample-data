Let C be a unital AH-algebra and A be a unital simple C*-algebra with tracial rank zero. It has been shown that two unital monomorphisms \phi, \psi: C\to A are approximately unitarily equivalent if and only if  [\phi]=[\psi] {\rm in} KL(C,A) and \tau\circ \phi=\tau\circ \psi \tforal \tau\in T(A),  where T(A) is the tracial state space of A. In this paper we prove the following: Given \kappa\in KL(C,A) with \kappa(K_0(C)_+\setminus \{0\})\subset K_0(A)_+\setminus \{0\} and with \kappa([1_C])=[1_A] and a continuous affine map \lambda: T(A)\to T_{\mathtt{f}}(C) which is compatible with \kappa, where T_{\mathtt{f}}(C) is the convex set of all faithful tracial states, there exists a unital monomorphism \phi: C\to A such that  [\phi]=\kappa\andeqn \tau\circ \phi(c)=\lambda(\tau)(c)  for all c\in C_{s.a.} and \tau\in T(A). Denote by {\rm Mon}_{au}^e(C,A) the set of approximate unitary equivalence classes of unital monomorphisms. We provide a bijective map  \Lambda: {\rm Mon}_{au}^e (C,A)\to KLT(C,A)^{++},  where KLT(C,A)^{++} is the set of compatible pairs of elements in KL(C,A)^{++} and continuous affine maps from T(A) to T_{\mathtt{f}}(C). Moreover, we realized that there are compact metric spaces X, unital simple AF-algebras A and \kappa\in KL(C(X), A) with \kappa(K_0(C(X))_+\setminus\{0\})\subset K_0(A)_+\setminus \{0\} for which there is no \hm h: C(X)\to A so that [h]=\kappa.
