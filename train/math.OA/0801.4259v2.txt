We consider cones in a Hilbert space associated to two von Neumann algebras and determine when one algebra is included in the other. If a cone is assocated to a von Neumann algebra, the Jordan structure is naturally recovered from it and we can characterize projections of the given von Neumann algebra with the structure in some special situations.
