Let {\sf CK}_{*} denote the C^{*}-algebra defined by the direct sum of all Cuntz-Krieger algebras. We introduce a comultiplication \Delta_{\phi} and a counit \epsilon on {\sf CK}_{*} such that \Delta_{\phi} is a nondegenerate *-homomorphism from {\sf CK}_{*} to {\sf CK}_{*}\otimes {\sf CK}_{*} and \epsilon is a *-homomorphism from {\sf CK}_{*} to {\bf C}. From this, {\sf CK}_{*} is a counital non-commutative non-cocommutative C^{*}-bialgebra. Furthermore, C^{*}-bialgebra automorphisms, a tensor product of representations and C^{*}-subbialgebras of {\sf CK}_{*} are investigated.
