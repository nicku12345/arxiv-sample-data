In the paper, we introduce a new concept of topological orbit dimension of n-tuples of elements in a unital C^* algebra. Using this concept, we conclude that the Voiculescu's topological free entropy dimension of any family of self-adjoint generators of a nuclear C^* algebra is less than or equal to 1. We also show that the topological free entropy dimension is additive in the full free products of unital C^* algebras. In the appendix, we show that unital full free product of Blackadar and Kirchberg's unital MF algebras is also MF algebra.
