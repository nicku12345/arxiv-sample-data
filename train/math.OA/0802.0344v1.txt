We introduce the notions of approximate innerness and central triviality for endomorphisms on separable von Neumann factors, and we characterize them for hyperfinite factors by Connes-Takesaki modules of endomorphisms and modular endomorphisms which are introduced by Izumi. Our result is a generalization of the corresponding result obtained by Kawahigashi-Sutherland-Takesaki in automorphism case.
