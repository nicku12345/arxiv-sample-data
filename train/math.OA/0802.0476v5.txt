Motivated by a question of Vincent Lafforgue, we study the Banach spaces X satisfying the following property: there is a function \vp\to \Delta_X(\vp) tending to zero with \vp>0 such that every operator T\colon L_2\to L_2 with \|T\|\le \vp that is simultaneously contractive (i.e. of norm \le 1) on L_1 and on L_\infty must be of norm \le \Delta_X(\vp) on L_2(X).   We show that \Delta_X(\vp)\in O(\vp^\alpha) for some \alpha>0 iff X is isomorphic to a quotient of a subspace of an ultraproduct of \theta-Hilbertian spaces for some  \theta>0 (see Corollary \ref{comcor4.3}), where \theta-Hilbertian is meant in a slightly more general sense than in our previous paper \cite{P1}. Let B_{r}(L_2(\mu)) be the space of all regular operators on L_2(\mu). We are able to describe the complex interpolation space \[ (B_{r}(L_2(\mu), B(L_2(\mu))^\theta. \] We show that T\colon L_2(\mu)\to L_2(\mu) belongs to this space iff T\otimes id_X is bounded on L_2(X) for any \theta-Hilbertian space X.   More generally, we are able to describe the spaces  (B(\ell_{p_0}), B(\ell_{p_1}))^\theta {\rm or} (B(L_{p_0}), B(L_{p_1}))^\theta  for any pair 1\le p_0,p_1\le \infty and 0<\theta<1. In the same vein, given a locally compact Abelian group G, let M(G) (resp. PM(G)) be the space of complex measures (resp. pseudo-measures) on G equipped with the usual norm \|\mu\|_{M(G)} = |\mu|(G) (resp. \[ \|\mu\|_{PM(G)} = \sup\{|\hat\mu(\gamma)|   \big| \gamma\in\hat G\}). \] We describe similarly the interpolation space (M(G), PM(G))^\theta. Various extensions and variants of this result will be given, e.g. to Schur multipliers on B(\ell_2) and to operator spaces.
