Let A and C be two unital simple C*-algebas with tracial rank zero. Suppose that C is amenable and satisfies the Universal Coefficient Theorem. Denote by {{KK}}_e(C,A)^{++} the set of those \kappa for which \kappa(K_0(C)_+\setminus\{0\})\subset K_0(A)_+\setminus\{0\} and \kappa([1_C])=[1_A]. Suppose that \kappa\in {KK}_e(C,A)^{++}.   We show that there is a unital monomorphism \phi: C\to A such that [\phi]=\kappa. Suppose that C is a unital AH-algebra and \lambda: \mathrm{T}(A)\to \mathrm{T}_{\mathtt{f}}(C) is a continuous affine map for which \tau(\kappa([p]))=\lambda(\tau)(p) for all projections p in all matrix algebras of C and any \tau\in \mathrm{T}(A), where \mathrm{T}(A) is the simplex of tracial states of A and \mathrm{T}_{\mathtt{f}}(C) is the convex set of faithful tracial states of C. We prove that there is a unital monomorphism \phi: C\to A such that \phi induces both \kappa and \lambda.   Suppose that h: C\to A is a unital monomorphism and \gamma \in \mathrm{Hom}(\Kone(C), \aff(A)). We show that there exists a unital monomorphism \phi: C\to A such that [\phi]=[h] in {KK}(C,A), \tau\circ \phi=\tau\circ h for all tracial states \tau and the associated rotation map can be given by \gamma. Applications to classification of simple C*-algebras are also given.
