We introduce mollifiers in Clifford analysis setting and construct a sequence of \C^{\infinity}-functions that approximate a \gamma-regular function and a solution to a non homogeneous BVP of an in homogeneous Dirac like operator in certain Sobolev spaces over bounded domains whose boundary is not that wild. One can extend the smooth functions upto the boundary if the domain has a \C^1-boundary and this is the case in the paper as we consider a domain whose boundary is a \C^2-hyper surface.
