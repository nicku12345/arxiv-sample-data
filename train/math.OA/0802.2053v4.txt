We define, for a locally compact quantum group G in the sense of Kustermans--Vaes, the space of LUC(G) of left uniformly continuous elements in L^\infty(G). This definition covers both the usual left uniformly continuous functions on a locally compact group and Granirer's uniformly continuous functionals on the Fourier algebra. We show that LUC(G) is an operator system containing the C^*-algebra C_0(G) and contained in its multiplier algebra M(C_0(G)). We use this to partially answer an open problem by Bedos--Tuset: if G is co-amenable, then the existence of a left invariant mean on M(C_0(G)) is sufficient for G to be amenable. Furthermore, we study the space WAP(G) of weakly almost periodic elements of L^\infty(G): it is a closed operator system in L^\infty(G) containing C_0(G) and--for co-amenable G--contained in LUC(G). Finally, we show that--under certain conditions, which are always satisfied if G is a group--the operator system LUC(G) is a C^*-algebra.
