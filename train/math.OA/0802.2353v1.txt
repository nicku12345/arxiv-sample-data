Let \Gamma be a countable group and denote by \Cal S the equivalence relation induced by the Bernoulli action \Gamma\curvearrowright [0,1]^{\Gamma}, where [0,1]^{\Gamma} is endowed with the product Lebesgue measure. We prove that for any subequivalence relation \Cal R of \Cal S, there exists a partition \{X_i\}_{i\geq 0} of [0,1]^{\Gamma} with \Cal R-invariant measurable sets such that \Cal R_{|X_0} is hyperfinite and \Cal R_{|X_i} is strongly ergodic (hence ergodic), for every i\geq 1.
