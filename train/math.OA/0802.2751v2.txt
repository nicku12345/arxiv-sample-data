In this paper, we determine the isomorphic classes of Morita equivalent subalgebras of irrational rotation algebras. It is based on the solution of the quadratic Diophantine equations. We determine the irrational rotation algebras that have locally trivial inclusions. We compute the index of the locally trivial inclusions of irrational rotation algebras.
