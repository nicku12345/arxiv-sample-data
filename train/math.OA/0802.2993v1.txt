We call a unital locally convex algebra A a continuous inverse algebra if its unit group A^\times is open and inversion is a continuous map. For any smooth action of a, possibly infinite-dimensional, connected Lie group G on a continuous inverse algebra A by automorphisms and any finitely generated projective right A-module E, we construct a Lie group extension \hat G of G by the group \GL_A(E) of automorphisms of the A-module E. This Lie group extension is a ``non-commutative'' version of the group \Aut(\V) of automorphism of a vector bundle over a compact manifold M, which arises for G = \Diff(M), A = C^\infty(M,\C) and E = \Gamma\V. We also identify the Lie algebra \hat\g of \hat G and explain how it is related to connections of the A-module E.
