A non-commutative extension of Amar and Lederer's peak set result is given. As its simple applications it is shown that any non-commutative H^\infty-algebra H^\infty(M,\tau) has unique predual,and moreover some restriction in some of the results of Blecher and Labuschagne are removed, making them hold in full generality.
