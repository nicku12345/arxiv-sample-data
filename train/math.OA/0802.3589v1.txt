In this note we investigate the operators associated with frame sequences in a Hilbert space H, i.e., the synthesis operator T:\ell ^{2}(\mathbb{N}) \to H, the analysis operator T^{\ast}:H\to  % \ell ^{2}(\mathbb{N})  and the associated frame operator S=TT^{\ast} as operators defined on (or to) the whole space rather than on subspaces. Furthermore, the projection P onto the range of T, the projection Q onto the range of T^{\ast} and the Gram matrix G=T^{\ast}T are investigated. For all these operators, we investigate their pseudoinverses, how they interact with each other, as well as possible classification of frame sequences with them. For a tight frame sequence, we show that some of these operators are connected in a simple way.
