Different (fibrewise) amalgamated products of continuous C*-bundles have been studied over the last years, one of the main question being to know when these amalgamated products are continuous C*-bundles. In order to gather these approaches in a joint framework, we first recall a few definitions from the theory of deformations of C*-algebras and we fix several notations that will be used in the sequel. Then we characterise the continuity properties of different amalgamated products of (continuous) C(X)-algebras.
