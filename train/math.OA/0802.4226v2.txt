Let \{T_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty} be a family of *--free identically distributed operators in a finite von Neumann algebra. In this work we prove a multiplicative version of the free central limit Theorem. More precisely, let B_{n}=T_{1}^{*}T_{2}^{*}... T_{n}^{*}T_{n}... T_{2}T_{1} then B_{n} is a positive operator and B_{n}^{1/2n} converges in distribution to an operator \Lambda. We completely determine the probability distribution \nu of \Lambda from the distribution \mu of |T|^{2}. This gives us a natural map \mathcal{G}:\mathcal{M_{+}}\to \mathcal{M_{+}} with \mu\mapsto \mathcal{G}(\mu)=\nu. We study how this map behaves with respect to additive and multiplicative free convolution. As an interesting consequence of our results, we illustrate the relation between the probability distribution \nu and the distribution of the Lyapunov exponents for the sequence \{T_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty} introduced in \cite{LyaV}.
