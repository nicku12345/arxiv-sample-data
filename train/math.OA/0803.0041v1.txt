We introduce the notions of L(H)-valued norms and Banach spaces with respect to L(H)-valued norms. In particular, we introduce Hilbert spaces with respect to L(H)-valued inner products. In addition, we provide several fundamental examples of Hilbert spaces with respect to L(H)-valued inner products.
