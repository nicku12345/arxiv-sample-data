The classical Hausdorff-Young inequality for locally compact abelian groups states that, for 1\le p\le 2, the L^p-norm of a function dominates the L^q-norm of its Fourier transform, where 1/p+1/q=1. By using the theory of non-commutative L^p-spaces and by reinterpreting the Fourier transform, R. Kunze (1958) [resp. M. Terp (1980)] extended this inequality to unimodular [resp. non-unimodular] groups. The analysis of the L^p-spaces of the von Neumann algebra of a measured groupoid provides a further extension of the Hausdorff-Young inequality to measured groupoids.
