In the present paper we obtain an intrinsic characterization of real locally C*-algebras (projective limits of projective families of real C*-algebras) among complete real lmc *-algebras, and of locally JB-algebras (projective limits of projective families of JB-algebras) among complete fine Jordan locally multiplicatively-convex topological algebras.
