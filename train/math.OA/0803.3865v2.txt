We describe the structure of the irreducible representations of crossed products of unital C*-algebras by actions of finite groups in terms of irreducible representations of the C*-algebras on which the groups act. We then apply this description to derive a characterization of irreducible representations of crossed-products by finite cyclic groups in terms of representations of the C*-algebra and its fixed point subalgebra. These results are applied to crossed-products by the permutation group on three elements and illustrated by various examples.
