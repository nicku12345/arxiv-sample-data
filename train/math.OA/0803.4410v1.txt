We study some factorisation and dilation properties of completely positive maps on noncommutative L^p-spaces. We show that Akcoglu's dilation theorem for positive contractions on classical (=commutative) L^p-spaces has no reasonable analog in the noncommutative setting. Our study relies on non symmetric analogs of Pisier's operator space valued noncommutative L^p-spaces that we investigate in the first part of the paper.
