We prove an index theorem for Toeplitz operators on the quarter-plane using the index theory for generalized Toeplitz operators introduced by G. J. Murphy. To prove this index theorem we construct an indicial triple on the tensor product of two C*-algebras provided with indicial triples with general conditions. We show that our results can be extended to some extensions of the theory of Toeplitz operators on the quarter-plane.
