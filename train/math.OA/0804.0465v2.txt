Let \mathcal A be a separable, unital, approximately divisible C^*-algebra. We show that \mathcal A is generated by two self-adjoint elements and the topological free entropy dimension of any finite generating set of \mathcal A is less than or equal to 1. In addition, we show that the similarity degree of \mathcal A is at most 5. Thus an approximately divisible C^*-algebra has an affirmative answer to Kadison's similarity problem.
