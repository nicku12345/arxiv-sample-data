In this paper, we prove approximate lifting results in the C^{\ast}-algebra and von Neumann algebra settings. In the C^{\ast}-algebra setting, we show that two (weakly) semiprojective unital C*-algebras, each generated by n projections, can be glued together with partial isometries to define a larger (weakly) semiprojective algebra. In the von Neumann algebra setting, we prove lifting theorems for trace-preserving *-homomorphisms from abelian von Neumann algebras or hyperfinite von Neumann algebras into ultraproducts. We also extend a classical result of S. Sakai \cite{sakai} by showing that a tracial ultraproduct of C*-algebras is a von Neumann algebra, which yields a generalization of Lin's theorem \cite{Lin} on almost commuting selfadjoint operators with respect to \Vert\cdot\Vert_{p} on any unital C*-algebra with trace.
