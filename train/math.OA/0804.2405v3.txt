In this article, we investigate the notion of a Galois object for a locally compact quantum group M. Such an object consists of a von Neumann algebra N equipped with an ergodic integrable coaction of M on N, such that the crossed product is a type I factor. We show how to construct from such a coaction a new locally compact quantum group P, which we call the reflection of M along N. By way of application, we prove the following statement: any twisting of a locally compact quantum group by a unitary 2-cocycle is again a locally compact quantum group.
