The Atiyah-Singer index theorem is a topological formula for the index of an elliptic differential operator. The topological index depends on a cohomology class that is constructed from the principal symbol of the operator. On contact manifolds, the important Fredholm operators are not elliptic, but hypoelliptic. Their symbolic calculus is noncommutative, and involves analysis on the Heisenberg group. For a hypoelliptic differential operator in the Heisenberg calculus on a contact manifold we construct a symbol class in the K-theory of a noncommutative C*-algebra of symbols. There is a canonical map from this analytic K-theory group to the deRham cohomology of the manifold, which gives a class to which the Atiyah-Singer formula can be applied. We prove that the index formula holds for these hypoelliptic operators. Our methods derive from Connes' tangent groupoid proof of the index theorem.
