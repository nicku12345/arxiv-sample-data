We prove that if X_{1},...,X_{n} (n >1) are selfadjoints in a W^{*}-probability space with finite non-microstates free Fisher information, then the von Neumann algebra W^{*}(X_{1},...,X_{n}) they generate doesn't have property \Gamma (especially is not amenable). This is an analog of a well-known result of Voiculescu for microstates free entropy. We also prove factoriality under finite non-microstates entropy.
