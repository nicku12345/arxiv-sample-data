We investigate possible preduals of the measure algebra M(G) of a locally compact group and the Fourier algebra A(G) of a separable compact group. Both of these algebras are canonically dual spaces and the canonical preduals make the multiplication separately weak^*-continuous so that these algebras are dual Banach algebras. In this paper we find additional conditions under which the preduals C_0(G) of M(G) and C^*(G) of A(G) are uniquely determined. In both cases we consider a natural coassociative multiplication and show that the canonical predual gives rise to the unique weak^*-topology making both the multiplication separately weak^*-continuous and the coassociative multiplication weak^*-continuous. In particular, dual cohomological properties of these algebras are well defined with this additional structure.
