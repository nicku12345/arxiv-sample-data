Let \Fth be a \Bk-graph on a single vertex. We show that every irreducible atomic *-representation is the minimal *-dilation of a group construction representation. It follows that every atomic representation decomposes as a direct sum or integral of such representations. We characterize periodicity of \Fth and identify a symmetry subgroup H_\theta of \bZ^\Bk. If this has rank s, then \ca(\Fth) \cong \rC(\bT^s) \otimes \fA for some simple C*-algebra \fA.
