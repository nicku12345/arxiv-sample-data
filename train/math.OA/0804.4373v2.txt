Noncommutative topological entropy estimates are obtained for polynomial gauge invariant endomorphisms of Cuntz algebras, generalising known results for the canonical shift endomorphisms. Exact values for the entropy are computed for a class of permutative endomorphisms related to branching function systems introduced and studied by Bratteli, Jorgensen and Kawamura.
