One of the main tools to classify \cst-algebras is the study of its projections and its unitaries. It was proved by Cuntz in \cite{Cu81} that if A is a \textit{purely infinite} simple \cst-algebra, then the kernel of the natural map for the unitary group \U(A) to the K-theory group K_1(A) is reduced to the connected component \U^0(A), i.e. A is \textit{K_1-injective} (see \S 3). We study in this note a finitely generated \cst-algebra, the K_1-injectivity of which would imply the K_1-injectivity of all unital \textit{properly infinite} \cst-algebras.
