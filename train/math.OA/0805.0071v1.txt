In this paper we consider non-commutative analogue for the arithmeticgeometric mean inequality a^{r}b^{1-r}+(r-1)b\geq ra for two positive numbers a,b and r> 1. We show that under some assumptions the non-commutative analogue for a^{r}b^{1-r} which satisfies this inequality is unique and equal to r-mean. The case 0<r<1 is also considered. In particular, we give a new characterization of the geometric mean.
