Let \epsilon>0 be a positive number. Is there a number \delta>0 satisfying the following? Given any pair of unitaries u and v in a unital simple C^*-algebra A with [v]=0 in K_1(A) for which  \|uv-vu\|<\dt,  there is a continuous path of unitaries \{v(t): t\in [0,1]\}\subset A such that  v(0)=v, v(1)=1 \and \|uv(t)-v(t)u\|<\epsilon \forall t\in [0,1].  An answer is given to this question when A is assumed to be a unital simple C^*-algebra with tracial rank no more than one.   Let C be a unital separable amenable simple C^*-algebra with tracial rank no more than one which also satisfies the UCT. Suppose that \phi: C\to A is a unital monomorphism and suppose that v\in A is a unitary with [v]=0 in K_1(A) such that v almost commutes with \phi. It is shown that there is a continuous path of unitaries \{v(t): t\in [0,1]\} in A with v(0)=v and v(1)=1 such that the entire path v(t) almost commutes with \phi, provided that an induced Bott map vanishes. Other versions of the so-called Basic Homotopy Lemma are also presented.
