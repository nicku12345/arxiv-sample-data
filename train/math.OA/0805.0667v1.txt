We introduced a non-symmetric tensor product of any two states or any two representations of Cuntz-Krieger algebras associated with a certain non-cocommutative comultiplication in previous our work. In this paper, we show that a certain set of KMS states is closed with respect to the tensor product. From this, we obtain formulae of tensor product of type {\rm III} factor representations of Cuntz-Krieger algebras which is different from results of the tensor product of factors of type {\rm III}.
