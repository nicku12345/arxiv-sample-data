Let n \in \N and M_n be the algebra of n \times n matrices. We call a function f matrix monotone of order n or n-monotone in short whenever the inequality f(a) \leq f(b) holds for every pair of selfadjoint matrices a, b \in M_n such that a \leq b and all eigenvalues of a and b are contained in I. Matrix convex (concave) functions on I are similarily defined. The spaces for n-monotone functions and n-convex functions are written as P_n(I) and K_n(I). In this note we discuss several assertions at each leven n for which we regard themas the problems of double piling structure of those sequences \{P_n(I)\}_{n\in\N} and \{K_n(I)\}_{n\in\N}. In order to see clear insight of the aspect of the problems, however, we choose the following three main assertions among them and discuss their mutual dependence:   \begin{enumerate} \item[(i)] f(0)\leq 0 and f is n-convex in [0,\alpha), \item[(ii)] For each matrix a with its spectrum in [0,\alpha) and a contraction c in the matrix algebra M_n,   \[ f(c^{\star}a c)\leq c^{\star}f(a)c, \] \item[(iii)] The functon g(t)/t is n-monotone in (0,\alpha). \end{enumerate}   In particular, we show that for any n \in \N two conditions (ii) and (iii) are equivalent.
