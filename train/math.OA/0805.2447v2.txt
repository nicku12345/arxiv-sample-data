In this article, we give an abstract characterization of the ``identity'' of an operator space V by looking at a quantity n_{cb}(V,u) which is defined in analogue to a well-known quantity in Banach space theory. More precisely, we show that there exists a complete isometry from V to some \mathcal{L}(H) sending u to {\rm id}_H if and only if n_{cb}(V,u) =1. We will use it to give an abstract characterization of operator systems. Moreover, we will show that if V is a unital operator space and W is a proper complete M-ideal, then V/W is also a unital operator space. As a consequece, the quotient of an operator system by a proper complete M-ideal is again an operator system. In the appendix, we will also give an abstract characterisation of ``non-unital operator systems'' using an idea arose from the definition of n_{cb}(V,u).
