We present a class of subshifts Z_N, N = 1,2,... whose associated C^*-algebras {\cal O}_{Z_N} are simple, purely infinite and not stably isomorphic to any Cuntz-Krieger algebra nor to Cuntz algebra. The class of the subshifts is the first examples whose associated C^*-algebras are not stably isomorphic to any Cuntz-Krieger algebra nor to Cuntz algebra. The subshifts Z_N are coded systems whose languages are context free. We compute the topological entropy for the subshifts and show that KMS-state for gauge action on the associated C^*-algebra {\cal O}_{Z_N} exists if and only if the logarithm of the inverse temperature is the topological entropy for the subshift Z_N, and the corresponding KMS-state is unique.
