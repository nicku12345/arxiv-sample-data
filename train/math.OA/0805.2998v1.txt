Consider a free ergodic measure preserving profinite action \Gamma\curvearrowright X (i.e. an inverse limit of actions \Gamma\curvearrowright X_n, with X_n finite) of a countable property (T) group \Gamma (more generally of a group \Gamma which admits an infinite normal subgroup \Gamma_0 such that the inclusion \Gamma_0\subset\Gamma has relative property (T) and \Gamma/\Gamma_0 is finitely generated) on a standard probability space X. We prove that if w:\Gamma\times X\to \Lambda is a measurable cocycle with values in a countable group \Lambda, then w is cohomologous to a cocycle w' which factors through the map \Gamma\times X\to \Gamma\times X_n, for some n. As a corollary, we show that any orbit equivalence of \Gamma\curvearrowright X with any free ergodic measure preserving action \Lambda\curvearrowright Y comes from a (virtual) conjugacy of actions.
