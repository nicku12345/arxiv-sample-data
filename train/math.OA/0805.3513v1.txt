Motivated by importance of operator spaces contained in the set of all scalar multiples of isometries (MI-spaces) in a separable Hilbert space for C^*-algebras and E-semigroups we exhibit more properties of such spaces. For example, if an MI-space contains an isometry with shift part of finite multiplicity, then it is one-dimensional. We propose a simple model of a unilateral shift of arbitrary multiplicity and show that each separable subspace of a Hilbert space is the range of a shift. Also, we show that MI-spaces are non-symmetric, very unfriendly to multiplication, and prove a Commutator Identity which elucidates the extreme non-commutativity of these spaces.
