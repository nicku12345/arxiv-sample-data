We give an identification between the planar algebra of the subgroup-subfactor R \rtimes H \subset R \rtimes G and the G-invariant planar subalgebra of the planar algebra of the bipartite graph \star_n, where n = [G : H]. The crucial step in this identification is an exhibition of a model for the basic construction tower, and thereafter of the standard invariant, of R \rtimes H \subset R \rtimes G in terms of operator matrices. We also obtain an identification between the planar algebra of the fixed algebra subfactor R^G \subset R^H and the G-invariant planar subalgebra of the planar algebra of the `flip' of \star_n .
