We prove that a unital simple approximately homogeneous (AH) C*-algebra with no dimension growth absorbs the Jiang-Su algebra tensorially without appealing to the classification theory of these algebras. Our main result continues to hold under the slightly weaker hypothesis of exponentially slow dimension growth.
