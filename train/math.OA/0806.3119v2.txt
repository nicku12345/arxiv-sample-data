We completely classify type III factor representations of Cuntz-Krieger algebras associated with quasi-free states up to unitary equivalence. Furthermore, we realize these representations on concrete Hilbert spaces without using GNS construction. Free groups and their type {\rm II}_{1} factor representations are used in these realizations.
