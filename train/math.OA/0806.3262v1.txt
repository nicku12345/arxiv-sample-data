We describe the envelope C*-algebra associated to a partial action of a countable discrete group on a locally compact space as a groupoid C*-algebra (more precisely as a C*-algebra from an equivalence relation) and we use our approach to show that, for a large class of partial actions of Z on the Cantor set, the envelope C*-algebra is an AF-algebra. We also completely characterize partial actions of a countable discrete group on a compact space such that the envelope action acts in a Hausdorff space.
