Bosons and fermions are described by using canonical generators of Cuntz algebras on any permutative representation. According to branching laws associated with these descriptions, a certain representation of the Cuntz algebra \co{2} induces Fock representations {\cal H}_{B} and {\cal H}_{F} of bosons and fermions simultaneously. From this, a unitary operator U from {\cal H}_{B} to {\cal H}_{F} is obtained. We show the explicit formula of the action of U on the standard basis of {\cal H}_{B}. It is shown that U preserves the particle number of {\cal H}_{B} and {\cal H}_{F}.
