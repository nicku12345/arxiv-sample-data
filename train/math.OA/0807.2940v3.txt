For the C^*-crossed product C^*(\Sigma) associated with an arbitrary topological dynamical system \Sigma = (X, \sigma), we provide a detailed analysis of the commutant, in C^* (\Sigma), of C(X) and the commutant of the image of C(X) under an arbitrary Hilbert space representation \tilde{\pi} of C^* (\Sigma). In particular, we give a concrete description of these commutants, and also determine their spectra. We show that, regardless of the system \Sigma, the commutant of C(X) has non-zero intersection with every non-zero, not necessarily closed or self-adjoint, ideal of C^* (\Sigma). We also show that the corresponding statement holds true for the commutant of \tilde{\pi}(C(X)) under the assumption that a certain family of pure states of \tilde{\pi}(C^* (\Sigma)) is total. Furthermore we establish that, if C(X) \subsetneq C(X)', there exist both a C^*-subalgebra properly between C(X) and C(X)' which has the aforementioned intersection property, and such a C^*-subalgebra which does not have this property. We also discuss existence of a projection of norm one from C^*(\Sigma) onto the commutant of C(X).
