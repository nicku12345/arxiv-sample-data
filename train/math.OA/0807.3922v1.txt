We discuss the relation between questions regarding the essential normality of finitely generated essentially spherical isometries and some results and conjectures of Arveson and Guo-Wang on the closure of homogeneous ideals in the m-shift space. We establish a general results for the case of two tuples and ideals with one dimensional zero variety. Further, we show how to reduce the analogous question for quasi-homogeneous ideals, to those results for homogeneous ones. Finally, we show that the essential reductivity of positive regular Hilbert modules is directly related to a generalization of the Arveson problem.
