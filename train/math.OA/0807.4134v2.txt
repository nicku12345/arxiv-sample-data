If G is a countable, discrete group generated by two finite subgroups H and K and P is a II_1 factor with an outer G-action, one can construct the group-type subfactor P^H \subset P \rtimes K introduced in \cite{BH}. This construction was used in \cite{BH} to obtain numerous examples of infinite depth subfactors whose standard invariant has exotic growth properties. We compute the planar algebra (in the sense of Jones \cite{J2}) of this subfactor and prove that any subfactor with an abstract planar algebra of "group type" arises from such a subfactor. The action of Jones' planar operad is determined explicitly.
