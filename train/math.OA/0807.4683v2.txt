The generalized Effros-Hahn conjecture for groupoid C*-algebras says that, if G is amenable, then every primitive ideal of the groupoid C*-algebra C*(G) is induced from a stability group. We prove that the conjecture is valid for all second countable amenable locally compact Hausdorff groupoids. Our results are a sharpening of previous work of Jean Renault and depend significantly on his results.
