Let G be an inductive limit of finite cyclic groups and let A be a unital simple projectionless C*-algebra with K_1(A) \cong G and with a unique tracial state, as constructed based on dimension drop algebras by Jiang and Su. First, we show that any two aperiodic elements in \Aut(A)/\WInn(A) are conjugate, where \WInn(A) means the subgroup of \Aut(A) consisting of automorphisms which are inner in the tracial representation.   In the second part of this paper, we consider a class of unital simple C*-algebras with a unique tracial state which contains the class of unital simple AT-algebras of real rank zero with a unique tracial state. This class is closed under inductive limits and under crossed products by actions of \Z with the Rohlin property. Let A be a TAF-algebra in this class. We show that for any automorphism \alpha of A there exists an automorphism \widetilde{\alpha} of A with the Rohlin property such that \widetilde{\alpha} and \alpha are asymptotically unitarily equivalent. In its proof we use an aperiodic automorphism of the Jiang-Su algebra.
