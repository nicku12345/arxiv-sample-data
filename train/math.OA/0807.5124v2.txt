Let Top_c be the category of compact spaces and continuous maps and Top_f\subset Top_c be the full subcategory of finite spaces. Consider the covariant functor Mor:Top_f^{op}\times Top_c\to Top_c that associates any pair (X,Y) with the space of all morphisms from X to Y. In this paper, we describe a non commutative version of Mor. More pricelessly, we define a functor \mathfrak{M}\mathfrak{o}\mathfrak{r}, that takes any pair (B,C) of a finitely generated unital C*-algebra B and a finite dimensional C*-algebra C to the quantum family of all morphism from B to C.
