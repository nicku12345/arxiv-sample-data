Let \M be a type {\rm II}_1 factor with a faithful normal tracial state \tau and let \M^\omega be the ultrapower algebra of \M. In this paper, we prove that for every operator T\in \M^\omega, there is a family of projections \{P_t\}_{0\leq t\leq 1} in \M^\omega such that TP_t=P_tTP_t, P_s\leq P_t if s\leq t, and \tau_\omega(P_t)=t. Let \mathfrak{M}=\{Z \in \M: \text{there is a family of projections} \{P_t\}_{0\leq t\leq 1}   \text{in} \M \text{such that} ZP_t=P_tZP_t, P_s\leq P_t \text{if} s\leq t, \text{and} \tau(P_t)=t\}. As an application we show that for every operator T\in \M and \epsilon>0, there is an operator S\in \mathfrak{M} such that \|S\|\leq \|T\| and \|S-T\|_2<\epsilon.   We also show that \prod_n^\omega M_n(\cc) is not \ast-isomorphic to the ultrapower algebra of the hyperfinite type {\rm II}_1 factor.
