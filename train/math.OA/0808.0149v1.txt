Given a von Neumann algebra M denote by S(M) and LS(M) respectively the algebras of all measurable and locally measurable operators affiliated with M. For a faithful normal semi-finite trace \tau on M let S(M, \tau) (resp. S_0(M, \tau)) be the algebra of all \tau-measurable (resp. \tau-compact) operators from S(M). We give a complete description of all derivations on the above algebras of operators in the case of type I von Neumann algebra M. In particular, we prove that if M is of type I_\infty then every derivation on LS(M) (resp. S(M) and S(M,\tau)) is inner, and each derivation on S_0(M, \tau) is spatial and implemented by an element from S(M, \tau).
