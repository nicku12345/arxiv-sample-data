Given a C^*-dynamical system (A, G, \alpha) one defines a homomorphism, called the Chern-Connes character, that take an element in K_0(A) \oplus K_1(A), the K-theory groups of the C^*-algebra A, and maps it into H_{\mathbb{R}}^*(G), the real deRham cohomology ring of G. We explictly compute this homomorphism for the examples (\overline{\Psi_{cl}^0(S^1)}, S^1, \alpha) and (\overline{\Psi_{cl}^0(S^2)}, SO(3), \alpha), where \overline{\Psi_{cl}^0(M)} denotes the C^*-algebra generated by the classical pseudodifferential operators of zero order in the manifold M and \alpha the action of conjugation by the regular representation (translations).
