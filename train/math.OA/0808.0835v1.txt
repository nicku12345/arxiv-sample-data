In this paper we extend work of Kawamura, see kawamura, for Cuntz-Krieger algebras O_A for infinite matrices A. We generalize the definition of branching systems, prove their existence for any given matrix A and show how they induce some very concrete representations of O_A. We use these representations to describe the Perron-Frobenius operator, associated to an nonsingular transformation, as an infinite sum and under some hypothesis we find a matrix representation for the operator. We finish the paper with a few examples.
