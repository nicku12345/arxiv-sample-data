Let S be a subset of a amenable group G such that e\in S and S^{-1}=S. The main result of the paper states that if the Cayley graph of G with respect to S has a certain combinatorial property, then every positive definite operator-valued function on S can be extended to a positive definite function on G. Several known extension results are obtained as a corollary. New applications are also presented.
