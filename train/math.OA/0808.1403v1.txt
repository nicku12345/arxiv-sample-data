We investigate Cuntz-Pimsner C^*-algebras associated with certain correspondences of the unit circle \mathbb{T}. We analyze these C^*-algebras by analogy with irrational rotation algebras A_\theta and Cuntz algebras \mathcal{O}_n. We construct a Rieffel type projection, study the fixed point algebras of certain actions of finite groups, and calculate the entropy of a certain endomorphism. We also study the induced map of the dual action of the gauge action on K-groups.
