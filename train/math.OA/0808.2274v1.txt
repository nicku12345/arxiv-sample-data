Let p be an even positive integer and U_p(H) be the Banach-Lie group of unitary operators u which verify that u-1 belongs to the p-Schatten ideal B_p(H). Let {\cal O} be a smooth manifold on which U_p(H) acts transitively and smoothly. Then one can endow {\cal O} with a natural Finsler metric in terms of the p-Schatten norm and the action of U_p(H). Our main result establishes that for any pair of given initial conditions  x\in {\cal O}\hbox{and} X\in (T{\cal O})_x  there exists a curve \delta(t)=e^{tz}\cdot x in {\cal O}, with z a skew-hermitian element in the p-Schatten class such that  \delta(0)=x \hbox{and} \dot{\delta}(0)=X,  which remains minimal as long as t\|z\|_p\le \pi/4. Moreover, \delta is unique with these properties. We also show that the metric space ({\cal O},d) (d= rectifiable distance) is complete. In the process we establish minimality results in the groups U_p(H), and a convexity property for the rectifiable distance. As an example of these spaces, we treat the case of the unitary orbit  {\cal O}=\{uAu^*: u\in U_p(H)\}  of a self-adjoint operator A\in B(H).
