Let M_0 \subset M_1 be a finite-index infinite-depth hyperfinite II_1 subfactor and \omega a free ultrafilter of the natural numbers. We show that if this subfactor is constructed from a commuting square then the central sequence inclusion M_0^{\omega} \cap M_1' \subset (M_0)_{\omega} has infinite Pimnser-Popa index. We will also demonstrate this result for certain infinite-depth hyperfinite subfactors coming from groups.
