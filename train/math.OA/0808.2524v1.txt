We give a Riemannian structure to the set \Sigma of positive invertible unitized Hilbert-Schmidt operators, by means of the trace inner product. This metric makes of \Sigma a nonpositively curved, simply connected and metrically complete Hilbert manifold. The manifold \Sigma is a universal model for symmetric spaces of the noncompact type: any such space can be isometrically embedded into \Sigma. We give an intrinsic algebraic characterization of convex closed submanifolds M. We study the group of isometries of such submanifolds: we prove that G_M, the Banach-Lie group generated by M, acts isometrically and transitively on M. Moreover, G_M admits a polar decomposition relative to M, namely G_M\simeq M\times K as Hilbert manifolds (here K is the isotropy of p=1 for the action I_g: p\mapsto gpg^*), and also G_M/K\simeq M so M is an homogeneous space. We obtain several decomposition theorems by means of geodesically convex submanifolds M. These decompositions are obtained \textit{via} a nonlinear but analytic orthogonal projection \Pi_M:\Sigma\to M, a map which is a contraction for the geodesic distance. As a byproduct, we prove the isomorphism NM\simeq\Sigma (here NM stands for the normal bundle of a convex closed submanifold M). Writing down the factorizations for fixed {\rm e}^a, we obtain {\rm e}^a={\rm e}^x{\rm e}^v{\rm e}^x with {\rm e}^x\in M and v orthogonal to M at p=1. As a corollary we obtain decompositions for the full group of invertible elements G\simeq M\times \exp(T_1M^{\perp})\times K.
