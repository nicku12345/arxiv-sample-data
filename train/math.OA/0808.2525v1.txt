Let U_2({\cal H}) be the Banach-Lie group of unitary operators in the Hilbert space {\cal H} which are Hilbert-Schmidt perturbations of the identity 1. In this paper we study the geometry of the unitary orbit \{upu^*: u\in U_2({\cal H})\}, of an infinite projection p in {\cal H}. This orbit coincides with the connected component of p in the Hilbert-Schmidt restricted Grassmannian Gr_{res}(p) (also known in the literature as the Sato Grassmannian) corresponding to the polarization {\cal H}=p({\cal H})\oplus p({\cal H})^\perp. It is known that the components of Gr_{res}(p) are differentiable manifolds. Here we give a simple proof of the fact that Gr_{res}^0(p) is a smooth submanifold of the affine Hilbert space p+{\cal B}_2({\cal H}), where {\cal B}_2({\cal H}) denotes the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators of {\cal H}. We prove that the geodesics of the natural connection, which are of the form \gamma(t)=e^{tz}pe^{-tz}, for z a p-codiagonal anti-hermitic element of {\cal B}_2({\cal H}), have minimal length provided that \|z\|\le \pi/2. Note that the condition is given in terms of the usual operator norm, a fact which implies that there exist minimal geodesics of arbitrary length. Also we show that any two points p_1,p_2\in Gr_{res}^0(p) are joined by a minimal geodesic. If moreover \|p_1-p_2\|<1, the minimal geodesic is unique. Finally, we replace the 2-norm by the k-Schatten norm (k>2), and prove that the geodesics are also minimal for these norms, up to a critical value of t, which is estimated also in terms of the usual operator norm. In the process, minimality results in the k-norms are also obtained for the group U_2({\cal H}).
