We shall present examples of Schauder bases in the preduals to the hyperfinite factors of types \hbox{II}_1, \hbox{II}_\infty, \hbox{III}_\lambda, 0 < \lambda \leq 1. In the semifinite (respectively, purely infinite) setting, these systems form Schauder bases in any associated separable symmetric space of measurable operators (respectively, in any non-commutative L^p-space).
