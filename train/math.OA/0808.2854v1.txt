In noncommutative geometry one is interested in invariants such as the Fredholm index or spectral flow and their calculation using cyclic cocycles. A variety of formulae have been established under side conditions called summability constraints. These can be formulated in two ways, either for spectral triples or for bounded Fredholm modules. We study the relationship between these by proving various properties of the map on unbounded self adjoint operators D given by f(D)=D(1+D^2)^{-1/2}. In particular we prove commutator estimates which are needed for the bounded case. In fact our methods work in the setting of semifinite noncommutative geometry where one has D as an unbounded self adjoint linear operator affiliated with a semi-finite von Neumann algebra \aM. More precisely we show that for a pair D,D_0 of such operators with D-D_0 a bounded self-adjoint linear operator from \aM and  ({\bf 1}+D_0^2)^{-1/2}\in \sE, where \sE is a noncommutative symmetric space associated with \aM, then  \Vert f(D) - f (D_0) \Vert_{\sE} \leq C\cdot \Vert D-D_0\Vert_{\aM}.  This result is further used to show continuous differentiability of the mapping between an odd \sE-summable spectral triple and its bounded counterpart.
