We use a tensor C*-category with conjugates and two quasitensor functors into the category of Hilbert spaces to define a *-algebra depending functorially on this data. If one of them is tensorial, we can complete in the maximal C*-norm. A particular case of this construction allows us to begin with solutions of the conjugate equations and associate ergodic actions of quantum groups on the C*-algebra in question. The quantum groups involved are A_u(Q) and B_u(Q).
