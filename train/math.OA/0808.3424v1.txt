We study the range of a classifiable class {\cal A} of unital separable simple amenable C^*-algebras which satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. The class {\cal A} contains all unital simple AH-algebras. We show that all unital simple inductive limits of dimension drop circle C^*-algebras are also in the class. This unifies some of the previous known classification results for unital simple amenable C^*-algebras. We also show that there are many other C^*-algebras in the class. We prove that, for any partially ordered, simple weakly unperforated rationally Riesz group G_0 with order unit u, any countable abelian group G_1, any metrizable Choquet simplex S, and any surjective affine continuous map r: S\to S_u(G_0) (where S_u(G_0) is the state space of G_0) which preserves extremal points, there exists one and only one (up to isomorphism) unital separable simple amenable C^*-algebra A in the classifiable class {\cal A} such that  ((K_0(A), K_0(A)_+, [1_A]), K_1(A), T(A), \lambda_A)=((G_0, (G_0)_+, u), G_1,S, r).
