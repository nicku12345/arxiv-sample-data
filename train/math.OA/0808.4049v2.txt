Mimicking the von Neumann version of Kustermans and Vaes' locally compact quantum groups, Franck Lesieur had introduced a notion of measured quantum groupoid, in the setting of von Neumann algebras. In a former article, the author had introduced the notion of actions, crossed-product, dual actions of a measured quantum groupoid: a biduality theorem for actions had been proved. This article continues that program : we prove the existence of a standard implementation for an action, and a bidulaity theorem for weights. We generalize this way results which were proved, for locally compact quantum groups by S. Vaes, and for measured groupoids by T. Yamanouchi.
