Mimicking the von Neumann version of Kustermans and Vaes' locally compact quantum groups, Franck Lesieur had introduced a notion of measured quantum groupoid, in the setting of von Neumann algebras. In this article, we suppose that the basis of the measured quantum groupoid is central; in that case, we prove that a specific sub-{\bf C}^* algebra is invariant under all the data of the measured quantum groupoid; moreover, this sub-{\bf C}^*-algebra is a continuous field of {\bf C}^*-algebras; when the basis is central in both the measured quantum groupoid and its dual, we get that the measured quantum groupoid is a continuous field of locally compact quantum groups. On the other hand, using this sub-{\bf C}^*-algebra, we prove that any abelian measured quantum groupoid comes from a locally compact groupoid.
