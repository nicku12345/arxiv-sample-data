It is shown that the heteroclinic and homoclinic algebras of a generalized one-dimensional solenoid are simple AH-algebras of real rank zero with no dimension growth and a unique trace. In the orientable case they are AT-algebras, and in the non-orientable case they have two-torsion both in K_1 and K_0.
