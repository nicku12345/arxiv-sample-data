Suppose that a locally compact group G acts freely and properly on the right of a locally compact space T. Rieffel proved that if \alpha is an action of G on a C^*-algebra A and there is an equivariant embedding of C_0(T) in M(A), then the action \alpha of G on A is proper, and the crossed product A\rtimes_{\alpha,r}G is Morita equivalent to a generalised fixed-point algebra \Fix(A,\alpha) in M(A)^\alpha. We show that the assignment (A,\alpha)\mapsto\Fix(A,\alpha) extends to a functor \Fix on a category of C^*-dynamical systems in which the isomorphisms are Morita equivalences, and that Rieffel's Morita equivalence implements a natural isomorphism between a crossed-product functor and \Fix. From this, we deduce naturality of Mansfield imprimitivity for crossed products by coactions, improving results of Echterhoff-Kaliszewski-Quigg-Raeburn and Kaliszewski-Quigg Raeburn, and naturality of a Morita equivalence for graph algebras due to Kumjian and Pask.
