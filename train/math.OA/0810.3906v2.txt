The radial (or Laplacian) masa in a free group factor is the abelian von Neumann algebra generated by the sum of the generators (of the free group) and their inverses. The main result of this paper is that the radial masa is a maximal injective von Neumann subalgebra of a free group factor. We also investigate tensor products of maximal injective algebras. Given two inclusions B_i\subset M_i of type \mathrm{I} von Neumann algebras in finite von Neumann algebras such that each B_i is maximal injective in M_i, we show that the tensor product B_1\ \bar{\otimes}\ B_2 is maximal injective in M_1\ \bar{\otimes}\ M_2 provided at least one of the inclusions satisfies the asymptotic orthogonality property we establish for the radial masa. In particular it follows that finite tensor products of generator and radial masas will be maximal injective in the corresponding tensor product of free group factors.
