For dynamical systems defined by a covering map of a compact Hausdorff space and the corresponding transfer operator, the associated crossed product C^*-algebras \cros introduced by Exel and Vershik are considered. An important property for homeomorphism dynamical systems is topological freeness. It can be extended in a natural way to in general non-invertible dynamical systems generated by covering maps. In this article, it is shown that the following four properties are equivalent: the dynamical system generated by a covering map is topologically free; the canonical imbedding of C(X) into \cros is a maximal abelian C^*-subalgebra of \cros; any nontrivial two sided ideal of \cros has non-zero intersection with the imbedded copy of C(X); a certain natural representation of \cros is faithful. This result is a generalization to non-invertible dynamics of the corresponding results for crossed product C^*-algebras of homeomorphism dynamical systems.
