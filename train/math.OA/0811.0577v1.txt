We show that there exist infinite-dimensional extremely non-complex Banach spaces, i.e. spaces X such that the norm equality \|Id + T^2\|=1 + \|T^2\| holds for every bounded linear operator T:X\longrightarrow X. This answers in the positive Question 4.11 of [Kadets, Martin, Meri, Norm equalities for operators, \emph{Indiana U. Math. J.} \textbf{56} (2007), 2385--2411]. More concretely, we show that this is the case of some C(K) spaces with few operators constructed in [Koszmider, Banach spaces of continuous functions with few operators, \emph{Math. Ann.} \textbf{330} (2004), 151--183] and [Plebanek, A construction of a Banach space C(K) with few operators, \emph{Topology Appl.} \textbf{143} (2004), 217--239]. We also construct compact spaces K_1 and K_2 such that C(K_1) and C(K_2) are extremely non-complex, C(K_1) contains a complemented copy of C(2^\omega) and C(K_2) contains a (1-complemented) isometric copy of \ell_\infty.
