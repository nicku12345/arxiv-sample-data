We show that a Banach space with numerical index one cannot enjoy good convexity or smoothness properties unless it is one-dimensional. For instance, it has no WLUR points in its unit ball, its norm is not Frechet smooth and its dual norm is neither smooth nor strictly convex. Actually, these results also hold if the space has the (strictly weaker) alternative Daugavet property. We construct a (non-complete) strictly convex predual of an infinite-dimensional L_1 space (which satisfies a property called lushness which implies numerical index~1). On the other hand, we show that a lush real Banach space is neither strictly convex nor smooth, unless it is one-dimensional. In particular, if a subspace X of the real space C[0,1] is smooth or strictly convex, then C[0,1]/X contains a copy of C[0,1]. Finally, we prove that the dual of any lush infinite-dimensional real space contains a copy of \ell_1.
