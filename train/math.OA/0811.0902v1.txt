In this paper we study derivations in subalgebras of L_{0}^{wo}(\nu ;% \mathcal{L}(X)) , the algebra of all weak operator measurable funtions f:S\to \mathcal{L}(X) , where % \mathcal{L}(X)  is the Banach algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Banach space X. It is shown, in particular, that all derivations on L_{0}^{wo}(\nu ;\mathcal{L}(X))  are inner whenever X is separable and infinite dimensional. This contrasts strongly with the fact that L_{0}^{wo}(\nu ;\mathcal{L}(X))  admits non-trivial non-inner derivations whenever X is finite dimensional and the measure \nu  is non-atomic. As an application of our approach, we study derivations in various algebras of measurable operators affiliated with von Neumann algebras.
