A hyperfinite II_1 subfactor may be obtained from a symmetric commuting square via iteration of the basic construction. For certain commuting squares constructed from Hadamard matrices, we describe this subfactor as a group-type inclusion R^H \subset R \rtimes K, where H and K are finite groups with outer actions on the hyperfinite II_1 factor R. We find the group of outer automorphisms generated by H and K, and use the method of Bisch and Haagerup to determine the principal and dual principal graphs. In some cases a complete classification is obtained by examining the element of H^3(H \ast K / Int R) associated with the action.
