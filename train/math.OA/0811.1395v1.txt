We consider three lifting questions: Given a C\sp{*}-algebra I, if there is a unital C\sp{*}-algebra A contains I as an ideal, is every unitary from A/I lifted to a unitary in A? is every unitary from A/I lifted to an extremal partial isometry? is every extremal partial isometry from A/I lifted to an extremal partial isometry? We show several constructions of I which serve as working examples or counter-examples for above questions.
