We review Kajiwara and Watatani's construction of a C*-algebra from an iterated function system (IFS). If the IFS satisfies the finite branch condition or the open set condition, we build an injective homomorphism from Kajiwara-Watatani algebras to the Cuntz algebra, which can be thought as the algebra of the lifted system, and we give the description of its image. Finally, if the IFS admits a left inverse we show that the Kajiwara-Watatani algebra is isomorphic to an Exel's crossed product.
