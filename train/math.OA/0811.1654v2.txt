We define a semidirect product groupoid of a system of partially defined local homeomorphisms T=(T_{1},..., T_{r}). We prove that this construction gives rise to amenable groupoids. The associated algebra is a Cuntz-like algebra. We use this construction for higher rank graph algebras in order to give a topological interpretation for the duality in E-theory between C^{*}(\Lambda) and C^{*}(\Lambda^{op}).
