Associated to each set S of simple roots for SL(n,\mathbb{C}) is an equivariant fibration X\to X_S of the space X of complete flags of \mathbb{C}^n. To each such fibration we associate an algebra J_S of operators on L^2(X) which contains, in particular, the longitudinal pseudodifferential operators of negative order tangent to the fibres. These form a lattice of operator ideals whose common intersection is the compact operators. As a consequence, the product of fibrewise smoothing operators (for instance) along the fibres of two such fibrations, X\to X_S and X\to X_T, is a compact operator if S\cup T is the full set of simple roots.   The construction uses noncommutative harmonic analysis, and hinges upon a representation theoretic property of subgroups of SU(n), which may be described as `essential orthogonality of subrepresentations'.
