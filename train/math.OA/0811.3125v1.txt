We consider the resolvent (\lambda-a)^{-1} of any R-diagonal operator a in a \mathrm{II}_1-factor. Our main theorem gives a universal asymptotic formula for the norm of such a resolvent. En route to its proof, we calculate the R-transform of the operator |\lambda-c|^2 where c is Voiculescu's circular operator, and give an asymptotic formula for the negative moments of |\lambda-a|^2 for any R-diagonal a. We use a mixture of complex analytic and combinatorial techniques, each giving finer information where the other can give only coarse detail. In particular, we introduce {\em partition structure diagrams}, a new combinatorial structure arising in free probability.
