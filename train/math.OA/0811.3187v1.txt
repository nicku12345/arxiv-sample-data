Quantum groups and quantum homogeneous spaces - developed by several authors since the 80's - provide a large class of examples of algebras which for many reasons we interpret as `coordinate algebras' over noncommutative spaces. This dissertation is an attempt to understand them from the point of view of Connes' noncommutative geometry.
