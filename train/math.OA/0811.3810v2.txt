The odd dimensional quantum sphere S_q^{2\ell+1} is a homogeneous space for the quantum group SU_q(\ell+1). A generic equivariant spectral triple for S_q^{2\ell+1} on its L_2 space was constructed by Chakraborty & Pal. We prove regularity for that spectral triple here. We also compute its dimension spectrum and show that it is simple. We give detailed construction of its smooth function algebra and some related algebras that help proving regularity and in the computation of the dimension spectrum. Following the idea of Connes for SU_q(2), we first study another spectral triple for S_q^{2\ell+1} equivariant under torus group action constructed by Chakraborty & Pal. We then derive the results for the SU_q(\ell+1)-equivariant triple in the q=0 case from those for the torus equivariant triple. For the q\neq 0 case, we deduce regularity and dimension spectrum from the q=0 case.
