We study the s-numbers of elementary operators acting on C*-algebras. The main results are the following: If \tau is any tensor norm and a,b\in B(H) are such that the sequences s(a),s(b) of their singular numbers belong to a stable Calkin space J then the sequence of approximation numbers of a\otimes_{\tau} b belongs to J. If A is a C*-algebra, J is a stable Calkin space, s is an s-number function, and a_i, b_i \in A, i=1,...,m are such that s(\pi(a_i)), s(\pi(b_i)) \in J, i=1,...,m for some faithful representation \pi of A then s(\sum_{i=1}^{m} M_{a_i,b_i})\in J. The converse implication holds if and only if the ideal of compact elements of A has finite spectrum. We also prove a quantitative version of a result of Ylinen.
