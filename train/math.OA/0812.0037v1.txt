We find new presentations for the Thompson's groups F, the derived group F^{'} and the intermediate group D. These presentations have a common ground in that their relators are the same and only the generating sets differ. As an application of these presentations we extract the following consequences: the cost of the group F^{'} is 1 hence the cost cannot decide the (non)amenability question of F; the II_1 factor L(F^{'}) is inner asymptotically abelian and the reduced C^*-algebra of F is not residually finite dimensional.
