We define spatial CPD-semigroup and construct their Powers sum. We construct the Powers sum for general spatial CP-semigroups. In both cases, we show that the product system of that Powers sum is the product of the spatial product systems of its factors. We show that on the domain of intersection, pointwise bounded CPD-semigroups on the one side and Schur CP-semigroups on the other, the constructions coincide. This summarizes all known results about Powers sums and generalizes them considerably.
