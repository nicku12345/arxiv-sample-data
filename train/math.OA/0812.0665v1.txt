We give a simple definition of property T for discrete quantum groups. We prove the basic expected properties: discrete quantum groups with property T are finitely generated and unimodular. Moreover we show that, for "I.C.C." discrete quantum groups, property T is equivalent to Connes' property T for the dual von Neumann algebra. This allows us to give the first example of a property T discrete quantum group which is not a group using the twisting construction.
