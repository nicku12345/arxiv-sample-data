Let T be an underlying space with a non-atomic measure \sigma on it (e.g. T=\mathbb R^d and \sigma is the Lebesgue measure). We introduce and study a class of non-commutative generalized stochastic processes, indexed by points of T, with freely independent values. Such a process (field), \omega=\omega(t), t\in T, is given a rigorous meaning through smearing out with test functions on T, with \int_T \sigma(dt)f(t)\omega(t) being a (bounded) linear operator in a full Fock space. We define a set \mathbf{CP} of all continuous polynomials of \omega, and then define a con-commutative L^2-space L^2(\tau) by taking the closure of \mathbf{CP} in the norm \|P\|_{L^2(\tau)}:=\|P\Omega\|, where \Omega is the vacuum in the Fock space. Through procedure of orthogonalization of polynomials, we construct a unitary isomorphism between L^2(\tau) and a (Fock-space-type) Hilbert space \mathbb F=\mathbb R\oplus\bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty L^2(T^n,\gamma_n), with explicitly given measures \gamma_n. We identify the Meixner class as those processes for which the procedure of orthogonalization leaves the set \mathbf {CP} invariant. (Note that, in the general case, the projection of a continuous monomial of oder n onto the n-th chaos need not remain a continuous polynomial.) Each element of the Meixner class is characterized by two continuous functions \lambda and \eta\ge0 on T, such that, in the \mathbb F space, \omega has representation \omega(t)=\di_t^\dag+\lambda(t)\di_t^\dag\di_t+\di_t+\eta(t)\di_t^\dag\di^2_t, where \di_t^\dag and \di_t are the usual creation and annihilation operators at point t.
