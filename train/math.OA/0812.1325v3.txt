We show that for any type {\rm III_1} free Araki-Woods factor \mathcal{M} = \Gamma(H_\R, U_t)" associated with an orthogonal representation (U_t) of \R on a separable real Hilbert space H_\R, the continuous core M = \mathcal{M} \rtimes_\sigma \R is a semisolid {\rm II_\infty} factor, i.e. for any non-zero finite projection q \in M, the {\rm II_1} factor qMq is semisolid. If the representation (U_t) is moreover assumed to be mixing, then we prove that the core M is solid. As an application, we construct an example of a non-amenable solid {\rm II_1} factor N with full fundamental group, i.e. \mathcal{F}(N) = \R^*_+, which is not isomorphic to any interpolated free group factor L(\F_t), for 1 < t \leq +\infty.
