We prove that two dual operator spaces X and Y are stably isomorphic if and only if there exist completely isometric normal representations \phi and \psi of X and Y, respectively, and ternary rings of operators M_1, M_2 such that \phi (X)= [M_2^*\psi (Y)M_1]^{-w^*} and \psi (Y)=[M_2\phi (X)M_1^*]. We prove that this is equivalent to certain canonical dual operator algebras associated with the operator spaces being stably isomorphic. We apply these operator space results to prove that certain dual operator algebras are stably isomorphic if and only if they are isomorphic. We provide examples motivated by CSL algebra theory.
