In this paper, we investigate Jordan *-homomorphisms on C^*-algebras associated with the following functional inequality \|f(\frac{b-a}{3})+f(\frac{a-3c}{3})+f(\frac{3a+3c-b}{3})\| \leq \|f(a)\|. We moreover prove the superstability and the generalized Hyers-Ulam stability of Jordan *-homomorphisms on C^*-algebras associated with the following functional equation f(\frac{b-a}{3})+f(\frac{a-3c}{3})+f(\frac{3a+3c-b}{3})=f(a).
