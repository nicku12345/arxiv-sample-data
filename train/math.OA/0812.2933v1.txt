In this paper, we investigate homomorphisms between C^*-ternary algebras and derivations on C^*-ternary algebras, associated with the following functional equation f(\frac{x_2-x_1}{3})+f(\frac{x_1-3x_3}{3})+f(\frac{3x_1+3x_3-x_2}{3})=f(x_1). Moreover, we prove the generalized Hyers-Ulam -Rassias stability of homomorphisms in C^*-ternary algebras and of derivations on C^*-ternary algebras.
