The subject of this thesis is Galois correspondence for von Neumann algebras and its interplay with non-commutative probability theory. After a brief introduction to representation theory for compact groups, in particular to Peter-Weyl theorem, and to operator algebras, including von Neumann algebras, automorphism groups, crossed products and decomposition theory, we formulate first steps of a non-commutative version of probability theory and introduce non-abelian analogues of stochastic processes and martingales. The central objects are a von Neumann algebra \Ma and a compact group \Gr acting on \Ma, for which we give in three consecutive steps, i.e. for inner, spatial and general automorphism groups one-to-one correspondences between subgroups of \Gr and von Neumann subalgebras of \Ma. Furthermore, we identify non-abelian martingales in our approach and prove for them a convergence theorem.
