Given a separable unital C*-algebra A, let E denote the Banach-space completion of the A-valued Schwartz space on Rn with norm induced by the A-valued inner product <f,g>=\int f(x)^*g(x) dx. The assignment of the pseudodifferential operator B=b(x,D) with A-valued symbol b(x,\xi) to each smooth function with bounded derivatives b defines an injective mapping O, from the set of all such symbols to the set of all operators with smooth orbit under the canonical action of the Heisenberg group on the algebra of all adjointable operators on the Hilbert module E. It is known that O is surjective if A is commutative. In this paper, we show that, if O is surjective for A, then it is also surjective for the algebra of k-by-k matrices with entries in A.
