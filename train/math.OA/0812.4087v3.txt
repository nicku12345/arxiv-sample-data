We present examples of non-Hausdorff, etale, essentially principal groupoids for which three results, known to hold in the Hausdorff case, fail. These results are: (A) the subalgebra of continuous functions on the unit space is maximal abelian within the reduced groupoid C*-algebra, (B) every nonzero ideal of the reduced groupoid C*-algebra has a nonzero intersection with the subalgebra of continuous functions on the unit space, and (C) the open support of a normalizer is a bissection.
