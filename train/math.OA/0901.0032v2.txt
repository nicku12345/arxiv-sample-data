We define the notion of a \Lambda-system of C^*-correspondences associated to a higher-rank graph \Lambda. Roughly speaking, such a system assigns to each vertex of \Lambda a C^*-algebra, and to each path in \Lambda a C^*-correspondence in a way which carries compositions of paths to balanced tensor products of C^*-correspondences. Under some simplifying assumptions, we use Fowler's technology of Cuntz-Pimsner algebras for product systems of C^*-correspondences to associate a C^*-algebra to each \Lambda-system. We then construct a Fell bundle over the path groupoid \Gg_\Lambda and show that the C^*-algebra of the \Lambda-system coincides with the reduced cross-sectional algebra of the Fell bundle. We conclude by discussing several examples of our construction arising in the literature.
