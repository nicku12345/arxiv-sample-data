We give entropy estimates for two canonical non commutative shifts on C^*-algebras associated to some topological graphs E=(E^0,E^1,s,r), defined using a basis of the corresponding Hilbert bimodule H(E). We compare their entropies with the growth entropies associated directly to the topological graph. We illustrate with some examples of topological graphs considered by Katsura, where the vertex and the edge spaces are a union of unit circles and more detailed computations can be done.
