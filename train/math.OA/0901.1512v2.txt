Given a separable Banach space E, we construct an extremely non-complex Banach space (i.e. a space satisfying that \|Id + T^2\|=1+\|T^2\| for every bounded linear operator T on it) whose dual contains E^* as an L-summand. We also study surjective isometries on extremely non-complex Banach spaces and construct an example of a real Banach space whose group of surjective isometries reduces to \pm Id, but the group of surjective isometries of its dual contains the group of isometries of a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space as a subgroup.
