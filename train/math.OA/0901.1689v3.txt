This paper is based on talks delivered in summer 2008 at the Conference on Motives, QFT and Pseudodifferential Operators in Boston, and at the Trimester programme Geometry and Physics, Hausdorff Institute for Mathematics in Bonn   The paper surveys the pseudodifferential calculus with parameter, resolvent expansions, Dixmier trace, noncommutative residue, Kontsevich-Vishik canonical trace as well some aspects of regularized integrals on spaces of symbols.
