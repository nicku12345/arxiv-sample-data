We get three types of results on measure equivalence rigidity; direct product groups of Ozawa's class \mathcal{S} groups, wreath product groups and amalgamated free products. We prove measure equivalence factorization results on direct product groups of Ozawa's class \mathcal{S} groups. As consequences, Monod--Shalom type orbit equivalence rigidity theorems follow. We prove that if two wreath product groups A \wr G, B \wr \Gamma of non-amenable exact direct product groups G, \Gamma with amenable bases A, B are measure equivalent, then G and \Gamma are measure equivalent. We get Bass--Serre rigidity results on amalgamated free products of non-amenable exact direct product groups.
