We give examples of non-amenable ICC groups \Gamma with the Haagerup property, weakly amenable with constant \Lambda_{\cb}(\Gamma) = 1, for which we show that the associated {\rm II_1} factors L(\Gamma) are strongly solid, i.e. the normalizer of any diffuse amenable subalgebra P \subset L(\Gamma) generates an amenable von Neumann algebra. Nevertheless, for these examples of groups \Gamma, L(\Gamma) is not isomorphic to any interpolated free group factor L(\F_t), for 1 < t \leq \infty.
