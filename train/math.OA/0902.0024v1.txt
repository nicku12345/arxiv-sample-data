Let A be a unital separable simple infinite dimensional \CA with tracial rank no more than one and with the tracial state space T(A) and let U(A) be the unitary group of A. Suppose that u\in U_0(A), the connected component of U(A) containing the identity.   We show that, for any \ep>0, there exists a selfadjoint element h\in A_{s.a} such that  \|u-\exp(ih)\|<\ep.  We also study the problem when u can be approximated by unitaries in A with finite spectrum.   Denote by CU(A) the closure of the subgroup of unitary group of U(A) generated by its commutators. It is known that CU(A)\subset U_0(A). Denote by \widehat{a} the affine function on T(A) defined by \widehat{a}(\tau)=\tau(a). We show that u can be approximated by unitaries in A with finite spectrum if and only if u\in CU(A) and \widehat{u^n+(u^n)^*},i(\widehat{u^n-(u^n)^*})\in \overline{\rho_A(K_0(A)} for all n\ge 1. Examples are given that there are unitaries in CU(A) which can not be approximated by unitaries with finite spectrum. Significantly these results are obtained in the absence of amenability.
