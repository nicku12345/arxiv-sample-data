We generalize Loewner's method for proving that matrix monotone functions are operator monotone. The relation x \leq y on bounded operators is our model for a definition for C*-relations of being residually finite dimensional.   Our main result is a meta-theorem about theorems involving relations on bounded operators. If we can show there are residually finite dimensional relations involved, and verify a technical condition, then such a theorem will follow from its restriction to matrices.   Applications are shown regarding norms of exponentials, the norms of commutators and "positive" noncommutative *-polynomials.
