Noncommutative domain algebras were introduced by Popescu as the non-selfadjoint operator algebras generated by weighted shifts on the Full Fock space. This paper uses results from several complex variables to classify many noncommutative domain algebras, and it uses results from operator theory to obtain new bounded domains in hermitian spaces with non-compact automorphic group.
