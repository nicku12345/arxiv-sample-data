We prove that for q not a nontrivial root of unity any symmetric invariant 2-cocycle for a completion of Uq(g) is the coboundary of a central element. Equivalently, a Drinfeld twist relating the coproducts on completions of Uq(g) and U(g) is unique up to coboundary of a central element. As an application we show that the spectral triple we defined in an earlier paper for the q-deformation of a simply connected semisimple compact Lie group G does not depend on any choices up to unitary equivalence.
