Let A be a stably finite simple unital C^*-algebra and suppose \alpha  is an action of a finite group G with the tracial Rokhlin property. Suppose further A has real rank zero and the order on projections over A is determined by traces. Then the crossed product C^*-algebra C^*(G,A, \alpha) also has real rank zero and order on projections over A is determined by traces. Moreover, if A also has stable rank one, then C^*(G,A, \alpha) also has stable rank one.
