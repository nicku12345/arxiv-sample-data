We give a short answer to the question in the title: {\em dendrits}. Precisely we show that the C^{\ast}-algebra C(X) of all complex-valued continuous functions on a compactum X is projective in the category {\mathcal C}^{1} of all (not necessarily commutative) unital C^{\ast}-algebras if and only if X is an absolute retract of dimension \dim X \leq 1 or, equivalently, that X is a dendrit.
