In this article we survey some of the recent goings-on in the classification programme of C^*-algebras, following the interesting link found between the Cuntz semigroup and the classical Elliott invariant and the fact that the Elliott conjecture does not hold at its boldest. We review the construction of this object both by means of positive elements and via its recent interpretation using countably generated Hilbert modules (due to Coward, Elliott and Ivanescu). The passage from one picture to another is presented with full, concise, proofs. We indicate the potential role of the Cuntz semigroup in future classification results, particularly for non-simple algebras.
