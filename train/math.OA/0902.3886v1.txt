It is shown that a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra is of real rank zero and absorbs the Jiang-Su algebra if it contains a nontrivial projection. We also consider cases where the UCT is automatic for strongly self-absorbing C*-algebras, and K-theoretical ways of characterizing when Kirchberg algebras are strongly self-absorbing.
