We describe some of the forms of freeness of group actions on noncommutative C*-algebras that have been used, with emphasis on actions of finite groups. We give some indications of their strengths, weaknesses, applications, and relationships to each other. The properties discussed include the Rokhlin property, K-theoretic freeness, the tracial Rokhlin property, pointwise outerness, saturation, hereditary saturation, and the requirement that the strong Connes spectrum be the entire dual.
