Let \mathcal A be a von Neumann algebra and \mathcal M be a Banach \mathcal A-module. It is shown that for every homomorphisms \sigma, \tau on \mathcal A, every bounded linear map f:\mathcal A\to \mathcal M with property that f(p^2)=\sigma(p)f(p)+f(p)\tau(p) for every projection p in \mathcal A is a (\sigma,\tau)-derivation. Also, it is shown that a bounded linear map f:\mathcal A \to \mathcal M  which satisfies f(ab)= \sigma(a)f(b)+f(a)\tau(b) for all a,b\in \mathcal A with ab=S, is a (\sigma,\tau)- derivation if \tau(S) is left invertible for fixed S.
