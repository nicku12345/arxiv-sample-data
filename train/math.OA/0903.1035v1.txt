We give a general formula for the equivariant complex K-theory K_G^*(V) of a finite dimensional real linear space V equipped with a linear action of a compact group G in terms of the representation theory of a certain double cover of G. Using this general formula, we give explicit computations in various interesting special cases. In particular, as an application we obtain explicit formulas for the K-theory of C_r^*(GL(n,\RR)), the reduced group C*-algebra of GL(n,\RR).
