We give a general scheme for constructing faithful actions of genuine (noncommutative as C^* algebra) compact quantum groups on classical topological spaces. Using this, we show that: (i) a compact connected classical space can have a faithful action by a genuine compact quantum group, and (ii) there exists a spectral triple on a classical connected compact space for which the quantum group of orientation and volume preserving isometries (in the sense of \cite{qorient}) is a genuine quantum group.
