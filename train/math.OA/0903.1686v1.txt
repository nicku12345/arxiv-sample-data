We compute the Hochschild homology of the free orthogonal quantum group A_o(n). We show that it satisfies Poincar\'e duality and should be considered to be a 3-dimensional object. We then use recent results of R. Vergnioux to derive results about the \ell^2-homology of A_o(n) and estimates on the free entropy dimension of its set of generators. In particular, we show that the \ell^2 Betti-numbers of A_o(n) all vanish and that the free entropy dimension is less than 1.
