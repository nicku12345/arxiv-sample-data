We continue here the study of free extreme values begun in Ben Arous and Voiculescu (2006). We study the convergence of the free point processes associated with free extreme values to a free Poisson random measure (Voiculescu (1998), Barndorff-Nielsen and Thorbjornsen (2005)). We relate this convergence to the free extremal laws introduced in Ben Arous and Voiculescu (2006) and give the limit laws for free order statistics.
