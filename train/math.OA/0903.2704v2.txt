We give a lower bound for the numerical index of the real space L_p(\mu) showing, in particular, that it is non-zero for p\neq 2. In other words, it is shown that for every bounded linear operator T on the real space L_p(\mu), one has  \sup{\Bigl|\int |x|^{p-1}\sign(x) T x d\mu \Bigr| : x\in L_p(\mu), \|x\|=1} \geq \frac{M_p}{12\e}\|T\|  where M_p=\max_{t\in[0,1]}\frac{|t^{p-1}-t|}{1+t^p}>0 for every p\neq 2. It is also shown that for every bounded linear operator T on the real space L_p(\mu), one has  \sup{\int |x|^{p-1}|Tx| d\mu : x\in L_p(\mu), \|x\|=1} \geq \frac{1}{2\e}\|T\|.
