In this paper we investigate a *-algebra \cX of fractions associated with a unital complex *-algebra \cA. The algebra \cX and its Hilbert space representations are used to prove abstract noncommutative strict Positivstellens\"atze for \cA. Multi-grading of \cA are studied as technical tools to verify the assumptions of this theorem.   As applications we obtain new strict Positivstellens\"atze for the Weyl algebra and for the Lie algebra \cg of the affine group of the real line. We characterize integrable representations of the Lie algebra \cg in terms of resolvents of the generators and derive a new integrability criterion for representations of \cg.
