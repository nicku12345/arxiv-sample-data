In this paper we give an analytic interpretation of free convolution of type B, introduced by Biane, Goodman and Nica, and provide a new formula for its computation. This formula allows us to show that free additive convolution of type B is essentially a re-casting of conditionally free convolution. We put in evidence several aspects of this operation, the most significant being its apparition as an 'intertwiner' between derivation and free convolution of type A. We also show connections between several limit theorems in type A and type B free probability. Moreover, we show that the analytical picture fits very well with the idea of considering type B random variables as infinitesimal deformations to ordinary non-commutative random variables.
