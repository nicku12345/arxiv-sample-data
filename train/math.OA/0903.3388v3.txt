Given a saturated Fell bundle A over an inverse semigroup S which is semi-abelian in the sense that the fibers over the idempotents of S are commutative, we construct a twisted etale groupoid L such that A can be recovered from L in a canonical way. As an application we recover most of Renault's recent result on the classification of Cartan subalgebras of C*-algebras through twisted etale groupoids.
