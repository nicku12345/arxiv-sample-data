In this last article of the series on outer actions of a countable dicrete amenable group on AFD factors, we analyze outer actions of a countable discrete free abelian group on an AFD factor of type \text{III}_\lambda, 0<\lambda< 1, and compute outer conjugacy invariants. As a byproduct, we discover the asymmetrization technique for coboundary condition on a \Bbb T-valued cocycle of a torsion free abelian group, which might have been known by the group cohomologists. As the asymmetrization technique gives us a very handy criteria for coboundaries, we present it here in detail in the second section.
