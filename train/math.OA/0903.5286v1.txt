Let G be a countable abelian group. We construct a unital simple projectionless C*-algebra A with a unique tracial state, that satisfies (K_0(A), [1_A]) \cong (\Z, 1) , K_1(A) \cong G, absorbs the Jiang-Su algebra tensorially, and that is obtained as the inductive limit C*-algebra of a sequence of dimension drop algebras of a specific form. This construction is based on the construction of the Jiang-Su algebra. By this construction, we show a certain conjugacy result for aperiodic automorphisms of these projectionless C*-algebras. We also show that an automorphism of this projectoinless C*-algebra has a certain aperiodicity up to the weakly inner automorphisms in the tracial representation if and only if it has a kind of Rohlin property, which leads to the Rohlin property after taking tensor product of certain C*-algebras of real rank zero.
