We present other examples illustrating the operator-theoretic approach to invariant integrals on quantum homogeneous spaces developed by Kuersten and the second author. The quantum spaces are chosen such that their coordinate algebras do not admit bounded Hilbert space representations and their self-adjoint generators have continuous spectrum. Operator algebras of trace class operators are associated to the coordinate algebras which allow interpretations as rapidly decreasing functions and as finite functions. The invariant integral is defined as a trace functional which generalizes the well-known quantum trace. We argue that previous algebraic methods would fail for these examples.
