Using an extension of techniques of Ozawa and Popa, we give an example of a non-amenable strongly solid \rm{II}_1 factor M containing an "exotic" maximal abelian subalgebra A: as an A,A-bimodule, L^2(M) is neither coarse nor discrete. Thus we show that there exist \rm{II}_1 factors with such property but without Cartan subalgebras. It also follows from Voiculescu's free entropy results that M is not an interpolated free group factor, yet it is strongly solid and has both the Haagerup property and the complete metric approximation property.
