Assume that \phi_1 and \phi_2 are automorphisms of the non-commutative disc algebra \fA_n, n \geq 2. We show that the semicrossed products \fA_n \times_{\phi_1} \bZ^+ and \fA_n \times_{\phi_2} \bZ^+ are isomorphic as algebras if and only if \phi_1 and \phi_2 are conjugate via an automorphism of \fA_n. A similar result holds for semicrossed products of the d-shift algebra \A_d, d \geq 2.
