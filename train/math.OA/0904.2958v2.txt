Consider real symmetric, complex Hermitian Toeplitz and real symmetric Hankel band matrix models, where the bandwidth b_{N}\ra \iy but b_{N}/N \to b, b\in [0,1] as N\to \infty. We prove that the distributions of eigenvalues converge weakly to universal, symmetric distributions \gamma_{_{T}}(b) and \gamma_{_{H}}(b). In the case b>0 or b=0 but with the addition of b_{N}\geq C N^{{1/2}+\epsilon_{0}} for some positive constants \epsilon_{0} and C, we prove almost sure convergence. The even moments of these distributions are the sum of some integrals related to certain pair partitions. In particular, when the bandwidth grows slowly, i.e. b=0, \gamma_{_{T}}(0) is the standard Gaussian distribution and \gamma_{_{H}}(0) is the distribution |x| \exp(-x^{2}). In addition, from the fourth moments we know that the \gamma_{_{T}}(b)'s are different for different b's, the \gamma_{_{H}}(b)'s different for different b\in [0,{1/2}] and the \gamma_{_{H}}(b)'s different for different b\in [{1/2},1].
