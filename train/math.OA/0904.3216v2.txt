For C^*-algebras A_1, A_2 the map (I_1,I_2)\to ker(q_{I_1}\otimes q_{I_2}) from Id^{\prime}(A_1)\times Id^{\prime}(A_2) into Id^{\prime}(A_1\otimes_{\mathrm{min}} A_2) is a homeomorphism onto its image which is dense in the range. Here, for a C^*-algebra A, the space of all proper closed two sided ideals endowed with an adequate topology is denoted Id^{\prime}(A) and q_I is the quotient map of A onto A/I. New proofs of the equivalence of the property (F) of Tomiyama for A_1\otimes_{\mathrm{min}} A_2 with certain other properties are presented.
