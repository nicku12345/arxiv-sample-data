We construct dense, unconditional subalgebras of the reduced group C^*-algebra of a word-hyperbolic group, which are closed under holomorphic functional calculus and possess many bounded traces. Applications to the cyclic cohomology of group C^*-algebras and to delocalized L^2-invariants of negatively curved manifolds are given.
