Let A be a Banach algebra with the second dual A^{**}.   If A has a bounded approximate identity (=BAI), then A^{**} is unital if and only if A^{**} has a   weak^* bounded approximate identity(=W^*BAI). If A is Arens regular and A \noindent has a   BAI, then A^* factors on both sides.   In this paper we introduce new concepts LW^*W and RW^*W- property and we show that under certain conditions if A has LW^*W and RW^*W- property, then A is Arens regular and also if A is Arens regular, then A has LW^*W and RW^*W- property. We also offer some applications of these new concepts for the special algebras l^1(G), L^1(G), M(G), and A(G).
