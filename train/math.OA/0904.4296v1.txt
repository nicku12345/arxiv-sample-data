Let {\cal O}_{*} be the C^{*}-algebra defined as the direct sum of all Cuntz algebras. Then {\cal O}_{*} has a non-cocommutative comultiplication \Delta_{\phi} and a counit \epsilon. Let {\rm BI}({\cal O}_{*}) denote the set of all closed biideals of the C^{*}-bialgebra ({\cal O}_{*},\Delta_{\phi},\epsilon) and let {\cal P}({\bf P}) denote the power set of the set of all prime numbers. We show a one-to-one correspondence between {\rm BI}({\cal O}_{*}) and {\cal P}({\bf P}). Furthermore, we show that for any {\cal I} in {\rm BI}({\cal O}_{*}), there exists a C^{*}-subbialgebra {\cal B}_{{\cal I}} of {\cal O}_{*} such that {\cal O}_{*}={\cal B}_{{\cal I}}\oplus {\cal I}, and the set of all such C^{*}-subbialgebras is a lattice with respect to the natural operations among C^{*}-subbialgebras, which is isomorphic to the lattice {\cal P}({\bf P}).
