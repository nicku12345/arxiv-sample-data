We introduce and study two new examples of noncommutative spheres: the half-liberated sphere, and the free sphere. Together with the usual sphere, these two spheres have the property that the corresponding quantum isometry group is "easy", in the representation theory sense. We present as well some general comments on the axiomatization problem, and on the "untwisted" and "non-easy" case.
