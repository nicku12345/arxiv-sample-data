We prove two new reverse Cauchy--Schwarz inequalities of additive and multiplicative types in a space equipped with a positive sesquilinear form with values in a C*-algebra. We apply our results to get some norm and integral inequalities. As a consequence, we improve a celebrated reverse Cauchy--Schwarz inequality due to G Polya and G. Szego.
