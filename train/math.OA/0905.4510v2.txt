Suppose that \phi and \psi are smooth complex-valued functions on the circle that are invertible, have winding number zero with respect to the origin, and have meromorphic extensions to an open neighborhood of the closed unit disk. Let T_\phi and T_\psi denote the Toeplitz operators with symbols \phi and \psi respectively. We give an explicit formula for the determinant of T_\phi T_\psi T_\phi^{-1} T_\psi^{-1} in terms of the products of the tame symbols of \phi and \psi on the open unit disk.
