Analogues for Hilbert C*-modules of classical results of Fourier series theory in Hilbert spaces are considered. Relations between different properties of orthogonal and orthonormal systems for Hilbert C*-modules are studied with special attention paid on the differences with the well-known Hilbert space situation.
