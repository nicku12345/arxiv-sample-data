Over the last 25 years, the notion of "fuzzy spaces" has become ubiquitous in the high-energy physics literature. These are finite dimensional noncommutative approximations of the algebra of functions on a classical space. The most well known examples come from the Berezin quantization of coadjoint orbits of compact semisimple Lie groups.   We develop a theory of Berezin quantization for certain quantum homogeneous spaces coming from ergodic actions of compact quantum groups. This allows us to construct fuzzy versions of these quantum homogeneous spaces. We show that the finite dimensional approximations converge to the homogeneous space in a continuous field of operator systems, and in the quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance of Rieffel.   We apply the theory to construct a fuzzy version of an ellipsoid which is naturally endowed with an orbifold structure, as well as a fuzzy version of the \theta-deformed coset spaces C(G/H)_{\hbar \theta} of Varilly. In the process of the latter, we show that our Berezin quantization commutes with Rieffel's deformation quantization for actions of \R^d.
