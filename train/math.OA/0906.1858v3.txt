Based on the Archimedeanization developed by Paulsen and Tomforde, we give an explicit description for the positive cones of maximal tensor products of function systems. From this description, we obtain an approximation theorem for nuclear maps between function systems. As an application, we give elementary proofs on several characterizations of nuclear function systems that are already known.
