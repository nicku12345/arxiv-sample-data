We investigate C^*-algebras associated with row-finite topological higher-rank graphs with no source, which are based on product system C^*-algebras. We prove the Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem, and provide the condition of simplicity and purely infiniteness of our algebras. We give examples of non-discrete topological higher-rank graphs whose C^*-algebras contain Cuntz's ax+b-semigroup C^*-algebra over \mathbb{N}.
