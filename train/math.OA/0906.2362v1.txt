We show that idempotent states on finite quantum groups correspond to pre-subgroups in the sense of Baaj, Blanchard, and Skandalis. It follows that the lattices formed by the idempotent states on a finite quantum group and by its coidalgebras are isomorphic. We show furthermore that these lattices are also isomorphic for compact quantum groups, if one restricts to expected coidalgebras.
