The direct sum {\cal O}_{*} of all Cuntz algebras has a non-cocommutative comultiplication \Delta_{\varphi} such that there exists no antipode of any dense subbialgebra of the C^{*}-bialgebra ({\cal O}_{*},\Delta_{\varphi}).   From states equations of {\cal O}_{*} with respect to the tensor product, we construct an operator W for ({\cal O}_{*},\Delta_{\varphi}) such that W^{*} is an isometry, W(x\otimes I)W^{*}=\Delta_{\varphi}(x) for each x\in {\cal O}_{*} and W satisfies the pentagon equation.
