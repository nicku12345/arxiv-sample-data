Let \phi:M_n\to B(H) be an injective, completely positive contraction with \V\phi^{-1}:\phi(M_n)\to M_n\V_{cb}\leq1+\delta(\epsilon). We show that if either (i) \phi(M_n) is faithful modulo the compact operators or (ii) \phi(M_n) approximately contains a rank 1 projection, then there is a complete order embedding \psi:M_n\to B(H) with \V\phi-\psi\V_{cb}<\epsilon. We also give examples showing that such a perturbation does not exist in general. As an application, we show that every C^*-algebra A with \mathcal{OL}_\infty(A)=1 and a finite separating family of primitive ideals is a strong NF algebra, providing a partial answer to a question of Junge, Ozawa and Ruan.
