For a directed graph E, we compute the K-theory of the C^*-algebra C^*(E) from the Cuntz-Krieger generators and relations. First we compute the K-theory of the crossed product C^*(E)\times_\gamma\IT, and then using duality and the Pimsner-Voiculescu exact sequence we compute the K-theory of C^*(E)\otimes\CK \cong (C^*(E)\times\IT)\times\IZ. The method relies on the decomposition of C^*(E) as an inductive limit of Toeplitz graph C^*-algebras, indexed by the finite subgraphs of E. The proof and result require no special asssumptions about the graph, and is given in graph-theoretic terms. This can be helpful if the graph is described by pictures rather than by a matrix.
