A subproduct system of two-dimensional Hilbert spaces can generate an Arveson system of type I1 only. All possible cases are classified up to isomorphism. This work is triggered by a question of Bhat: can a subproduct system of n-dimensional Hilbert spaces generate an Arveson system of type II or III? The question is still open for n=3,4,...
