We introduce and analyse the structure of C*-algebras arising from ideals in right tensor C*-precategories, which naturally generalize both relative Cuntz-Pimsner and Doplicher-Roberts algebras. We establish an explicit intrinsic construction of the considered algebras and a number of key results such as structure theorem, gauge-invariant uniqueness theorem or description of the gauge-invariant ideal structure. In particular, these statements give a new insight into the corresponding results for relative Cuntz-Pimsner algebras and are applied to Doplicher-Roberts associated to C*-correspondences.
