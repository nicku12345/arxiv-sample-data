The following result is proven. Let G_1 \cc^{T_1} (X_1,\mu_1) and G_2 \cc^{T_2} (X_2,\mu_2) be orbit-equivalent, essentially free, probability measure preserving actions of countable groups G_1 and G_2. Let H be any countable group. For i=1,2, let \Gamma_i = G_i *H be the free product. Then the actions of \Gamma_1 and \Gamma_2 coinduced from T_1 and T_2 are orbit-equivalent. As an application, it is shown that if \Gamma is a free group, then all nontrivial Bernoulli shifts over \Gamma are orbit-equivalent.
