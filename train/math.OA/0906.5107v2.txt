For a Banach algebra A with a bounded approximate identity, we investigate the A-module homomorphisms of certain introverted subspaces of A^*, and show that all A-module homomorphisms of A^* are normal if and only if A is an ideal of A^{**}. We obtain some characterizations of compactness and discreteness for a locally compact quantum group \G. Furthermore, in the co-amenable case we prove that the multiplier algebra of \LL can be identified with \MG. As a consequence, we prove that \G is compact if and only if \LUC={\rm WAP}(\G) and \MG\cong\mathcal{Z}({\rm LUC}(\G)^*); which partially answer a problem raised by Volker Runde.
