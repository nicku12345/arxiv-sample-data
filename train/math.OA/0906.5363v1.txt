We consider the following three properties for countable discrete groups \Gamma: (1) \Gamma has an infinite subgroup with relative property (T), (2) the group von Neumann algebra L\Gamma has a diffuse von Neumann subalgebra with relative property (T) and (3) \Gamma does not have Haagerup's property. It is clear that (1) \Longrightarrow (2) \Longrightarrow (3). We prove that both of the converses are false.
