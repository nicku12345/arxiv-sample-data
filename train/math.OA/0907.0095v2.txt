Here we generalize the concept of spatial tensor product, introduced by Skeide, of two product systems via a pair of normalized units. This new notion is called amalgamated tensor product of product systems, and now the amalgamation can be done using a contractive morphism. Index of amalgamation product (when done through units) adds up for normalized units but for non-normalized units, the index is one more than the sum. We define inclusion systems and use it as a tool for index computations. It is expected that this notion will have other uses.
