In this paper, we study the Yang-Mills functional on quantum Heisenberg manifolds using the appratuses developed by A. Connes and M. Rieffel. It is discovered that a connection on a projective module over a quantum Heisenberg manifold is a minimum of Yang-Mills functional whicih is a critical point that is different with critical points found by S. Kang.
