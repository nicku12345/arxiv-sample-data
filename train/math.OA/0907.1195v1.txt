This paper is concerned with derivations in algebras of (unbounded) operators affiliated with a von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M}. Let \mathcal{% A} be one of the algebras of measurable operators, locally measurable operators or, \tau -measurable operators. We present a complete description of von Neumann algebras \mathcal{M} of type I in terms of their central projections such that every derivation in \mathcal{A} is inner. It is also shown that every derivation in the algebra LS(\mathcal{M}) of all locally measurable operators with respect to a properly infinite von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M} vanishes on the center of LS(\mathcal{M}).
