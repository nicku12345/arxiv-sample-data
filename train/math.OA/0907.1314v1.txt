We consider von Neumann algebras generated by the stationary laws of free stochastic differential equations of the form dX_t = dS_t -1/2 DV(X_t) for a suitably convex multivariate noncommutative polynomial V. Using techniques of Guionnet and Shlyakhtenko, we prove that these von Neumann algebras have property AO of Ozawa and are thus solid.
