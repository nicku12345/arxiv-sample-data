We show that the KMS_beta-states of Bost-Connes type systems for number fields in the region 0<beta\le 1, as well as of the Connes-Marcolli GL_2-system for 1<beta\le 2, have type III_1. This is equivalent to ergodicity of various actions on adelic spaces. For example, the case beta=2 of the GL_2-system corresponds to ergodicity of the action of GL_2(Q) on Mat_2(A) with its Haar measure.
