A new construction method of R-matrix is given. Let A be a C^{*}-bialgebra with a comultiplication \Delta. For two states \omega and \psi of A which satisfy certain conditions, we construct a unitary R-matrix R(\omega,\psi) of the C^{*}-bialgebra (A,\Delta) on the tensor product of GNS representation spaces associated with \omega and \psi. The set \{R(\omega,\psi):\omega,\psi\} satisfies a kind of Yang-Baxter equation. Furthermore, we show a nontrivial example of such R-matrices for a non-quasi-cocommutative C^{*}-bialgebra.
