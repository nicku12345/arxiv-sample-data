We continue the study of r-ideals, l-ideals, and HSA's in operator algebras. Some applications are made to the structure of operator algebras, including Wedderburn type theorems for a class of operator algebras. We also consider the one-sided M-ideal structure of certain tensor products of operator algebras.
