We show that, if E is a Banach space with a basis satisfying a certain condition, then the Banach algebra \ell^\infty({\cal K}(\ell^2 \oplus E)) is not amenable; in particular, this is true for E = \ell^p with p \in (1,\infty). As a consequence, \ell^\infty({\cal K}(E)) is not amenable for any infinite-dimensional {\cal L}^p-space. This, in turn, entails the non-amenability of {\cal B}(\ell^p(E)) for any {\cal L}^p-space E, so that, in particular, {\cal B}(\ell^p) and {\cal B}(L^p[0,1]) are not amenable.
