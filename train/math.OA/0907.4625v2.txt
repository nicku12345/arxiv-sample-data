Previous work showed that every pair of nontrivial Bernoulli shifts over a fixed free group are orbit equivalent. In this paper, we prove that if G_1,G_2 are nonabelian free groups of finite rank then every nontrivial Bernoulli shift over G_1 is stably orbit equivalent to every nontrivial Bernoulli shift over G_2. This answers a question of S. Popa.
