We study the von Neumann algebra, generated by the regular representations of the infinite-dimensional nilpotent group B_0^{\mathbb Z}. In [14] a condition have been found on the measure for the right von Neumann algebra to be the commutant of the left one. In the present article, we prove that, in this case, the von Neumann algebra generated by the regular representations of group B_0^{\mathbb Z} is the type {\rm III}_1 hyperfinite factor. We use a technique, developed in [20] where a similar result was proved for the group B_0^{\mathbb N}. The crossed product allows us to remove some technical condition on the measure used in [20].
