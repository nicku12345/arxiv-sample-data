Given a w*-closed unital algebra A acting on H_0 and a contractive w*-continuous endomorphism \beta of A, there is a w*-closed (non-selfadjoint) unital algebra \mathbb{Z}_+\bar{\times}_\beta A acting on H_0\otimes\ell^2({\mathbb{Z}_+}), called the w*-semicrossed product of A with \beta. We prove that the w*-semicrossed product is a reflexive operator algebra provided A is reflexive and \beta is unitarily implemented, and that it has the bicommutant property if and only if so does A. Also, we show that the w*-semicrossed product generated by a commutative C*-algebra and a *-endomorphism is reflexive.
