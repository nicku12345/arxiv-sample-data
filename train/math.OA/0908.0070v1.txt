Let A,B be two unital C^*-algebras. We prove that every almost unital almost linear mapping h:A\longrightarrow B which satisfies h(3^nuy+3^nyu) = h(3^nu)h(y)+h(y)h(3^nu) for all u\in U(A), all y\in A, and all n = 0, 1, 2,..., is a Jordan homomorphism. Also, for a unital C^*-algebra A of real rank zero, every almost unital almost linear continuous mapping h:A\longrightarrow B is a Jordan homomorphism when h(3^nuy+3^nyu) = h(3^nu)h(y)+h(y)h(3^nu) holds for all u\in I_1(A_{sa}), all y\in A, and all n = 0, 1, 2,... ~. Furthermore, we investigate the Hyers--Ulam--Rassias stability of Jordan *-homomorphisms between unital C^*-algebras by using the fixed points methods.
