For projectionless C*-algebras absorbing the Jiang-Su algebra tensorially, we study a kind of the Rohlin property for autmorphisms. We show that the crossed products obtained by automorphisms with this Rohlin property also absorb the Jiang-Su algebra tensorially under a mild technical condition on the C*-algebras.   In particular, for the Jiang-Su algebra we show the uniqueness up to outer conjugacy of the automorphism with this Rohlin property.
