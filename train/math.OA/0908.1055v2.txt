In this paper we show how to produce a large number of representations of a graph C*-algebra in the space of the bounded linear operators in L^2(X,\mu). These representations are very concrete and, in the case of graphs that satisfy condition (K), we use our techniques to realize the associated graph C*-algebra as a subalgebra of the bounded operators in L^2(R). We also show how to describe some Perron-Frobenius operators in L^1(X,\mu), in terms of the representations we associate to a graph.
