We first describe a Rieffel induction system for groupoid crossed products. We then use this induction system to show that, given a regular groupoid G and a dynamical system (A,G,\alpha), every irreducible representation of A\rtimes G is induced from a representation of the group crossed product A(u)\rtimes S_u where u\in G\unit, A(u) is a fibre of A, and S_u is a stabilizer subgroup of G.
