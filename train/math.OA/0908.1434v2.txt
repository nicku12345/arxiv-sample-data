We prove that given a regular groupoid G whose isotropy subgroupoid S has a Haar system, along with a dynamical system (A,G,\alpha), there is an action of G on the spectrum of A\rtimes S such that the spectrum of A\rtimes G is homeomorphic to the orbit space of this action via induction. In addition, we give a strengthening of these results in the case where the crossed product is a groupoid algebra.
