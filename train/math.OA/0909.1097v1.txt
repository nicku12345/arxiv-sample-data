The operator L_\mu: f \mapsto \int \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} d\mu(y) is, for a compactly supported measure \mu with an L^3 density, a closed, densely defined operator on L^2(\mu). We show that the operator Q = p L_\mu^2 - q L_\mu has polynomial eigenfunctions if and only if \mu is a free Meixner distribution. The only time Q has orthogonal polynomial eigenfunctions is if \mu is a semicircular distribution. More generally, the only time the operator p (L_\nu L_\mu) - q L_\mu has orthogonal polynomial eigenfunctions is when \mu and \nu are related by a Jacobi shift.
