Mimicking a recent article of Stefaan Vaes, in which was proved that every locally compact quantum group can act outerly, we prove that we get the same result for measured quantum groupoids, with an appropriate definition of outer actions of measured quantum groupoids. This result is used to show that every measured quantum groupoid can be found from some depth 2 inclusion of von Neumann algebras.
