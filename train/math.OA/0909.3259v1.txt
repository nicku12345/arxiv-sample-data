We show that if \AA is a Fell bundle over a locally compact group G, then there is a natural coaction \delta of G on the Fell-bundle C^*-algebra C^*(G,\AA) such that if \hat{\delta} is the dual action of G on the crossed product C^*(G,\AA) \rtimes_{\delta} G, then the full crossed product (C^*(G,\AA) \rtimes_{\delta}G)\rtimes_{\hat{\delta}}G is canonically isomorphic to C^*(G,\AA) \otimes\KK(L^2(G)). Hence the coaction \delta is maximal.
