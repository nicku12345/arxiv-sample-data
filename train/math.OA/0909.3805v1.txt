Let A be a unital C^*-algebra. Its unitary group, UA, contains a wealth of topological information about A. However, the homotopy type of UA is out of reach even for A = M_2(\CC). There are two simplifications which have been considered. The first, well-traveled road, is to pass to \pi_*(U(A\otimes \KK )) which is isomorphic (with a degree shift) to K_*(A). This approach has led to spectacular success in many arenas, as is well-known.   A different approach is to consider \pi_*(UA)\otimes\QQ , the rational homotopy of UA. In joint work with G. Lupton and N. C. Phillips we have calculated this functor for the cases A = C(X)\otimes M_n(\CC) and A a unital continuous trace C^*-algebra. In this note we look at some concrete examples of this calculation and, in particular, at the \ZZ-graded map \[ \pi _*(UA)\otimes\QQ \longrightarrow K_{*+1}(A)\otimes\QQ . \]
