The stabilization theorem for A-Hilbert modules was established by G. G. Kasparov. The equivariant version, in which a locally compact group H acts properly on a locally compact space Y, was proved by N. C. Phillips. This equivariant theorem involves the Hilbert (H,C_{0}(Y))-module C_{0}(Y,L^{2}(H)^{\infty}). It can naturally be interpreted in terms of a stabilization theorem for proper groupoids, and the paper establishes this theorem within the general proper groupoid context. The theorem has applications in equivariant KK-theory and groupoid index theory.
