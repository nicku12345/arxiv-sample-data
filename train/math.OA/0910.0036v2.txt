We prove an index theorem for Toeplitz operators on irreducible tube--type domains and we extend our results to Toeplitz operators with matrix symbols. In order to prove our index theorem, we proved a result asserting that a non--vanishing function on the Shilov boundary of a tube--type bounded symmetric domain, not necessarily irreducible, is equal to a unimodular function defined as the product of powers of generic norms times an exponential function.
