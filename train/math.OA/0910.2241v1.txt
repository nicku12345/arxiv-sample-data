We consider II_1 factors M which can be realized as inductive limits of subfactors, N_n \nearrow M, having spectral gap in M and satisfying the bi-commutant condition (N_n'\cap M)'\cap M=N_n. Examples are the enveloping algebras associated to non-Gamma subfactors of finite depth, as well as certain crossed products of McDuff factors by amenable groups. We use deformation/rigidity techniques to obtain classification results for such factors.
