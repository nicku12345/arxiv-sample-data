Recently, M. Daws introduced a notion of co-representation of abelian Hopf--von Neumann algebras on general reflexive Banach spaces. In this note, we show that this notion cannot be extended beyond subhomogeneous Hopf--von Neumann algebras. The key is our observation that, for a von Neumann algebra \M and a reflexive operator space E, the normal spatial tensor product \M \bar{\tensor} \CB(E) is a Banach algebra if and only if \M is subhomogeneous or E is completely isomorphic to column Hilbert space.
