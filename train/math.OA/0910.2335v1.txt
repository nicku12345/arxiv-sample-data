Let A be a C^*-algebra. Let E and F be Hilbert A-modules with E being full. Suppose that \theta : E\to F is a linear map preserving orthogonality, i.e., <\theta(x), \theta(y) > = 0 whenever <x, y > = 0. We show in this article that if, in addition, A has real rank zero, and \theta is an A-module map (not assumed to be bounded), then there exists a central positive multiplier u\in M(A) such that <\theta(x), \theta(y) > = u < x, y> (x,y\in E). In the case when A is a standard C^*-algebra, or when A is a W^*-algebra containing no finite type II direct summand, we also obtain the same conclusion with the assumption of \theta being an A-module map weakened to being a local map.
