By considering spectral triples on S^{2}_{\mu, c} (c>0) constructed by Chakraborty and Pal (\cite{chak_pal}), we show that in general the quantum group of volume and orientation preserving isometries (in the sense of \cite{goswami2}) for a spectral triple of compact type may not have a C^*-action, and moreover, it can fail to be a matrix quantum group. It is also proved that the category with objects consisting of those volume and orientation preserving quantum isometries which induce C^*-action on the C^* algebra underlying the given spectral triple, may not have a universal object.
