In a recent paper of the first author and Kashyap, a new class of modules over dual operator algebras is introduced. These generalize the W*-modules (that is, Hilbert C*-modules over a von Neumann algebra which satisfy an analogue of the Riesz representation theorem for Hilbert spaces), which in turn generalize the theory of Hilbert spaces. In the present paper we give several new results about these modules.
