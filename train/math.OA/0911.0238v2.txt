We show that any countable subgroup of the multiplicative group \mathbb{R}_+^{\times} of positive real numbers can be realized as the fundamental group \mathcal{F}(A) of a separable simple unital C^*-algebra A with unique trace. Furthermore for any fixed countable subgroup G of \mathbb{R}_+^{\times}, there exist uncountably many mutually nonisomorphic such algebras A with G = \mathcal{F}(A).
