Coactions of Hopf C*-bimodules simultaneously generalize coactions of Hopf C*-algebras and actions of groupoids. Following an approach of Baaj and Skandalis, we construct reduced crossed products and establish a duality for fine coactions. Examples of coactions arise from Fell bundles on groupoids and actions of a groupoid on bundles of C*-algebras. Continuous Fell bundles on an etale groupoid correspond to coactions of the reduced groupoid algebra, and actions of a groupoid on a continuous bundle of C*-algebras correspond to coactions of the function algebra.
