Using an analogue of the Guionnet-Jones-Shlaykhtenko construction for graphs we show that their construction applied to any subfactor planar algebra of finite depth yields an inclusion of interpolated free group factors with finite parameter, thereby giving another proof of their universality for finite depth planar algebras.
