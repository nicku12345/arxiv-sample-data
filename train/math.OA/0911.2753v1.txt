Suppose that {\mathcal A} is an algebra, \sigma,\tau:{\mathcal A}\to{\mathcal A} are two linear mappings such that both \sigma({\mathcal A}) and \tau({\mathcal A}) are subalgebras of {\mathcal A} and {\mathcal X} is a \big(\tau({\mathcal A}),\sigma({\mathcal A})\big)-bimodule. A linear mapping D:{\mathcal A}\to {\mathcal X} is called a (\sigma,\tau)-derivation if D(ab)=D(a)\cdot\sigma(b)+\tau(a)\cdot D(b) (a,b\in {\mathcal A}). A (\sigma,\tau)-derivation D is called a (\sigma,\tau)-inner derivation if there exists an x\in{\mathcal X} such that D is of the form either D_x^-(a)=x\cdot \sigma(a)-\tau(a)\cdot x (a\in {\mathcal A}) or D_x^ +(a)=x\cdot \sigma(a)+\tau(a)\cdot x (a\in {\mathcal A}). A Banach algebra {\mathcal A} is called (\sigma,\tau)-amenable if every (\sigma,\tau)-derivation from {\mathcal A} into a dual Banach \big(\tau({\mathcal A}),\sigma({\mathcal A})\big)-bimodule is (\sigma,\tau)-inner. Studying some general algebraic aspects of (\sigma,\tau)-derivations, we investigate the relation between amenability and (\sigma,\tau)-amenability of Banach algebras in the case when \sigma, \tau are homomorphisms. We prove that if \mathfrak A is a C^*-algebra and \sigma, \tau are *-homomorphisms with \ker(\sigma)=\ker(\tau), then {\mathfrak A} is (\sigma, \tau)-amenable if and only if \sigma({\mathfrak A}) is amenable
