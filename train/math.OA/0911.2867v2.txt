Let \mathcal{A} be the class of unital separable simple amenable C*-algebras A which satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem for which A\otimes M_{\texttt{P}} has tracial rank zero for some supernatural number \texttt{p} of infinite type. Let A\in \mathcal{A} and let \alpha be an automorphism of A. Suppose that \alpha has the tracial Rokhlin property. Suppose also that there is an integer J\geq 1 such that [\alpha^J]=[\mbox{id}_A] in KL(A,A), we show that A\rtimes_{\alpha}\mathbb{Z}\in \mathcal{A}.
