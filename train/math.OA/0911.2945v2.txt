The connected stable rank and the general stable rank are homotopy invariants for Banach algebras, whereas the Bass stable rank and the topological stable rank should be thought of as dimensional invariants. This paper studies the two homotopical stable ranks, viz. their general properties as well as specific examples and computations. The picture that emerges is that of a strong affinity between the homotopical stable ranks, and a marked contrast with the dimensional ones.
