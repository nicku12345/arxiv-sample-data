We consider inclusions of type (P\otimes A)^G\subset(P\otimes B)^G, where G is a compact quantum group of Kac type acting on a {\rm II}_1 factor P, and on a Markov inclusion of finite dimensional C^*-algebras A\subset B. In the case [A,B]=0, which basically covers all known examples, we show that the planar algebra of such a subfactor is of the form P(A\subset B)^G, with G acting in some natural sense on the bipartite graph algebra P(A\subset B).
