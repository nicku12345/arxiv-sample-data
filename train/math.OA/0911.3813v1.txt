This investigation is devoted to the program to characterise continuous and variable discrete asymptotics of solutions to elliptic equations on a manifold with edge, continued in a cicle of forthcoming expositions [15], [16]. The structure of continuous and variable discrete (in general branch- ing) asymptotics is very complex. Therefore, in order to make things more transparent we present here the approach first in the special constant di- screte case, based on meromorphic Mellin symbols.
