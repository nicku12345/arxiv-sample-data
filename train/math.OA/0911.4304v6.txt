We introduce a noncommutative analogue of the Fig\'a-Talamanca-Herz algebra A_p(G) on the natural predual of the operator space \frak{M}_{p,cb} of completely bounded Schur multipliers on Schatten space S_p. We determine the isometric Schur multipliers and prove that the space \frak{M}_{p} of bounded Schur multipliers on Schatten space S_p is the closure in the weak operator topology of the span of isometric multipliers.
