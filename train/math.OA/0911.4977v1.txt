Our main result provides a closed expression for the completely bounded Fourier multiplier norm of the spherical functions on the generalized Lorentz groups. As a corollary, we find that there is no uniform bound on the completely bounded Fourier multiplier norm of the spherical functions on the generalized Lorentz groups. We extend the latter result to the remaining connected, real rank one, simple Lie groups with finite center, and as an application we obtain that each of the above mentioned groups has a completely bounded Fourier multiplier, which is not the coefficient of a uniformly bounded representation of the group on a Hilbert space.
