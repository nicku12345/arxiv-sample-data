We compute the K-theory of ring C*-algebras for polynomial rings over finite fields. The key ingredient is a duality theorem which we had obtained in a previous paper. It allows us to show that the K-theory of these algebras has a ring structure and to determine explicit generators. Our main result also reveals striking similarities between the number field case and the function field case.
