We consider a certain class of unital simple stably finite C^*-algebras which absorb the Jiang-Su algebra Z tensorially. Under a mild assumption, we show that the crossed product of a C^*-algebra in this class by a strongly outer action of Z^N or a finite group is Z-stable. As an application, we also prove that all strongly outer actions of Z^2 on Z are mutually cocycle conjugate.
