The notion of textile system was introduced by M. Nasu in order to analyze endomorphisms and automorphisms of topological Markov shifts. A textile system is given by two finite directed graphs G and H and two morphisms p,q:G\to H, with some extra properties. It turns out that a textile system determines a first quadrant two-dimensional shift of finite type, via a collection of Wang tiles, and conversely, any such shift is conjugate to a textile shift. In the case the morphisms p and q have the path lifting property, we prove that they induce groupoid morphisms \pi, \rho:\Gamma(G)\to \Gamma(H) between the corresponding \'etale groupoids of G and H.   We define two families {\mathcal A}(m,n) and \bar{\mathcal A}(m,n) of C^*-algebras associated to a textile shift, and compute them in specific cases. These are graph algebras, associated to some one-dimensional shifts of finite type constructed from the textile shift. Under extra hypotheses, we also define two families of Fell bundles which encode the complexity of these two-dimensional shifts. We consider several classes of examples of textile shifts, including the full shift, the Golden Mean shift and shifts associated to rank two graphs.
