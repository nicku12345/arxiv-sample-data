We give a new method for proving the homomorphic property of a quantum stochastic ow satisfying a quantum stochastic differential equation with unbounded coefficients, under some further hypotheses. As an application, we prove a Trotter product formula for quantum stochastic ows and obtain quantum stochastic dilations of a class of quantum dynamical semigroups generalizing results of [5]
