Let G be a second countable, locally compact group and let f be a continuous Herz-Schur multiplier on G. Our main result gives the existence of a (not necessarily uniformly bounded) strongly continuous representation on a Hilbert space, such that f is the coefficient of this representation with respect to two vectors with bounded orbit. Moreover, we show that the norm of the representation of an element g from G is at most exponential in terms of the metric distance from g to the identity element of G.
