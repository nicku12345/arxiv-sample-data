We construct a family of purely infinite C^*-algebras, \mathcal{Q}^\lambda for \lambda\in (0,1) that are classified by their K-groups.   There is an action of the circle   \T with a unique {\rm KMS} state \psi on each \mathcal{Q}^\lambda. For \lambda=1/n, \mathcal{Q}^{1/n}\cong O_n, with its usual \T action and {\rm KMS} state.   For \lambda=p/q, rational in lowest terms, \mathcal{Q}^\lambda\cong O_n (n=q-p+1) with UHF fixed point algebra of type (pq)^\infty. For any n>0, \mathcal{Q}^\lambda\cong O_n for infinitely many \lambda with distinct KMS states and UHF fixed-point algebras. For any \lambda\in (0,1), \mathcal{Q}^\lambda\neq O_\infty. For \lambda irrational the fixed point algebras, are NOT AF and the \mathcal{Q}^\lambda are usually NOT Cuntz algebras. For \lambda transcendental, K_1\cong K_0\cong\Z^\infty, so that \mathcal{Q}^\lambda is Cuntz' \mathcal Q_{\N}, \cite{Cu1}. If \lambda^{\pm 1} are both algebraic integers, the {\bf only} O_n which appear satisfy n\equiv 3(mod 4). For each \lambda, the representation of \mathcal{Q}^\lambda defined by the KMS state \psi generates a type {\rm III}_\lambda factor. These algebras fit into the framework of modular index (twisted cyclic) theory of \cite{CPR2,CRT} and \cite{CNNR}.
