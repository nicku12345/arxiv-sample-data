We present two examples of actions of non-regular locally compact quantum groups on their homogeneous spaces. The homogeneous spaces are defined in a way specific to these examples, but the definitions we use have the advantage of being expressed in purely \mathrm{C}^*-algebraic language. We also discuss continuity of the obtained actions. Finally we describe in detail a general construction of quantum homogeneous spaces obtained as quotients by compact quantum subgroups.
