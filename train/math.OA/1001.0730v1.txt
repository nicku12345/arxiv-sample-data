We study operator algebras associated to integral domains. In particular, with respect to a set of natural identities we look at the possible nonselfadjoint operator algebras which encode the ring structure of an integral domain. We show that these algebras give a new class of examples of semicrossed products by discrete semigroups. We investigate the structure of these algebras together with a particular class of representations.
