We consider the locally measure topology t(\mathcal{M}) on the *-algebra LS(\mathcal{M}) of all locally measurable operators affiliated with a von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M}. We prove that t(\mathcal{M}) coincides with the (o)-topology on LS_h(\mathcal{M})=\{T\in LS(\mathcal{M}): T^*=T\} if and only if the algebra \mathcal{M} is \sigma-finite and a finite algebra. We study relationships between the topology t(\mathcal{M}) and various topologies generated by faithful normal semifinite traces on \mathcal{M}.
