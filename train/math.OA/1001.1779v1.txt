Let M_{*}({\bf C}) denote the C^{*}-algebra defined as the direct sum of all matrix algebras \{M_{n}({\bf C}):n\geq 1\}. It is known that M_{*}({\bf C}) has a non-cocommutative comultiplication \Delta_{\varphi}. We show that the C^{*}-bialgebra (M_{*}({\bf C}),\Delta_{\varphi}) has a universal R-matrix R such that the quasi-cocommutative C^{*}-bialgebra (M_{*}({\bf C}),\Delta_{\varphi},R) is triangular.
