The structure of the C^*-algebras corresponding to even-dimensional mirror quantum spheres is investigated. It is shown that they are isomorphic to both Cuntz-Pimsner algebras of certain C^*-correspondences and C^*-algebras of certain labelled graphs. In order to achieve this, categories of labelled graphs and C^*-correspondences are studied. A functor from labelled graphs to C^*-correspondences is constructed, such that the corresponding associated C^*-algebras are isomorphic. Furthermore, it is shown that C^*-correspondences for the mirror quantum spheres arise via a general construction of restricted direct sum.
