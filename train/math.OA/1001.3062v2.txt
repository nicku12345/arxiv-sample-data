In this paper we use a design theoretical approach to construct new, previously unknown complex Hadamard matrices. Our methods generalize and extend the earlier results of de la Harpe--Jones and Munemasa--Watatani and offer a theoretical explanation for the existence of some sporadic examples of complex Hadamard matrices in the existing literature. As it is increasingly difficult to distinguish inequivalent matrices from each other, we propose a new invariant, the fingerprint of complex Hadamard matrices. As a side result, we refute a conjecture of Koukouvinos et al. on (n-8)x(n-8) minors of real Hadamard matrices.
