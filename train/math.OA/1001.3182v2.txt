An n-tuple of operators (V_1,...,V_n) acting on a Hilbert space H is said to be isometric if the operator [V_1\...\ V_n]:H^n\to H is an isometry. We prove a decomposition for an isometric tuple of operators that generalizes the classical Lebesgue-von Neumann-Wold decomposition of an isometry into the direct sum of a unilateral shift, an absolutely continuous unitary and a singular unitary. We show that, as in the classical case, this decomposition determines the weakly closed algebra and the von Neumann algebra generated by the tuple.
