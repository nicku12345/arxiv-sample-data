We introduce notions of the Rohlin property and the approximate representability for inclusions of unital C^*-algebras. We investigate a dual relation between the Rohlin property and the approximate representability. We prove that a number of classes of unital C^*-algebras are closed under inclusions with the Rohlin property, including:   AF algebras, AI algebras, AT algebras, and related classes characterized by direct limit decomposition using semiprojective building blocks. C^*-algebras with stable rank one. C^*-algebras with real rank zero.
