Let A be a simple C*-algebra of stable rank one and let p and q be two \sigma-compact open projections. It is proved that there is a continuous path of unitaries in {\tilde A} which connects open sub-projections of p which is compactly contained in p to those in q. It is also shown that every Hilbert module is projective in the category whose morphisms are bounded module maps with adjoints. A discussion of projective Hilbert modules (whose morphisms are bounded module maps) is also given.
