Based on the fact that, for a subfactor N of a II_1 factor M, the first non-trivial Jones index is 2 and then M is decomposed as the crossed product of N by an outer action of {\mathbb{Z}}_2, we study pairs  \{N, uNu^* \} from a view point of entropy for two subalgebras of M with a connection to the entropy for automorphisms, where the inclusion of II_1 factors  N \subset M is given as M is the crossed product of N by a finite group of outer automorphisms and u is a unitary in M.
