Let P \subset A be a inclusion of unital C*-algebras and E\colon A \to P be a conditional expectation of index finite type. We introduce a Rokhlin property for E and discuss about \mathcal{D}-absorbing proeprty, where \mathcal{D} is a separable, unital, strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra. In this paper we consider permanent properties for strongly self-absorbing property under inclusions of unital C*-algebras with a finite Watatani index.
