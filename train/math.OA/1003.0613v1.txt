We introduce a new notion of twisted actions of inverse semigroups and show that they correspond bijectively to certain regular Fell bundles over inverse semigroups, yielding in this way a structure classification of such bundles. These include as special cases all the stable Fell bundles.   Our definition of twisted actions properly generalizes a previous one introduced by Sieben and corresponds to Busby-Smith twisted actions in the group case. As an application we describe twisted etale groupoid C*-algebras in terms of crossed products by twisted actions of inverse semigroups and show that Sieben's twisted actions essentially correspond to twisted etale groupoids with topologically trivial twists.
