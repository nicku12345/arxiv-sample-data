An algebra is said to be quasi-directly finite when any left-invertible element in its unitization is automatically right-invertible. It is an old observation of Kaplansky that the von Neumann algebra of a discrete group has this property; in this note, we collate some analogous results for the group C^*-algebras of more general locally compact groups. Partial motivation comes from earlier work of the author on the phenomenon of empty residual spectrum for convolution operators.
