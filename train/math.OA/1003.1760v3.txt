Let A and B be unital separable simple amenable \CA s which satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. Suppose {that} A and B are \mathcal Z-stable and are of rationally tracial rank no more than one. We prove the following: Suppose that \phi, \psi: A\to B are unital {monomorphisms}. There exists a sequence of unitaries \{u_n\}\subset B such that  \lim_{n\to\infty} u_n^*\phi(a) u_n=\psi(a)\tforal a\in A,  if and only if  [\phi]=[\psi]\,\,\,\text{in}\,\,\, KL(A,B), \phi_{\sharp}=\psi_{\sharp}\andeqn\phi^{\ddag}=\psi^{\ddag},  where \phi_{\sharp}, \psi_{\sharp}: \aff(T(A))\to \aff(T(B)) and \phi^{\ddag}, \psi^{\ddag}: U(A)/CU(A)\to U(B)/CU(B) are {the} induced maps and where T(A) and T(B) are tracial state spaces of A and B, and CU(A) and CU(B) are closure of {commutator} subgroups of unitary groups of A and B, respectively. We also show that this holds for some AH-algebras A. {Moreover, if \kappa\in KL(A,B) preserves the order and the identity, \lambda: \aff(\tr(A))\to \aff(\tr(B)) is a continuous affine map and \gamma: U(A)/CU(A)\to U(B)/CU(B) is a \hm\, which are compatible, we also show that there is a unital \hm\, \phi: A\to B so that ([\phi],\phi_{\sharp},\phi^{\ddag})=(\kappa, \lambda, \gamma), at least in the case that K_1(A) is a free group,
