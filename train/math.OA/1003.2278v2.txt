We give a formula for the modular operator and modular conjugation in terms of matrix coefficients of corepresentations of a quantum group in the sense of Kustermans and Vaes. As a consequence, the modular autmorphism group of a unimodular quantum group can be expressed in terms of matrix coefficients. As an application, we determine the Duflo-Moore operators for the quantum group analogue of the normaliser of SU(1,1) in SL(2,\mathbb{C}).
