We study the automorphism group of a unital, simple, \mathcal{Z}-stable C^{*}-algebra. In this paper, we generalize the results by the authors in \cite{pr_auto} to \mathcal{Z}-stable C^{*}-algebras \mathfrak{A} such that \mathfrak{A} \otimes \mathfrak{B} is a separable, nuclear, simple, tracially AI algebras satisfying the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT) of Rosenberg and Schochet \cite{uct}. By the results of Lin in \cite{hl_asyunit} and Winter in \cite{ww_localelliott}, C^{\ast}-algebras that satisfies the above condition are classified via K-theory and traces.
