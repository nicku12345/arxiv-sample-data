Let A be a unital ring which is a product of possibly infinitely many indecomposable rings. We establish criteria for the existence of a globalization for a given twisted partial action of a group on A. If the globalization exists, it is unique up to a certain equivalence relation and, moreover, the crossed product corresponding to the twisted partial action is Morita equivalent to that corresponding to its globalization. For arbitrary unital rings the globalization problem is reduced to an extendibility property of the multipliers involved in the twisted partial action.
