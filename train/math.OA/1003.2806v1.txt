If b is an inner function, then composition with b induces an endomorphism, \beta, of L^\infty(\mathbb{T}) that leaves H^\infty(\mathbb{T}) invariant. We investigate the structure of the endomorphisms of B(L^2(\mathbb{T})) and B(H^2(\mathbb{T})) that implement \beta through the representations of L^\infty(\mathbb{T}) and H^\infty(\mathbb{T}) in terms of multiplication operators on L^2(\mathbb{T}) and H^2(\mathbb{T}). Our analysis, which is based on work of R. Rochberg and J. McDonald, will wind its way through the theory of composition operators on spaces of analytic functions to recent work on Cuntz families of isometries and Hilbert C^*-modules.
