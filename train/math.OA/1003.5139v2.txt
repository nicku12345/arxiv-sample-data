In this paper we develop a theory of free holomorphic functions on noncommutative Reinhardt domains generated by positive regular free holomorphic functions in n noncommuting variables. We show that the free biholomorphic classification of these domains is the same as the classification, up to unital completely isometric isomorphisms, of the corresponding noncommutative domain algebras.
