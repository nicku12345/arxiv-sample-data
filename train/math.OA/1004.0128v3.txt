We present families of pairs of finite von Neumann algebras A\subset M where A is a maximal injective masa in the type \mathrm{II}_1 factor M with separable predual. Our results make use of the strong mixing and the asymptotic orthogonality properties of A in M and are borrowed from ideas of S. Popa who proved that if G is a non abelian free group and if a is one of its generators, then the von Neumann algebra generated by a is maximal injective in the factor L(G). Our results apply to pairs H<G where H is an infinite abelian subgroup of a suitable amalgamated product group G.
