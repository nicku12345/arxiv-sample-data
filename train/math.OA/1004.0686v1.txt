Let v_1,..., v_n be n vectors in an inner product space. Can we find a natural number d and positive (semidefinite) complex matrices A_1,..., A_n of size d \times d such that {\rm Tr}(A_kA_l)= <v_k, v_l> for all k,l=1,..., n? For such matrices to exist, one must have <v_k, v_l> \geq 0 for all k,l=1,..., n. We prove that if n<5 then this trivial necessary condition is also a sufficient one and find an appropriate example showing that from n=5 this is not so --- even if we allowed realizations by positive operators in a von Neumann algebra with a faithful normal tracial state.   The fact that the first such example occurs at n=5 is similar to what one has in the well-investigated problem of positive factorization of positive (semidefinite) matrices. If the matrix (<v_k, v_l>) has a positive factorization, then matrices A_1,..., A_n as above exist. However, as we show by a large class of examples constructed with the help of the Clifford algebra, the converse implication is false.
