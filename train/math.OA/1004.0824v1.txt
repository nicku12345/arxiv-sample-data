A theory of Galois co-objects for von Neumann bialgebras is introduced. This concept is closely related to the notion of comonoidal W*-Morita equivalence between von Neumann bialgebras, which is a Morita equivalence taking the comultiplication structure into account. We show that the property of `being a von Neumann algebraic quantum group' (i.e. `having invariant weights') is preserved under this equivalence relation. We also introduce the notion of a projective corepresentation for a von Neumann bialgebra, and show how it leads to a construction method for Galois co-objects and comonoidal W*-Morita equivalences.
