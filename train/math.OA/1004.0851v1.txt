The groupoid normalisers of a unital inclusion B\subseteq M of von Neumann algebras consist of the set \mathcal{GN}_M(B) of partial isometries v\in M with vBv^*\subseteq B and v^*Bv\subseteq B. Given two unital inclusions B_i\subseteq M_i of von Neumann algebras, we examine groupoid normalisers for the tensor product inclusion B_1\ \overline{\otimes}\ B_2\subseteq M_1\ \overline{\otimes}\ M_2 establishing the formula  \mathcal{GN}_{M_1\,\overline{\otimes}\,M_2}(B_1\ \overline{\otimes}\ B_2)''=\mathcal{GN}_{M_1}(B_1)''\ \overline{\otimes}\ \mathcal{GN}_{M_2}(B_2)''  when one inclusion has a discrete relative commutant B_1'\cap M_1 equal to the centre of B_1 (no assumption is made on the second inclusion). This result also holds when one inclusion is a generator masa in a free group factor. We also examine when a unitary u\in M_1\ \overline{\otimes}\ M_2 normalising a tensor product B_1\ \overline{\otimes}\ B_2 of irreducible subfactors factorises as w(v_1\otimes v_2) (for some unitary w\in B_1\ \overline{\otimes}\ B_2 and normalisers v_i\in\mathcal{N}_{M_i}(B_i)). We obtain a positive result when one of the M_i is finite or both of the B_i are infinite. For the remaining case, we characterise the II_1 factors B_1 for which such factorisations always occur (for all M_1, B_2 and M_2) as those with a trivial fundamental group.
