The additive (generalized) \xi-Lie derivations on prime algebras are characterized. It is shown, under some suitable assumption, that an additive map L is an additive (generalized) Lie derivation if and only if it is the sum of an additive (generalized) derivation and an additive map from the algebra into its center vanishing all commutators; is an additive (generalized) \xi-Lie derivation with \xi\not=1 if and only if it is an additive (generalized) derivation satisfying L(\xi A)=\xi L(A) for all A. These results are then used to characterize additive (generalized) \xi-Lie derivations on several operator algebras such as Banach space standard operator algebras and von Neumman algebras.
