We prove that all strongly outer Z^N-actions on a UHF algebra of infinite type are strongly cocycle conjugate to each other. We also prove that all strongly outer, asymptotically representable Z^N-actions on a unital simple AH algebra with real rank zero, slow dimension growth and finitely many extremal tracial states are cocycle conjugate to each other.
