A triple of finite von Neumann algebras B\subseteq N\subseteq M is said to have the relative weak asymptotic homomorphism property if there exists a net of unitary operators \{u_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda\in \Lambda} in B such that \lim_{\lambda}|\mathbb{E}}_B(xu_{\lambda}y)-{\mathbb{E}}_B({\mathbb{E}}_N(x)u_{\lambda}{\mathbb{E}}_N(y))\|_2=0 for all x,y\in M. We prove that a triple of finite von Neumann algebras B\subseteq N\subseteq M has the relative weak asymptotic homomorphism property if and only if N contains the set of all x\in M such that Bx\subseteq \sum_{i=1}^n x_iB for a finite number of elements x_1,...,x_n in M. Such an x is called a one sided quasi-normalizer of B, and the von Neumann algebra generated by all one sided quasi-normalizers of B is called the one sided quasi-normalizer algebra of B.   We characterize one sided quasi-normalizer algebras for inclusions of group von Neumann algebras and use this to show that one sided quasi-normalizer algebras and quasi-normalizer algebras are not equal in general. We also give some applications to inclusions L(H)\subseteq L(G) arising from containments of groups. For example, when L(H) is a masa we determine the unitary normalizer algebra as the von Neumann algebra generated by the normalizers of H in G.
