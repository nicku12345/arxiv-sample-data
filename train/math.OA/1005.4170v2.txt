In this paper, we concentrate on the MF property of reduced free products of unital C*-algebras with amalgamation over finite dimensional C*-algebras. More specifically, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a reduced free product of two UHF algebras amalgamated over a finite-dimensional C*-algebra with respect to trace preserving conditional expectations to be MF.
