Due to the corresponding fact concerning Hilbert spaces, it is natural to ask if the linearity and the orthogonality structure of a Hilbert C^*-module determine its C^*-algebra-valued inner product. We verify this in the case when the C^*-algebra is commutative (or equivalently, we consider a Hilbert bundle over a locally compact Hausdorff space). More precisely, a \mathbb{C}-linear map \theta (not assumed to be bounded) between two Hilbert C^*-modules is said to be "orthogonality preserving" if \left<\theta(x),\theta(y)\right> =0 whenever \left<x,y\right> =0. We prove that if \theta is an orthogonality preserving map from a full Hilbert C_0(\Omega)-module E into another Hilbert C_0(\Omega)-module F that satisfies a weaker notion of C_0(\Omega)-linearity (known as "localness"), then \theta is bounded and there exists \phi\in C_b(\Omega)_+ such that  \left<\theta(x),\theta(y)\right>\ =\ \phi\cdot\left<x,y\right>, \quad \forall x,y \in E.  On the other hand, if F is a full Hilbert C^*-module over another commutative C^*-algebra C_0(\Delta), we show that a "bi-orthogonality preserving" bijective map \theta with some "local-type property" will be bounded and satisfy  \left<\theta(x),\theta(y)\right>\ =\ \phi\cdot\left<x,y\right>\circ\sigma, \quad \forall x,y \in E  where \phi\in C_b(\Omega)_+ and \sigma: \Delta \rightarrow \Omega is a homeomorphism.
