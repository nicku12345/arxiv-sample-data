Let \Omega be a locally compact Hausdorff space. We show that any local \mathbb{C}-linear map (where "local" is a weaker notion than C_0(\Omega)-linearity) between Banach C_0(\Omega)-modules are "nearly C_0(\Omega)-linear" and "nearly bounded". As an application, a local \mathbb{C}-linear map \theta between Hilbert C_0(\Omega)-modules is automatically C_0(\Omega)-linear. If, in addition, \Omega contains no isolated point, then any C_0(\Omega)-linear map between Hilbert C_0(\Omega)-modules is automatically bounded. Another application is that if a sequence of maps \{\theta_n\} between two Banach spaces "preserve c_0-sequences" (or "preserve ultra-c_0-sequences"), then \theta_n is bounded for large enough n and they have a common bound. Moreover, we will show that if \theta is a bijective "biseparating" linear map from a "full" essential Banach C_0(\Omega)-module E into a "full" Hilbert C_0(\Delta)-module F (where \Delta is another locally compact Hausdorff space), then \theta is "nearly bounded" (in fact, it is automatically bounded if \Delta or \Omega contains no isolated point) and there exists a homeomorphism \sigma: \Delta \rightarrow \Omega such that \theta(e\cdot \varphi) = \theta(e)\cdot \varphi\circ \sigma (e\in E, \varphi\in C_0(\Omega)).
