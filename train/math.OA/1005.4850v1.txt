We give an affirmative answer to the question whether there exist Lie algebras for suitable closed subgroups of the unitary group U(\mathcal{H}) in a Hilbert space \mathcal{H} with U(\mathcal{H}) equipped with the strong operator topology. More precisely, for any strongly closed subgroup G of the unitary group U(\mathfrak{M}) in a finite von Neumann algebra \mathfrak{M}, we show that the set of all generators of strongly continuous one-parameter subgroups of G forms a complete topological Lie algebra with respect to the strong resolvent topology. We also characterize the algebra \mathfrak{M} of all densely defined closed operators affiliated with \mathfrak{M} from the viewpoint of a tensor category.
