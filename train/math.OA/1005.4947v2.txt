In this paper we give a proof of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem of Connes and Tretkoff for noncommutative two tori \mathbb{T}_{\theta}^2 equipped with an arbitrary translation invariant complex structure. More precisely, we show that for any complex number \tau in the upper half plane, representing the conformal class of a metric on \mathbb{T}_{\theta}^2, and a Weyl factor given by a positive invertible element k \in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}_{\theta}^2), the value at the origin, \zeta (0), of the spectral zeta function of the Laplacian \triangle' attached to (\mathbb{T}_{\theta}^2, \tau, k) is independent of \tau and k.
