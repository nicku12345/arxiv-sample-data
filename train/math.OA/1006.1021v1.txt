Let \mathscr{A} be a unital C^*-algebra and let \Phi: \mathscr{A} \to {\mathbb B}({\mathscr H}) be a unital n-positive linear map between C^*-algebras for some n \geq 3. We show that \|\Phi(AB)-\Phi(A)\Phi(B)\| \leq \Delta(A,||\cdot||)\,\Delta(B,||\cdot||) for all operators A, B \in \mathscr{A}, where \Delta(C,\|\cdot\|) denotes the operator norm distance of C from the scalar operators.
