In a two-state free probability space (A, \phi, \psi), we define an algebraic two-state free Brownian motion to be a process with two-state freely independent increments whose two-state free cumulant generating function is quadratic. Note that a priori, the distribution of the process with respect to the second state \psi is arbitrary. We show, however, that if A is a von Neumann algebra, the states \phi, \psi are normal, and \phi is faithful, then there is only a one-parameter family of such processes. Moreover, with the exception of the actual free Brownian motion (corresponding to \phi = \psi), these processes only exist for finite time.
