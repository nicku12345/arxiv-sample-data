Suppose \mathcal{T}_{+}(E) is the tensor algebra of a W^{*}-correspondence E and H^{\infty}(E) is the associated Hardy algebra. We investigate the problem of extending completely contractive representations of \mathcal{T}_{+}(E) on a Hilbert space to ultra-weakly continuous completely contractive representations of H^{\infty}(E) on the same Hilbert space. Our work extends the classical Sz.-Nagy - Foia\c{s} functional calculus and more recent work by Davidson, Li and Pitts on the representation theory of Popescu's noncommutative disc algebra.
