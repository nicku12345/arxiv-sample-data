Quantum Steiffel manifolds were introduced by Vainerman and Podkolzin in \cite{VP}. They classified the irreducible representations of their underlying C^*-algebras. Here we compute the K groups of the quantum homogeneous spaces SU_{q}(n)/SU_{q}(n-2), n\ge 3. Specializing to the case n=3 we show that the fundamental unitary for quantum SU(3) is nontrivial and is a unimodular element in K_1.
