We present several operator versions of the Dunkl--Williams inequality with respect to the p-angular distance for operators. More precisely, we show that if A, B \in \mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H}) such that |A| and |B| are invertible, \frac{1}{r}+\frac{1}{s}=1\,\,(r>1) and p\in\mathbb{R}, then \begin{equation*} |A|A|^{p-1}-B|B|^{p-1}|^{2} \leq |A|^{p-1}(r|A-B|^{2}+s||A|^{1-p}|B|^{p}-|B||^2)|A|^{p-1}.%\nonumber \end{equation*} In the case that 0<p \leq 1, we remove the invertibility assumption and show that if A=U|A| and B=V|B| are the polar decompositions of A and B, respectively, t>0, then |(U|A|^{p}-V|B|^{p})|A|^{1-p}|^{2}\leq (1+t)|A-B|^{2}+(1+\frac{1}{t})||B|^{p}|A|^{1-p}-|B||^2 \,. We obtain several equivalent conditions, when the case of equalities hold.
