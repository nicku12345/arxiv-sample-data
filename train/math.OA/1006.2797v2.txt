Given a graph E we define E-algebraic branching systems, show their existence and how they induce representations of the associated Leavitt path algebra. We also give sufficient conditions to guarantee faithfulness of the representations associated to E-algebraic branching systems and to guarantee equivalence of a given representation (or a restriction of it) to a representation arising from an E-algebraic branching system.
