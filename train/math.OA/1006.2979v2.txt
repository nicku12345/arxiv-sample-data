We show that all orthogonal free quantum groups are isomorphic to variants of the free orthogonal Wang algebra, the hyperoctahedral quantum group or the quantum permutation group. We also obtain a description of their free complexification. In particular we complete the calculation of fusion rules of all orthogonal free quantum groups and their free complexifications.
