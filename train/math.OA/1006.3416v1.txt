Let G be a locally compact group, H an abelian subgroup and let f be a continuous 2-cocycle on the dual group of H. Let B be a C*-algebra equipped with a continuous right coaction of G. Using Rieffel deformation, we can construct a quantum group G(f) and the deformed C*-algebra B(f). The aim of this paper is to show that B(f) is equipped with a continuous coaction of G(f). The transition from the original coaction to its deformed counterpart is nontrivial in the sense that the deformed one contains complete information about the undeformed one. In order to illustrate our construction we apply it to the action of the Lorentz group on the Minkowski space obtaining a C*-algebraic quantum Minkowski space.
