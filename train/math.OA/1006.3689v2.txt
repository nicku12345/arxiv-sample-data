We show that all the free Araki-Woods factors \Gamma(H_\R, U_t)" have the complete metric approximation property. Using Ozawa-Popa's techniques, we then prove that every nonamenable subfactor \mathcal{N} \subset \Gamma(H_\R, U_t)" which is the range of a normal conditional expectation has no Cartan subalgebra. We finally deduce that the type {\rm III_1} factors constructed by Connes in the '70s can never be isomorphic to any free Araki-Woods factor, which answers a question of Shlyakhtenko and Vaes.
