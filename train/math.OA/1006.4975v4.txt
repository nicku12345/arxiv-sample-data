We give an introduction into the ideal structure and representation theory of crossed products by actions of locally compact groups on C*-algebras. In particular, we discuss the Mackey-Rieffel-Green theory of induced representations of crossed products and groups. Although we do not give complete proofs of all results, we try at least to explain the main ideas. For a more detailed exposition of many of the results presented here we refer to the beautiful recent book by Dana Williams.
