We introduce the fundamental group F(A) of a simple \sigma-unital C^*-algebra A with unique (up to scalar multiple) densely defined lower semicontinuous trace. This is a generalization of our previous works. Our definition in this paper makes sense for stably projectionless C^*-algebras. We show that there exist separable stably projectionless C^*-algebras such that their fundamental groups are equal to \mathbb{R}_+^\times by using the classification theorem of Razak and Tsang. This is a contrast to the unital case. This study is motivated by the work of Kishimoto and Kumjian.
