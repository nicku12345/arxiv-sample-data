We reflect on the notions of positivity and square roots. We review many examples which underline our thesis that square roots of positive maps related to *-algebras are Hilbert modules. As a result of our considerations we discuss requirements a notion of positivity on a *-algebra should fulfill and derive some basic consequences.
