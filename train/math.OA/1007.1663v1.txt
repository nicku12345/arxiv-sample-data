Let A, A' be separable C^*-algebras, B a stable \sigma-unital C^*-algebra. Our main result is the construction of the pairing [[A',A]]\times\operatorname{Ext}^{-1/2}(A,B)\to\operatorname{Ext}^{-1/2}(A',B), where [[A',A]] denotes the set of homotopy classes of asymptotic homomorphisms from A' to A and \operatorname{Ext}^{-1/2}(A,B) is the group of semi-invertible extensions of A by B. Assume that all extensions of A by B are semi-invertible. Then this pairing allows us to give a condition on A' that provides semi-invertibility of all extensions of A' by B. This holds, in particular, if A and A' are shape equivalent. A similar condition implies that if \operatorname{Ext}^{-1/2} coincides with E-theory (via the Connes-Higson map) for A then the same holds for A'.
