A classification result is obtained for the C*-algebras that are (stably isomorphic to) inductive limits of 1-dimensional noncommutative CW complexes with trivial K_1-group. The classifying functor Cu is defined in terms of the Cuntz semigroup of the unitization of the algebra. For the simple C*-algebras covered by the classification, Cu reduces to the ordered K_0-group, the cone of traces, and the pairing between them. As an application of the classification, it is shown that the crossed products by a quasi-free action O_2\rtimes_\lambda \mathbb{R} are all isomorphic for a dense set of positive irrational numbers \lambda.
