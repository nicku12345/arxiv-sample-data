We define the action of a locally compact group G on a topological graph E. This action induces a natural action of G on the C^*-correspondence {\mathcal H}(E) and on the graph C^*-algebra C^*(E). If the action is free and proper, we prove that C^*(E)\rtimes_r G is strongly Morita equivalent to C^*(E/G). We define the skew product of a locally compact group G by a topological graph E via a cocycle c:E^1\to G. The group acts freely and properly on this new topological graph E\times_cG. If G is abelian, there is a dual action on C^*(E) such that C^*(E)\rtimes \hat{G}\cong C^*(E\times_cG). We also define the fundamental group and the universal covering of a topological graph.
