In the given article the notion of infinite norm decomposition of a C^*-algebra is investigated. The norm decomposition is some generalization of Peirce decomposition. It is proved that the infinite norm decomposition of any C^*-algebra is a C^*-algebra. C^*-factors with an infinite and a nonzero finite projection and simple purely infinite C^*-algebras are constructed.
