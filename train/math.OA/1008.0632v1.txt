In this paper we construct a new, previously unknown four-parameter family of complex Hadamard matrices of order 6, the entries of which are described by algebraic functions of roots of various sextic polynomials. We conjecture that the new, generic family G together with Karlsson's degenerate family K and Tao's spectral matrix S form an exhaustive list of complex Hadamard matrices of order 6. Such a complete characterization might finally lead to the solution of the famous MUB-6 problem.
