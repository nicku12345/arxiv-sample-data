For two positive definite adjointable operators M and N, and an adjointable operator A acting on a Hilbert C^*-module, some properties of the weighted Moore-Penrose inverse A^\dag_{MN} are established. When A=(A_{ij}) is 1\times 2 or 2\times 2 partitioned, general representations for A^\dag_{MN} in terms of the individual blocks A_{ij} are studied. In case A is 1\times 2 partitioned, a unified representation for A^\dag_{MN} is presented. In the 2\times 2 partitioned case, an approach to constructing Moore-Penrose inverses from the non-weighted case to the weighted case is provided. Some results known for matrices are generalized in the general setting of Hilbert C^*-module operators.
