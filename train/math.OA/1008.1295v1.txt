Let \A be a unital separable nuclear C^*--algebra which belongs to the bootstrap category \N and \B be a separable stable C^*--algebra. In this paper, we consider the group \Ext_u(\A,\B) consisting of the unitary equivalence classes of unital extensions \tau\colon\A\rightarrow Q(\B). The relation between \Ext_u(\A,\B) and \Ext(\A,\B) is established. Using this relation, we show the half--exactness of \Ext_u(\cdot,\B) and the (UCT) for \Ext_u(\A,\B). Furthermore, under certain conditions, we obtain the half--exactness and Bott periodicity of \Ext_u(\A,\cdot).
