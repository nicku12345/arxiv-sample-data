Let \mathcal{M} be a W^*-factor and let S\left( \mathcal{M} \right)  be the space of all measurable operators affiliated with \mathcal{M}. It is shown that for any self-adjoint element a\in S(\mathcal{M}) there exists a scalar \lambda_0\in\mathbb{R}, such that for all \varepsilon > 0, there exists a unitary element u_\varepsilon from \mathcal{M}, satisfying |[a,u_\varepsilon]| \geq (1-\varepsilon)|a-\lambda_0\mathbf{1}|. A corollary of this result is that for any derivation \delta on \mathcal{M} with the range in an ideal I\subseteq\mathcal{M}, the derivation \delta is inner, that is \delta(\cdot)=\delta_a(\cdot)=[a,\cdot], and a\in I. Similar results are also obtained for inner derivations on S(\mathcal{M}).
