We study of the connection between operator valued central limits for monotone, Boolean and free probability theory, which we shall call the arcsine, Bernoulli and semicircle distributions, respectively. In scalar-valued non-commutative probability these measures are known to satisfy certain arithmetic relations with respect to Boolean and free convolutions. We show that generally the corresponding operator-valued distributions satisfy the same relations only when we consider them in the fully matricial sense introduced by Voiculescu. In addition, we provide a combinatorial description in terms of moments of the operator valued arcsine distribution and we show that its reciprocal Cauchy transform satisfies a version of the Abel equation similar to the one satisfied in the scalar-valued case.
