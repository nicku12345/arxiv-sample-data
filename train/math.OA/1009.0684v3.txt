Let (M,\tau,\sigma,\Gamma) be a (finite) von Neumann dynamical system and let N be a \Gamma-invariant unital von Neumann subalgebra of M. If V\subset L^2(M) is a right N-submodule whose projection p_V has finite trace in < M,e_N> and is \Gamma-invariant, then we prove that, for every \epsilon>0, one can find a \Gamma-invariant submodule W\subset V which has finite rank and such that Tr(p_V-p_W)<\epsilon. Furthermore, we also construct a \sigma-cocycle that gives the action of \Gamma on a basis of W. In particular, this answers a question of T. Austin, T. Eisner and T. Tao.
