We introduce P-graphs, which are generalisations of directed graphs in which paths have a degree in a semigroup P rather than a length in N. We focus on semigroups P arising as part of a quasi-lattice ordered group (G,P) in the sense of Nica, and on P-graphs which are finitely aligned in the sense of Raeburn and Sims. We show that each finitely aligned P-graph admits a C*-algebra C*_{min}(Lambda) which is co-universal for partial-isometric representations of Lambda which admit a coaction of G compatible with the P-valued length function. We also characterise when a homomorphism induced by the co-universal property is injective. Our results combined with those of Spielberg show that every Kirchberg algebra is Morita equivalent C*_{min}(Lambda) for some (N^2 * N)-graph Lambda.
