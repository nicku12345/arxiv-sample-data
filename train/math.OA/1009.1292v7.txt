We exhibit large classes of contractions on noncommutative L^p-spaces which satisfy the noncommutative analogue of Matsaev's conjecture, introduced by Peller, in 1985. In particular, we prove that every Schur multiplier on a Schatten space S^p induced by a contractive Schur multiplier on B(\ell^2) associated with a real matrix satisfy this conjecture. Moreover, we deal with analogue questions for C_0-semigroups. Finally, we disprove a conjecture of Peller concerning norms on the space of complex polynomials arising from Matsaev's conjecture and Peller's problem. Indeed, if S denotes the shift on \ell^p and \sigma the shift on the Schatten space S^p, the norms \bnorm{P(S)}_{\ell^p \xra{}\ell^p} and \bnorm{P(\sigma)\ot \Id_{S^p}}_{S^p(S^p) \xra{}S^p(S^p)} can be different for a complex polynomial P.
