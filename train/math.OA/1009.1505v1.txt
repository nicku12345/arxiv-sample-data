We define a new independence in three states called indented independence which unifies many independences: free, monotone, anti-monotone, Boolean, conditionally free, conditionally monotone and conditionally anti-monotone independences. This unification preserves the associative laws. Therefore, the central limit theorem, cumulants and moment-cumulant formulae for indented independence also unify those for the above seven independences.
