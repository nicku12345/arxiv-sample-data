Let M_n denote the algebra of complex n\times n  matrices and write M for the direct sum of the M_n. So a typical element of M has the form \[x = x_1\oplus x_2 \... \oplus x_n \oplus \...,\] where x_n \in M_n and \|x\| = \sup_n\|x_n\|. We set D= \{\{x_n\} \in M: x_n is diagonal for all N\}. We conjecture (contra Kadison and Singer (1959)) that every pure state of D extends uniquely to a pure state of M. This is known for the normal pure states of D, and we show that this is true for a (weak*) open, dense subset of all the singular pure states of D. We also show that (assuming the Continuum hypothesis) M has pure states that are not multiplicative on any maximal abelian *-subalgebra of M.
