We prove that an operator system \mathcal S is nuclear in the category of operator systems if and only if there exist nets of unital completely positive maps \phi_\lambda : \cl S \to M_{n_\lambda} and \psi_\lambda : M_{n_\lambda} \to \cl S such that \psi_\lambda \circ \phi_\lambda converges to {\rm id}_{\cl S} in the point-norm topology. Our proof is independent of the Choi-Effros-Kirchberg characterization of nuclear C^*-algebras and yields this characterization as a corollary. We give an example of a nuclear operator system that is not completely order isomorphic to a unital C^*-algebra.
