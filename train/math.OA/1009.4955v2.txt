Let \mu be a probability measure on the real line. In this paper we prove that there exists a decomposition \mu = \mu_{0} \boxplus \mu_{1} \boxplus \... \boxplus \mu_{n} \boxplus \... such that \mu_{0} is infinitely divisible and \mu_{i} is indecomposable for i \geq 1. Additionally, we prove that the family of all \boxplus-divisors of a measure \mu is compact up to translation. Analogous results are also proven in the case of multiplicative convolution.
