To each finite-dimensional operator space E is associated a commutative operator algebra UC(E), so that E embeds completely isometrically in UC(E) and any completely contractive map from E to bounded operators on Hilbert space extends uniquely to a completely contractive homomorphism out of UC(E). The unit ball of UC(E) is characterized by a Nevanlinna factorization and transfer function realization. Examples related to multivariable von Neumann inequalities are discussed.
