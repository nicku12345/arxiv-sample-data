We introduce quotient maps in the category of operator systems and show that the maximal tensor product is projective with respect to them. Whereas, the maximal tensor product is not injective, which makes the ({\rm el},\max)-nuclearity distinguish a class in the category of operator systems. We generalize Lance's characterization of C^*-algebras with the WEP by showing that ({\rm el},\max)-nuclearity is equivalent to the weak expectation property. Applying Werner's unitization to the dual spaces of operator systems, we consider a class of completely positive maps associated with the maximal tensor product and establish the duality between quotient maps and complete order embeddings.
