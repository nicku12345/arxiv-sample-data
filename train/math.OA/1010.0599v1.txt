We complete the analysis of KMS-states of the Toeplitz algebra of the affine semigroup over the natural numbers, recently studied by Raeburn and the first author, by showing that for every inverse temperature beta in the critical interval [1,2], the unique KMS_beta-state is of type III_1. We prove this by reducing the type classification from the Toeplitz algebra to that of the symmetric part of the Bost-Connes system, with a shift in inverse temperature. To carry out this reduction we first obtain a parametrization of the Nica spectrum of the Toeplitz algebra in terms of an adelic space. Combining a characterization of traces on crossed products due to the second author with an analysis of the action of the affine semigroup on the Nica spectrum, we can also recover all the KMS-states originally computed by Raeburn and the first author. Our computation sheds light on why there is a free transitive circle action on the extremal KMS_beta-states for beta>2 that does not ostensibly come from an action on the C*-algebra.
