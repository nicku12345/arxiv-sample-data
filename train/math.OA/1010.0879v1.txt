By using the theory of Complex Multiplication for general Siegel modular varieties we construct arithmetic subalgebras for BC-type systems attached to number fields containing a CM field. Our approach extends the construction of Connes, Marcolli and Ramachandran given in the case of imaginary quadratic fields.
