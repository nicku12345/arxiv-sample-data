Let A be a von Neumann algebra with a finite trace \tau, represented in H=L^2(A,\tau), and let B_t\subset A be sub-algebras, for t in an interval I. Let E_t:A\to B_t be the unique \tau-preserving conditional expectation. We say that the path t\mapsto E_t is smooth if for every a\in A and v \in H, the map  I\ni t\mapsto E_t(a)v\in H  is continuously differentiable. This condition implies the existence of the derivative operator  dE_t(a):H\to H, \ dE_t(a)v=\frac{d}{dt}E_t(a)v.  If this operator verifies the additional boundedness condition,  \int_J \|dE_t(a)\|_2^2 d t\le C_J\|a\|_2^2,  for any closed bounded sub-interval J\subset I, and C_J>0 a constant depending only on J, then the algebras B_t are *-isomorphic. More precisely, there exists a curve G_t:A\to A, t\in I of unital, *-preserving linear isomorphisms which intertwine the expectations,  G_t\circ E_0=E_t\circ G_t.  The curve G_t is weakly continuously differentiable. Moreover, the intertwining property in particular implies that G_t maps B_0 onto B_t. We show that this restriction is a multiplicative isomorphism.
