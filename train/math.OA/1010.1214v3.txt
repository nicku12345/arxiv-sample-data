If N \subset \R is a separable II_1-factor, the space \Hom(N,\R) of unitary equivalence classes of unital *-homomorphisms N \to \R is shown to have a surprisingly rich structure. If N is not hyperfinite, \Hom(N,\R) is an infinite-dimensional, complete, metrizeable topological space with convex-like structure, and the outer automorphism group \Out(N) acts on it by "affine" homeomorphisms. (If N \cong R, then \Hom(N,\R) is just a point.) Property (T) is reflected in the extreme points -- they're discrete in this case. For certain free products N = \Sigma \ast R, every countable group acts nontrivially on \Hom(N, \R), and we show the extreme points are not discrete for these examples. Finally, we prove that the dynamical systems associated to free group factors are isomorphic.
