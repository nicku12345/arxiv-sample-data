We study Fermionic systems on a lattice with random interactions through their dynamics and the associated KMS states. We extend to the disordered CAR algebra, some standard results concerning the spectral properties exhibited by temperature states for disordered quantum spin systems. We discuss the Arveson spectrum and its connection with the Connes and Borchers \G-invariants for such W*-dynamical systems. In the case of KMS states exhibiting a natural property of invariance with respect to the spatial translations, some interesting properties, associated with standard spin-glass-like behaviour, emerge naturally. It covers infinite-volume limits of finite-volume Gibbs states, that is the quenched disorder for Fermions living on a standard lattice Z^d. In particular, we show that a temperature state of the systems under consideration can generate only a type III von Neumann algebra (with the type III_0 component excluded). Moreover, in the case of the pure thermodynamic phase, the associated von Neumann algebra is of type III_\l for some \l in(0,1] independent of the disorder. Such a result is in accordance with the principle of self-averaging which affirms that the physically relevant quantities do not depend on the disorder. The present approach can be viewed as a further step towards fully understanding the very complicated structure of the set of temperature states of quantum spin glasses, and its connection with the breakdown of the symmetry for the replicas.
