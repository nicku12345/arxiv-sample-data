Suppose T and S are bounded adjointable operators with close range between Hilbert C*-modules, then TS has closed range if and only if Ker(T)+Ran(S) is an orthogonal summand, if and only if Ker(S^*)+Ran(T^*) is an orthogonal summand. Moreover, if the Dixmier (or minimal) angle between Ran(S) and Ker(T) \cap [Ker(T) \cap Ran(S)]^{\perp} is positive and  \bar{Ker(S^*)+Ran(T^*)}  is an orthogonal summand then TS has closed range.
