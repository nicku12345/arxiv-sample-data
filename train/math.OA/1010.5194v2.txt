Using an approach emerging from the theory of closable derivations on von Neumann algebras, we exhibit a class of groups CR satisfying the following property: given any groups G_1, G_2 in CR, then any free, ergodic, measure preserving action on a probability space G_1 x G_2 on X gives rise to a von Neumann algebra with unique group measure space Cartan subalgebra. Pairing this result with Popa's Orbit Equivalence Superrigidity Theorem we obtain new examples of W*-superrigid actions.
