This paper extends the results of the previous work of the authors on the classification on noncommutative domain algebras up to completely isometric isomorphism. Using Sunada's classification of Reinhardt domains in C^n, we show that aspherical noncommutative domain algebras are isomorphic if and only if their defining symbols are equivalent, in the sense that one can be obtained from the other via permutation and scaling of the free variables. Our result also shows that the automorphism groups of aspherical noncommutative domain algebras consists of a subgroup of some finite dimensional unitary group. We conclude by illustrating how our methods can be used to extend to noncommutative domain algebras some results from analysis in C^n with the example of Cartan's lemma.
