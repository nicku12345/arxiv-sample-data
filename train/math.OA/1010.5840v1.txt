We establish that particular quotients of the non-commutative Hardy algebras carry ergodic actions of convergent discrete subgroups of the group \operatorname*{SU}(n,1) of automorphisms of the unit ball in \mathbb{C}% ^{n}. To do so, we provide a mean to compute the spectra of quotients of noncommutative Hardy algebra and characterize their automorphisms in term of biholomorphic maps of the unit ball in \mathbb{C}^{n}.
