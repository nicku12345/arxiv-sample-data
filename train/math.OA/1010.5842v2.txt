We investigate the structure of the automorphism of \mathcal{O}_{2} which exchanges the two canonical isometries. Our main observation is that the fixed point C*-subalgebra for this action is isomorphic to \mathcal{O}_{2} and we detail the relationship between the crossed-product and fixed point subalgebra.
