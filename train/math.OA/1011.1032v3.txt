We provide a direct and elementary proof of the equivalence between the weak asymptotic homomorphism property for the pair of group von Neumann algebras L(H)\subset L(G) and the embedding into H of the one sided quasi-normalizer of the pair H<G, as it is stated by J. Fang, M. Gao and R. R. Smith in a recent article, and we extend the result to triples of groups H<K<G.
