We define matrix models that converge to the generating functions of a wide variety of loop models with fugacity taken in sets with an accumulation point. The latter can also be seen as moments of a non-commutative law on a subfactor planar algebra. We apply this construction to compute the generating functions of the Potts model on a random planar map.
