We show that a pair of almost commuting self-adjoint, symmetric matrices is close to a pair of commuting self-adjoint, symmetric matrices (in a uniform way). Moreover we prove that the same holds with self-dual in place of symmetric. The notion of self-dual Hermitian matrices is important in physics when studying fermionic systems that have time reversal symmetry. Since a symmetric, self-adjoint matrix is real, we get a real version of Huaxin Lin's famous theorem on almost commuting matrices. Similarly the self-dual case gives a version for matrices over the quaternions.   We prove analogous results for element of real C^*-algebras of "low rank." In particular, these stronger results apply to paths of almost commuting Hermitian matrices that are real or self-dual. Along the way we develop a theory of semiprojectivity for real C^*-algebras.
