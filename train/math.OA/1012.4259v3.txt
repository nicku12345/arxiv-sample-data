An open question, raised independently by several authors, asks if a closed amenable subalgebra of {\mathcal B}({\mathcal H}) must be similar to an amenable C*-algebra; the question remains open even for singly-generated algebras. In this article we show that any closed, commutative, operator amenable subalgebra of a finite von Neumann algebra {\mathcal M} is similar to a commutative C*-subalgebra of {\mathcal M}, with the similarity implemented by an element of {\mathcal M}. Our proof makes use of the algebra of measurable operators affiliated to {\mathcal M}.
