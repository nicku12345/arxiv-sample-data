In this article we deal with the stability and convergence of numerical solutions of nonlinear evolution equations of the form A(u(t))+f(u(t))=u'(t), the numerical analysis of solutions to this problems will be performed using some methods from particular algebras of operators which are sometimes represented by unital subalgebras of the unital C*-algebras of operators that are generated by some basic operators say \mathbf{1},a,\mathcal{D}(\cdot)\in\mathcal{L}(H^m(G)) that in some suitable sense are related to the operator A(\cdot)\in\mathcal{L}(H^m(G)) in the evolution equations, particular cases where the operator algebras do not verify the C*-identity with respect to the norm chosen are also studied, when applicable basic C*-algebra techniques are implemented to perform some estimates of numerical solutions to some types of problems, in all this work expressions like H^m(G) will represent a prescribed discretizable Hilbert space with G\subset\subset\mathbb{R}^n.
