Some subadditivity results involving symmetric (unitarily invariant) norms are obtained. For instance, if g(t)=\sum_{k=0}^m a_kt^k is a polynomial of degree m with non-negative coefficients, then, for all positive operators A,\,B and all symmetric norms, \|g(A+B)\|^{1/m} \le \|g(A)\|^{1/m} + \|g(B)\|^{1/m}. To give parallel superadditivity results, we investigate anti-norms, a class of functionals containing the Schatten q-norms for q\in(0,1] and q<0. The results are extensions of the Minkowski determinantal inequality. A few estimates for block-matrices are derived. For instance, let f:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty) be concave and p\in(1,\infty). If f^p(t) is superadditive, then Tr f(A) \ge (\sum_{i=1}^m f^p(a_{ii}))^{1/p} for all positive m\times m matrix A=[a_{ij}]. Furthermore, for the normalized trace \tau, we consider functions \phi(t) and f(t) for which the functional A\mapsto\phi\circ\tau\circ f(A) is convex or concave, and obtain a simple analytic criterion.
