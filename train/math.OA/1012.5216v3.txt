We define a Riesz type interpolation property for the Cuntz semigroup of a C^*-algebra and prove it is satisfied by the Cuntz semigroup of every C^*-algebra with the ideal property. Related to this, we obtain two characterizations of the ideal property in terms of the Cuntz semigroup of the C^*-algebra. Some additional characterizations are proved in the special case of the stable, purely infinite C^*-algebras, and two of them are expressed in language of the Cuntz semigroup. We introduce a notion of comparison of positive elements for every unital C^*-algebra that has (normalized) quasitraces. We prove that large classes of C^*-algebras (including large classes of AH algebras) with the ideal property have this comparison property.
