Cuntz and Li have defined a C*-algebra associated to any integral domain, using generators and relations, and proved that it is simple and purely infinite and that it is stably isomorphic to a crossed product of a commutative C*-algebra. We give an approach to a class of C*-algebras containing those studied by Cuntz and Li, using the general theory of C*-dynamical systems associated to certain semidirect product groups. Even for the special case of the Cuntz-Li algebras, our development is new.
