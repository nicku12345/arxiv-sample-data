In this paper, we consider families of operators \{x_r\}_{r \in \Lambda} in a tracial C^\ast-probability space (\mathcal A, \phi), whose joint \ast-distribution is invariant under free complexification and the action of the hyperoctahedral quantum groups \{H_n^+\}_{n \in \N}. We prove a strong form of Haagerup's inequality for the non-self-adjoint operator algebra \mathcal B generated by \{x_r\}_{r \in \Lambda}, which generalizes the strong Haagerup inequalities for \ast-free R-diagonal families obtained by Kemp-Speicher \cite{KeSp}. As an application of our result, we show that \mathcal B always has the metric approximation property (MAP). We also apply our techniques to study the reduced C^\ast-algebra of the free unitary quantum group U_n^+. We show that the non-self-adjoint subalgebra \mathcal B_n generated by the matrix elements of the fundamental corepresentation of U_n^+ has the MAP. Additionally, we prove a strong Haagerup inequality for \mathcal B_n, which improves on the estimates given by Vergnioux's property RD \cite{Ve}.
