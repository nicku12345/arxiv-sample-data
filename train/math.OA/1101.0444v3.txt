Suppose that B is a G-Banach algebra over \mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R} or \mathbb{C}, X is a finite dimensional compact metric space, \zeta : P \to X is a standard principal G-bundle, and A_\zeta = \Gamma (X, P \times_G B) is the associated algebra of sections.   We produce a spectral sequence which converges to \pi_*(GL_o A_\zeta)  with [E^2_{-p,q} \cong \check{H}^p(X ; \pi_q(GL_o B)).] A related spectral sequence converging to \K_{*+1}(A_\zeta) (the real or complex topological K-theory) allows us to conclude that if B is Bott-stable, (i.e., if  \pi_*(GL_o B) \to \K_{*+1}(B) is an isomorphism for all *>0) then so is A_\zeta.
