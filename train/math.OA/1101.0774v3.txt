Guo and the second author have shown that the closure [I] in the Drury-Arveson space of a homogeneous principal ideal I in \mathbb{C}[z_1,...,z_n] is essentially normal. In this note, the authors extend this result to the closure of any principal polynomial ideal in the Bergman space. In particular, the commutators and cross-commutators of the restrictions of the multiplication operators are shown to be in the Schatten p -class for p>n. The same is true for modules generated by polynomials with vector-valued coefficients. Further, the maximal ideal space X_I of the resulting C^\ast-algebra for the quotient module is shown to be contained in Z(I)\cap \partial\mathbb{B}_n, where Z(I) is the zero variety for I, and to contain all points in \partial\mathbb{B}_n that are limit points of Z(I)\cap \mathbb{B}_n. Finally, the techniques introduced enable one to study a certain class of weight Bergman spaces on the ball.
