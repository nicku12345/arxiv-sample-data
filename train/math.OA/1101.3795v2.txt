We introduce the concept of a 1-coaligned k-graph and prove that the shift maps of a k-graph pairwise *-commute if and only if the k-graph is 1-coaligned. We then prove that for 2-graphs \Lambda generated from basic data *-commuting shift maps is equivalent to a condition that implies that C^*(\Lambda) is simple and purely infinite. We then consider full shift spaces and introduce a condition on a block map which ensures the associated sliding block code *-commutes with the shift.
