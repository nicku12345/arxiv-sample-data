An integer matrix A\in M_d(\Z) induces a covering \sigma_A of \T^d and an endomorphism \alpha_A:f\mapsto f\circ \sigma_A of C(\T^d) for which there is a natural transfer operator L. In this paper, we compute the KMS states on the Exel crossed product C(\T^d)\rtimes_{\alpha_A,L}\N and its Toeplitz extension. We find that C(\T^d)\rtimes_{\alpha_A,L}\N has a unique KMS state, which has inverse temperature \beta=\log|\det A|. Its Toeplitz extension, on the other hand, exhibits a phase transition at \beta=\log|\det A|, and for larger \beta the simplex of KMS_\beta states is isomorphic to the simplex of probability measures on \T^d.
