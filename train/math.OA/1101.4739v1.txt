We consider the simplicity of the C^*-algebra associated to a labelled space (E,\CL,\bE), where (E,\CL) is a labelled graph and \bE is the smallest accommodating set containing all generalized vertices. We prove that if C^*(E, \CL, \bE) is simple, then (E, \CL, \bE) is strongly cofinal, and if, in addition, \{v\}\in \bE for every vertex v, then (E, \CL, \bE) is disagreeable. It is observed that C^*(E, \CL, \bE) is simple whenever (E, \CL, \bE) is strongly cofinal and disagreeable, which is recently known for the C^*-algebra C^*(E, \CL, \CEa) associated to a labelled space (E, \CL, \CEa) of the smallest accommodating set \CEa.
