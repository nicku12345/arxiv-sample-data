Let \Lambda = \mathbb{Z}^n with lexicographic ordering. \Lambda is a totally ordered group. Let X = \Lambda^+ * \Lambda^+. Then X is a \Lambda-tree. Analogous to the construction of graph C^*-algebras, we form a groupoid whose unit space is the space of ends of the tree. The C^*-algebra of the \Lambda-tree is defined as the C^*-algebra of this groupoid. We prove some properties of this C^*-algebra.
