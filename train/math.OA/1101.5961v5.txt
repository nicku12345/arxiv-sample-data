A translation invariant state \omega on C^*-algebra \clb=\otimes_{k \in \IZ}M^{(k)}, where M^{(k)}=M_d(\IC) is the d-dimensional matrices over field of complex numbers, give rises a stationary quantum Markov chain and associates canonically a unital completely positive normal map \tau on a von-Neumann algebra \clm with a faithful normal invariant state \phi. We give an asymptotic criteria on the Markov map (\clm,\tau,\phi) for purity of \omega. Such a pure \omega gives only type-I or type-III factor \omega_R once restricted to one side of the chain \clb_R=\otimes_{\IZ_+}M^{(k)}. In case \omega_R is type-I, \omega admits Kolmogorov's property.
