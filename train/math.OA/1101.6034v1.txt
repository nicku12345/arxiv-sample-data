To each irreducible infinite dimensional representation (\pi,\cH) of a C^*-algebra \cA, we associate a collection of irreducible norm-continuous unitary representations \pi_{\lambda}^\cA of its unitary group \U(\cA), whose equivalence classes are parameterized by highest weights in the same way as the irreducible bounded unitary representations of the group \U_\infty(\cH) = \U(\cH) \cap (\1 + K(\cH)) are. These are precisely the representations arising in the decomposition of the tensor products \cH^{\otimes n} \otimes (\cH^*)^{\otimes m} under \U(\cA). We show that these representations can be realized by sections of holomorphic line bundles over homogeneous K\"ahler manifolds on which \U(\cA) acts transitively and that the corresponding norm-closed momentum sets I_{\pi_\lambda^\cA}^{\bf n} \subeq \fu(\cA)' distinguish inequivalent representations of this type.
