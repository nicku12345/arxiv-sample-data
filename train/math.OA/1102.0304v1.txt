It is a well-known result of Eymard that the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra of a locally compact group G can be identified with the dual of the group \cs C^{*}(G). A corresponding result for a locally compact groupoid G has been investigated by Renault, Ramsay and Walter. We show that the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra B_{\mu}(G) of G (with respect to a quasi-invariant measure \mu on the unit space X of G) can be characterized in operator space terms as the dual of the Haagerup tensor product \ov{L^{2}(X,\mu)}^{r}\otimes_{hA}C^{*}(G,\mu)\otimes_{h A}L^2(X,\mu)^c and as the space of completely bounded bimodule maps CB_{A}(C^{*}(G,\mu),B(L^2(X,\mu))), where A=C_{0}(X) and C^{*}(G,\mu) is the groupoid \cs obtained from those G-representations associated with \mu. A similar but different result has been given by Renault, but our proof is along different lines, and full details are given. Examples illustrating the result are discussed.
