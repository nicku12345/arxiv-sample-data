We observe almost divisibility for the original Cuntz semigroup of a simple AH algebra with strict comparison. As a consequence, the properties of strict comparison, finite nuclear dimension, and Z-stability are equivalent for such algebras, confirming partially a conjecture of Winter and the author.
