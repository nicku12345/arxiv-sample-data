We construct a locally compact Hausdorff topology on the path space of a directed graph E, and identify its boundary-path space \partial E as the spectrum of a commutative C^*-subalgebra D_E of C^*(E). We then show that \partial E is homeomorphic to a subset of the infinite-path space of any desingularisation F of E. Drinen and Tomforde showed that we can realise C^*(E) as a full corner of C^*(F), and we deduce that D_E is isomorphic to a corner of D_F. Lastly, we show that this isomorphism implements the homeomorphism between the boundary-path spaces.
