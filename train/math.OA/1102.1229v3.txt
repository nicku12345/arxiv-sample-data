We construct a locally compact Hausdorff topology on the path space of a finitely aligned k-graph \Lambda. We identify the boundary-path space \partial\Lambda as the spectrum of a commutative C^*-subalgebra D_\Lambda of C^*(\Lambda). Then, using a construction similar to that of Farthing, we construct a finitely aligned k-graph \wt\Lambda with no sources in which \Lambda is embedded, and show that \partial\Lambda is homeomorphic to a subset of \partial\wt\Lambda . We show that when \Lambda is row-finite, we can identify C^*(\Lambda) with a full corner of C^*(\wt\Lambda), and deduce that D_\Lambda is isomorphic to a corner of D_{\wt\Lambda}. Lastly, we show that this isomorphism implements the homeomorphism between the boundary-path spaces.
