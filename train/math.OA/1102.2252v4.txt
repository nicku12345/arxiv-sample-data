Let \mathcal{C} be a C*-algebra and \alpha:\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C} a unital *-endomorphism. There is a natural way to construct operator algebras which are called semicrossed products, using a convolution induced by the action of \alpha on \mathcal{C}. We show that the C*-envelope of a semicrossed product is (a full corner of) a crossed product. As a consequence, we get that, when \alpha is *-injective, the semicrossed products are completely isometrically isomorphic and share the same C*-envelope, the crossed product \mathcal{C}_\infty \rtimes_{\alpha_\infty} \mathbb{Z}. We show that minimality of the dynamical system (\mathcal{C},\alpha) is equivalent to non-existence of non-trivial Fourier invariant ideals in the C*-envelope. We get sharper results for commutative dynamical systems.
