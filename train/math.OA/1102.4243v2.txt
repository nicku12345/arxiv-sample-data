We study an ergodic theorem for disjoint C*-dynamical systems, where disjointness here is a noncommutative version of the concept introduced by Furstenberg for classical dynamical systems. This is applied to W*-dynamical systems. We also consider specific examples of disjoint C*-dynamical and W*-dynamical systems, including for actions of other groups than \mathbb{Z}. Unique ergodicity and unique ergodicity relative to the fixed point algebra are closely related to disjointness, and are used to give examples of disjoint C*-dynamical systems.
