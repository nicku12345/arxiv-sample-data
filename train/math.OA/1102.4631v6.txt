Let C be a general unital AH-algebra and let A be a unital simple C^*-algebra with tracial rank at most one. Suppose that \phi, \psi: C\to A are two unital monomorphisms. We show that \phi and \psi are approximately unitarily equivalent if and only if \beq[\phi]&=&[\psi] {\rm in} KL(C,A), \phi_{\sharp}&=&\psi_{\sharp}\tand \phi^{\dag}&=&\psi^{\dag}, \eneq where \phi_{\sharp} and \psi_{\sharp} are continuous affine maps from tracial state space T(A) of A to faithful tracial state space T_{\rm f}(C) of C induced by \phi and \psi, respectively, and \phi^{\ddag} and \psi^{\ddag} are induced homomorphisms from K_1(C) into \Aff(T(A))/\bar{\rho_A(K_0(A))}, where \Aff(T(A)) is the space of all real affine continuous functions on T(A) and \bar{\rho_A(K_0(A))} is the closure of the image of K_0(A) in the affine space \Aff(T(A)). In particular, the above holds for C=C(X), the algebra of continuous functions on a compact metric space.   An approximate version of this is also obtained. We also show that, given a triple of compatible elements \kappa\in KL_e(C,A)^{++}, an affine map \gamma: T(C)\to T_{\rm f}(C) and a \hm \af: K_1(C)\to \Aff(T(A))/\bar{\rho_A(K_0(A))}, there exists a unital monomorphism \phi: C\to A such that [h]=\kappa, h_{\sharp}=\gamma and \phi^{\dag}=\af.
