Let \mathcal{M} be a W^*-algebra and let LS(\mathcal{M}) be the algebra of all locally measurable operators affiliated with \mathcal{M}. It is shown that for any self-adjoint element a\in LS(\mathcal{M}) there exists a self-adjoint element c_{_{0}} from the center of LS(\mathcal{M}), such that for any \epsilon>0 there exists a unitary element  u_\epsilon from \mathcal{M}, satisfying |[a,u_\epsilon]| \geq (1-\epsilon)|a-c_{_{0}}|. A corollary of this result is that for any derivation \delta on \mathcal{M} with the range in a (not necessarily norm-closed) ideal I\subseteq\mathcal{M}, the derivation \delta is inner, that is \delta(\cdot)=\delta_a(\cdot)=[a,\cdot], and a\in I. Similar results are also obtained for inner derivations on LS(\mathcal{M}).
