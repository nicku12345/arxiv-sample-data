We discuss different mixing properties for triples of finite von Neumann algebras B\subset N\subset M, and we introduce families of triples of groups H<K<G whose associated von Neumann algebras L(H)\subset L(K)\subset L(G) satisfy \mathcal{N}_{L(G)}(L(H))"=L(K). It turns out that the latter equality is implied by two conditions: the equality \mathcal{N}_G(H)=K and the above mentioned mixing properties. Our families of examples also allow us to exhibit examples of pairs H<G such that L(\mathcal{N}_G(H))\not=\mathcal{N}_{L(G)}(L(H))".
