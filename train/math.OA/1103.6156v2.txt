Let \boxplus, \boxtimes and \uplus be the free additive, free multiplicative, and boolean additive convolutions, respectively. For a probability measure \mu on [0,\infty) with finite second moment, we find the scaling limit of (\mu^{\boxtimes N})^{\boxplus N} as N goes to infinity. The \mathcal{R}--transform of the limit distribution can be represented by the Lambert's W function. We also find similar limit theorem by replacing the free additive convolution with the boolean convolution.
