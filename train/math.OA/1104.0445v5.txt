We show that every unital amenable separable simple C^*-algebra with finite tracial rank which satisfies the UCT has in fact tracial rank at most one. We also show that unital separable simple C^*-algebrass which are "tracially" locally AH with slow dimension growth are {\cal Z}-stable. As a consequence, unital separable simple C^*-algebras which are locally AH with no dimension growth are isomorphic to a unital simple AH-algebra with no dimension growth.
