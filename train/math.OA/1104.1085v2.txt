In this paper, we apply the theory of inverse semigroups to the C^{*}-algebra U[\mathbb{Z}] considered in \cite{Cuntz}. We show that the C^{*}-algebra U[\mathbb{Z}] is generated by an inverse semigroup of partial isometries. We explicity identify the groupoid \mathcal{G}_{tight} associated to the inverse semigroup and show that \mathcal{G}_{tight} is exactly the same groupoid obtained in \cite{Cuntz-Li}.
