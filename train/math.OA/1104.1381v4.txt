A fundamental result of Biane (1998) states that a process with freely independent increments has the Markov property, but that there are two kinds of free Levy processes: the first kind has stationary increments, while the second kind has stationary transition operators. We show that a process of the first kind (with mean zero and finite variance) has the same transition operators as the free Brownian motion with appropriate initial conditions, while a process of the second kind has the same transition operators as a monotone Levy process. We compute an explicit formula for the generators of these families of transition operators, in terms of singular integral operators, and prove that this formula holds on a fairly large domain. We also compute the generators for the q-Brownian motion, and for the two-state free Brownian motions.
