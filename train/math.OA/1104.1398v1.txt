If \alpha is the endomorphism of the disk algebra, \AD, induced by composition with a finite Blaschke product b, then the semicrossed product \AD\times_{\alpha} \bZ^+ imbeds canonically, completely isometrically into \rC(\bT)\times_{\alpha} \bZ^+. Hence in the case of a non-constant Blaschke product b, the C*-envelope has the form  \rC(\S_{b})\times_{s} \bZ, where (\S_{b}, s) is the solenoid system for (\bT, b). In the case where b is a constant, then the C*-envelope of \AD\times_{\alpha} \bZ^+ is strongly Morita equivalent to a crossed product of the form  \rC(\S_{e})\times_{s} \bZ, where e \colon \bT \times \bN \longrightarrow \bT \times \bN is a suitable map and (\S_{e}, s) is the solenoid system for (\bT \times \bN, \, e) .
