We describe the C^*-algebra of an E-unitary or strongly 0-E-unitary inverse semigroup as the partial crossed product of a commutative C^*-algebra by the maximal group image of the inverse semigroup. We give a similar result for the C^*-algebra of the tight groupoid of an inverse semigroup. We also study conditions on a groupoid C^*-algebra to be Morita equivalent to a full crossed product of a commutative C^*-algebra with an inverse semigroup, generalizing results of Khoshkam and Skandalis for crossed products with groups.
