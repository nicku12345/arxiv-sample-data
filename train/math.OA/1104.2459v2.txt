We study Gelfand pairs for locally compact quantum groups. We give an operator algebraic interpretation and show that the quantum Plancherel transformation restricts to a spherical Plancherel transformation. As an example, we turn the quantum group analogue of the normaliser of SU(1,1) in SL(2,\mathbb{C}) together with its diagonal subgroup into a pair for which every irreducible corepresentation admits at most two vectors that are invariant with respect to the quantum subgroup. Using a \mathbb{Z}_2-grading, we obtain product formulae for little q-Jacobi functions.
