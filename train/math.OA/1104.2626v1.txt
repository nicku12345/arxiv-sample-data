In this paper we study the completely bounded anti-isomorphisms on operator algebras, that work similarly to the involutions with the exception for the property of being completely isometric. We elaborate the Blecher's characterization theorem for operator algebras to make it applicable to the so-called operator K-algebras with completely bounded reflexive anti-isomorphism. We also establish a connection of this result with the notion of smooth C^*-modules, that play an important role in Mesland's approach to Baaj-Julg picture of KK-theory.
