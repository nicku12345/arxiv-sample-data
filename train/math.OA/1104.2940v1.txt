In this paper we give a new construction of parametric families of complex Hadamard matrices of square orders, and connect them to equiangular tight frames. The results presented here generalize some of the recent ideas of Bodmann et al. and extend the list of known equiangular tight frames. In particular, a (36,21) frame coming from a nontrivial cube root signature matrix is obtained for the first time.
