We observe that for a large class of non-amenable groups G, one can find bounded representations of A(G) on Hilbert space which are not completely bounded. We also consider restriction algebras obtained from A(G), equipped with the natural operator space structure, and ask whether such algebras can be completely isomorphic to operator algebras; partial results are obtained, using a modified notion of Helson set which takes account of operator space structure. In particular, we show that if G is virtually abelian, then the restriction algebra A_G(E) is completely isomorphic to an operator algebra if and only if E is finite.
