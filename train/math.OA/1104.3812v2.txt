Let (M,\Gamma) be a Hopf--von Neumann algebra, so that M_\ast is a completely contractive Banach algebra. We investigate whether the product of two elements of M that are both weakly almost periodic functionals on M_\ast is again weakly almost periodic. For that purpose, we establish the following factorization result: If M and N are injective von Neumann algebras, and if x, y \in M \bar{\otimes} N correspond to weakly compact operators from M_\ast to N factoring through reflexive operator spaces X and Y, respectively, then the operator corresponding to xy factors through the Haagerup tensor product X \otimes^h Y provided that X \otimes^h Y is reflexive. As a consequence, for instance, for any Hopf--von Neumann algebra (M,\Gamma) with M injective, the product of a weakly almost periodic element of M with a completely almost periodic one is again weakly almost periodic.
