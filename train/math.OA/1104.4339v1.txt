Let G be a countable discrete amenable group, {\cal M} a McDuff factor von Neumann algebra, and A a separable nuclear weakly dense C^*-subalgebra of {\cal M}. We show that if two centrally free actions of G on {\cal M} differ up to approximately inner automorphisms then they are outer conjugate by an approximately inner automorphism, in the operator norm topology, which makes A invariant. In addition, when A is unital, simple, and with a unique tracial state and \alpha is an automorphism of A we also show that the aperiodicity of \alpha on the von Neumann algebra is equivalent to the weak Rohlin property.
