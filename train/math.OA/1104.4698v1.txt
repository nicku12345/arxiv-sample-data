Given a von Neumann algebra M we consider the central extension E(M) of M. For type I von Neumann algebras E(M) coincides with the algebra LS(M) of all locally measurable operators affiliated with M. In this case we show that an arbitrary automorphism T of E(M) can be decomposed as T=T_a\circ T_\phi, where T_a(x)=axa^{-1} is an inner automorphism implemented by an element a\in E(M), and T_\phi is a special automorphism generated by an automorphism \phi of the center of E(M). In particular if M is of type I_\infty then every band preserving automorphism of E(M) is inner.
