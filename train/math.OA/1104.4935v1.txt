We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the left projectivity and biprojectivity of Banach algebras defined by locally trivial continuous fields of Banach algebras. We identify projective C^*-algebras \A defined by locally trivial continuous fields \mathcal{U} = \{\Omega,(A_t)_{t \in \Omega},\Theta\} such that each C^*-algebra  A_{t} has a strictly positive element. For a commutative C^*-algebra \D contained in {\cal B}(H), where H is a separable Hilbert space, we show that the condition of left projectivity of \D is equivalent to the existence of a strictly positive element in \D and so to the spectrum of \D being a Lindel\ddot{\rm o}f space.
