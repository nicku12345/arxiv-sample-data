A matrix T \in \M_n(\C) is \emph{UECSM} if it is unitarily equivalent to a complex symmetric (i.e., self-transpose) matrix. We develop several techniques for studying this property in dimensions three and four. Among other things, we completely characterize 4 \times 4 nilpotent matrices which are UECSM and we settle an open problem which has lingered in the 3 \times 3 case. We conclude with a discussion concerning a crucial difference which makes dimension three so different from dimensions four and above
