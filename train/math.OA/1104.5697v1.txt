Let \Fth be a 2 graph generated by m blue edges and n red edges, and \omega be the distinguished faithful state associated with its graph C*-algebra \O_\theta.   In this paper, we characterize the factorness of the von Neumann algebra \pi_\omega(\O_\theta)" induced from the GNS representation of \omega under a certain condition. Moreover, when \pi_\omega(\O_\theta)" is a factor, then it is of type III_{m^{-\frac{1}{b}}} (or III_{n^{-\frac{1}{a}}}) if \frac{\ln m}{\ln n}\in\bQ, where a,b\in\bN with \gcd(a,b)=1 satisfy m^a=n^b, and of type III_1 if \frac{\ln m}{\ln n}\not\in\bQ. In the case of \theta being the identity permutation, our condition turns out to be redundant.   On the way to our main results, we also obtain the structure of the fixed point algebra \O_\theta^\sigma of the modular action \sigma from \omega. This could be useful in proving the redundancy of our extra condition.
