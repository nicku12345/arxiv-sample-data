Given locally compact quantum groups \G_1 and \G_2, we show that if the convolution algebras L^1(\G_1) and L^1(\G_2) are isometrically isomorphic as algebras, then \G_1 is isomorphic either to \G_2 or the commutant \G_2'. Furthermore, given an isometric algebra isomorphism \theta:L^1(\G_2) \rightarrow L^1(\G_1), the adjoint is a *-isomorphism between L^\infty(\G_1) and either L^\infty(\G_2) or its commutant, composed with a twist given by a member of the intrinsic group of L^\infty(\G_2). This extends known results for Kac algebras (although our proofs are somewhat different) which in turn generalised classical results of Wendel and Walter. We show that the same result holds for isometric algebra homomorphisms between quantum measure algebras (either reduced or universal). We make some remarks about the intrinsic groups of the enveloping von Neumann algebras of C^*-algebraic quantum groups.
