H. Dye defined the projections P_{i,j}(a) of a C^*-matrix algebra by {eqnarray*} P_{i,j}(a) &=& (1+aa^*)^{-1}\otimes E_{i,i} + (1+aa^*)^{-1}a \otimes E_{i,j}   + a^*(1+aa^*)^{-1} \otimes E_{j,i} + a^*(1+aa^*)^{-1}a\otimes E_{j,j}, {eqnarray*} and he used it to show that in the case of factors not of type I_{2n}, the unitary group determines the algebraic type of that factor. We study these projections and we show that in \mathbb{M}_2(\mathbb{C}), the set of such projections includes all the projections. For infinite C^*-algebra A, having a system of matrix units, including the Cuntz algebra \mathcal{O}_n, we have A\simeq \mathbb{M}_n(A). M. Leen proved that in a simple, purely infinite C^*-algebra A, the *-symmetries generate \mathcal{U}_0(A). We revise and modify Leen's proof to show that part of such *-isometry factors are of the form 1-2P_{i,j}(\omega),\ \omega \in \mathcal{U}(A). In simple, unital purely infinite C^*-algebras having trivial K_1-group, we prove that all P_{i,j}(\omega) have trivial K_0-class. In particular, if u\in \mathcal{U}(\mathcal{O}_n), then u can be factorized as a product of *-symmetries, where eight of them are of the form 1-2P_{i,j}(\omega)
