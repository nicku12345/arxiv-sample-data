Let n>2 be a positive integer. In this paper, we obtain the general solution of the following functional equation n \sum_{1 \le i<j \le n} Q(x_i-x_j)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}Q(\sum_{j =1}^n x_j -n x_i) which is derived from the centroid of the n distinct vectors x_1, ..., x_n in an inner product space. Furthermore, we prove that a mapping f between quasi-Banach modules over a C^*-algebra satisfying approximately the equation can be approximated by a quadratic mapping Q satisfying exactly the equation such that |f(x)-Q(x)| is bounded.
