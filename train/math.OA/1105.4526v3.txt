We show that every topological k-graph constructed from a locally compact Hausdorff space {\Omega} and a family of pairwise commuting local homeomorphisms on {\Omega} satisfying a uniform boundedness condition on the cardinalities of inverse images may be realized as a semigroup crossed product in the sense of Larsen.
