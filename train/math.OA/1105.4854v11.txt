Let \Gamma be a discrete countable group. Consider the crossed product C^\ast-algebra \mathfrak{R}(\Gamma) = C^{\ast}(\Gamma \rtimes l^{\infty}(\Gamma)).   Let G be a larger discrete group, containing \Gamma as an almost normal subgroup. Consequently G acts by partial isomorphisms on G and hence on \mathfrak {R}(\Gamma). Let \mathfrak{R}_G(\Gamma) be the crossed product C^{\ast} - algebra C^{\ast}(G \times (\mathfrak{R}(\Gamma)). The C^\ast-algebra \mathfrak{R}_G(\Gamma) has a natural representation into \mathcal B(\ell ^2(\Gamma)) and hence also admits a representation \Pi_{\mathcal{Q}} into the Calkin algebra \mathcal{Q}(\ell ^2(\Gamma)).   Let G\rtimes \Gamma=\Gamma\times \Gamma^{\rm op}  and assume that \Gamma is exact. Assume that the non-trivial conjugation orbits under the action of \Gamma, having non amenable stabilizers, are separated, in a suitable chosen profinite topology, from the identity element in \Gamma. We also assume natural amenability conditions on the dynamics of the action of \Gamma\times \Gamma^{\rm op} on cosets of amenable subgroups. Then \Pi_{\mathcal Q} factorises to a representation of C^{\ast}_{\rm red}(G \rtimes \mathfrak{R}(\Gamma)). In particular the groups {\mathop{SL}}_3(\mathbb Z), {\mathop{\rm PGL}}_2(\mathbb Z[\frac{1}{p}]) have the Akemann-Ostrand property.   This implies, using the solidity property of Ozawa ([Oz]), that the group von Neumann algebras, \mathcal L({\mathop{SL}}_3(\mathbb Z)) and \mathcal L({\mathop{SL}}_n(\mathbb Z)), n\geq 4, are non-isomorphic.
