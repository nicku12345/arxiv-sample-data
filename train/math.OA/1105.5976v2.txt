Let \mathcal{A} be a unital algebra over the complex field \mathbb{C}. A linear mapping \delta from \mathcal{A} into itself is called a weak (\textit{m,n,l})-Jordan centralizer if (m+n+l)\delta(A^2)-m\delta(A)A-nA\delta(A)-lA\delta(I)A\in \mathbb{C}I for every A\in \mathcal{A}, where m\geq0, n\geq0, l\geq0 are fixed integers with m+n+l\neq 0. In this paper, we study weak (\textit{m,n,l})-Jordan centralizer on generalized matrix algebras and some reflexive algebras alg\mathcal{L}, where \mathcal{L} is CSL or satisfies \vee\{L: L\in \mathcal{J}(\mathcal{L})\}=X or \wedge\{L_-: L\in \mathcal{J}(\mathcal{L})\}=(0), and prove that each weak (\textit{m,n,l})-Jordan centralizer of these algebras is a centralizer when m+l\geq1 and n+l\geq1.
