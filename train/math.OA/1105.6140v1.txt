We describe majorization between selfadjoint operators in a \sigma-finite II_\infty factor (\mathcal{M},\tau) in terms of simple spectral relations. For a diffuse abelian von Neumann subalgebra \mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{M} with trace-preserving conditional expectation E_{\mathcal{A}}, we characterize the closure in the measure topology of the image through E_{\mathcal{A}} of the unitary orbit of a selfadjoint operator in \mathcal{M} in terms of majorization (i.e., a Schur-Horn theorem). We also obtain similar results for the contractive orbit of positive operators in \mathcal{M} and for the unitary and contractive orbits of \tau-integrable operators in \mathcal{M}.
