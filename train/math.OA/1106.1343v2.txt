If \Sigma=(X,\sigma) is a topological dynamical system, where X is a compact Hausdorff space and \sigma is a homeomorphism of X, then a crossed product Banach \sp{*}-algebra \ell^1(\Sigma) is naturally associated with these data. If X consists of one point, then \ell^1(\Sigma) is the group algebra of the integers. The commutant C(X)'_1 of C(X) in \ell^1(\Sigma) is known to be a maximal abelian subalgebra which has non-zero intersection with each non-zero closed ideal, and the same holds for the commutant C(X)'_* of C(X) in C^*(\Sigma), the enveloping C^*-algebra of \ell^1(\Sigma). This intersection property has proven to be a valuable tool in investigating these algebras. Motivated by this pivotal role, we study C(X)'_1 and C(X)'_* in detail in the present paper. The maximal ideal space of C(X)'_1 is described explicitly, and is seen to coincide with its pure state space and to be a topological quotient of X\times\mathbb{T}. We show that C(X)'_1 is hermitian and semisimple, and that its enveloping C^*-algebra is C(X)'_*. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for projections onto C(X)'_1 and C(X)'_* to exist, and give explicit formulas for such projections, which we show to be unique. In the appendix, topological results for the periodic points of a homeomorphism of a locally compact Hausdorff space are given.
