Let \{\phi_s\}_{s\in S} be a commutative semigroup of completely positive, contractive, and weak*-continuous linear maps acting on a von Neumann algebra N. Assume there exists a semigroup \{\alpha_s\}_{s\in S} of weak*-continuous *-endomorphisms of some larger von Neumann algebra M\supset N and a projection p\in M with N=pMp such that \alpha_s(1-p)\le 1-p for every s\in S and \phi_s(y)=p\alpha_s(y)p for all y\in N. If \inf_{s\in S}\alpha_s(1-p)=0 then we show that the map E:M\to N defined by E(x)=pxp for x\in M induces a complete isometry between the fixed point spaces of \{\alpha_s\}_{s\in S} and \{\phi_s\}_{s\in S}.
