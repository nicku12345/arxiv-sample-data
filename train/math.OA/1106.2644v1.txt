We prove that for operator spaces V and W, the operator space V^{**}\otimes_h W^{**} can be completely isometrically embedded into (V\otimes_h W)^{**}, \otimes_h being the Haagerup tensor product. It is also shown that, for exact operator spaces V and W, a jointly completely bounded bilinear form on V\times W can be extended uniquely to a separately w^*-continuous jointly completely bounded bilinear form on  V^{**}\times W^{**}. This paves the way to obtain a canonical embedding of V^{**}\hat{\otimes} W^{**} into (V\hat{\otimes} W)^{**} with a continuous inverse, where \hat{\otimes} is the operator space projective tensor product. Further, for C^*-algebras A and B, we study the (closed) ideal structure of A\hat{\otimes}B, which, in particular, determines the lattice of closed ideals of B(H)\hat{\otimes} B(H) completely.
