Let \mathcal{C}_p be the Schatten p-class for p>0. Generalizations of the parallelogram law for the Schatten 2-norms have been given in the following form: If \mathbf{A}=\{A_1,A_2,...,A_n\} and \mathbf{B}=\{B_1,B_2,...,B_n\} are two sets of operators in \mathcal{C}_2, then \sum_{i,j=1}^n\|A_i-A_j\|_2^2 + \sum_{i,j=1}^n\|B_i-B_j\|_2^2 = 2\sum_{i,j=1}^n\|A_i-B_j\|_2^2 - 2\Norm{\sum_{i=1}^n(A_i-B_i)}_2^2. In this paper, we give generalizations of this as pairs of inequalities for Schatten p-norms, which hold for certain values of p and reduce to the equality above for p=2. Moreover, we present some related inequalities for three sets of operators.
