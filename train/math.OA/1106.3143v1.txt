For C^*-algebras A and B, we prove the slice map conjecture for ideals in the operator space projective tensor product A \hat\otimes B. As an application, a characterization of prime ideals in the Banach \ast-algebra A\hat\otimes B is obtained. Further, we study the primitive ideals, modular ideals and the maximal modular ideals of A\hat\otimes B. It is also shown that the Banach \ast-algebra A\hat\otimes B possesses Wiener property; and that, for a subhomogenous C^*-algebra A, A\hat\otimes B is symmetric.
