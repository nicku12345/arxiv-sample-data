Given an arbitrary graph E and a field K, the prime ideals as well as the primitive ideals of the Leavitt path algebra L_K(E) are completely described in terms of their generators. The stratification of the prime spectrum of L_K(E) is indicated with information on its individual stratum. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given on the graph E under which every prime ideal of L_K(E) is primitive. Leavitt path algebras of Krull dimension zero are characterized and those with various prescribed Krull dimension are constructed. The minimal prime ideals of L_K(E) are are described in terms of the graphical properties of E and using this, complete descriptions of the height one as well as the co-height one prime ideals of L_K(E) are given.
