We improve upon on a limit theorem for numerical index for large classes of Banach spaces including vector valued \ell_p-spaces and \ell_p-sums of Banach spaces where 1\leq p \leq \infty. We first prove  n_1(X) = \displaystyle \lim_m n_1(X_m) for a modified numerical index n_1(\, .\,). Later, we establish if a norm on X satisfies the local characterization condition, then n(X) = \displaystyle\lim_m n(X_m). We also present an example of a Banach space where the local characterization condition is satisfied.
