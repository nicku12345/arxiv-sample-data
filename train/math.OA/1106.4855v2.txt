We study the closure \bar{CSO} of the set CSO of all complex symmetric operators on a separable, infinite-dimensional, complex Hilbert space. Among other things, we prove that every compact operator in \bar{CSO} is complex symmetric. Using a construction of Kakutani as motivation, we also describe many properties of weighted shifts in \bar{CSO} \backslash CSO. In particular, we show that weighted shifts which demonstrate a type of approximate self-similarity belong to \bar{CSO}\backslash CSO. As a byproduct of our treatment of weighted shifts, we explain several ways in which our result on compact operators is optimal.
