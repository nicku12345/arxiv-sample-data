A C^*-symbolic dynamical system ({\cal A}, \rho, \Sigma) is a finite family \{\rho_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in\Sigma} of endomorphisms of a C^*-algebra {\cal A} with some conditions. It yields a C^*-algebra {\cal O}_\rho from an associated Hilbert C^*-bimodule. In this paper, we will extend the notion of C^*-symbolic dynamical system to C^*-textile dynamical system ({\cal A}, \rho, \eta, {\Sigma^\rho}, {\Sigma^\eta}, \kappa) which consists of two C^*-symbolic dynamical systems ({\cal A}, \rho, {\Sigma^\rho}) and ({\cal A}, \eta, {\Sigma^\eta}) with certain commutation relations \kappa between their endomorphisms \{\rho_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \Sigma^\rho} and \{\eta_a \}_{a \in \Sigma^\eta}. C^*-textile dynamical systems yield two-dimensional subshifts and C^*-algebras {\cal O}^{\kappa}_{\rho,\eta}. We will study the structure of the algebras {\cal O}^\kappa_{\rho,\eta} and present its K-theory formulae.
