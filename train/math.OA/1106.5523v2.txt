We consider three notions of divisibility in the Cuntz semigroup of a C*-algebra, and show how they reflect properties of the C*-algebra. We develop methods to construct (simple and non-simple) C*-algebras with specific divisibility behaviour. As a byproduct of our investigations, we show that there exists a sequence (A_n) of simple unital infinite dimensional C*-algebras such that the product \prod_{n=1}^\infty A_n has a character.
