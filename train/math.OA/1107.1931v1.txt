Let \mathcal{A} be an operator algebra on a Hilbert space. We say that an element G\in {\mathcal{A}} is an all-derivable point of {\mathcal{A}} if every derivable linear mapping \phi at G (i.e. \phi(ST)=\phi(S)T+S\phi(T) for any S,T\in alg{\mathcal{N}} with ST=G) is a derivation. Suppose that \mathcal{N} is a nontrivial complete nest on a Hilbert space H. We show in this paper that G\in {alg\mathcal{N}} is an all-derivable point if and only if G\neq0.
