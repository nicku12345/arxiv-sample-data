We shall prove the following Stinespring-type theorem: there exists a triple (\pi,\mathcal{H},\mathbf{V}) associated with an unital completely positive map \Phi:\mathfrak{A}\rightarrow \mathfrak{A} on C* algebra \mathfrak{A} with unit, where \mathcal{H} is a Hilbert space, \pi:\mathfrak{A\rightarrow B}(\mathcal{H}) is a faithful representation and \mathbf{V} is a linear isometry on \mathcal{H} such that \pi(\Phi(a)=\mathbf{V}^*\pi(a)\mathbf{V} for all a belong to \mathfrak{A}. The Nagy dilation theorem, applied to isometry \mathbf{V}, allows to construct a dilation of ucp-map, \Phi, in the sense of Arveson, that satisfies ergodic properties of a \Phi -invariante state \phi on \mathfrak{A}, if \Phi admit a \phi -adjoint.
