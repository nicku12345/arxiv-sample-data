Given a von Neumann algebra M we consider the central extension E(M) of M. We introduce the topology t_c(M) on E(M) generated by a center-valued norm and prove that it coincides with the topology of convergence locally in measure on E(M) if and only if M does not have direct summands of type II. We also show that t_c(M) restricted on the set E(M)_h of self-adjoint elements of E(M) coincides with the order topology on E(M)_h if and only if M is a \sigma-finite type I_{fin} von Neumann algebra.
