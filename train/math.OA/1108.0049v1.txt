If k is an infinite cardinal, we say a C*-algebra \mathcal{A} is residually less than k dimensional, R_{<k}D, if the family of representations of \mathcal{A} on Hilbert spaces of dimension less than k separates the points of \mathcal{A}. We give characterizations of this property, and we show that if \{\mathcal{A}_{i}:i\in I\}  is a family of R_{<k}D algebras, then the free product \underset{i\in I}{\ast}\mathcal{A}_{i} is R_{<k}D. If each \mathcal{A}_{i} is unital, we give sufficient conditions, depending on the cardinal k, for the free product \underset{i\in I}{\ast_{\mathbb{C}}}\mathcal{A}_{i} in the category of unital C*-algebras to be R_{<k}D. We also give a new characterization of RFD, in terms of a lifting property, for separable C*-algebras.
