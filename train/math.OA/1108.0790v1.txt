We consider a product system over the multiplicative semigroup N^x of Hilbert bimodules which is implicit in work of S. Yamashita and of the second named author. We prove directly, using universal properties, that the associated Nica-Toeplitz algebra is an extension of the C^*-algebra Q_N introduced recently by Cuntz.
