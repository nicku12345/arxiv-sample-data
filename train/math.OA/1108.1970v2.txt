We prove that von Neumann algebras and separable nuclear C^*-algebras are stable for the Banach-Mazur cb-distance. A technical step is to show that unital almost completely isometric maps between C^*-algebras are almost multiplicative and almost selfadjoint. Also as an intermediate result, we compare the Banach-Mazur cb-distance and the Kadison-Kastler distance. Finally, we show that if two C^*-algebras are close enough for the cb-distance, then they have at most the same length.
