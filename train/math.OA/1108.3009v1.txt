In this paper, we study the existence of solutions of some kinds of operator equations via operator inequalities. First, we investigate characterizations of operator order A\geqslant B >0 and chaotic operator order log A \geqslant log B for positive definite operators A, B in terms of operator equations, and generalize the results in \cite{CSLin}. Then, we introduce applications of complete form of Furuta inequality in operator equations. Some kinds of operator equations are researched and related characterizations of solutions are proved.
