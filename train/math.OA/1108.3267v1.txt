In the present paper we introduce a certain class of non commutative Orlicz spaces, associated with arbitrary faithful normal locally-finite weights on a semi-finite von Neumann algebra M. We describe the dual spaces for such Orlicz spaces and, in the case of regular weights, we show that they can be realized as linear subspaces of the algebra of LS(M) of locally measurable operators affiliated with M.
