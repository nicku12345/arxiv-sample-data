Normalized free semi-circular random variables satisfy an upper Khintchine inequality in L_\infty. We show that this implies the corresponding upper Khintchine inequality in any noncommutative Banach function space. As applications, we obtain a very simple proof of a well-known interpolation result for row and column operator spaces and, moreover, answer an open question on noncommutative moment inequalities concerning a paper by Bekjan and Chen.
