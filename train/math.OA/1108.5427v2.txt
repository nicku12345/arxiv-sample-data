We prove that any derivation of the *-algebra LS(\mathcal{M}) of all locally measurable operators affiliated with a properly infinite von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M} is continuous with respect to the local measure topology t(\mathcal{M}). Building an extension of a derivation \delta:\mathcal{M}\longrightarrow LS(\mathcal{M}) up to a derivation from LS(\mathcal{M}) into LS(\mathcal{M}), it is further established that any derivation from \mathcal{M} into LS(\mathcal{M}) is t(\mathcal{M})-continuous.
