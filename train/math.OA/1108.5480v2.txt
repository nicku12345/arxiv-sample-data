We consider the problem of classification of invariant subspaces for the class of uniform Jordan operators. We show that given two invariant subspaces M_1 and M_2 of a uniform Jordan operator T=S(\theta)\oplus S(\theta)\oplus \ldots, the subspace M_2 belongs to the quasiaffine orbit of M_1 if and only if the restrictions T|M_1 and T|M_2 are quasisimilar and the compression T_{M_2^\perp} can be injected in the compression T_{M_1^\perp}. Our result refines previous work on the subject by Bercovici and Smotzer.
