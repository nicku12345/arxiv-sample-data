We study closedness of the range, adjointability and generalized invertibility of modular operators between Hilbert modules over locally C*-algebras of coefficients. Our investigations and the recent results of M. Frank [Characterizing C*-algebras of compact operators by generic categorical properties of Hilbert C*-modules, {\it J. K-Theory} {\bf 2} (2008), 453-462] reveal a number of equivalence properties of the category of Hilbert modules over locally C*-algebras which characterize precisely the inverse limit of C*-algebras of the C*-algebra of compact operators.
