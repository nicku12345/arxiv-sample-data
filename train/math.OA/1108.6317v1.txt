An operator algebra \mathcal{A} acting on a Hilbert space is said to have the closability property if every densely defined linear transformation commuting with \mathcal{A} is closable. In this paper we study the closability property of the von Neumann algebra consisting of the multiplication operators on L^2(\mu), and give necessary and sufficient conditions for a normal operator N such that the von Neumann algebra generated by N has the closability property. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for an operator T of class C_0 such that the algebra generated by T in the weak operator topology and the algebra H^\infty(T)=\{u(T):u\in H^\infty\} have the closability property.
