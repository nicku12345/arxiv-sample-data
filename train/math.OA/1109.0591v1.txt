In this paper we outline a recent construction of a Chern-Weil isomorphism for the equivariant Brauer group of \mathbb R^n actions on a principal torus bundle, where the target for this isomorphism is a "dimensionally reduced" \vCech cohomology group. Using this latter group, we demonstrate how to extend the induced algebra construction to algebras with a non-trivial bundle as their spectrum.
