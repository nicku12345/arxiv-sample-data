A theorem of Giesy and James states that c_0 is finitely representable in James' quasi-reflexive Banach space J_2. We extend this theorem to the pth quasi-reflexive James space J_p for each p \in (1,\infty). As an application, we obtain a new closed ideal of operators on J_p, namely the closure of the set of operators that factor through the complemented subspace (\ell_\infty^1 \oplus \ell_\infty^2 \oplus...\oplus \ell_\infty^n \oplus...)_{\ell_p} of J_p.
