Let {\cal A}_{0}(*) denote the direct sum of a certain set of UHF algebras and let {\cal A}(*)\equiv {\bf C}\oplus {\cal A}_{0}(*). We introduce a non-cocommutative comultiplication \Delta_{\phi} on {\cal A}(*), and give an example of comodule-C^{*}-algebra of the C^{*}-bialgebra ({\cal A}(*),\Delta_{\phi}). With respect to \Delta_{\phi}, we define a non-symmetric tensor product of *-representations of UHF algebras and show tensor product formulas of GNS representations by product states.
