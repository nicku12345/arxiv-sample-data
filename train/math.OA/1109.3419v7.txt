Let \mathbb B be a Lie group admitting a left-invariant negatively curved K\"ahlerian structure. Consider a strongly continuous action \alpha of \mathbb B on a Fr\'echet algebra \mathcal A. Denote by \mathcal A^\infty the associated Fr\'echet algebra of smooth vectors for the action \alpha. In the Abelian case \mathbb B=\mathbb R^{2n} and \alpha isometric, Marc Rieffel proved that Weyl's operator symbol composition formula yields a deformation through Fr\'echet algebra structures {\star_{\theta}^\alpha}_{\theta\in\mathbb R} on \mathcal A^\infty. When \mathcal A is a C^\star-algebra, every deformed algebra (\mathcal A^\infty,\star^\alpha_\theta) admits a compatible pre-C^\star-structure. In this paper, we prove both analogous statements in the general negatively curved K\"ahlerian group and (non-isometric) "tempered" action case. The construction relies on the one hand on combining a non-Abelian version of oscillatory integral on tempered Lie groups with geometrical objects coming from invariant WKB-quantization of solvable symplectic symmetric spaces, and, on the second hand, in establishing a non-Abelian version of the Calder\`on-Vaillancourt Theorem. In particular, we give an oscillating kernel formula for WKB-star products on symplectic symmetric spaces that fiber over an exponential Lie group.
