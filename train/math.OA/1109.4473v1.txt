The paper studies the K-theoretic invariants of the crossed product C^{*}-algebras associated with an important family of homeomorphisms of the tori \Bbb{T}^{n} called {\em Furstenberg transformations}. Using the Pimsner-Voiculescu theorem, we prove that given n, the K-groups of those crossed products, whose corresponding n\times n integer matrices are unipotent of maximal degree, always have the same rank a_{n}. We show using the theory developed here, together with two computing programs - included in an appendix - that a claim made in the literature about the torsion subgroups of these K-groups is false. Using the representation theory of the simple Lie algebra \frak{sl}(2,\Bbb{C}), we show that, remarkably, a_{n} has a combinatorial significance. For example, every a_{2n+1} is just the number of ways that 0 can be represented as a sum of integers between -n and n (with no repetitions). By adapting an argument of van Lint (in which he answered a question of Erd\"os), a simple, explicit formula for the asymptotic behavior of the sequence \{a_{n}\} is given. Finally, we describe the order structure of the K_{0}-groups of an important class of Furstenberg crossed products, obtaining their complete Elliott invariant using classification results of H. Lin and N. C. Phillips.
