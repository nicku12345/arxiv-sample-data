The paper is devoted to so-called local and 2-local derivations on the noncommutative Arens algebra L^\omega(M, \tau) associated with a von Neumann algebra M and a faithful normal semi-finite trace \tau. We prove that every 2-local derivation on L^\omega(M, \tau) is a spatial derivation, and if M is a finite von Neumann algebra, then each local derivation on L^\omega(M, \tau) is also a spatial derivation and every 2-local derivation on M is in fact an inner derivation.
