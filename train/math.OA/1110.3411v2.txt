We define the profinite completion of a C*-algebra, which is a pro-C*-algebra, as well as the pro-C*-algebra of a profinite group. We show that the continuous representations of the pro-C*-algebra of a profinite group correspond to the unitary representations of the group which factor through a finite group. We define natural homomorphisms from the C*-algebra of a locally compact group and its profinite completion to the pro-C*-algebra of the profinite completion of the group. We give some conditions for injectivity or surjectivity of these homomorphisms, but an important question remains open.
