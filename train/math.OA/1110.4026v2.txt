We give two new conditions on topological k-graphs that are equivalent to the Yeend's aperiodicity Condition (A). Each of the new conditions concerns finite paths rather than infinite. We use a specific example, resulting from a new construction of a twisted topological k-graph, to demonstrate the improvements achieved by the new conditions. Reducing this proof of equivalence to the discrete case also gives a new direct proof of the corresponding conditions in discrete k-graphs, where previous proofs depended on simplicity of the corresponding C^*-algebra.
