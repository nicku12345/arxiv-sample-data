We give an explicit realization of the \eta-convolution power of an A-valued distribution, as defined earlier by Anshelevich, Belinschi, Fevrier and Nica. If \eta:A\to A is completely positive and \eta\geq\operatorname{id}, we give a short proof of positivity of the \eta-convolution power of a positive distribution. Conversely, if \eta\not\geq\operatorname{id}, and s is large enough, we construct an s-tuple whose A-valued distribution is positive, but has non-positive \eta-convolution power.
