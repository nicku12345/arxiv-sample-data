We characterise the strictly closed left invariant C*-subalgebras of the C*-algebra C_b(G) of bounded continuous functions on a locally compact group G. On the dual side, we characterise the strictly closed invariant C*-subalgebras of the multiplier algebra of the reduced group C*-algebra C*_r(G) when G is amenable. In both cases, these C*-subalgebras correspond to closed subgroups of G.
