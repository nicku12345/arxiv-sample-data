In this paper we describe the amalgamated free product of two hyperfinite von Neumann algebras over a finite dimensional subalgebra. In general the free product is a finite direct sum of interpolated free group factors and a hyperfinite von Neumann algebra. We then show that the class of von Neumann algebras of this form is closed under taking amalgamated free products over finite dimensional subalgebras.
