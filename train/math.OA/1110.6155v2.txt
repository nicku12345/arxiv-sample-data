We prove that norm continuous derivations from a von Neumann algebra into the algebra of operators affiliated with its tensor square are automatically continuous for both the strong operator topology and the measure topology. Furthermore, we prove that the first continuous L^2-Betti number scales quadratically when passing to corner algebras and derive an upper bound given by Shen's generator invariant. This, in turn, yields vanishing of the first continuous L^2-Betti number for II_1 factors with property (T), for finitely generated factors with non-trivial fundamental group and for factors with property Gamma.
