There are many different crossed products by an endomorphism of a C*-algebra, and constructions by Exel and Stacey have proved particularly useful. Here we show that every Exel crossed product is isomorphic to a Stacey crossed product, though by a different endomorphism of a different C*-algebra. We apply this result to a variety of Exel systems, including those associated to shifts on the path spaces of directed graphs.
