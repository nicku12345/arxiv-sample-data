Let P \subset A be an inclusion of separable unital C*-algebras with finite Watatani index. Suppose that E \colon A \rightarrow P has the Rokhlin property, that is, there is a projection e \in A' \cap A^\infty such that E^\infty(e) = ({\rm Index}E)^{-1}1. We show that if A has nuclear dimension n, then P has nuclear dimension less than or equal to n. In particular, if an action \alpha of a finite group G on A has the Rokhlin property, then the nuclear dimension of the crossed product algebra A \rtimes_\alpha G is less than or equal to that of A.
