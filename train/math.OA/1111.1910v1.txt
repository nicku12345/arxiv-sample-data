The projective representation of groups was introduced in 1904 by Issai Schur. It differs from the normal representation of groups by a twisting factor. It starts with a group T and a scalar valued function f on T^2 satisfying the conditions: f(1,1)=1, |f(s,t)|=1, and f(r,s)f(rs,t)=f(r,st)f(s,t) for all r,s,t in T. The projective representation of T twisted by f is a unital C*-subalgebra of the C*-algebra of operators on the Hilbert space l^2(T). This representation can be used in order to construct many examples of C*-algebras. By replacing the scalars with an arbitrary unital C*-algebra (as range of f) the field of applications is enhanced in an essential way. The projective representation of groups, which we present in this paper, has some similarities with the construction of cross products with discrete groups. It opens the way to create many K-theories.   In a first section we introduce some results which are needed for this construction, which is developed in the second section. In a third section we present some examples of C*-algebras obtained by this method. Examples of a special kind (the Clifford algebras) are presented in the last section.
