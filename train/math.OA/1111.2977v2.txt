The aim of this paper is to present some properties of Choquet maximal Radon probability measures on compact, convex subsets of Hausdorff, locally convex, topological real vector spaces. Theorem 3.12 is the main result of the paper. While somewhat technical, the results here are foundational for my proof of a Stone-Weierstrass theorem for non-separable C*-algebras, in the companion paper 'On the Stone-Weierstrass theorem'.
