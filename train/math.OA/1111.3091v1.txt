A C^*-textile dynamical system ({\cal A}, \rho,\eta,\Sigma^\rho,\Sigma^\eta, \kappa) connsists of a unital C^*-algebra {\cal A}, two families of endomorphisms {\rho_\alpha}_{\alpha \in \Sigma^\rho} and {\eta_a}_{a \in \Sigma^\eta} of {\cal A} and certain commutation relations \kappa among them. It yields a two-dimensional subshift and multi structure of Hilbert C^*-bimodules, which we call a Hilbert C^*-quad module. We introduce a C^*-algebra from the Hilbert C^*-quad module as a two-dimensional analogue of Pimsner's construction of C^*-algebras from Hilbert C^*-bimodules. We study the C^*-algebras defined by the Hilbert C^*-quad modules and prove that they have universal properties subject to certain operator relations. We also present its examples arising from commuting matrices.
