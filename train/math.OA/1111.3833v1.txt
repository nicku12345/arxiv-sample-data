The carpenter problem in the context of II_1 factors, formulated by Kadison asks: Let \mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{M} be a masa in a type II_1 factor and let E be the normal conditional expectation from \mathcal{M} onto \mathcal{A}. Then, is it true that for every positive contraction A in \mathcal{A}, there is a projection P in \mathcal{M} such that E(P) = A? In this note, we show that this is true if A has finite spectrum. We will then use this result to prove an exact Schur-Horn theorem for (positive)operators with finite spectrum and an approximate Schur-Horn theorem for general (positive)operators.
