Let M_n(R) be the algebra of all n\times n matrices over a unital commutative ring R with 6 invertible. We say that A\in M_n(R) is a Jordan product determined point if for every R-module X and every symmetric R-bilinear map \{\cdot, \cdot\} : M_n(R)\times M_n(R)\to X the following two conditions are equivalent: (i) there exists a fixed element w\in X such that \{x,y\}=w whenever x\circ y=A, x,y\in M_n(R); (ii) there exists an R-linear map T:M_n(R)^2\to X such that \{x,y\}=T(x\circ y) for all x,y\in M_n(R). In this paper, we mainly prove that all the matrix units are the Jordan product determined points in M_n(R) when n\geq 3. In addition, we get some corollaries by applying the main results.
