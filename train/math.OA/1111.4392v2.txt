For special universal C^*-algebras associated to k-semigraphs we present the universal representations of these algebras, prove a Cuntz--Krieger uniqueness theorem, and compute the K-theory. These C^*-algebras seem to be the most universal Cuntz--Krieger like algebras naturally associated to k-semigraphs. For instance, the Toeplitz Cuntz algebra is a proper quotient of such an algebra.
