This paper is an attempt to find large classes of noncommutative multivariable functions g:\Omega\subset [B(\cH)^n]_1^-\to B(\cH)^n for which a reasonable operator model theory and dilation theory can be developed for the noncommutative domain g(\Omega). In other words, we want to transfer the free analogue of Nagy-Foias theory from the unit ball [B(\cH)^n]_1 to other noncommutative domains, using appropriate maps.
