We show that if E is an equivalence of upper semicontinuous Fell bundles B and C over groupoids, then there is a linking bundle L(E) over the linking groupoid L such that the full cross-sectional algebra of L(E) contains those of B and C as complementary full corners, and likewise for reduced cross-sectional algebras. We show how our results generalise to groupoid crossed-products the fact, proved by Quigg and Spielberg, that Raeburn's symmetric imprimitivity theorem passes through the quotient map to reduced crossed products.
