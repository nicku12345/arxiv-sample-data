In this note, we first work out some `bare hands' computations of the most elementary possible free products involving \mathbb{C}^2 ~(=\mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C} ) and M_2 ~(= M_2(\mathbb{C})). Using these, we identify all free products C \ast D, where C,D are of the form A_1 \oplus A_2 or M_2(B); A_1,A_2,B are finite von Neumann algebras, as is A_1 \oplus A_2 with the 'uniform trace' given by tr(a_1, a_2) = 1/2 (tr(a_1) + tr(a_2))\} and M_2(B) with the normalized trace given by tr((b_{i,j}))=1/2(tr(b_{1,1}) + tr(b_{2,2})). Those results are then used to compute various possible free products involving certain finite dimensional von-Neumann algebras, the free-group von-Neumann algebras and the hyperfinite II_1 factor. In the process, we reprove Dykema's result `R \ast R \cong LF_2'.
