Let \mathcal{S} be the semigroup \mathcal{S}=\sum^{\oplus k}_{i=1}\Sc{S}_i, where for each i\in I, \mathcal{S}_i is a countable subsemigroup of the additive semigroup \B{R}_+ containing 0. We consider representations of \mathcal{S} as contractions \{T_s\}_{s\in\mathcal{S}} on a Hilbert space with the Nica-covariance property: T_s^*T_t=T_tT_s^* whenever t\wedge s=0. We show that all such representations have a unique minimal isometric Nica-covariant dilation.   This result is used to help analyse the nonself-adjoint semicrossed product algebras formed from Nica-covariant representations of the action of \mathcal{S} on an operator algebra \mathcal{A} by completely contractive endomorphisms. We conclude by calculating the C^*-envelope of the isometric nonself-adjoint semicrossed product algebra (in the sense of Kakariadis and Katsoulis).
