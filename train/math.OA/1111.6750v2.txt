To supplement the already known classification of traces on classical pseudodifferential operators, we present a classification of traces on the algebras of odd-class pseudodifferential operators of non-positive order acting on smooth functions on a closed odd-dimensional manifold. By means of the one to one correspondence between continuous traces on Lie algebras and determinants on the associated regular Lie groups, we give a classification of determinants on the group associated to the algebra of odd-class pseudodifferential operators with fixed non-positive order. At the end we discuss two possible ways to extend the definition of a determinant outside a neighborhood of the identity on the Lie group associated to the algebra of odd-class pseudodifferential operators of order zero.
