In factoring matrices into the product of two matrices operations are typically performed with elements restricted to matrix subspaces. Such modest structural assumptions are realistic, for example, in large scale computations. This paper is concerned with analyzing associated matrix geometries. Curvature of the product of two matrix subspaces is assessed. As an analogue of the internal Zappa-Sz\'ep product of a group, the notion of factorizable matrix subspace arises. Interpreted in this way, several classical instances are encompassed by this structure. The Craig-Sakamoto theorem fits naturally into this framework.
