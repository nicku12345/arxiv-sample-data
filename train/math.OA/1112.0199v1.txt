This is a continuation of the paper entitled "Free biholomorphic functions and operator model theory", in our attempt to transfer the free analogue of Nagy-Foias theory from the unit ball [B(\cH)^n]_1 to other noncommutative domains and varieties in B(\cH)^n, using appropriate maps. The present paper treats the completely non-coisometric case and the case of noncommutative varieties.
