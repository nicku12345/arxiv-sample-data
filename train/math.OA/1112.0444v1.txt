The Banach ^{*}-algebra A\hat{\otimes}B, the operator space projective tensor product of C^{*}-algebras A and B, is shown to be ^{*}-regular if Tomiyama's property (F) holds for A\otimes_{\min}B and A \otimes_{\min}B=A \otimes_{\max}B, where \otimes_{\min} and \otimes_{\max} are the injective and projective C^{*}-cross norm, respectively. However, A\hat{\otimes}B has a unique C^{*}-norm if and only if A\otimes B has. We also discuss the property (F) of A\hat{\otimes}B and A\otimes_{h}B, the Haagerup tensor product of A and B.
