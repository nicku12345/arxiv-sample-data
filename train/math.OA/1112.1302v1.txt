Let A=U|A| and B=V|B| be the polar decompositions of A\in \mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H}_1) and B\in \mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H}_2) and let Com(A,B) stand for the set of operators X\in\mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H}_2,\mathscr{H}_1) such that AX=XB. A pair (A,B) is said to have the FP-property if Com(A,B)\subseteqCom(A^\ast,B^\ast). Let \tilde{C} denote the Aluthge transform of a bounded linear operator C. We show that (i) if A and B are invertible and (A,B) has the FP-property, then so is (\tilde{A},\tilde{B}); (ii) if A and B are invertible, the spectrums of both U and V are contained in some open semicircle and (\tilde{A},\tilde{B}) has the FP-property, then so is (A,B); (iii) if (A,B) has the FP-property, then Com(A,B)\subseteqCom(\tilde{A},\tilde{B}), moreover, if A is invertible, then Com(A,B)=Com(\tilde{A},\tilde{B}). Finally, if Re(U|A|^{1\over2})\geq a>0 and Re(V|B|^{1\over2})\geq a>0 and X is an operator such that U^* X=XV, then we prove that \|\tilde{A}^* X-X\tilde{B}\|_p\geq 2a\|\,|B|^{1\over2}X-X|B|^{1\over2}\|_p for any 1 \leq p \leq \infty.
