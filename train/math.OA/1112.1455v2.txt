We define type \mathfrak{A}, type \mathfrak{B}, type \mathfrak{C} as well as C*-semi-finite C*-algebras.   It is shown that a von Neumann algebra is a type \mathfrak{A}, type \mathfrak{B}, type \mathfrak{C} or C*-semi-finite C*-algebra if and only if it is, respectively, a type I, type II, type III or semi-finite von Neumann algebra. Any type I C*-algebra is of type \mathfrak{A} (actually, type \mathfrak{A} coincides with the discreteness as defined by Peligrad and Zsido), and any type II C*-algebra (as defined by Cuntz and Pedersen) is of type \mathfrak{B}. Moreover, any type \mathfrak{C} C*-algebra is of type III (in the sense of Cuntz and Pedersen). Furthermore, any purely infinite C*-algebra (in the sense of Kirchberg and Rordam) with real rank zero is of type \mathfrak{C}, and any separable purely infinite C*-algebra with stable rank one is also of type \mathfrak{C}.   We also prove that type \mathfrak{A}, type \mathfrak{B}, type \mathfrak{C} and C*-semi-finiteness are stable under taking hereditary C*-subalgebras, multiplier algebras and strong Morita equivalence. Furthermore, any C*-algebra A contains a largest type \mathfrak{A} closed ideal J_\mathfrak{A}, a largest type \mathfrak{B} closed ideal J_\mathfrak{B}, a largest type \mathfrak{C} closed ideal J_\mathfrak{C} as well as a largest C*-semi-finite closed ideal J_\mathfrak{sf}. Among them, we have J_\mathfrak{A} + J_\mathfrak{B} being an essential ideal of J_\mathfrak{sf}, and J_\mathfrak{A} + J_\mathfrak{B} + J_\mathfrak{C} being an essential ideal of A. On the other hand, A/J_\mathfrak{C} is always C*-semi-finite, and if A is C*-semi-finite, then A/J_\mathfrak{B} is of type \mathfrak{A}.
