A genuine infinite tensor product of complex vector spaces is a vector space {\bigotimes}_{i\in I} X_i whose linear maps coincide with multilinear maps on an infinite family \{X_i\}_{i\in I} of vector spaces. We give a direct sum decomposition of {\bigotimes}_{i\in I} X_i over a set \Omega_{I;X}, through which we obtain a more concrete description and some properties of {\bigotimes}_{i\in I} X_i. If \{A_i\}_{i\in I} is a family of unital ^*-algebras, we define, through a subgroup \Omega^{\rm ut}_{I;A}\subseteq \Omega_{I;A}, an interesting subalgebra {\bigotimes}_{i\in I}^{\rm ut} A_i. Moreover, it is shown that {\bigotimes}_{i\in I}^{\rm ut} \mathbb{C} is the group algebra of \Omega^{\rm ut}_{I;\mathbb{C}}. In general, {\bigotimes}_{i\in I}^{\rm ut} A_i can be identified with the algebraic crossed product of a cocycle twisted action of \Omega^{\rm ut}_{I;A}. If \{H_i\}_{i\in I} is a family of inner-product spaces, we define a Hilbert C^*(\Omega^{\rm ut}_{I;\mathbb{C}})-module \bar\bigotimes^{\rm mod}_{i\in I} H_i, which is the completion of a subspace {\bigotimes}_{i\in I}^{\rm unit} H_i of {\bigotimes}_{i\in I} H_i. If \chi_{\Omega^{\rm ut}_{I;\mathbb{C}}} is the canonical tracial state on C^*(\Omega^{\rm ut}_{I;\mathbb{C}}), then \bar\bigotimes^{\rm mod}_{i\in I} H_i\otimes_{\chi_{\Omega^{\rm ut}_{I;\mathbb{C}}}}\mathbb{C} is a natural dilation of the infinite direct product \prod {{\otimes}_{i\in I}} H_i as defined by J. von Neumann. We will show that the canonical representation of {\bigotimes}_{i\in I}^{\rm ut} \mathcal{L}(H_i) on \bar\bigotimes^{\phi_1}_{i\in I} H_i is injective. We will also show that if \{A_i\}_{i\in I} is a family of unital Hilbert algebras, then so is {\bigotimes}_{i\in I}^{\rm ut} A_i.
