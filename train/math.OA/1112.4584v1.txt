We define equivariant semiprojectivity for C*-algebras equipped with actions of compact groups. We prove that the following examples are equivariantly semiprojective: arbitrary finite dimensional C*-algebras with arbitrary actions of compact groups; the Cuntz algebras {\mathcal{O}}_d and extended Cuntz algebras E_d, for finite d, with quasifree actions of compact groups; the Cuntz algebra {\mathcal{O}}_{\infty} with any quasifree action of a finite group. For actions of finite groups, we prove that equivariant semiprojectivity is equivalent to a form of equivariant stability of generators and relations. We also prove that if G is finite, then C^* (G) is graded semiprojective.
