We construct and normalise intertwining operators at the level of Hilbert modules describing the principal series of SL(2). Normalisation is achieved through the use of a Fourier transform defined on some homogenous space and twisted by a Weyl element. Normalising factors are also explicitely obtained. In the appendix we relate reducibility points to a certain distribution arising from the non-normalised intertwiners.
