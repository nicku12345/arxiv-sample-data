We define the categorical cohomology of a k-graph \Lambda\ and show that the first three terms in this cohomology are isomorphic to the corresponding terms in the cohomology defined in our previous paper. This leads to an alternative characterisation of the twisted k-graph C*-algebras introduced there. We prove a gauge-invariant uniqueness theorem and use it to show that every twisted k-graph C*-algebra is isomorphic to a twisted groupoid C*-algebra. We deduce criteria for simplicity, prove a Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem and establish that all twisted k-graph C*-algebras are nuclear and belong to the bootstrap class.
