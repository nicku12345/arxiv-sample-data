We construct a family of spectral triples for the Sierpinski Gasket K. For suitable values of the parameters, we determine the dimensional spectrum and recover the Hausdorff measure of K in terms of the residue of the volume functional a\to tr(a\,|D|^{-s}) at its abscissa of convergence d_D, which coincides with the Hausdorff dimension d_H of the fractal. We determine the associated Connes' distance showing that it is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the distance on K induced by the Euclidean metric of the plane, and show that the pairing of the associated Fredholm module with (odd) K-theory is non-trivial. When the parameters belong to a suitable range, the abscissa of convergence \delta_D of the energy functional a\to tr(|D|^{-s/2}|[D,a]|^2\,|D|^{-s/2}) takes the value d_E=\frac{\log(12/5)}{\log 2}, which we call energy dimension, and the corresponding residue gives the standard Dirichlet form on K.
