We give a sufficient condition for a ^*-algebra with a specified basis to have an enveloping C^*-algebra. Particularizing to the setting of a Hecke algebra \h(G,\gm), we show that under a suitable assumption not only we can assure that an enveloping C^*-algebra C^*(G, \gm) exists, but also that it coincides with C^*(L^1(G,\gm)), the enveloping C^*-algebra of the L^1-Hecke algebra. Our methods are used to show the existence of C^*(G, \gm) and isomorphism with C^*(L^1(G,\gm)) for several classes of Hecke algebras. Most of the classes which are known to satisfy these properties are covered by this approach, and we also describe some new ones.
