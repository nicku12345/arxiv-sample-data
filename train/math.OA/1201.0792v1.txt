We establish conditions under which the universal and reduced norms coincide for a Fell bundle over a groupoid. Specifically, we prove that the full and reduced C*-algebras of any Fell bundle over a measurewise amenable groupoid coincide, and also that for a groupoid G whose orbit space is T_0, the full and reduced algebras of a Fell bundle over G coincide if the full and reduced algebras of the restriction of the bundle to each isotropy group coincide.
