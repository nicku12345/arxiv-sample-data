Let {\cal O}_{{\cal H}^{A,B}_\kappa} be the C^*-algebra associated with the Hilbert C^*-quad module arising from commuting matrices A,B with entries in \{0,1\}. We will show that if the associated tiling space X_{A,B}^\kappa is transitive, the C^*-algebra {\cal O}_{{\cal H}^{A,B}_\kappa} is simple and purely infinite. In particulr, for two positive integers N,M, the K-groups of the simple purely infinite C^*-algebra {\cal O}_{{\cal H}^{[N],[M]}_\kappa} are computed by using the Euclidean algorithm.
