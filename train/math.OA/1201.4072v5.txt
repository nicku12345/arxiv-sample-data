We study the isomorphism problem for the multiplier algebras of irreducible complete Pick kernels. These are precisely the restrictions \mathcal M_V of the multiplier algebra \mathcal M of Drury-Arveson space to a holomorphic subvariety V of the unit ball \mathbb{B}_d.   We find that \mathcal M_V is completely isometrically isomorphic to \mathcal M_W if and only if W is the image of V under a biholomorphic automorphism of the ball. In this case, the isomorphism is unitarily implemented. This is then strengthend to show that, when d<\infty, every isometric isomorphism is completely isometric.   The problem of characterizing when two such algebras are (algebraically) isomorphic is also studied. When V and W are each a finite union of irreducible varieties and a discrete variety in \mathbb{B}_d with d<\infty, then an isomorphism between \mathcal M_V and \mathcal M_W determines a biholomorphism (with multiplier coordinates) between the varieties; and the isomorphism is composition with this function. These maps are automatically weak-* continuous.   We present a number of examples showing that the converse fails in several ways. We discuss several special cases in which the converse does hold---particularly, smooth curves and Blaschke sequences.   We also discuss the norm closed algebras associated to a variety, and point out some of the differences.
