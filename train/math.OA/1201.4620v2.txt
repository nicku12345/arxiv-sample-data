In this paper we show that the universal C*-algebra satisfying the Cuntz-Li relations is generated by an inverse semigroup of partial isometries. We apply Exel's theory of tight representations to this inverse semigroup. We identify the universal C*-algebra as the C*-algebra of the tight groupoid associated to the inverse semigroup.
