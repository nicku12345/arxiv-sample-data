In this paper we investigate the normalizer \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{O}_{n}}(A) of a C^{*}-subalgebra A\subset \mathcal{F}_{n} where \mathcal{F}_{n} is the canonical UHF-subalgebra of type n^{\infty} in the Cuntz algebra \mathcal{O}_{n}. Under the assumption that the relative commutant A'\cap \mathcal{F}_{n} is finite-dimensional, we show several facts for normalizers of A. In particular it is shown that the automorphism group \{{\rm Ad}u|_{A}\ \ |\ u\in \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{F}_{n}}(A)\} has a finite index in \{{\rm Ad}U|_{A}\ \ |\ U\in \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{O}_{n}}(A)\}.
