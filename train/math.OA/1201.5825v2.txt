We derive a formula for the moments and the free cumulants of the multiplication of k free random variables in terms of k-equal and k-divisible non-crossing partitions. This leads to a new simple proof for the bounds of the right-edge of the support of the free multiplicative convolution \mu^{\boxtimes k}, given by Kargin which show that the support grows at most linearly with k. Moreover, this combinatorial approach generalize the results of Kargin since we do not require the convolved measures to be identical. We also give further applications, such as a new proof of the limit theorem of Sakuma and Yoshida.
