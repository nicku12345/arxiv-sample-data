Let \fS be an analytic free semigroup algebra. In this paper, we explore richer structures of \fS and its predual \fS_*. We prove that \fS and \fS_* both are Hopf algebras. Moreover, the structures of \fS and \fS_* are closely connected with each other: There is a bijection between the set of completely bounded representations of \fS_* and the set of corepresentations of \fS on one hand, and \fS can be recovered from the coefficient operators of completely bounded representations of \fS_* on the other hand. As an amusing application of our results, the (Gelfand) spectrum of \fS_* is identified. Surprisingly, the main results of this paper seem new even in the classical case.
