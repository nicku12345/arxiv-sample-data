We will study some modifications to the notion of an exact C*-algebra by replacing the minimal tensor product with the reduced free product. First we will demonstrate how the reduced free product of a short exact sequence of C*-algebras with another C*-algebra may be taken. It will then be demonstrated that this operation preserves exact sequences. We will also establish that adjoining arbitrary k-tuples of operators in a free way behaves well with respect to taking ultrapowers.
