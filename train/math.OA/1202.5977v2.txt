To each discrete left cancellative semigroup S one may associate a certain inverse semigroup I_l(S), often called the left inverse hull of S. We show how the full and the reduced C*-algebras of I_l(S) are related to the full and reduced semigroup C*-algebras for S recently introduced by Xin Li, and give conditions ensuring that these algebras are isomorphic. Our picture provides an enhanced understanding of Li's algebras.
