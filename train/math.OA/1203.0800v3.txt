For every p\geq 2, we give a characterization of positive definite functions on a free group with finitely many generators, which can be extended to the positive linear functionals on the free group C^*-algebra associated with the ideal \ell_p. This is a generalization of Haagerup's characterization for the case of the reduced free group C^*-algebra. As a consequence, the associated C^*-algebras are mutually non-isomorphic, and they have a unique tracial state.
