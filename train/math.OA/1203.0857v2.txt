A C*-algebra is n-homogeneous (where n is finite) if every its nonzero irreducible representation acts on an n-dimensional Hilbert space. An elementary proof of Fell's characterization of n-homogeneous C*-algebras (by means of their spectra) is presented. A spectral theorem and a functional calculus for finite systems of elements which generate n-homogeneous C*-algebras are proposed.
