The main aim of this book is to present recent results concerning inequalities for continuous functions of selfadjoint operators on complex Hilbert spaces. It is intended for use by both researchers in various fields of Linear Operator Theory and Mathematical Inequalities, domains which have grown exponentially in the last decade, as well as by postgraduate students and scientists applying inequalities in their specific areas.
