In this paper, we characterize Jordan derivable mappings in terms of Peirce decomposition and determine Jordan all-derivable points for some general bimodules. Then we generalize the results to the case of Jordan higher derivable mappings. An immediate application of our main results shows that for a nest \mathcal{N} on a Banach X with the associated nest algebra alg\mathcal{N}, if there exists a non-trivial element in \mathcal{N} which is complemented in X, then every C\in alg\mathcal{N} is a Jordan all-derivable point of L(alg\mathcal{N}, B(X)) and a Jordan higher all-derivable point of L(alg\mathcal{N}).
