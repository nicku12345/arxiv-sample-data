Let \mathcal{A} be a unital algebra, \delta be a linear mapping from \mathcal{A} into itself and m, n be fixed integers. We call \delta an (\textit{m, n})-derivable mapping at Z, if m\delta(AB)+n\delta(BA)=m\delta(A)B+mA\delta(B)+n\delta(B)A+nB\delta(A) for all A, B\in \mathcal{A} with AB=Z. In this paper, (\textit{m, n})-derivable mappings at 0 (resp. I_\mathcal{A}\oplus0, I) on generalized matrix algebras are characterized. We also study (\textit{m, n})-derivable mappings at 0 on CSL algebras. We reveal the relationship between this kind of mappings with Lie derivations, Jordan derivations and derivations.
