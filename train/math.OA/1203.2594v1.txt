For a locally compact quantum group \G with tracial Haar weight \varphi, and a quantum measure \mu on \G, we study the space {H}_\mu^p of \mu-harmonic operators in the non-commutative L^p-space {L}^p(\G) associated to the Haar weight \varphi. The main result states that if \mu is non-degenerate, then {H}_\mu^p is trivial for all 1 \leq p < \infty.
