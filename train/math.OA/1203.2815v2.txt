Given a separated graph (E,C), there are two different C*-algebras associated to it, the full graph C*-algebra C^*(E,C), and the reduced one C^*_{\text{red}} (E,C). For a large class of separated graphs (E,C), we prove that C^*_{\text{red}} (E,C) either is purely infinite simple or admits a faithful tracial state. The main tool we use to show pure infiniteness of reduced graph C*-algebras is a generalization to the amalgamated case of a result on purely infinite simple free products due to Dykema.
