In this paper we give a formula for the K-theory of the C^*-algebra of a weakly left-resolving labelled space. This is done by realising the C^*-algebra of a weakly left-resolving labelled space as the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of a C^*-correspondence. As a corollary we get a gauge invariant uniqueness theorem for the C^*-algebra of any weakly left-resolving labelled space. In order to achieve this we must modify the definition of the C^*-algebra of a weakly left-resolving labelled space.   We also establish strong connections between the various classes of C^*-algebras which are associated with shift spaces and labelled graph algebras. Hence, by computing the K-theory of a labelled graph algebra we are providing a common framework for computing the K-theory of graph algebras, ultragraph algebras, Exel-Laca algebras, Matsumoto algebras and the C^*-algebras of Carlsen.   We provide an inductive limit approach for computing the K-groups of an important class of labelled graph algebras, and give examples.
