If A is a \sigma-unital C^*-algebra and a is a strictly positive element of A then for every compact subset K of the complete regularization \mathrm{Glimm}(A) of \mathrm{Prim}(A) there exists \alpha > 0 such that K\subset \{G\in \mathrm{Glimm}(A) \mid \|a + G\|\geq \alpha\}. This extends a 1974 result of J. Dauns to all \sigma-unital C^*-algebras. However, there is a C^*-algebra A and a compact subset of \mathrm{Glimm}(A) that is not contained in any set of the form \{G\in \mathrm{Glimm}(A) \mid \|a + G\|\geq \alpha\}, a\in A and \alpha > 0.
