Let {\cal A}_1 be the class of all unital separable simple C^*-algebras A such that A\otimes U has tracial rank at most one for all UHF-algebras of infinite type. It has been shown that amenable {\cal Z}-stable C^*-algebras in {\cal A}_1 which satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem can be classified up to isomorphism by the Elliott invariant. We show that A\in {\cal A}_1 if and only if A\otimes B has tracial rank at most one for one of unital simple infinite dimensional AF-algebra B. In fact, we show that A\in {\cal A}_1 if and only if A\otimes B\in {\cal A}_1 for some unital simple AH-algebra B. Other results regarding the tensor products of C^*-algebras in {\cal A}_1 are also obtained
