We develop some tools for manipulating and constructing projections in C*-algebras. These are then applied to give short proofs of some standard projection homotopy results, as well as strengthen some fundamental classical results for C*-algebras of real rank zero, specifically on liftings, excising pure states and Kadison's transitivity theorem. Lastly, we investigate some order properties of the set of projections in C*-algebras of real rank zero, building on our previous work.
