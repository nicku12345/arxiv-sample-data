In this paper we introduce a notion of Morita equivalence for Hilbert C*-modules in terms of the Morita equivalence of the algebras of compact operators on Hilbert C*-modules. We investigate some properties of the new version of Morita equivalence and obtain some results. We then applied our results to study the continuous actions of locally compact groups on full Hilbert C*-modules. We present an extension of Green's theorem in the context of Hilbert C*-modules as well.
