We consider a free action of an Ore semigroup on a higher-rank graph, and the induced action by endomorphisms of the C^*-algebra of the graph. We show that the crossed product by this action is stably isomorphic to the C^*-algebra of a quotient graph. Our main tool is Laca's dilation theory for endomorphic actions of Ore semigroups on C^*-algebras, which embeds such an action in an automorphic action of the enveloping group on a larger C^*-algebra.
