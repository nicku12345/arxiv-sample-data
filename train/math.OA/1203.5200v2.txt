We extend the Nonconventional Ergodic Theorem for generic measures by Furstenberg, to several situations of interest arising from quantum dynamical systems. We deal with the diagonal state canonically associated to the product state (i.e. quantum "diagonal measures"), or to convex combinations of diagonal measures for non ergodic cases. For the sake of completeness, we treat also the Nonconventional Ergodic Theorem for compact dynamical systems, that is when the unitary generating the dynamics in the GNS representation is almost periodic. The Nonconventional Ergodic Theorem allows in a natural way to determine the limit of the three-point correlations, naturally relevant for the knowledge of the ergodic properties of a dynamical system.
