We present several matrix and operator inequalities of Hermite-Hadamard type. We first establish a majorization version for monotone convex functions on matrices. We then utilize the Mond-Pecaric method to get an operator version for convex functions. We also present some applications. Finally we obtain an Hermite-Hadamard inequality for operator convex functions, positive linear maps and operators acting on Hilbert spaces.
