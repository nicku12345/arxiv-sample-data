Noncommutative domain algebras are noncommutative analogues of the algebras of holomorphic functions on domains of \C^n defined by holomorphic polynomials, and they generalize the noncommutative Hardy algebras. We present here a complete classification of these algebras based upon techniques inspired by multivariate complex analysis, and more specifically the classification of domains in hermitian spaces up to biholomorphic equivalence.
