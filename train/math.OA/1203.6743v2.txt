We show that for every mixing orthogonal representation \pi : \Z \to \mathcal O(H_\R), the abelian subalgebra \LL(\Z) is maximal amenable in the crossed product {\rm II}_1 factor \Gamma(H_\R)\dpr \rtimes_\pi \Z associated with the free Bogoljubov action of the representation \pi. This provides uncountably many non-isomorphic A-A-bimodules which are disjoint from the coarse A-A-bimodule and of the form \LL^2(M \ominus A) where A \subset M is a maximal amenable masa in a {\rm II_1} factor.
