Denote by J the operator of coefficient stripping. We show that for any free convolution semigroup of measures \nu_t with finite variance, applying a single stripping produces semicircular evolution with non-zero initial condition, J[\nu_t] = \rho \boxplus \sigma^{\boxplus t}, where \sigma is the semicircular distribution with mean \beta and variance \gamma. For more general freely infinitely divisible distributions \tau, expressions of the form \rho \boxplus \tau^{\boxplus t} arise from stripping \mu_t, where the pairs (\mu_t, \nu_t) form a semigroup under the operation of two-state free convolution. The converse to this statement holds in the algebraic setting. Numerous examples illustrating these constructions are computed. Additional results include the formula for generators of such semigroups.
