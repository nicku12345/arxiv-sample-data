Let \mathcal{M} be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a faithful normal semi-finite trace \tau and let S_0(\tau) be the algebra of all \tau-compact operators affiliated with \mathcal{M}. Let E(\tau)\subseteq S_0(\tau) be a symmetric operator space (on \mathcal{M}) and let \mathcal{E} be a symmetrically-normed Banach ideal of \tau-compact operators in \mathcal{M}. We study (i) derivations \delta on \mathcal{M} with the range in E(\tau) and (ii) derivations on the Banach algebra \mathcal{E}. In the first case our main results assert that such derivations are continuous (with respect to the norm topologies) and also inner (under some mild assumptions on E(\tau)). In the second case we show that any such derivation is necessarily inner when \mathcal{M} is a type I factor. As an interesting application of our results for the case (i) we deduce that any derivation from \mathcal{M} into an L_p-space, L_p(\mathcal{M},\tau), (1<p<\infty) associated with \mathcal{M} is inner.
