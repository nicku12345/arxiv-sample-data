Let \mathcal{I,J} be symmetric quasi-Banach ideals of compact operators on an infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space H, let \mathcal{J:I} be a space of multipliers from \mathcal{I} to \mathcal{J}. Obviously, ideals \mathcal{I} and \mathcal{J} are quasi-Banach algebras and it is clear that ideal \mathcal{J} is a bimodule for \mathcal{I}. We study the set of all derivations from \mathcal{I} into \mathcal{J}. We show that any such derivation is automatically continuous and there exists an operator a\in\mathcal{J:I} such that \delta(\cdot)=[a,\cdot], moreover \|a\|_{\mathcal{B}(H)}\leq\|\delta\|_\mathcal{I\to J}\leq 2C\|a\|_\mathcal{J:I}, where C is the modulus of concavity of the quasi-norm \|\cdot\|_\mathcal{J}. In the special case, when \mathcal{I=J=K}(H) is a symmetric Banach ideal of compact operators on H our result yields the classical fact that any derivation \delta on \mathcal{K}(H) may be written as \delta(\cdot)=[a,\cdot], where a is some bounded operator on H and \|a\|_{\mathcal{B}(H)}\leq\|\delta\|_\mathcal{I\to I}\leq 2\|a\|_{\mathcal{B}(H)}.
