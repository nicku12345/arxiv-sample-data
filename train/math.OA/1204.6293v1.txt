We calculate the Fuglede-Kadison determinant for operators of the form \sum_{i=1}^n M_{f_i}L_{g_i} where L_{g_i} are unitaries or partial isometries coming from Borel (partial) isomorphisms g_i on a probability space which generate an ergodic equivalence relation, and M_{f_i} are multiplication operators. We obtain formulas for the cases when the relation is treeable or the f_i's and g_i's satisfy some restrictions.
