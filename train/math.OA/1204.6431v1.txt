Larsen has recently extended Exel's construction of crossed products from single endomorphisms to abelian semigroups of endomorphisms, and here we study two families of her crossed products. First, we look at the natural action of the multiplicative semigroup \mathbb{N}^\times on a compact abelian group \Gamma, and the induced action on C(\Gamma). We prove a uniqueness theorem for the crossed product, and we find a class of connected compact abelian groups \Gamma for which the crossed product is purely infinite simple. Second, we consider some natural actions of the additive semigroup \mathbb{N}^2 on the UHF cores in 2-graph algebras, as introduced by Yang, and confirm that these actions have properties similar to those of single endomorphisms of the core in Cuntz algebras.
