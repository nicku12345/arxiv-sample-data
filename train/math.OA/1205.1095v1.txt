Let {\mathcal M} be a von Neumann algebra without central summands of type I_1 and \xi\in{\mathbb C} a scalar. It is shown that an additive map L on \mathcal M satisfies L(AB-\xi BA)=L(A)B-\xi BL(A)+L(B)A-\xi AL(B) whenever A,B\in{\mathcal M} with AB=0 if and only if one of the following statements holds: (1) \xi=1, L=\varphi+f, where \varphi is an additive derivation on \mathcal M and f is an additive map from \mathcal M into its center vanishing on [A,B] with AB=0; (2)   \xi=0, L(I)\in{\mathcal Z}({\mathcal M}) and there exists an additive derivation \varphi such that L(A)=\varphi(A)+L(I)A for all A; (3) \xi=-1, L is a Jordan derivation; (4) \xi is rational and \xi\not=0, \pm1, L is an additive derivation; (5) \xi is not rational, there exists an additive derivation \varphi satisfying \varphi(\xi I)=\xi L(I) such that L(A)=\varphi(A) + L(I)A for all A \in{\mathcal M}. A linear map L on \mathcal M satisfies L(AB-\xi BA)=L(A)B-\xi BL(A)+L(B)A-\xi AL(B) whenever A,B\in{\mathcal M} with AB=0 if and only if there exists a T\in\mathcal M and a linear map f:{\mathcal M}\rightarrow{\mathcal Z}({\mathcal M}) vanishing on [A,B] with AB=0 such that (i) \xi=1, L(A)=AT-TA+f(A) for all A\in\mathcal M; (ii) \xi=0, L(I)\in{\mathcal Z}({\mathcal M}) and L(A)=AT-(T-L(I))A for all A\in{\mathcal M}; (iii) \xi\not=0,1, L(A)=AT-TA for all A \in{\mathcal M}.
