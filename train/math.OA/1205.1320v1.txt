Let (X_A,\sigma_A) be the right one-sided topological Markov shift for an irreducible matrix with entries in \{0,1\}, and \Gamma_A the continuous full group of (X_A,\sigma_A). For two irreducible matrices A and B with entries in \{0,1\}, it will be proved that the continuous full groups \Gamma_A and \Gamma_B are isomorphic as abstract groups if and only if their one-sided topological Markov shifts (X_A,\sigma_A) and (X_B,\sigma_B) are continuously orbit equivalent.
