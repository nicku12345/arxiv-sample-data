Let (A, \alpha) and (B, \beta) be C*-dynamical systems where \alpha and \beta are arbitrary *-endomorphisms. When \alpha is injective or surjective, we show that the semicrossed products A \times_\alpha \mathbb{Z} and B \times_\beta \mathbb{Z} are isometrically isomorphic if and only if (A, \alpha) and (B, \beta) are outer conjugate. This conclusion also holds in various other cases as well.
