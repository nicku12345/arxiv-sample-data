We show that every point x_0\in [0,1] carries a representation of a C^*-algebra that encodes the orbit structure of the linear mod 1 interval map f_{\beta,\alpha}(x)=\beta x +\alpha. Such C^*-algebra is generated by partial isometries arising from the subintervals of monotonicity of the underlying map f_{\beta,\alpha}. Then we prove that such representation is irreducible. Moreover two such of representations are unitarily equivalent if and only if the points belong to the same generalized orbit, for every \alpha\in [0,1[ and \beta\geq 1.
