Let \mathcal{A} be a commutative AW^*-algebra, let S(\mathcal{A}) be the *-algebra of all measurable operators affiliated with \mathcal{A}, let \mathcal{I} be an ideal in \mathcal{A}, let s(\mathcal{I}) be the support of the ideal \mathcal{I} and let \mathbb{Y} be a solid subspace in S(\mathcal{A}). The necessary and sufficient conditions of existence of non-zero band preserving derivations from \mathcal{I} to \mathbb{Y} are given. We show that, in case when \mathbb{Y}\subset\mathcal{A}, or \mathbb{Y} is a quasi-normed solid space, any band preserving derivation from \mathcal{I} into \mathbb{Y} is always trivial. At the same time, there exist non-zero band preserving derivations from \mathcal{I} with values in S(\mathcal{A}), if and only if the Boolean algebra of all projections from the AW^*-algebra s(\mathcal{I})\mathcal{A} is not \sigma-distributive.
