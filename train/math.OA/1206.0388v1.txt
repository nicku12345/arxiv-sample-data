We generalize Kirchberg's weak exactness to inclusions of C*-algebras in von Neumann algebras and study some characterizations and permanence properties which are similar to those of exact groups. We then consider a similar condition to Ozawa's condition (AO) with our weak exactness and generalize Ozawa's theorem for bi-exact groups. As a corollary, we give new examples of prime factors.
