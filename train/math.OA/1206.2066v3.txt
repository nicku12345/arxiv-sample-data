Given groupoids G and H and a (G,H)-equivalence X we may form the transformation groupoid G\ltimes X\rtimes H. Given a separable groupoid dynamical system (A,G\ltimes X\rtimes H,\omega) we may restrict \omega to an action of G\ltimes X on A and form the crossed product A\rtimes G\ltimes X. We show that there is an action of H on A\rtimes G\ltimes X and that the iterated crossed product (A\rtimes G\ltimes X)\rtimes H is naturally isomorphic to the crossed product A\rtimes (G\ltimes X\rtimes H).
