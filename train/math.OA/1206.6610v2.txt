Let C=C(X) be the unital C^*-algebra of all continuous functions on a finite CW complex X and let A be a unital simple C^*-algebra with tracial rank at most one. We show that two unital monomorphisms \phi, \psi: C\to A are asymptotically unitarily equivalent, i.e., there exists a continuous path of unitaries \{u_t: t\in [0,1)\}\subset A such that      \lim_{t\to 1} u_t^*\phi(f)u_t=\psi(f) {\rm for all} \in C(X),    if and only if \beq [\phi]&=&[\psi] {\rm in} KK(C, A), \tau\circ \phi&=&\tau\circ \psi {\rm for all} \tau\in T(A), and \phi^{\dag}&=&\psi^{\dag}, \eneq where T(A) is the simplex of tracial states of A and \phi^{\dag}, \psi^{\dag}: U(M_{\infty}(C))/DU(M_{\infty}(C))\to U(M_{\infty}(A))/DU(M_{\infty}(A)) are induced homomorphisms and where U(M_{\infty}(A)) and U(M_{\infty}(C)) are groups of union of unitary groups of M_k(A) and M_k(C) for all integer k\ge 1, DU(M_{\infty}(A)) and DU(M_{\infty}(C)) are commutator subgroups of U(M_{\infty}(A)) and U(M_{\infty}(C)), respectively. We actually prove a more general result for the case that C is any general unital AH-algebra.
