A notion of super operator system is defined which generalizes the usual notion of operator systems to include certain unital involutive operator spaces which cannot be represented completely isometric as a concrete operator system on some Hilbert space. They can nevertheless be represented by bounded operators on a standard Z_2-graded Hilbert space equipped with a superinvolution. We apply this theory to investigate on the relation between certain tensor products defined for operator spaces and C^*-algebras, such as the projective tensor product, the Haagerup tensor product and the maximal C^*-tensor product.
