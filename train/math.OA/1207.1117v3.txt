In this paper we describe the amalgamated free product of finite and semifinite hyperfinite von Neumann algebras over atomic type I subalgebras. To do this we extend the notions of free dimension and standard embeddings used in the related results for finite von Neumann algebras to ones which work better for the semifinite case. We also define classes R3 (of finite von Neumann algebras) and R4 (of semifinite von Neumann algebras) which are closed under such amalgamated free products.
