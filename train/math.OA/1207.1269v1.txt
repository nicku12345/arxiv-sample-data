Every differential subalgebra of a unital C^*-algebra is spectrally invariant. We derive a quantitative version of this well-known fact and show that a minimal amount of smoothness, as given by a differential norm, already implies norm control. We obtain an explicit estimate for the differential norm of an invertible element a. This estimate depends only on the condition number of a and the ratio of two norms.
