The noncommutative Choquet boundary and the C*-envelope of operator systems of the form Span{1,T,T*}, where T is a Hilbert space operator with normal-like features, are studied. Such operators include normal operators, k-normal operators, subnormal operators, and Toeplitz operators. Our main result is the determination of the noncommutative Choquet boundary for an operator system generated by an irreducible periodic weighted unilateral shift operator.
