Subfactors where the initial branching point of the principal graph is 3-valent are subject to strong constraints called triple point obstructions. Since more complicated initial branches increase the index of the subfactor, triple point obstructions play a key role in the classification of small index subfactors. There are two strong triple point obstructions called the triple-single obstruction and the quadratic tangles obstruction. Although these obstructions are very closely related, neither is strictly stronger. In this paper we give a more general triple-point obstruction which subsumes both. The techniques are a mix of planar algebraic and connection-theoretic techniques with the key role played by the rotation operator.
