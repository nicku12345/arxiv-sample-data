In the third and latest paper in this series, we recover the imprimitivity theorems of Mansfield and Fell using our technique of Fell bundles over groupoids. Also, we apply the Rieffel Surjection of the first paper in the series to relate our version of Mansfield's theorem to that of an Huef and Raeburn, and to give an automatic amenability result for certain transformation Fell bundles.
