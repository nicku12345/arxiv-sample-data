Suppose G is a second countable, locally compact Hausdorff groupoid with abelian stabilizer subgroups and a Haar system. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the groupoid C^*-algebra to have Hausdorff spectrum. In particular we show that the spectrum of C^*(G) is Hausdorff if and only if the stabilizers vary continuously with respect to the Fell topology, the orbit space G^{(0)}/G is Hausdorff, and, given convergent sequences \chi_i\to \chi and \gamma_i\cdot\chi_i \to \omega in the dual stabilizer groupoid \hat{S} where the \gamma_i\in G act via conjugation, if \chi and \omega are elements of the same fiber then \chi = \omega
