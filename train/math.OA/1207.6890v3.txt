In this short note, we prove that for a C^*-algebra \aa generated by n elements, M_{k}(\tilde{\aa}) is generated by k mutually unitarily equivalent and almost mutually orthogonal projections for any k\ge \de(n)=\min\big\{k\in\mathbb N\,|\,(k-1)(k-2)\ge 2n\big\}. Then combining this result with recent works of Nagisa, Thiel and Winter on the generators of C^*--algebras, we show that for a C^*-algebra \aa generated by finite number of elements, there is d\ge 3 such that M_d(\tilde A) is generated by three mutually unitarily equivalent and almost mutually orthogonal projections. Furthermore, for certain separable purely infinite simple unital C^*--algebras and AF--algebras, we give some conditions that make them be generated by three mutually unitarily equivalent and almost mutually orthogonal projections.
