We introduce the notion of a Jordan triple module and determine the precise conditions under which every derivation from a JB*-triple E into a Banach (Jordan) triple E-module is continuous. In particular, every derivation from a real or complex JB*-triple into its dual space is automatically continuous. Among the consequences, we prove that every triple derivation from a C*-algebra A to a Banach triple A-module is continuous. In particular, every Jordan derivation from A to a Banach A-bimodule is a derivation, a result which complements a classical theorem due to B.E. Johnson and solves a problem which has remained open for over ten years.
