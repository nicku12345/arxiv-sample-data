We study the space of irreducible representations of a crossed product C*-algebra AxG, where G is a finite group. We construct a space \Gamma which consists of pairs of irreducible representations of A and irreducible projective representations of subgroups of G. We show that there is a natural action of G on \Gamma and that the orbit space G \ \Gamma corresponds bijectively to the dual of AxG.
