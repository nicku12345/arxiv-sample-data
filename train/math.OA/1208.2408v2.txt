For a C^*-algebra \mathcal A and a von Neumann algebra \mathcal R, we describe the predual of space D(\mathcal A,\mathcal R) of decomposable maps from \mathcal A into \mathcal R equipped with decomposable norm. This predual is found to be the matrix regular operator space structure on \mathcal A \otimes \mathcal R_* with a certain universal property. Its matrix norms are the largest and its positive cones on each matrix level are the smallest among all possible matrix regular operator space structures on \mathcal A \otimes \mathcal R_* under the two natural restrictions: (1) |x \otimes y| \le |x| |y| for x\in M_k(\mathcal A), y \in M_l(\mathcal R_*) and (2) v \otimes w is positive if v \in M_k(\mathcal A)^+ and w \in M_l(\mathcal R_*)^+.
