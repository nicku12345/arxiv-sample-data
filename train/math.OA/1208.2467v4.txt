We consider a countable discrete group G acting ergodicaly and a.e. freely, by measure-preserving transformations, on an infinite measure space (\mathcal X,\nu) with \sigma-finite measure \nu. Let \Gamma \subseteq G be an almost normal subgroup with fundamental domain F\subseteq \mathcal X  of finite measure. Let \mathcal R_G be the countable measurable equivalence relation on \mathcal X determined by the orbits of G. Let \mathcal R_G| F be its restriction to F.   We find an explicit presentation, by generators and relations, for the von Neumann algebra associated, by the Feldman-Moore (\cite{FM}) construction, to the relation \mathcal R_G|_F. The generators of the relation \mathcal R_G|_F are a set of transformations of the quotient space F\cong \mathcal X/ \Gamma, in a one to one correspondence with the cosets of \Gamma in G. We prove that the composition formula for these transformations is an averaged version, with coefficients in L^\infty(F,\nu), of the Hecke algebra product formula (\cite{BC}).   In the situation G = PGL_2(\mathbb Z[\frac1p]), \Gamma=PSL_2(\mathbb Z), p\geq 3 prime number, the relation \mathcal R_G|_F is the equivalence relation associated to a free, measure-preserving action of a free group on (p+1)/2 generators on F (\cite{Ad},\cite {Hj}). We use the coset representations of the transformations generating \mathcal R_G|_F to find a canonical treeing (\cite{Ga}).
