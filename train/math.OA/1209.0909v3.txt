A few years ago, Richard Kadison thoroughly analysed the diagonals of projection operators on Hilbert spaces and asked the following question: Let \mathcal{A} be a masa in a type II_1 factor \mathcal{M} and let A \in \mathcal{A} be a positive contraction. Letting E be the canonical normal conditional expectation from \mathcal{M} to \mathcal{A}, can one find a projection P \in \mathcal{M} so that [E(P) = A?] In a later paper, Kadison and Arveson, as an extension, conjectured a Schur-Horn theorem in type II_1 factors. In this paper, I give a proof of this conjecture of Arveson and Kadison. I also prove versions of the Schur-Horn theorem for type II_{\infty} and type III factors as well as finite von Neumann algebras.
