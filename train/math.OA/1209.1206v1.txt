We prove the regularity of the \eta function for classical pseudodifferential operators with Shubin symbols. We recall the construction of complex powers and of the Wodzicki and Kontsevich-Vishik functionals for classical symbols on \mathbb{R}^{n} with these symbols. We then define the \zeta and \eta functions associated to suitable elliptic operators. We compute the K_{0} group of the algebra of zero-order operators and use this knowledge to show that the Wodzicki trace of the idempotents in the algebra vanishes. From this, it follows that the \eta function is regular at 0 for any self-adjoint elliptic operator of positive order.
