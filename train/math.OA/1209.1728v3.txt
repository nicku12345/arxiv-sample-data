We consider some conditions similar to Ozawa's condition (AO), and prove that if a non-injective factor satisfies such a condition and has the W*CBAP, then it has no Cartan subalgebras. As a corollary, we prove that \rm II_1 factors of universal orthogonal and unitary discrete quantum groups have no Cartan subalgebras. We also prove that continuous cores of type \rm III_1 factors with such a condition are semisolid as a \rm II_\infty factor.
