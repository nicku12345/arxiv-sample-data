We show that a simple separable unital nuclear nonelementary C^*-algebra whose tracial state space has a compact extreme boundary with finite covering dimension admits uniformly tracially large order zero maps from matrix algebras into its central sequence algebra. As a consequence, strict comparison implies \Z-stability for these algebras.
