We prove several results of the following general form: automorphisms of (or actions of {\mathbb{Z}}^d on) certain kinds of simple separable unital C*-algebras A which have a suitable version of the Rokhlin property are generic among all automorphisms (or actions), or in a suitable class of automorphisms. That is, the ones with the version of the Rokhlin property contain a dense G_{\delta}-subset of the set of all such automorphisms (or actions).   Specifically, we prove the following. If A is stable under tensoring with the Jiang-Su algebra Z, and has tracial rank zero, then automorphisms with the tracial Rokhlin property are generic. If A has tracial rank zero, or, more generally, A is tracially approximately divisible together with a technical condition, then automorphisms with the tracial Rokhlin property are generic among the approximately inner automorphisms. If A is stable under tensoring with the Cuntz algebra {\mathcal{O}}_{\infty} or with a UHF algebra of infinite type, then actions of {\mathbb{Z}}^d on A with the Rokhlin property are generic among all actions of {\mathbb{Z}}^d. We further give a related but more restricted result for actions of finite groups.
