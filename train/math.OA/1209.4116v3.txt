A conjecture of Kadison and Kastler from 1972 asks whether sufficiently close operator algebras in a natural uniform sense must be small unitary perturbations of one another. For n\geq 3 and a free ergodic probability measure preserving action of SL_n(\mathbb Z) on a standard nonatomic probability space (X,\mu), write M=((L^\infty(X,\mu)\rtimes SL_n(\mathbb Z))\,\overline{\otimes}\, R, where R is the hyperfinite II_1 factor. We show that whenever M is represented as a von Neumann algebra on some Hilbert space \mathcal H and N\subseteq\mathcal B(\mathcal H) is sufficiently close to M, then there is a unitary u on \mathcal H close to the identity operator with uMu^*=N. This provides the first nonamenable class of von Neumann algebras satisfying Kadison and Kastler's conjecture.   We also obtain stability results for crossed products L^\infty(X,\mu)\rtimes\Gamma whenever the comparison map from the bounded to usual group cohomology vanishes in degree 2 for the module L^2(X,\mu). In this case, any von Neumann algebra sufficiently close to such a crossed product is necessarily isomorphic to it. In particular, this result applies when \Gamma is a free group.
