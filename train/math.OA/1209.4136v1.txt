We shall introduce the approximate representability and the Rohlin property for coactions of a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra on a unital C^*-algebra and discuss some basic properties of approximately representable coactions and coactions with the Rohlin property of a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra on a unital C^*-algebra. Also, we shall give an example of an approximately representable coaction of a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra on a simple unital C^*-algebra which has also the Rohlin property and we shall give the 1-cohomology vanishing theorem for coactions of a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra on a unital C^*-algebra and the 2-cohomology vanishing theorem for twisted coactions of a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra on a unital C^*-algebra. Furthermore, we shall introduce the notion of the approximately unitary equivalence of coactions of a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra H on a unital C^*-algebra A and show that if \rho and \sigma, coactions of H on a separable unital C^*-algebra A, which have the Rohlin property, are approximately unitarily equivalent, then there is an approximately inner automorphism \alpha on A such that \sigma=(\alpha\otimes\id)\circ\rho\circ\alpha^{-1}.
