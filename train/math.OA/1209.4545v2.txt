Let \MCZK, denote the multiplier algebra over \CZK, the algebra of continuous functions into the compact operators with spectrum the infinite product of two-spheres. We consider multiplier projections in \MCZK of a certain diagonal form. We show that, while for each multiplier projection Q of the special form, we have that Q(x)\in\BH\setminus \KK for all x\in \prod_{j=1}^\infty S^2, the ideal generated by Q in \MCZK might be proper. We further show that the ideal generated by a multiplier projection of the special form is proper if and only if the projection is stably finite.
