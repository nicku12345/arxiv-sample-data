We give an account of the theory of E_0-semigroups. We first focus on Arveson's contributions to the field and related results. Then we present the recent development of type II and type III E_0-semigroups. We also include a short note in Appendix, based on Arveson's observation, on noncommutative Poisson boundaries.
