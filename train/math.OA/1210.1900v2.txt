The paper is devoted to 2-local derivations on matrix algebras over commutative regular algebras. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on a commutative regular algebra to admit 2-local derivations which are not derivations. We prove that every 2-local derivation on a matrix algebra over a commutative regular algebra is a derivation. We apply these results to 2-local derivations on algebras of measurable and locally measurable operators affiliated with type I von Neumann algebras.
