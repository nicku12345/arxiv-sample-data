We introduce a class of generalized universal irrational rotation C^*-algebras A_{\theta,\gamma}=C^*(x,w) which is characterized by the relations w^*w=ww^*=1, x^*x=\gamma(w), xx^*=\gamma(e^{-2\pi i\theta}w), and xw=e^{-2\pi i\theta}wx, where \theta is an irrational number and \gamma(z)\in C(\mathbb{T}) is a positive function. We characterize tracial linear functionals, simplicity, and K-groups of A_{\theta,\gamma} in terms of zero points of \gamma(z). We show that if A_{\theta,\gamma} is simple then A_{\theta,\gamma} is an A{\mathbb T}-algebra of real rank zero. We classify A_{\theta,\gamma} in terms of \theta and zero points of \gamma(z). Let A_\theta=C^*(u,v) be the universal irrational rotation C^*-algebra with vu=e^{2\pi i\theta}uv.   Then C^*(u+v)\cong A_{\theta,|1+z|^2}. As an application, we show that C^*(u+v) is a proper simple C^*-subalgebra of A_\theta which has a unique trace, K_1(C^*(u+v))\cong \mathbb{Z}, and there is an order isomorphism of K_0(C^*(u+v)) onto \mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}\theta. {Moreover, C^*(u+v) is a unital simple A{\mathbb T}-algebra of real rank zero.} We also calculate the spectrum and the Brown measure of u+v.
