The aim of this article is to extend the results of Asadi M.B, B.V.R. Bhat, G. Ramesh, K. Sumesh about completely positive maps on Hilbert C*-modules. We prove a Stinespring type theorem for a finite family of completely positive maps on Hilbert C*-modules. We also show that any two minimal Stinespring representations are unitarily equivalent.
