We construct spectral triples for path spaces of stationary Bratteli diagrams and study their associated mathematical objects, in particular their zeta function, their heat kernel expansion and their Dirichlet forms. One of the main difficulties to properly define a Dirichlet form concerns its domain. We address this question in particular in the context of Pisot substitution tiling spaces for which we find two types of Dirichlet forms: one of transversal type, and one of longitudinal type. Here the eigenfunctions under the translation action can serve as a good core for a non-trivial Dirichlet form. We find that the infinitesimal generators can be interpreted as elliptic differential operators on the maximal equicontinuous factor of the tiling dynamical system.
