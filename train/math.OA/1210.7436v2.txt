We present more planar algebraic construction of subfactors than those of Guionet-Jones-Shlyakhtenko-Walker and Kodiyalam-Sunder which start from a subfactor planar algebra and give in a direct way a subfactor of the same standard invariant with the planar algebra. Our construction is based on using the ordinary concepts in planar algebras such as involution, inclusion and conditional expectation mappings as it is
