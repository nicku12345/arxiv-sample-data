Let \Gamma be a countable discrete group. We show that \Gamma has the approximation property if and only if \Gamma is exact and for any operator space S \subseteq \K(H) we have \Cu(\Gamma)^{\Gamma} \otimes S = (\Cu(\Gamma) \otimes S)^{\Gamma}, where \Cu(\Gamma) is the uniform Roe algebra with the right adjoint \Gamma-action. This answers a question of J. Zacharias. We also show that characterisations of several properties of \Gamma in terms of the reduced group \cast-algebra apply to the invariant uniform Roe algebra \Cu(\Gamma)^{\Gamma}.
