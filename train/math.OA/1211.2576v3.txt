We begin this note with a von Neumann algebraic version of the elementary but extremely useful fact about being able to extend inner-product preserving maps from a total set of the domain Hilbert space to an isometry defined on the entire domain. This leads us to the notion of when `good' endomorphisms of a factorial probability space (M,\phi) (which we call equi-modular) admit a natural extension to endomorphisms of L^2(M,\phi). We exhibit examples of such extendable endomorphisms.   We then pass to E_0-semigroups \alpha = {\alpha_t: t \geq 0} of factors, and observe that extendability of this semigroup (i.e., extendability of each \alpha_t) is a cocycle-conjugacy invariant of the semigroup. We identify a necessary condition for extendability of such an E_0-semigroup, which we then use to show that the Clifford flow on the hyperfinite II_1 factor is not extendable.
