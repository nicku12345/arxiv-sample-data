Tracial Rokhlin property was introduced by Phillips to prove various structure theorems for crossed product. But it is defined for actions on simple C*-algebras only. This paper consists of two major parts: In section 2 and 3, we study the permanence properties and give a complete classification of tracial Rokhlin property for product-type actions; In section 4 and 5, we introduce the weak tracial Rokhlin property for actions on non-simple C*-algebras. We prove that when the action has the weak tracial Rokhlin property and the crossed product is simple, the properties on A of having tracial rank \leq k, or real rank 0, or stable rank 1, can be inherited by the crossed product.
