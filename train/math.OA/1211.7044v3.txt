We observe that a recent theorem of Sato, Toms-White-Winter and Kirchberg-Rordam also holds for certain nonunital C*-algebras. Namely, we show that an algebraically simple, separable, nuclear, nonelementary C*-algebra with strict comparison, whose cone of densely finite traces has as a base a Choquet simplex with compact, finite dimensional extreme boundary, and which admits a continuous rank function, tensorially absorbs the Jiang-Su algebra Z.
