We show that for a large class of C*-algebras \mathcal{A}, containing arbitrary direct limits of separable type I C*-algebras, the following statement holds: If A\in \mathcal{A} and B is a simple projectionless C*-algebra with trivial K-groups that can be written as a direct limit of a system of (nonunital) recursive subhomogeneous algebras with no dimension growth then the stable rank of A\otimes B is one. As a consequence we show that if A\in \mathcal A then the stable rank of A\otimes\mathcal W is one. We also prove the following stronger result: If A is separable C*-algebra that can be written as a direct limit of C*-algebras of the form \mathrm{C}_0(X)\otimes \mathrm{M}_n, where X is locally compact and Hausdorff, then A\otimes \mathcal W can be written as a direct limit of a sequence of 1-dimensional noncommutative CW-complexes.
