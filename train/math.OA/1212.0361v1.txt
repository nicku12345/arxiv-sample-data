It is shown that topological freeness of Rieffel's induced representation functor implies that any C^*-algebra generated by a faithful covariant representation of a Hilbert bimodule X over a C^*-algebra A is canonically isomorphic to the crossed product A\rtimes_X \mathbb{Z}. An ideal lattice description and a simplicity criterion for A\rtimes_X \mathbb{Z} are established.
