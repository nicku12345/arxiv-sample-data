We study the crossed product C^*-algebra associated to injective endomorphisms, which turns out to be equivalent to study the crossed product by the dilated autormorphism. We prove that the dilation of the Bernoulli p-shift endomorphism is topologically free. As a consequence, we have a way to twist any endomorphism of a \D-absorbing C^*-algebra into one whose dilated automorphism is essentially free and have the same K-theory map than the original one. This allows us to construct purely infinite crossed products C^*-algebras with diverse ideal structures.
