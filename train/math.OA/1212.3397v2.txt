Topological quivers generalize the notion of directed graphs in which the sets of vertices and edges are locally compact (second countable) Hausdorff spaces. Associated to a topological quiver Q is a C^*-correspondence, and in turn, a Cuntz-Pimsner algebra C^*(Q). Given \Gamma a locally compact group and \alpha and \beta endomorphisms on \Gamma, one may construct a topological quiver Q_{\alpha,\beta}(\Gamma) with vertex set \Gamma, and edge set \Omega_{\alpha,\beta}(\Gamma)= \{(x,y)\in\Gamma\times\Gamma\st \alpha(y)=\beta(x)\}. In this paper, the author examines the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra \cO_{\alpha,\beta}(\Gamma):=C^*(Q_{\alpha,\beta}(\Gamma)). The investigative topics include a notion for topological quiver isomorphisms, generators (and their relations) of the C^*-algebras \cO_{\alpha,\beta}(\Gamma), and its spatial structure (i.e., colimits, tensor products and crossed products) and a few properties of its C^*-subalgebras.
