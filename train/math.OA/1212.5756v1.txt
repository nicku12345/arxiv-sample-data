We develop a theory of crossed products by "actions" of Hecke pairs (G, \Gamma), motivated by applications in non-abelian C^*-duality. Our approach gives back the usual crossed product construction whenever G / \Gamma is a group and retains many of the aspects of crossed products by groups. In this first of two articles we lay the ^*-algebraic foundations of these crossed products by Hecke pairs and we explore their representation theory.
