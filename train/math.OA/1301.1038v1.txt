We study the structure of weakly-closed nonself-adjoint algebras arising from representations of single vertex 2-graphs. These are the algebras generated by 2 isometric tuples which satisfy a certain commutation relation. We show that these algebras have a lower-triangular 3\times 3 form. The left-hand side of this matrix decomposition is a slice of the enveloping von Neumann algebra generated by the 2-graph algebra. We further give necessary and sufficient conditions for these algebras themselves to be von Neumann algebras. The paper concludes with further study of atomic representations.
