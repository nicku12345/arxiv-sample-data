In this paper we concern with positive zero divisors in C^{*} algebras. By means of zero divisors, we introduce a hereditary invariant for C^{*} algebras. Using this invariant, we give an example of a C^{*} algebra A and a C^{*} sub algebra B of A such that there is no a hereditary imbedding of B into A.   We also introduce a new concept zero divisor real rank of a C^{*} algebra, as a zero divisor analogy of real rank theory of C^{*} algebras. We observe that this quantity is zero for A=C(X) when X is a separable compact Hausdorff space or X is homeomorphic to the unit square with the lexicographic topology. To a C^{*} algebra A with \dim A > 1, we assign the undirected graph \Gamma^{+} (A) of non zero positive zero divisors. For the Calkin algebra A=B(H)/K(H), we show that \Gamma^{+}(A) is a connected graph and diam \Gamma^{+}(A)= 3. We show that \Gamma^{+}(A) is a connected graph with \text {diam}\; \Gamma^{+}(A)\leq 6, if A is a factor.
