In this second article on crossed products by "actions" of Hecke pairs we study their different C*-completions, namely we show how reduced and full C*-crossed products can be defined. We also establish that our construction coincides with that of Laca, Larsen and Neshveyev whenever they are both definable. As an application of our theory, we prove a Stone-von Neumann theorem for Hecke pairs which encompasses the work of an Huef, Kaliszewski and Raeburn and we lay down the foundations for obtaining a form of Katayama duality with respect to the Echterhoff-Quigg crossed product.
