In \cite{bik1}, A. M. Bikchentaev conjectured that for positive \tau-measurable operators a and b affiliated with an arbitrary semifinite von Neumann algebra \mathcal M, the operator b^{1/2}ab^{1/2} is submajorized by the operator ab in the sense of Hardy-Littlewood. We prove this conjecture in full generality and present a number of applications to fully symmetric operator ideals, Golden-Thompson inequality and (singular) traces.
