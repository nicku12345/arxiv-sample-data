In the paper we give a characterization of a w^*-continuous orthogonal vector field F over an W^*-algebra \mathcal{N} of type I_2 in terms of reductions F on the center of \mathcal{N}. As an application it is obtained a proof of the assertion that an arbitrary w^*-continuous orthogonal vector field over a W^*-algebra of type I_2 is stationary.
