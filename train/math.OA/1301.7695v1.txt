We show that certain extensions of classifiable C*-algebra are strongly classified by the associated six-term exact sequence in K-theory together with the positive cone of K_{0}-groups of the ideal and quotient. We apply our result to give a complete classification of graph C*-algebras with exactly one ideal.
