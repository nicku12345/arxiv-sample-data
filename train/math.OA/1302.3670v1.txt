We give necessary and sufficient conditions which a graph should satisfy in order for its associated C^\ast-algebra to have a T_1 primitive ideal space. We give a description of which one-point sets in such a primitive ideal space are open, and use this to prove that any purely infinite graph C^\ast-algebra with a T_1 (in particular Hausdorff) primitive ideal space, is a c_0-direct sum of Kirchberg algebras. Moreover, we show that graph C^\ast-algebras with a T_1 primitive ideal space canonically may be given the structure of a C(\widetilde{\mathbb N})-algebra, and that isomorphisms of their \widetilde{\mathbb N}-filtered K-theory (without coefficients) lift to E(\widetilde{\mathbb N})-equivalences, as defined by Dadarlat and Meyer.
