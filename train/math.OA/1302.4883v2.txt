It is established that every derivation continuous with respect to the local measure topology acting on the *-algebra LS(\mathcal{M}) of all locally measurable operators affiliated with a von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M} is necessary inner. If \mathcal{M} is a properly infinite von Neumann algebra, then every derivation on LS(\mathcal{M}) is inner. In addition, it is proved that any derivation on \mathcal{M} with values in Banach \mathcal{M}-bimodule of locally measurable operators is inner.
