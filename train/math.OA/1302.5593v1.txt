To an r-dimensional subshift of finite type satisfying certain special properties we associate a C^*-algebra \cA. This algebra is a higher rank version of a Cuntz-Krieger algebra. In particular, it is simple, purely infinite and nuclear. We study an example: if \G is a group acting freely on the vertices of an \wt A_2 building, with finitely many orbits, and if \Omega is the boundary of that building, then C(\Om)\rtimes \G is the algebra associated to a certain two dimensional subshift.
