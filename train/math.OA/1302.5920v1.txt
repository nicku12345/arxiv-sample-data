A subgroup of an amenable group is amenable. The C^*-algebra version of this fact is false. This was first proved by M.-D. Choi who proved that the non-nuclear C^*-algebra C^*_r(\ZZ_2*\ZZ_3) is a subalgebra of the nuclear Cuntz algebra {\cal O}_2. A. Connes provided another example, based on a crossed product construction. More recently J. Spielberg [23] showed that these examples were essentially the same. In fact he proved that certain of the C^*-algebras studied by J. Cuntz and W. Krieger [10] can be constructed naturally as crossed product algebras. For example if the group \Gamma acts simply transitively on a homogeneous tree of finite degree with boundary \Omega then \cross is a Cuntz-Krieger algebra. Such trees may be regarded as affine buildings of type \widetilde A_1. The present paper is devoted to the study of the analogous situation where a group \G acts simply transitively on the vertices of an affine building of type \widetilde A_2 with boundary \O. The corresponding crossed product algebra \cross is then generated by two Cuntz-Krieger algebras. Moreover we show that \cross is simple and nuclear. This is a consequence of the facts that the action of \G on \O is minimal, topologically free, and amenable.
