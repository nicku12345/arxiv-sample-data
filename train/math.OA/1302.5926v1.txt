An \widetilde A_2 group \Gamma acts simply transitively on the vertices of an affine building \triangle. We study certain subgroups \Gamma_0 \cong {\Bbb Z}^2 which act on certain apartments of \triangle. If one of these subgroups acts simply transitively on an apartment, then the corresponding subalgebra of the group von Neumann algebra is maximal abelian and singular. Moreover the Puk\'anszky invariant contains a type I_{\infty} summand.
