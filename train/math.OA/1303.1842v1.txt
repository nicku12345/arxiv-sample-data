We review the notion of simple compact quantum groups and examples, and discuss the problem of construction and classification of simple compact quantum groups. Several new quantum groups constructed by Banica, Curran and Speicher since the author's first paper on simple quantum groups are shown to be simple using results of Raum and Weber.
