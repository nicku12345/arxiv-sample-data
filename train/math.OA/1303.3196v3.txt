We develop an analytic theory of operator-valued additive free convolution in terms of subordination functions. In contrast to earlier investigations our functions are not just given by power series expansions, but are defined as Frechet analytic functions in all of the operator upper half plane. Furthermore, we do not have to assume that our state is tracial. Combining this new analytic theory of operator-valued free convolution with Anderson's selfadjoint version of the linearization trick we are able to provide a solution to the following general random matrix problem: How can we calculate the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of a polynomial evaluated in independent random matrices with known asymptotic eigenvalue distributions?
