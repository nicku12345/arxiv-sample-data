Let V\subseteq W be two operator spaces. Arveson-Wittstock-Hahn-Banach theorem asserts that every completely contractive map \varphi:V\to \mathcal{B}(H) has a completely contractive extension \tilde{\varphi}:W\to \mathcal{B}(H), where \mathcal{B}(H) denotes the space of all bounded operators from a Hilbert space H to itself. In this paper, we show that this is not in general true for p-operator spaces, that is, we show that there are p-operator spaces V\subseteq W, an SQ_p space E, and a p-completely contractive map \varphi:V\to \mathcal{B}(E) such that \varphi does not extend to a p-completely contractive map on W. Restricting E to L_p spaces, we also consider a condition on W under which every completely contractive map \varphi:V\to \mathcal{B}(L_p(\mu)) has a completely contractive extension \tilde{\varphi}:W\to \mathcal{B}(L_p(\mu)).
