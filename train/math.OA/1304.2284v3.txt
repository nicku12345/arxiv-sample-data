Certain *-semigroups are associated with the universal C^*-algebra generated by a partial isometry, which is itself the universal C^*-algebra of a *-semigroup. A fundamental role for a *-structure on a semigroup is emphasized, and ordered and matricially ordered *-semigroups are introduced, along with their universal C^*-algebras. The universal C^*-algebra generated by a partial isometry is isomorphic to a relative Cuntz-Pimsner C^*-algebra of a C^*-correspondence over the C^*-algebra of a matricially ordered *-semigroup. One may view the C^*-algebra of a partial isometry as the crossed product algebra associated with a dynamical system defined by a complete order map modelled by a partial isometry acting on a matricially ordered *-semigroup.
