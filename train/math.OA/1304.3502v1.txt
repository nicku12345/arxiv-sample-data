We prove that the automorphisms of any separable C*-algebra that does not have continuous trace are not classifiable by countable structures up to unitary equivalence. This implies a dichotomy for the Borel complexity of the relation of unitary equivalence of automorphisms of a separable unital C*-algebra: Such relation is either smooth or not even classifiable by countable structures.
