We generalize the representation theorem of Junge, Neufang and Ruan [A representation theorem for locally compact quantum groups, Internat. J. Math. 20(3) (2009) 377-400], and some of the important results which were used in its proof, to the case of actions of locally compact quantum groups on von Neumann algebras.
