We show that for any C*-algebra A, a sufficiently large Hilbert space H and a unit vector \xi \in H, the natural application rep(A:H) \to Q(A), \pi \mapsto \langle \pi(-)\xi,\xi \rangle is a topological quotient, where rep(A:H) is the space of representations on H and Q(A) the set of quasi-states, i.e. positive linear functionals with norm at most 1. This quotient might be a useful tool in the representation theory of C*-algebras. We apply it to give an interesting proof of Takesaki-Bichteler duality for C*-algebras which allows to drop a hypothesis.
