Using unbounded Hilbert space representations basic results on the transition probability of positive linear functionals f and g on a unital *-algebra are obtained. The main assumption is the essential self-adjointness of GNS representations \pi_f and \pi_g. Applications to functionals given by density matrices and by integrals and to vector functionals on the Weyl algebra are given.
