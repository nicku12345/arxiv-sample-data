We decompose the crossed product functor for actions of crossed modules of locally compact groups on C*-algebras into more elementary constructions: taking crossed products by group actions and fibres in C*-algebras over topological spaces. For this, we extend the theory of partial crossed products from groups to crossed modules; extend Takesaki-Takai duality to Abelian crossed modules; show that equivalent crossed modules have equivalent categories of actions on C*-algebras; and show that certain crossed modules are automatically equivalent to Abelian crossed modules.
