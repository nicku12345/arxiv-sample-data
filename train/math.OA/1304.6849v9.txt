Let C^*(\cls) be the C^* algebra generated by an operator system \cls i.e. a unital *-closed subspace of a unital C^* algebra \cla. We prove that any complete order isomorphism \cli:\cls \raro \cls' between two such operator systems of matrix algebras has a unique extension to a C^*-isomorphism \cli:C^*(\cls) \raro C^*(\cls'). However, the same statement with more general operator systems of infinite dimensional C^*-algebra is false. As an application of this result, we characterise upto cocycle conjugacy the extreme points of unital completely positive maps on matrix algebra.
