We consider the question of when the multiplier algebra M(\mathcal{A}) of a C^*-algebra \mathcal{A} is a  W^*-algebra, and show that it holds for a stable C^*-algebra exactly when it is a C^*-algebra of compact operators. This implies that if for every Hilbert C^*-module E over a C^*-algebra \mathcal{A}, the algebra B(E) of adjointable operators on E is a  W^*-algebra, then \mathcal{A} is a C^*-algebra of compact operators.   Also we show that a unital C^*-algebra \mathcal{A} which is Morita equivalent to a  W^*-algebra must be a  W^*-algebra.
