In this paper we investigate whether positive elements in the multiplier algebras of certain finite C*-algebras can be written as finite linear combinations of projections with positive coefficients (PCP). Our focus is on the category of underlying C*-algebras that are separable, simple, with real rank zero, stable rank one, finitely many extreme traces, and strict comparison of projections by the traces. We prove that the strict comparison of projections holds also in the multiplier algebra of the stabilizer algebra. Based on this result and under the additional hypothesis that the multiplier algebra has real rank zero, we characterize which positive elements of the multiplier algebra are PCP.
