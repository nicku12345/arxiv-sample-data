We give precise conditions under which irreducible representations associated to stability groups induce to irreducible representations for Fell bundle C*-algebras. This result generalizes an earlier result of Echterhoff and the second author. Because the Fell bundle construction subsumes most other examples of C*-algebras constructed from dynamical systems, our result percolates down to many different constructions including the many flavors of groupoid crossed products.
