Let A be a unital separable simple amenable C^*-algebra with finite tracial rank which satisfies the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT). Suppose \af and \bt are two automorphisms with the Rokhlin property that {induce the same action on the K-theoretical data of A.} We show that \af and \bt are strongly cocycle conjugate and uniformly approximately conjugate, that is, there exists a sequence of unitaries \{u_n\}\subset A and a sequence of strongly asymptotically inner automorphisms \sigma_n such that  \af={\rm Ad}\, u_n\circ \sigma_n\circ \bt\circ \sigma_n^{-1}\andeqn \lim_{n\to\infty}\|u_n-1\|=0,  and that the converse holds. {We then give a K-theoretic description as to exactly when \af and \bt are cocycle conjugate, at least under a mild restriction. Moreover, we show that given any K-theoretical data, there exists an automorphism \af with the Rokhlin property which has the same K-theoretical data.
