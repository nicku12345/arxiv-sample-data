In this paper we study structural properties of the Cuntz semigroup and its functionals for continuous fields of C*-algebras over finite dimensional spaces. In a variety of cases, this leads to an answer to a conjecture posed by Blackadar and Handelman. Enroute to our results, we determine when the stable rank of continuous fields of C*-algebras over one dimensional spaces is one.
