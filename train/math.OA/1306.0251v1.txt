This paper is devoted to derivations on the algebra S(M) of all measurable operators affiliated with a finite von Neumann algebra M. We prove that if M is a finite von Neumann algebra with a faithful normal semi-finite trace \tau, equipped with the locally measure topology t, then every t-continuous derivation D:S(M)\rightarrow S(M) is inner. A similar result is valid for derivation on the algebra S(M,\tau) of \tau-measurable operators equipped with the measure topology t_{\tau}.
