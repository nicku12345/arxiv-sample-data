We study uniform perturbations of intermediate C*-subalgebras of inclusions of simple C*-algebras. If a unital simple C*-algebra has a simple C*-subalgebra of finite index, then sufficiently close simple intermediate C*-subalgebras are unitarily equivalent. These C*-subalgebras need not to be nuclear. The unitary can be chosen in the relative commutant algebra. An imediate corollary is the following: If the relative commutant is trivial, then the set of intermediate C*-subagebras is a finite set.
