By a quasi-representation of a group G we mean an approximately multiplicative map of G to the unitary group of a unital C^*-algebra. A quasi-representation induces a partially defined map at the level K-theory.   In the early 90s Exel and Loring associated two invariants to almost-commuting pairs of unitary matrices u and v: one a K-theoretic invariant, which may be regarded as the image of the Bott element in K_0(C(\mathbb{T}^2)) under a map induced by quasi-representation of \mathbb{Z}^2 in U(n); the other is the winding number in \mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\} of the closed path t\mapsto \det(tvu + (1-t)uv). The so-called Exel-Loring formula states that these two invariants coincide if \|uv - vu\| is sufficiently small.   A generalization of the Exel-Loring formula for quasi-representations of a surface group taking values in U(n) was given by the second-named author. Here we further extend this formula for quasi-representations of a surface group taking values in the unitary group of a tracial unital C^*-algebra.
