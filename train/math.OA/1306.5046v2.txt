We will study two kinds of actions of a discrete amenable Kac algebra. The first one is an action whose modular part is normal. We will construct a new invariant which generalizes a characteristic invariant for a discrete group action, and we will present a complete classification. The second is a centrally free action. By constructing a Rohlin tower in an asymptotic centralizer, we will show that the Connes-Takesaki module is a complete invariant.
