Let \mathcal{M}_i be a family of \mathrm{II}_1-factors, containing a common \mathrm{II}_1-subfactor \mathcal{N}, such that [\mathcal{M}_i:\mathcal{N}] \in \mathbb{N}_0 for all i. Furthermore, let \phi \colon \mathbb{N}_0 \to \mathbb{C}. We show that if a Hankel matrix related to \phi is trace-class, then there exists a unique completely bounded map M_\phi on the amalgamated free product of the \mathcal{M}_i with amalgamation over \mathcal{N}, which acts as an radial multiplier. Hereby we extend a result of U. Haagerup and the author for radial multipliers on reduced free products of unital C^*- and von Neumann algebras.
