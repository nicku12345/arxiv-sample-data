In a recent paper we studied general properties of super-KMS functionals on graded quantum dynamical systems coming from graded translation-covariant quantum field nets over R, and we carried out a detailed analysis of these objects on certain models of superconformal nets. In the present article we show that these locally bounded functionals give rise to local-entire cyclic cocycles (generalized JLO cocycles), which are homotopy-invariant for a suitable class of perturbations. Thus we can associate meaningful noncommutative geometric invariants to those graded quantum dynamical systems.
