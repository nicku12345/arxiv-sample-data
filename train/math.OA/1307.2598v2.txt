The concept of a relatively weakly injective pair of operator systems is introduced and studied in this paper, motivated by relative weak injectivity in the C*-algebra category. E. Kirchberg \cite{Kr} proved that the C*-algebra C^*(\mathbb{f}_\infty) of the free group \mathbb{f}_\infty on countably many generators characterizes relative weak injectivity for pairs of C*-algebras by means of the maximal tensor product. One of the main results of this paper shows that C^*(\mathbb{f}_\infty) also characterises relative weak injectivity in the operator system category. A key tool is the theory of operator system tensor products \cite{KP1,KP2}.
