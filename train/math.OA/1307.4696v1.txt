It is shown that the *-algebra of all (closed densely defined linear) operators affiliated with a finite type I von Neumann algebra admits a unique center-valued trace, which turns out to be, in a sense, normal. It is also demonstrated that for no other von Neumann algebras similar constructions can be performed.
