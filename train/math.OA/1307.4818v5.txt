This text is a detailed overview of the theories of W*-algebras and noncommutative integration, up to the Falcone-Takesaki theory of noncommutative Lp spaces over arbitrary W*-algebras, and its extension to noncommutative Orlicz spaces. The topics under consideration include the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, the relative modular theory (featuring bimodules, spatial quotients, and canonical representation), the theory of W*-dynamical systems (featuring derivations, liouvilleans, and crossed products), noncommutative Radon-Nikodym type theorems, and operator valued weights. We pay special attention to abstract algebraic formulation of all properties (avoiding the dependence on Hilbert spaces wherever it is possible), to functoriality of canonical structures arising in the theory, and to the relationship between commutative and noncommutative integration theories. Several new results are proved.
