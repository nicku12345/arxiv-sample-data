This paper is devoted to derivations on the algebra S_0(M, \tau) of all \tau-compact operators affiliated with a von Neumann algebra M and a faithful normal semi-finite trace \tau. The main result asserts that every t_\tau-continuous derivation D:S_0(M, \tau)\rightarrow S_0(M, \tau) is spatial and implemented by a \tau-measurable operator affiliated with M, where t_\tau denotes the measure topology on S_0(M, \tau). We also show the automatic t_\tau-continuity of all derivations on S_0(M, \tau) for properly infinite von Neumann algebras M. Thus in the properly infinite case the condition of t_\tau-continuity of the derivation is redundant for its spatiality.
