We consider when the universal C^*-algebras associated to edge-colored directed graphs are exact. Specifically, for countable edge-colored directed graphs we show that the universal C^*-algebra is exact if and only if the C^*-algebra is isomorphic to a graph C^*-algebra which occurs precisely when the universal and reduced C^*-algebras of the edge-colored directed graph are isomorphic.
