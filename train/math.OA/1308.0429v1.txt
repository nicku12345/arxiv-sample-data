We introduce the Rohlin property and the approximate representability for finite group actions on stably projectionless C*-algebras and study their basic properties. We give some examples of finite group actions on the Razak-Jacelon algebra and show some classification results of these actions. This study is based on the work of Izumi, Robert's classification theorem and Kirchberg's central sequence C*-algebras.
