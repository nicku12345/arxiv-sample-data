It is well-known that the equality L^{}_{G}\ominus L^{}_{H}=\bar{\mathrm{span}\{L_{g}:g\in G-H\}^{\mathrm{SOT}}} holds for G an i.c.c. group and H a subgroup in G, where L^{}_{G} and L^{}_{H} are the corresponding group von Neumann algebras and L^{}_{G}\ominus L^{}_{H} is the set \{x\in L^{}_{G}:E^{}_{L^{}_{H}}(x)=0\} with E^{}_{L^{}_{H}} the conditional expectation defined from L^{}_{G} onto L^{}_{H}. Inspired by this, it is natural to ask whether the equality N\ominus A=\bar{\mathrm{span}\{u: u\mbox{is unitary in}N\ominus A\}^{\mathrm{SOT}}} holds for N a type \mbox{II}^{}_{1} factor and A a von Neumann subalgebra of N. In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question for the case A a type I von Neumann algebra.
