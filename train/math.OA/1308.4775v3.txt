We found that if u and v are any two unitaries in a unital C^*-algebra with \|uv-vu\|<2 such that uvu^*v^* commutes with u and v, then the \SCA\, A_{u,v} generated by u and v is isomorphic to a quotient of the rotation algebra A_\theta provided that A_{u,v} has a unique tracial state. We also found that the Exel trace formula holds in any unital C^*-algebra. Let \theta\in (-1/2, 1/2) be a rational number. We prove the following: For any \ep>0, there exists \dt>0 satisfying the following: if u and v are two unitary matrices such that  \|uv-e^{2\pi i\theta}vu\|<\dt\andeqn {1\over{2\pi i}}\tau(\log(uvu^*v^*))=\theta,  then there exists a pair of unitary matrices \tilde{u} and \tilde{v} such that  \tilde{u}\tilde{v}=e^{2\pi i\theta} \tilde{v}\tilde{u},\,\, \|u-\tilde{u}\|<\ep\andeqn \|v-\tilde{v}\|<\ep.  Furthermore, a generalization of this for all real \theta is obtained for unitaries in unital infinite dimensional simple C^*-algebras of tracial rank zero.
