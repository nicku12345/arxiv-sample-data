We study when a local triple derivation on a real JB*-triple is a triple derivation. We find an example of a (real linear) local triple derivation on a rank-one Cartan factor of type I which is not a triple derivation. On the other hand, we find sufficient conditions on a real JB*-triple E to guarantee that every local triple derivation on E is a triple derivation.
