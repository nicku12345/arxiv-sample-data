We prove that the natural homomorphism from Kirchberg's ideal-related KK-theory, KKE(e, e'), with one specified ideal, into Hom_{\Lambda} (\underline{K}_{E} (e), \underline{K}_{E} (e')) is an isomorphism for all extensions e and e' of separable, nuclear C*-algebras in the bootstrap category N with the K-groups of the associated cyclic six term exact sequence being finitely generated, having zero exponential map and with the K_{1}-groups of the quotients being free abelian groups.   This class includes all Cuntz-Krieger algebras with exactly one non-trivial ideal. Combining our results with the results of Kirchberg, we classify automorphisms of the stabilized purely infinite Cuntz-Krieger algebras with exactly one non-trivial ideal modulo asymptotically unitary equivalence. We also get a classification result modulo approximately unitary equivalence.   The results in this paper also apply to certain graph algebras.
