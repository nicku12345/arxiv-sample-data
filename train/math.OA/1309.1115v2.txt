We show that if (A,G,\alpha) is a groupoid dynamical system with A continuous trace, then the crossed product A\rtimes_{\alpha}G is Morita equivalent to the C*-algebra C*(\underline G,\underline E) of a twist \underline E over a groupoid \underline G equivalent to G. This is a groupoid analogue of the well known result for the crossed product of a group acting on an elementary C*-algebra.
