We introduce a class of densely defined, unbounded, 2-Hochschild cocycles ([PT]) on finite von Neumann algebras M. Our cocycles admit a coboundary, determined by an unbounded operator on the standard Hilbert space associated to the von Neumann algebra M. For the cocycles associated to the \Gamma-equivariant deformation ([Ra]) of the upper halfplane (\Gamma=PSL_2(\mathbb Z)), the "imaginary" part of the coboundary operator is a cohomological obstruction - in the sense that it can not be removed by a "large class" of closable derivations, with non-trivial real part, that have a joint core domain, with the given coboundary.
