Suppose \Gamma^{+} is the positive cone of a totally ordered abelian group \Gamma, and (A,\Gamma^{+},\alpha) is a system consisting of a C^*-algebra A, an action \alpha of \Gamma^{+} by extendible endomorphisms of A. We prove that the partial-isometric crossed product A\times_{\alpha}^{\piso}\Gamma^{+} is a full corner in the subalgebra of \L(\ell^{2}(\Gamma^{+},A)), and that if \alpha is an action by automorphisms of A, then it is the isometric-crossed product (B_{\Gamma^{+}}\otimes A)\times^{\iso}\Gamma^{+}, which is therefore a full corner in the usual crossed product of system by a group of automorphisms. We use these realizations to identify the ideal of A\times_{\alpha}^{\piso}\Gamma^{+} such that the quotient is the isometric crossed product A\times_{\alpha}^{\iso}\Gamma^{+}.
