Let A be a C^{*} algebra and T: A\rightarrow A be a linear map which satisfies the functional equation \begin{cases}T(x)T(y)=T^{2}(xy)\\T(x^{*})=T(x)^{*} \end{cases} We prove that under each of the following conditions, T must be the trivial map T(x)=\lambda x for some \lambda \in \mathbb{R}:\\ \begin{enumerate} \item A is a simple C^{*}-algebra.   \item A is unital with trivial center and has a faithful trace such that each zero-trace element lies in the closure of the span of commutator elements.   \item A=B(H) where H is a separable Hilbert space. \end{enumerate}   For a given field F, we consider a similar functional equation \begin{cases}T(x)T(y)=T^{2}(xy)\\T(x^{tr})=T(x)^{tr} \end{cases} where T is a linear map on M_{n}(F) and "tr" is the transpose operator. We prove that this functional equation has trivial solution for all n\in \mathbb{N} if and only if F is a formally real field.
