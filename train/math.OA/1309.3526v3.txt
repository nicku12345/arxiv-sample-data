It is well known that every derivation of a von Neumann algebra into itself is an inner derivation and that every derivation of a von Neumann algebra into its predual is inner. It is less well known that every triple derivation (defined below) of a von Neumann algebra into itself is an inner triple derivation.We examine to what extent all triple derivations of a von Neumann algebra into its predual are inner. This rarely happens but it comes close. We prove a (triple) cohomological characterization of finite factors and a zero-one law for factors. Namely, we show that for any factor, the linear space of triple derivations into the predual, modulo the norm closure of the inner triple derivations, has dimension 0 or 1: It is zero if and only if the factor is finite.
