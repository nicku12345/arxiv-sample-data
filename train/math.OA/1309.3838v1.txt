Let T: A\to B be a (not necessarily surjective) linear isometry between two real JB^*-triples. Then for each a\in A there exists a tripotent u_a in the bidual, B'', of B such that \begin{enumerate}[(a)] \item \{u_a,T(\{f,g,h\}),u_a\}=\{u_a,\{T(f),T(g),T(h)\},u_a\}, for all f,g,h in the real JB^*-subtriple, A_a, generated by a; \item The mapping \{u_a,T(\cdot),u_a\} :A_a\rightarrow B'' is a linear isometry. \end{enumerate} Furthermore, when B is a real C^*-algebra, the projection p=p_a= u_a^* u_a satisfies that T(\cdot)p :A_a\rightarrow B'' is an isometric triple homomorphism. When A and B are real C^*-algebras and A is abelian of real type, then there exists a partial isometry u\in B'' such that the mapping T(\cdot)u^*u :A\rightarrow B'' is an isometric triple homomorphism. These results generalise, to the real setting, some previous contributions due to C.-H. Chu and N.-C. Wong, and C.-H. Chu and M. Mackey in 2004 and 2005. We give an example of a non-surjective real linear isometry which cannot be complexified to a complex isometry, showing that the results in the real setting can not be derived by a mere complexification argument.
