We initiate the study of orthogonal forms on a real C^*-algebra. Motivated by previous contributions, due to Ylinen, Jajte, Paszkiewicz and Goldstein, we prove that for every continuous orthogonal form V on a commutative real C^*-algebra, A, there exist functionals \varphi_1 and \varphi_2 in A^{*} satisfying V(x,y) = \varphi_1 (x y) + \varphi_2 (x y^*), for every x,y in A. We describe the general form of a (not-necessarily continuous) orthogonality preserving linear map between unital commutative real C^*-algebras. As a consequence, we show that every orthogonality preserving linear bijection between unital commutative real C^*-algebras is continuous.
