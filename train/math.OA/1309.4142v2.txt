We construct uncountably many mutually nonisomorphic simple separable stably finite unital exact C^\ast-algebras which are not isomorphic to their opposite algebras. In particular, we prove that there are uncountably many possibilities for the K_0-group, the K_1-group, and the tracial state space of such an algebra. We show that these C*-algebras satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. This is new even for the already known example of an exact C*-algebra nonisomorphic to its opposite algebra produced in earlier work.
