Topological quivers generalize the notion of directed graphs in which the sets of vertices and edges are locally compact (second countable) Hausdorff spaces. Associated to a topological quiver Q is a C^*-correspondence, and in turn, a Cuntz-Pimsner algebra C^*(Q). Given \Gamma a locally compact group and \alpha and \beta endomorphisms on \Gamma, one may construct a topological quiver Q_{\alpha,\beta}(\Gamma) with vertex set \Gamma, and edge set \Omega_{\alpha,\beta}(\Gamma)= \{(x,y)\in\Gamma\times\Gamma\| \alpha(y)=\beta(x)\}. In \cite{Mc1}, the author examined the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra \cal{O}_{\alpha,\beta}(\Gamma):=C^*(Q_{\alpha,\beta}(\Gamma)) and found generators (and their relations) of \cal{O}_{\alpha,\beta}(\Gamma). In this paper, the author translates a known criterion for simplicity of topological quivers into a precise criterion for the simplicity of topological group relations.
