Suppose X and Y are Banach spaces, and {\mathcal{I}}, {\mathcal{J}} are operator ideals (for instance, the ideals of strictly singular, weakly compact, or compact operators). Under what conditions does the inclusion {\mathcal{I}}(X,Y) \subset {\mathcal{J}}(X,Y), or the equality {\mathcal{I}}(X,Y) = {\mathcal{J}}(X,Y), hold? We examine this question when {\mathcal{I}}, {\mathcal{J}} are the ideals of Dunford-Pettis, strictly (co)singular, finitely strictly singular, inessential, or (weakly) compact operators, while X and Y are non-commutative function spaces. Since such spaces are ordered, we also address the same questions for positive parts of such ideals.
