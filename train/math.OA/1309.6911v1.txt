In this work it is proved that the Moore-Penrose inverse of the product of n-doubly commuting regular C^*-algebra elements obeys the so-called reverse order law. Conversely, conditions regarding the reverse order law of the Moore-Penrose inverse are given in order to characterize when n-regular elements doubly commute. Furthermore, applications of the main results of this article to normal C^*-algebra elements, to Hilbert space operators and to Calkin algebras will be considered.
