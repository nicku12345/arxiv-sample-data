The article exhibits certain relations between the injective envelope I(A) of a C*-algebra A and the von Neumann algebra generated by a representation lambda of A provided it is injective. More specifically we show that there exist positive retractions sigma : /lambda (A)'' ---> I(A) which are close to being *-homomorphisms in the sense that they are Jordan homomorphisms of the underlying Jordan algebras, and the kernel of /sigma is given by a twosided ideal.
