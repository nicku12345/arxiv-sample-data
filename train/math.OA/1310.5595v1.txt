A new category of topological spaces with additional structures, called m-towers, is introduced. It is shown that there is a covariant functor which establishes a one-to-one correspondences between unital (resp. arbitrary) subhomogeneous C*-algebras and proper (resp. proper pointed) m-towers of finite height, and between all *-homomorphisms between two such algebras and morphisms between m-towers corresponding to these algebras.
