The relative graph C^*-algebras introduced by Muhly and Tomforde are generalizations of both graph algebras and their Toeplitz extensions. For an arbitrary graph E and a subset R of the set of regular vertices of E we show that the relative graph C^*-algebra C^*(E, R) is isomorphic to a partial crossed product for an action of the free group generated by the edge set on the relative boundary path space. Given a time evolution on C^*(E, R) induced by a function on the edge set, we characterize the KMS_\beta states and ground states using an abstract result of Exel and Laca. Guided by their work on KMS states for Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger type algebras associated to infinite matrices, we obtain complete descriptions of the convex sets of KMS states of finite type and of KMS states of infinite type whose associated measures are supported on recurrent infinite paths. This allows us to give a complete concrete description of the convex set of all KMS states for a big class of graphs which includes all finite graphs.
