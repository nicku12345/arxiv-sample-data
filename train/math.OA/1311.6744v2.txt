We consider amalgamated unital full free products of the form A_1*_DA_2, where A_1, A_2 and D are finite dimensional C*-algebras and there are faithful traces on A_1 and A_2 whose restrictions to D agree. We provide several conditions on the matrices of partial multiplicities of the inclusions D\hookrightarrow A_1 and D\hookrightarrow A_2 that guarantee that the C*-algebra A_1*_DA_2 is primitive. If the ranks of the matrices of partial multiplicities are one, we prove that the algebra A_1*_DA_2 is primitive if and only if it has a trivial center.
