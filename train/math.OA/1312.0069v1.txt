Quantum tori are limits of finite dimensional C*-algebras for the quantum Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity, a metric defined by the author as a strengthening of Rieffel's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff designed to retain the C*-algebraic structure. In this paper, we propose a proof of the continuity of the family of quantum and fuzzy tori which relies on explicit representations of the C*-algebras rather than on more abstract arguments, in a manner which takes full advantage of the notion of bridge defining the quantum propinquity.
