We compute the K-groups of the C^{*}-algebra of bounded operators generated by the Boutet de Monvel operators with classical SG-symbols of order (0,0) and type 0 on \mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}, as defined by Schrohe, Kapanadze and Schulze. In order to adapt the techniques used in Melo, Nest, Schick and Schrohe's work on the K-theory of Boutet de Monvel's algebra on compact manifolds, we regard the symbols as functions defined on the radial compactifications of \mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}^{n} and \mathbb{R}^{n-1}\times\mathbb{R}^{n-1}. This allows us to give useful descriptions of the kernel and the image of the continuous extension of the boundary principal symbol map, which defines a C^{*}-algebra homomorphism. We are then able to compute the K-groups of the algebra using the standard K-theory six-term cyclic exact sequence associated to that homomorphism.
