Let Alg \mathcal{N} be a nest algebra associated with the nest  \mathcal{N} on a (real or complex) Banach space \X. Suppose that there exists a non-trivial idempotent P\in Alg\mathcal{N} with range P(\X) \in \mathcal{N} and \delta:Alg\mathcal{N} \rightarrow Alg\mathcal{N} is a continuous linear mapping (generalized) left derivable at P, i.e. \delta(ab)=a\delta(b)+b\delta(a) (\delta(ab)=a\delta(b)+b\delta(a)-ba\delta(I)) for any a,b\in Alg\mathcal{N} with ab=P. we show that \delta is a (generalized) Jordan left derivation. Moreover, we characterize the strongly operator topology continuous linear maps \delta on some nest algebra Alg\mathcal{N} with property that \delta(P)=2P\delta(P) or \delta(P)=2P\delta(P)-P\delta(I) every idempotent P in Alg\mathcal{N}.
