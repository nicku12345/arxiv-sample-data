For completely contractive Banach algebras A and B (respectively operator algebras A and B), the necessary and sufficient conditions for the operator space projective tensor product A\widehat{\otimes}B (respectively the Haagerup tensor product A\otimes^{h}B) to be Arens regular are obtained. Using the non-commutative Grothendieck's inequality, we show that, for C^*-algebras A and B, the Arens regularity of Banach algebras   A\otimes^{h}B, A\ot^{\gamma} B, A\ot^{s} B and A\widehat{\otimes}B are equivalent, where \otimes^h, \otimes^{\gamma}, \ot^s and \widehat{\otimes} are the Haagerup, the Banach space projective tensor norm, the Schur tensor norm and the operator space projective tensor norm, respectively.
