We give an explicit description of the q-deformation of symplectic group SP_{q}(2n) at the C^*-algebra level and find all irreducible representations of this C^{*}-algebra. Further we describe the C^*-algebra of the quotient space SP_{q}(2n)/SP_{q}(2n-2) in terms of generators and relations. We compute its K-theory by obtaining a chain of short exact sequence for the C^{*}-algebras underlying such manifolds.
