We prove some unique factorization results for tensor products of free quantum group factors. They are type III analogues of factorization results for direct products of bi-exact groups established by Ozawa and Popa. In the proof, we first take continuous cores of the tensor products, which satisfy a condition similar to condition (AO), and discuss some factorization properties for the continuous cores. We then deduce factorization properties for the original type III factors. We also prove some unique factorization results for crossed product von Neumann algebras by direct products of bi-exact groups.
