In this paper, we answer the question of equivalence, or singularity, of two given quasi-stationary Markov measures on one-sided infinite words, and the corresponding question of equivalence of associated Cuntz algebra \O_N representations. We do this by associating certain monic representations of \O_N to quasi-stationary Markov measures, and then proving that equivalence for pairs of measures is decided by unitary equivalence of the corresponding pair of representations.
