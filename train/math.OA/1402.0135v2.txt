In this paper, we show that if G by a non-elementary word hyperbolic group and a \in G an element, if the conjugacy class of a is infinite, then all traces \tau:C^*_{\text{red}}(G) \to \mathbb{C} vanish on a. We show that all traces \theta:C^*_{\text{red}}(G) \to \mathbb{C} are linear combinations of traces \chi_g:C^*_{\text{red}}(G) \to \mathbb{C} given by \[\chi_{g}=\begin{cases} 1 & g \in C(g) \\ 0 & \text{else}\end{cases}\] where C(g) is the conjugacy class of g. To do this, we introduce a new method to study traces, using Sobolev norms and property RD.
