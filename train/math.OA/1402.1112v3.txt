We refine a construction of Choi, Farah and Ozawa to build a nonseparable amenable operator algebra \mathcal A\subseteq\ell_\infty(M_2) whose nonseparable subalgebras, including \mathcal A, are not isomorphic to a C^*-algebra. This is done using a Luzin gap and a uniformly bounded group representation.   Next, we study additional properties of \mathcal A and of its separable subalgebras, related to the Kadison Kastler metric.
