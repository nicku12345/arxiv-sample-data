C*-bundle dynamical systems are introduced and their r\^ole within the theory of C*-subalgebras and Fell bundles is investigated. A C*-bundle dynamical system involves an action of a 1-parameter group of "spatial automorphisms" of the C*-bundle together with a notion of covariance with respect to the diffeomorphisms of the base manifold, and turns out to define a class of examples of Arveson's A-dynamical systems. An embedding invariant for non-commutative C*-subalgebras (equivalent to a groupoid 2-cocycle by construction) emerges and has presentation analogous to a partition function towards a potential algebraic formulation of quantum gravity.
