For the canonical action \alpha of \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) on 2-dimensional simple rotation algebras \mathcal{A}_\theta, it is known that if F is a finite subgroup of \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}), the crossed products \mathcal{A}_\theta\rtimes_\alpha F are all AF algebras. In this paper we show that this is not the case for higher dimensional noncommutative tori. More precisely, we show that for each n\geq 3 there exist noncommutative simple \phi(n)-dimensional tori \mathcal{A}_\Theta which admit canonical action of \mathbb{Z}_n and for each odd n\geq 7 with 2\phi(n)\geq n+5 their crossed products \mathcal{A}_\Theta\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{Z}_n are not AF (with nonzero K_1-groups). It is also shown that the only possible canonical action by a finite group on a 3-dimensional simple torus is the flip action by \mathbb{Z}_2. Besides, we discuss the canonical actions by finite groups \mathbb{Z}_5, \mathbb{Z}_8, \mathbb{Z}_{10}, and \mathbb{Z}_{12} on the 4-dimensional torus of the form \mathcal{A}_\theta\otimes \mathcal{A}_\theta.
