Let A be a unital C^*-algebra and let U_0(A) be the group of unitaries of A which are path connected to the identity. Denote by CU(A) the closure of the commutator subgroup of U_0(A). Let i_A^{(1, n)}\colon U_0(A)/CU(A)\rightarrow U_0(\mathrm M_n(A))/CU(\mathrm M_n(A)) be the \hm\, defined by sending u to {\rm diag}(u,1_n). We study the problem when the map i_A^{(1,n)} is an isomorphism for all n. We show that it is always surjective and is injective when A has stable rank one. It is also injective when A is a unital C^*-algebra of real rank zero, or A has no tracial state. We prove that the map is an isomorphism when A is the Villadsen's simple AH--algebra of stable rank k>1. We also prove that the map is an isomorphism for all Blackadar's unital projectionless separable simple C^*-algebras. Let A=\mathrm M_n(C(X)), where X is any compact metric space. It is noted that the map i_A^{(1, n)} is an isomorphism for all n. As a consequence, the map i_A^{(1, n)} is always an isomorphism for any unital C^*-algebra A that is an inductive limit of finite direct sum of C^*-algebras of the form \mathrm M_n(C(X)) as above. Nevertheless we show that there are unital C^*-algebras A such that i_A^{(1,2)} is not an isomorphism.
