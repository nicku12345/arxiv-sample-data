The paper is devoted to the description of 2-local derivations on von Neumann algebras. Earlier it was proved that every 2-local derivation on a semi-finite von Neumann algebra is a derivation. In this paper, using the analogue of Gleason Theorem for signed measures, we extend this result to type III von Neumann algebras. This implies that on arbitrary von Neumann algebra each 2-local derivation is a derivation.
