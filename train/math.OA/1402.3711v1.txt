We study tensor products of a C_0 (X)-algebra A and a C_0 (Y)-algebra B, and analyse the structure of their minimal tensor product A \otimes B as a C_0 (X \times Y)-algebra. We show that when A and B define continuous C^{\ast}-bundles, that continuity of the bundle arising from the C_0 (X \times Y)-algebra A \otimes B is a strictly weaker property than continuity of the `fibrewise tensor products' studied by Kirchberg and Wassermann. For a fixed quasi-standard C^{\ast}-algebra A, we show that A \otimes B is quasi-standard for all quasi-standard B precisely when A is exact, and exhibit some related equivalences.
