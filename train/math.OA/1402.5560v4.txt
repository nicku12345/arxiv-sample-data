We show by construction that when G is an elementary amenable group and A is a unital simple nuclear and tracially approximately divisible C^*-algebra, there exists an action \omega of G on A with the tracial Rokhlin property in the sense of Matui and Sato. In particular, group actions with this Matui-Sato tracial Rokhlin property always exist for unital simple separable nuclear C^*-algebras with tracial rank at most one. If A is simple with rational tracial rank at most one, then the crossed product A\rtimes_{\omega}G is also simple with rational tracial rank at most one.
