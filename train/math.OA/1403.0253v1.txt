Let G be a locally compact abelian Hausdorff topological group which is non-compact and whose Pontryagin dual \Gamma is partially ordered. Let \Gamma^{+}\subset\Gamma be the semigroup of positive elements in \Gamma. The Hardy space H^{2}(G) is the closed subspace of L^{2}(G) consisting of functions whose Fourier transforms are supported on \Gamma^{+}. In this paper we consider the C*-algebra C^{*}(\mathcal{T}(G)\cup F(C(\dot{\Gamma^{+}}))) generated by Toeplitz operators with continuous symbols on G which vanish at infinity and Fourier multipliers with symbols which are continuous on one point compactification of \Gamma^{+} on the Hilbert-Hardy space H^{2}(G). We characterize the character space of this C*-algebra using a theorem of Power.
