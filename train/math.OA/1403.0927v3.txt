Let x, y be two normal elements in a unital simple C*-algebra A. We introduce a function D_c(x, y) and show that in a unital simple AF-algebra there is a constant 1>C>0 such that  C\cdot D_c(x, y)\le {\rm dist}({\cal U}(x),{\cal U}(y))\le D_c(x,y),  where {\cal U}(x) and {\cal U}(y) are the closures of the unitary orbits of x and of y, respectively. We also generalize this to unital simple C*-algebras with real rank zero, stable rank one and weakly unperforated K_0-group. More complicated estimates are given in the presence of non-trivial K_1-information.
