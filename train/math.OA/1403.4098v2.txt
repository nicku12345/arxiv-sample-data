Let (M, \varphi) = (M_1, \varphi_1) \ast (M_2, \varphi_2) be a free product of arbitrary von Neumann algebras endowed with faithful normal states. Assume that the centralizer M_1^{\varphi_1} is diffuse. We first show that any intermediate subalgebra M_1 \subset Q \subset M which has nontrivial central sequences in M is necessarily equal to M_1. Then we obtain a general structural result for all the intermediate subalgebras M_1 \subset Q \subset M with expectation. We deduce that any diffuse amenable von Neumann algebra can be concretely realized as a maximal amenable subalgebra with expectation inside a full nonamenable type III_1 factor. This provides the first class of concrete maximal amenable subalgebras in the framework of type III factors. We finally strengthen all these results in the case of tracial free product von Neumann algebras.
