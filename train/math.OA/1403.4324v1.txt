Given a system of coverings of k-graphs, we show that the cohomology of the resulting (k+1)-graph is isomorphic to that of any one of the k-graphs in the system. We then consider Bratteli diagrams of 2-graphs whose twisted C*-algebras are matrix algebras over noncommutative tori. For such systems we calculate the ordered K-theory and the gauge-invariant semifinite traces of the resulting 3-graph C*-algebras. We deduce that every simple C*-algebra of this form is Morita equivalent to the C*-algebra of a rank-2 Bratteli diagram in the sense of Pask-Raeburn-R{\o}rdam-Sims.
