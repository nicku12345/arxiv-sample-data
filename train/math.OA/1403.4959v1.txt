Let G be a Hausdorff, \'etale groupoid that is minimal and topologically principal. We show that C^*_r(G) is purely infinite simple if and only if all the nonzero positive elements of C_0(G^0) are infinite in C_r^*(G). If G is a Hausdorff, ample groupoid, then we show that C^*_r(G) is purely infinite simple if and only if every nonzero projection in C_0(G^0) is infinite in C^*_r(G). We then show how this result applies to k-graph C^*-algebras. Finally, we investigate strongly purely infinite groupoid C^*-algebras.
