Suppose T and S are bounded adjointable operators between Hilbert C*-modules admitting bounded Moore-Penrose inverse operators. Some necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the reverse order law (TS)^{ \dag} =S^{ \dag} T^{ \dag} to hold. In particular, we show that the equality holds if and only if Ran(T^{\ast}TS) \subseteq Ran(S) and Ran(SS^{\ast}T^{\ast}) \subseteq Ran(T^{\ast}), which was studied first by Greville [{\it SIAM Rev. 8 (1966) 518--521}] for matrices.
