We generalize some results on compact operators on Hilbert spaces to "compact" operators on some Hilbert right W*-modules. We present in this frame the Schatten decomposition of the compact operators, the trace, the Banach Lp-spaces and their duals, the Hilbert-Schmitt operators, and the integral operators as an example of Hilbert-Schmitt operators.
