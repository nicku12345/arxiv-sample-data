In this paper we consider certain proejctions in the corona algebra of C(X)\otimes B associated to (p_0, p_1, \dots, p_n) where p_i: X_i \to \mt_s a continuous projection valued section to the multiplier algebra of a stable C\sp*-algebra B for each i. Here X_i's are closed intervals given by a partition \{x_1, \dots, x_n\} on the interior of X and adjacent sections differ by compacts at each partition point. Assuming a kind of homogeneity on the projection we characterize when two such projections are homotopy equivalent.
