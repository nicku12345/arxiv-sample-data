Consider a unital C*-algebra A, a von Neumann algebra M, a unital sub-C*-algebra C of A and a unital *-homomorphism \pi from C to M. Let u: A --> M be a decomposable map (i.e. a linear combination of completely positive maps) which is a C-bimodule map with respect to \pi. We show that u is a linear combination of C-bimodule completely positive maps if and only if there exists a projection e in the commutant of \pi(C) such that u is valued in eMe and e\pi(.)e has a completely positive extension A --> eMe.
