We show that if A is \mathcal{Z}, \mathcal{O}_2, \mathcal{O}_{\infty}, a UHF algebra of infinite type, or the tensor product of a UHF algebra of infinite type and \mathcal{O}_{\infty}, then the conjugation action \mathrm{Aut}(A) \curvearrowright \mathrm{Aut}(A) is generically turbulent for the point-norm topology. We moreover prove that if A is either (i) a separable C*-algebra which is stable under tensoring with \mathcal{Z} or \mathcal{K}, or (ii) a separable {\mathrm{II}}_1 factor which is McDuff or a free product of {\mathrm{II}}_1 factors, then the approximately inner automorphisms of A are not classifiable by countable structures.
