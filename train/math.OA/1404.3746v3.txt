We introduce a Morita type equivalence: two operator algebras A and B are called strongly \Delta -equivalent if they have completely isometric representations \alpha  and \beta  respectively and there exists a ternary ring of operators M such that \alpha (A) (resp. \beta (B)) is equal to the norm closure of the linear span of the set M^*\beta (B)M,  (resp. M\alpha (A)M^*). We study the properties of this equivalence. We prove that if two operator algebras A and B, possessing countable approximate identities, are strongly \Delta -equivalent, then the operator algebras A\otimes \cl K and B\otimes \cl K are isomorphic. Here \cl K is the set of compact operators on an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space and \otimes  is the spatial tensor product. Conversely, if A\otimes \cl K and B\otimes \cl K are isomorphic and A, B possess contractive approximate identities then A and B are strongly \Delta -equivalent.
