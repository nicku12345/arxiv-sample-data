Given a locally compact quantum group \mathbb G, we define and study representations and C^\ast-completions of the convolution algebra L_1(\mathbb G) associated with various linear subspaces of the multiplier algebra C_b(\mathbb G). For discrete quantum groups \mathbb G, we investigate the left regular representation, amenability and the Haagerup property in this framework. When \mathbb G is unimodular and discrete, we study in detail the C^\ast-completions of L_1(\mathbb G) associated with the non-commutative L_p-spaces L_p(\mathbb G). As an application of this theory, we characterize (for each p \in [1,\infty)) the positive definite functions on unimodular orthogonal and unitary free quantum groups \mathbb G that extend to states on the L_p-C^\ast-algebra of \mathbb G. Using this result, we construct uncountably many new examples of exotic quantum group norms for compact quantum groups.
