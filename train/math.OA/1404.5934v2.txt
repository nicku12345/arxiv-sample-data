We investigate E_0-semigroups on general factors, which are not necessarily of type I, and analyse associated invariants like product systems, super product systems etc. By tensoring E_0-semigroups on type I factors with E_0-semigroups on type II_1 factor, we produce several families (both countable and uncountable), consisting of mutually non-cocycle-conjugate of E_0-semigroups on the hyperfinite II_\infty factor. Using CCR representations associated with quasi-free states, we construct for the first time, uncountable families consisting of mutually non-cocycle-conjugate E_0-semigroups on all type III_\lambda factors, for \lambda \in (0,1].
