The Haagerup approximation property for a von Neumann algebra equipped with a faithful normal state \varphi is shown to imply existence of unital, \varphi-preserving and KMS-symmetric approximating maps. This is used to obtain a characterisation of the Haagerup approximation property via quantum Markov semigroups (extending the tracial case result due to Jolissaint and Martin) and further via quantum Dirichlet forms.
