For any pair M,N of von Neumann algebras such that the algebraic tensor product M\otimes N admits more than one \mathrm{C}^*-norm, the cardinal of the set of \mathrm{C}^*-norms is at least  {2^{\aleph_0}}. Moreover there is a family with cardinality  {2^{\aleph_0}} of injective tensor product functors for \mathrm{C}^*-algebras in Kirchberg's sense.   Let \IB=\prod_n M_{n}. We also show that, for any non-nuclear von Neumann algebra M\subset \IB(\ell_2), the set of \mathrm{C}^*-norms on \IB \otimes M has cardinality equal to 2^{2^{\aleph_0}}.
