We establish new estimates to compute the \lambda-function of Aron and Lohman on the unit ball of a JB^*-triple. It is established that for every Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertible element a in a JB^*-triple E we have \hbox{dist} (a, \mathfrak{E} (E_1)) = \max \left\{ 1- m_q (a) , \|a\|-1\right\}, where \mathfrak{E} (E_1) denotes the set of extreme points of the closed unit ball E_1 of E. It is proved that \lambda (a) = \frac{1+m_q (a)}{2}, for every Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertible element a in E_1, where m_q (a) is the square root of the quadratic conorm of a. For an element a in E_1 which is not Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertible we can only estimate that \lambda (a)\leq \frac12 (1-\alpha_q (a)). A complete description of the \lambda-function on the closed unit ball of every JBW^*-triple is also provided, and as a consequence, we prove that every JBW^*-triple satisfies the uniform \lambda-property.
