We define the notion of a twisted topological graph algebra associated to a topological graph and a 1-cocycle on its edge set. We prove a stronger version of a Vasselli's result. We expand Katsura's results to study twisted topological graph algebras. We prove a version of the Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem, describe the gauge-invariant ideal structure. We find that a twisted topological graph algebra is simple if and only if the corresponding untwisted one is simple.
