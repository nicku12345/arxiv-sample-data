We study first EP modular operators on Hilbert C*-modules and then we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the product of two EP modular operators to be EP. These enable us to extend some results of Koliha [{\it Studia Math.} {\bf 139} (2000), 81--90.] for an arbitrary C*-algebra and the C*-algebras of compact operators.
