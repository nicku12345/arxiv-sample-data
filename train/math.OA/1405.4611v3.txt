Let \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{B} be two prime C^{*}-algebras. In this paper, we investigate the additivity of map \Phi from \mathcal{A} onto \mathcal{B} that are bijective unital and satisfies \Phi(AP+\lambda PA^{*})=\Phi(A)\Phi(P)+\lambda \Phi(P)\Phi(A)^{*}, for all A\in\mathcal{A} and P\in\{P_{1},I_{\mathcal{A}}-P_{1}\} where P_{1} is a nontrivial projection in \mathcal{A} and \lambda\in\{-1,+1\}. Then, \Phi is *-additive.
