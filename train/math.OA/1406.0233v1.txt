We construct a topology on the class of pointed proper quantum metric spaces which generalizes the topology of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance on proper metric spaces, and the topology of the dual propinquity on Leibniz quantum compact metric spaces. A pointed proper quantum metric space is a special type of quantum locally compact metric space whose topography is proper, and with properties modeled on Leibniz quantum compact metric spaces, though they are usually not compact and include all the classical proper metric spaces. Our topology is obtained from an infra-metric which is our analogue of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, and which is null only between isometrically isomorphic pointed proper quantum metric spaces. Thus, we propose a new framework which extends noncommutative metric geometry, and in particular noncommutative Gromov-Hausdorff topology, to the realm of quantum locally compact metric spaces.
