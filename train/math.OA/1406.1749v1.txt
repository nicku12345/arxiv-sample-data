Let (\mathcal{A}, G, \alpha) be a groupoid dynamical system. We show that if G is assumed to be measurewise amenable and the section algebra A = \Gamma_0(G^{(0)}, \mathcal{A}) is nuclear, then the associated groupoid crossed product is also nuclear. This generalizes an earlier result of Green for crossed products by locally compact groups. We also extend a related result of Kirchberg to groupoids. In particular, if A is exact and G is amenable, then we show that \mathcal{A} \rtimes G is exact.
