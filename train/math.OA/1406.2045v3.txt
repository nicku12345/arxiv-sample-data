We prove that every Kirchberg algebra in the UCT class has nuclear dimension 1. We first show that Kirchberg 2-graph algebras with trivial K_0 and finite K_1 have nuclear dimension 1 by adapting a technique developed by Winter and Zacharias for Cuntz algebras. We then prove that every Kirchberg algebra in the UCT class is a direct limit of 2-graph algebras to obtain our main theorem.
