Given a spectral triple (A,H,D) and a C^*-dynamical system (\mathbf{A}, G, \alpha) where A is dense in \mathbf{A} and G is a locally compact group, we extend the triple to a triplet (\mathcal{B},\mathcal{H},\mathcal{D}) on the crossed product G \ltimes_{\alpha, \text{red}} \mathbf{A} which can be promoted to a modular-type twisted spectral triple within a general procedure exemplified by two cases: the C^*-algebra of the affine group and the conformal group acting on a complete Riemannian spin manifold.
