Given a finite depth subfactor planar algebra \mathcal{P} endowed with the graded *-algebra structures \{Gr_k^+ \mathcal{P}\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}} of Guionnet, Jones, and Shlyakhtenko, there is a sequence of canonical traces Tr_{k,+} on Gr_k^+\mathcal{P} induced by the Temperley-Lieb diagrams and a sequence of trace-preserving embeddings into the bounded operators on a Hilbert space. Via these embeddings the *-algebras \{Gr_k^+\mathcal{P}\}_{k\in \mathbb{N}} generate a tower of non-commutative probability spaces \{M_{k,+}\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}} whose inclusions recover \mathcal{P} as its standard invariant. We show that traces Tr_{k,+}^{(v)} induced by certain small perturbations of the Temperley-Lieb diagrams yield trace-preserving embeddings of Gr_k^+\mathcal{P} that generate the same tower \{M_{k,+}\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}.
