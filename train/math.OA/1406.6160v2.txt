The purpose of this paper is to investigate the structure of Shlyakhtenko's free Araki-Woods factors using the framework of ultraproduct von Neumann algebras. We first prove that all the free Araki-Woods factors \Gamma(H_{\mathbb R}, U_t)^{\prime \prime} are \omega-solid in the following sense: for every von Neumann subalgebra Q \subset \Gamma(H_{\mathbb R}, U_t)^{\prime \prime} that is the range of a faithful normal conditional expectation and such that the relative commutant Q' \cap M^\omega is diffuse, we have that Q is amenable. Next, we prove that the continuous cores of the free Araki-Woods factors \Gamma(H_{\mathbb R}, U_t)^{\prime \prime} associated with mixing orthogonal representations U : \mathbb R \to \mathcal O(H_{\mathbb R}) are \omega-solid type {\rm II_\infty} factors. Finally, when the orthogonal representation U : \mathbb R \to \mathcal O(H_{\mathbb R}) is weakly mixing, we prove a dichotomy result for all the von Neumann subalgebras Q \subset \Gamma(H_{\mathbb R}, U_t)^{\prime \prime} that are globally invariant under the modular automorphism group (\sigma_t^{\varphi_U}) of the free quasi-free state \varphi_U.
