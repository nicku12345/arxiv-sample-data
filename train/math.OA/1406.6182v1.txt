We prove that, under rather general conditions, the 1-cohomology of a von Neumann algebra M with values in a Banach M-bimodule satisfying a combination of smoothness and operatorial conditions, vanishes. For instance, we show that if M acts normally on a Hilbert space \Cal H and \Cal B_0\subset \Cal B(\Cal H) is a norm closed M-bimodule such that any T\in \Cal B_0 is {\it smooth} (i.e. the left and right multiplication of T by x\in M are continuous from the unit ball of M with the s^*-topology to \Cal B_0 with its norm), then any derivation of M into \Cal B_0 is inner. The compact operators are smooth over any M\subset \Cal B(\Cal H), but there is a large variety of non-compact smooth elements as well.
