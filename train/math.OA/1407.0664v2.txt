In this paper, Property \Gamma for a type II_{1} von Neumann algebra is introduced as a generalization of Murray and von Neumann's Property \Gamma for a type II_{1} factor. The main result of this paper is that if a type II_{1} von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M} with separable predual has Property \Gamma, then the continuous Hochschild cohomology group H^{k}(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{M}) vanishes for every k \geq 2. This gives a generalization of an earlier result due to E. Christensen, F. Pop, A.M. Sinclair and R.R. Smith.
