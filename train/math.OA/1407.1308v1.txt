We prove that if \rho is an adapted positive definite function in the Fourier--Stieltjes algebra B(G) of a locally compact group G with \|\rho\|_{B(G)}=1, then the iterated powers (\rho^n) converge to zero in the weak* topology \sigma(B(G) , C^*(G)). Moreover, if \rho is irreducible, we prove that (\rho^n) as a sequence of u.c.p. maps on the group C^*-algebra converges to zero in the strong operator topology.
