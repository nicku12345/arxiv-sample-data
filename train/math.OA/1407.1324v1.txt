For a locally compact quantum group \mathbb{G}, consider the convolution action of a quantum probability measure \mu on L_\infty(\mathbb{G}). As shown by Junge--Neufang--Ruan, this action has a natural extension to a Markov map on \mathcal{B}(L_2(\mathbb{G})). We prove that the Poisson boundary of the latter can be realized concretely as the von Neumann crossed product of the Poisson boundary associated with \mu under the action of \mathbb{G} induced by the coproduct. This yields an affirmative answer, for general locally compact quantum groups, to a problem raised by Izumi (2004) in the commutative situation, in which he settled the discrete case, and unifies earlier results of Jaworski, Neufang and Runde.
