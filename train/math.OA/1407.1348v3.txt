Suppose that \mathcal M is a countably decomposable type II_1 von Neumann algebra and \mathcal A is a separable, non-nuclear, unital C^*-algebra. We show that, if \mathcal M has Property \Gamma, then the similarity degree of \mathcal M is less than or equal to 5. If \mathcal A has Property c^*-\Gamma, then the similarity degree of \mathcal A is equal to 3. In particular, the similarity degree of a \mathcal Z-stable, separable, non-nuclear, unital C^*-algebra is equal to 3.
