We examine the common null spaces of families of Herz-Schur multipliers and apply our results to study jointly harmonic operators and their relation with jointly harmonic functionals. We show how an annihilation formula obtained in J. Funct. Anal. 266 (2014), 6473-6500 can be used to give a short proof as well as a generalisation of a result of Neufang and Runde concerning harmonic operators with respect to a normalised positive definite function. We compare the two notions of support of an operator that have been studied in the literature and show how one can be expressed in terms of the other.
