We show that formation of crossed products and passage to fixed point algebras by compact group actions with finite Rokhlin dimension preserve the following regularity properties: finite decomposition rank, finite nuclear dimension, and tensorial absorption of the Jiang-Su algebra, the latter in the formulation with commuting towers.
