We show that in a tracial and finitely generated W^\ast-probability space existence of conjugate variables in an appropriate sense exclude algebraic relations for the generators. Moreover, under the assumption of finite non-microstates free Fisher information, we prove that there are no zero divisors in the sense that the product of any non-commutative polynomial in the generators with any element from the von Neumann algebra is zero if and only if at least one of those factors is zero.
