Unifying two notions of an action and coaction of a locally compact group on a C^*-cor\-re\-spond\-ence we introduce a coaction (\sigma,\delta) of a Hopf C^*-algebra S on a C^*-cor\-re\-spond\-ence (X,A). We show that this coaction naturally induces a coaction \zeta of S on the associated Cuntz-Pimsner algebra \mathcal{O}_X under the weak \delta-invariancy for the ideal J_X. When the Hopf C^*-algebra S is defined by a well-behaved multiplicative unitary, we construct a C^*-cor\-re\-spond\-ence (X\rtimes_\sigma\widehat{S},A\rtimes_\delta\widehat{S}) from (\sigma,\delta) and show that it has a representation on the reduced crossed product \mathcal{O}_X\rtimes_\zeta\widehat{S} by the induced coaction \zeta. This representation is used to prove an isomorphism between the C^*-algebra \mathcal{O}_X\rtimes_\zeta\widehat{S} and the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra \mathcal{O}_{X\rtimes_\sigma\widehat{S}} under the covariance assumption which is guaranteed in particular if the ideal J_{X\rtimes_\sigma\widehat{S}} of A\rtimes_\delta\widehat{S} is generated by the canonical image of J_X in M(A\rtimes_\delta\widehat{S}) or the left action on X by A is injective. Under this covariance assumption, our results extend the isomorphism result known for actions of amenable groups to arbitrary locally compact groups. The Cuntz-Pimsner covariance condition which was assumed for the same isomorphism result concerning group coactions is shown to be redundant.
