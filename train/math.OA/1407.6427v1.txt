An automorphism \beta of a k-graph \Lambda induces a crossed product C^* ( \Lambda ) \rtimes_\beta \mathbb{Z} which is isomorphic to a (k+1)-graph algebra C^* ( \Lambda \times_\beta \mathbb{Z}). In this paper we show how this process interacts with k-graph C^*-algebras which have been twisted by an element of their second cohomology group. This analysis is done using a long exact sequence in cohomology associated to this data. We conclude with some examples
