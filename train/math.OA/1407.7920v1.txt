In this paper, we define and study a class \mathcal{R}_{c} of norms on L^{\infty}\left( \mathbb{T}\right) , called continuous\ rotationally\ symmetric \ norms, which properly contains the class \left \{ \left \Vert \cdot \right \Vert _{p}:1\leq p<\infty \right \} . For \alpha \in \mathcal{R}% _{c} we define L^{\alpha}\left( \mathbb{T}\right)  and the Hardy space H^{\alpha}\left( \mathbb{T}\right) , and we extend many of the classical results, including the dominated convergence theorem, convolution theorems, dual spaces, Beurling-type invariant spaces, inner-outer factorizations, characterizing the multipliers and the closed densely-defined operators commuting with multiplication by z. We also prove a duality theorem for a version of L^{\alpha} in the setting of von Neumann algebras.
