We describe the C*-algebra generated by an irreducible Toeplitz operator T_{\psi}, with continuous symbol \psi  on the unit circle \mathbb{T}, and finitely many composition operators on the Hardy space H^2 induced by certain linear-fractional self-maps of the unit disc, modulo the ideal of compact operators K(H^2). For composition operators with automorphism symbols, we show that this algebra is not isomorphic to the one generated by the shift and composition operators.
