Let G be a metrizable compact group, A a separable C*-algebra and \alpha a strongly continuous action of G on A. Provided that \alpha satisfies the continuous Rokhlin property, we show that the property of satisfying the UCT in E-theory passes from A to the crossed product C*-algebra A\rtimes_\alpha G and the fixed point algebra A^\alpha. This extends a result by Gardella in the case that G is the circle and A is nuclear. For circle actions on separable, unital C*-algebras with the continuous Rokhlin property, we establish a connection between the E-theory equivalence class of the coefficient algebra A and the fixed point algebra A^\alpha.
