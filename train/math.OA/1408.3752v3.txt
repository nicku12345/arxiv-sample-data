For p\in (1,\infty), we study representations of \'etale groupoids on L^{p}-spaces. Our main result is a generalization of Renault's disintegration theorem for representations of \'etale groupoids on Hilbert spaces. We establish a correspondence between L^{p}-representations of an \'etale groupoid G, contractive L^{p}-representations of C_{c}(G), and tight regular L^{p}-representations of any countable inverse semigroup of open slices of G that is a basis for the topology of G. We define analogs F^{p}(G) and F_{\mathrm{red}}^{p}(G) of the full and reduced groupoid C*-algebras using representations on L^{p}-spaces. As a consequence of our main result, we deduce that every contractive representation of F^{p}(G) or F_{\mathrm{red}}^{p}(G) is automatically completely contractive. Examples of our construction include the following natural families of Banach algebras: discrete group L^{p}-operator algebras, the analogs of Cuntz algebras on L^{p}-spaces, and the analogs of AF-algebras on L^{p}-spaces. Our results yield new information about these objects: their matricially normed structure is uniquely determined. More generally, groupoid L^{p}-operator algebras provide analogs of several families of classical C*-algebras, such as Cuntz-Krieger C*-algebras, tiling C*-algebras, and graph C*-algebras.
