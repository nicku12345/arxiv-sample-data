Let G be a locally compact group and P \subset G be a closed Ore semigroup containing the identity element. Let V: P \to B(\clh) be a representation such that for every a \in P, V_{a} is an isometry and the final projections of \{V_{a}: a \in P\} commute. In this article, we study the C^{*}-algebra \mathcal{W}_{V}(P,G), generated by \{\int f(a)V_{a} da: f \in L^{1}(P)\}. We show that there exists a universal C^{*}-algebra, which admits a groupoid description, of which \mathcal{W}_{V}(P,G) is a quotient. If P=G, then this universal algebra is just C^{*}(G).
