We will introduce a notion of strongly continuous orbit equivalence in one-sided topological Markov shifts. Strongly continuous orbit equivalence yields a topological conjugacy between their two-sided topological Markov shifts (\bar{X}_A, \bar{\sigma}_A) and (\bar{X}_B, \bar{\sigma}_B). We prove that one-sided topological Markov shifts (X_A, \sigma_A) and (X_B, \sigma_B) are strongly continuous orbit equivalent if and only if there exists an isomorphism bewteen the Cuntz-Krieger algebras {\mathcal{O}}_A and {\mathcal{O}}_B preserving their maximal commutative C^*-subalgebras C(X_A) and C(X_B) and giving cocycle conjugate gauge actions. An example of one-sided topological Markov shifts which are strongly continuous orbit equivalent but not one-sided topologically conjugate is presented.
