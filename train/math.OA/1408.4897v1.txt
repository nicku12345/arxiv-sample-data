Denote by U_{\mathcal I}({\mathcal H}) the group of all unitary operators in {\bf 1}+{\mathcal I} where {\mathcal H} is a separable infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space and {\mathcal I} is any two-sided ideal of {\mathcal B}({\mathcal H}). A Cartan subalgebra {\mathcal C} of {\mathcal I} is defined in this paper as a maximal abelian self-adjoint subalgebra of~{\mathcal I} and its conjugacy class is defined herein as the set of Cartan subalgebras \{V{\mathcal C} V^*\mid V\in U_{\mathcal I}({\mathcal H})\}. For nonzero proper ideals {\mathcal I} we construct an uncountable family of Cartan subalgebras of {\mathcal I} with distinct conjugacy classes. This is in contrast to the by now classical observation of P. de La Harpe who noted that when {\mathcal I} is any of the Schatten ideals, there is precisely one conjugacy class under the action of the full group of unitary operators on~{\mathcal B}.   In the case when {\mathcal I} is a symmetrically normed ideal and is the dual of some Banach space, we show how the conjugacy classes of the Cartan subalgebras of {\mathcal I} become smooth manifolds modeled on suitable Banach spaces. These manifolds are endowed with groups of smooth transformations given by the action of the group U_{\mathcal I}({\mathcal H}) on the orbits, and are equivariantly diffeomorphic to each other. We then find that there exists a unique diffeomorphism class of full flag manifolds of U_{\mathcal I}({\mathcal H}) and we give its construction.
