We study quantum isometry groups, denoted by \mathbb{Q}(\Gamma, S), of spectral triples on C^*_r(\Gamma) for a finitely generated discrete group coming from the word-length metric with respect to a symmetric generating set S. We first prove a few general results about \mathbb{Q}(\Gamma, S) including : \begin{itemize} \item For a group \Gamma with polynomial growth property, the dual of \mathbb{Q}(\Gamma, S) has polynomial growth property provided the action of \mathbb{Q}(\Gamma,S) on C^*_r(\Gamma) has full spectrum, \item \mathbb{Q}(\Gamma, S) \cong QISO(\hat{\Gamma}, d) for any abelian \Gamma, where d is a suitable metric on the dual compact abelian group \hat{\Gamma}. \end{itemize}   We then carry out explicit computations of \mathbb{Q}(\Gamma,S) for several classes of examples including free and direct product of cyclic groups, Baumslag-Solitar group, Coxeter groups etc. In particular, we have computed quantum isometry groups of all finitely generated abelian groups which do not have factors of the form \mathbb{Z}_2^k or \mathbb{Z}_4^l for some k,l in the direct product decomposition into cyclic subgroups.
