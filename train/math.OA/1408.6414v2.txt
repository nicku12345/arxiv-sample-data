Crossed products with noncommutative Bernoulli actions were introduced by Connes as the first examples of full factors of type III. This article provides a complete classification of the factors (P,\phi)^{\mathbb{F}_n} \rtimes \mathbb{F}_n, where \mathbb{F}_n is the free group and P is an amenable factor with an almost periodic state \phi. We show that these factors are completely classified by the rank n of the free group \mathbb{F}_n and Connes's Sd-invariant. We prove similar results for free product groups, as well as for classes of generalized Bernoulli actions.
