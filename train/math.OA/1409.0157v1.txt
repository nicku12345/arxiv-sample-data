Let E = (E^0, E^1, r, s) be a topological graph with no sinks such that E^0 and E^1 are compact. We show that when C^*(E) is finite, there is a natural isomorphism C^*(E) \cong C(E^\infty) \rtimes \mathbb{Z}, where E^\infty is the infinite path space of E and the action is given by the backwards shift on E^\infty. Combining this with a result of Pimsner, we show the properties of being AF-embeddable, quasidiagonal, stably finite, and finite are equivalent for C^*(E) and can be characterized by a natural "combinatorial" condition on E.
