When a locally compact group acts on a C*-correspondence, it also acts on the associated Cuntz-Pimsner algebra in a natural way. Hao and Ng have shown that when the group is amenable the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of the crossed product correspondence is isomorphic to the crossed product of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra. In this paper, we have a closer look at this isomorphism in the case where the group is not necessarily amenable. We also consider what happens at the level of Toeplitz algebras.
