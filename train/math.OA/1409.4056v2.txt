We show that group C*-algebras of finitely generated, nilpotent groups have finite nuclear dimension. It then follows, from a string of deep results, that the C*-algebra A generated by an irreducible representation of such a group has decomposition rank at most 3. If, in addition, A satisfies the universal coefficient theorem, another string of deep results shows it is classifiable by its Elliott invariant and is approximately subhomogeneous. We give a large class of irreducible representations of nilpotent groups (of arbitrarily large nilpotency class) that satisfy the universal coefficient theorem and therefore are classifiable and approximately subhomogeneous.
