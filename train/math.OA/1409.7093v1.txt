For any countable discrete group G with a reduced abelian subgroup of finite index, we construct an action \alpha of G on the universal UHF algebra \Qq using an infinite tensor product of permutation representations of G and show that these actions possess some sort of Rokhlin property. The crossed product \qag is then deduced to be tracially AF with a unique tracial state. We also compute the Elliott invariants in the case that G is abelian.
