Let H^{\infty}(E) be a non commutative Hardy algebra, associated with a W^*-correspondence E. These algebras were introduced in 2004, ~\cite{MuS3}, by P. Muhly and B. Solel, and generalize the classical Hardy algebra of the unit disc H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D}). As a special case one obtains also the algebra \mathcal{F}^{\infty} of Popescu, which is H^{\infty}(\mathbb{C}^n) in our setting.   In this paper we view the algebra H^\infty(E) as acting on a Hilbert space via an induced representation \rho(H^{\infty}(E)), and we study the reflexivity of \rho(H^{\infty}(E)). This question was studied by A. Arias and G. Popescu in the context of the algebra \mathcal{F}^{\infty}, and by other authors in several other special cases. As it will be clear from our work, the extension to the case of a general W^*-correspondence E over a general W^*-algebra M requires new techniques and approach.   We obtain some partial results in the general case and we turn to the case of a correspondence over factor. Under some additional assumptions on the representation \pi:M\rightarrow B(H) we show that \rho_\pi(H^{\infty}(E)) is reflexive. Then we apply these results to analytic crossed products \rho(H^{\infty}(\ _{\alpha}M)) and obtain their reflexivity for any automorphism \alpha\in Aut(M) whenever M is a factor. Finally, we show also the reflexivity of the compression of the Hardy algebra to a suitable coinvariant subspace \mathfrak{M}, which may be thought of as a generalized symmetric Fock space.
