For a locally compact quantum group \mathbb{G}, the quantum group algebra L^1(\mathbb{G}) is operator amenable if and only if it has an operator bounded approximate diagonal. It is known that if L^1(\mathbb{G}) is operator biflat and has a bounded approximate identity then it is operator amenable. In this paper, we consider nets in L^2(\mathbb{G}) which suffice to show these two conditions and combine them to make an approximate diagonal of the form \omega_{{W'}^*\xi\otimes\eta} where W is the multiplicative unitary and \xi\otimes\eta are simple tensors in L^2(\mathbb{G})\otimes L^2(\mathbb{G}). Indeed, if \mathbb{G} and \hat{\mathbb{G}} both have a bounded approximate identity and either of the corresponding nets in L^2(\mathbb{G}) satisfies a condition generalizing quasicentrality then this construction generates an operator bounded approximate diagonal. In the classical group case, this provides a new method for constructing approximate diagonals emphasizing the relation between the operator amenability of the group algebra L^1(G) and the Fourier algebra A(G).
