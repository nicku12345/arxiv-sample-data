If G acts on a C^*-correspondence {\mathcal H}, then by the universal property G acts on the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H} and we study the crossed product {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H}\rtimes G and the fixed point algebra {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H}^G. Using intertwiners, we define the Doplicher-Roberts algebra {\mathcal O}_\rho of a representation \rho of a compact group G on {\mathcal H} and prove that {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H}^G is isomorphic to {\mathcal O}_\rho. When the action of G commutes with the gauge action on {\mathcal O}_{{\mathcal H}}, then G acts also on the core algebras {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H}^{\mathbb T}, where \mathbb T denotes the unit circle. We give applications for the action of a group G on the C^*-correspondence {\mathcal H}_E associated to a directed graph E. If G is finite and E is discrete and locally finite, we prove that the crossed product C^*(E)\rtimes G is isomorphic to the C^*-algebra of a graph of C^*-correspondences and stably isomorphic to a locally finite graph algebra. If C^*(E) is simple and purely infinite and the action of G is outer, then C^*(E)^G and C^*(E)\rtimes G are also simple and purely infinite with the same K-theory groups. We illustrate with several examples.
