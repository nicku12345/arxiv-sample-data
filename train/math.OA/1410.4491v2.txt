Let \tau be a linear map from a unital C^*-algebra \CMcal A to a von Neumann algebra \mathematical B and let \CMcal C be a unital C^*-algebra. A map T from a Hilbert \CMcal A-module E to a von Neumann \CMcal C-\CMcal B module F is called a \tau-map if \langle T(x),T(y)\rangle=\tau(\langle x, y\rangle)~\mbox{for all}~x,y\in E. A Stinespring type theorem for \tau-maps and its covariant version are obtained when \tau is completely positive. We show that there is a bijective correspondence between the set of all \tau-maps from E to F which are (u',u)-covariant with respect to a dynamical system (G,\eta,E) and the set of all (u',u)-covariant \widetilde{\tau}-maps from the crossed product E\times_{\eta} G to F, where \tau and \widetilde{\tau} are completely positive.
