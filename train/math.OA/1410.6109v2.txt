We show that a class of ergodic transformations on a probability measure space (X,\mu) extends to a representation of \mathcal{B}(L^2(X,\mu)) that is both implemented by a Cuntz family and ergodic. This class contains several known examples, which are unified in this work.   During the analysis of the existence and uniqueness of such a Cuntz family we give several results of individual interest. Most notably we prove a decomposition of X for N-to-one local homeomorphisms that is connected to the orthonormal basis of Hilbert modules. We remark that the trivial Hilbert module of the Cuntz algebra \mathcal{O}_N does not have a well-defined Hilbert module basis (moreover that it is unitarily equivalent to the module sum \sum_{i=1}^n \mathcal{O}_N for infinitely many n \in \mathbb{N}).
