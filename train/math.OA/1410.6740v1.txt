The higher rank graphs of Kumjian and Pask are discrete Conduche fibrations over the monoid of k-tuples of natural numbers for some k in which every morphism in the base has a finite preimage under the the fibration. We examine the generalization of this construction to discrete Conduche fibrations with the same finiteness condition and a lifting property for completions of cospans to commutative squares, over any category satisfying a strong version of the right Ore condition, including all categories with pullbacks and right Ore categories in which all morphisms are monic.
