This short note amends Proposition 2.5 of the named article, which states that a full coaction of a locally compact group on a C*-algebra is nondegenerate if and only if its normalization is. The proof given there of the reverse implication is incorrect and, unfortunately, we have been unable to find a correct proof. Instead, we summarize the current state of our knowledge of the relationships between nondegeneracy of normal, reduced, and generic C*-coactions.
