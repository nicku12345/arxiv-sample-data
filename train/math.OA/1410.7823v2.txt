We show that if (X.A) and (Y,B) are two isomorphic Hilbert pro-C^{\ast} -bimodules, then the crossed product A\times_{X}\mathbb{Z} of A by X and the crossed product B\times_{Y}\mathbb{Z} of B by Y are isomorphic as pro-C^{\ast}-algebras. We also prove a property of "associativity" between " \otimes_{\min}" and "\times_{X}" \ as well as " \otimes_{\max}" and "\times_{X}". As an application of these results we show that the crossed product of a nuclear pro-C^{\ast} -algebra A by a full Hilbert pro-C^{\ast}-bimodule X is a nuclear pro-C^{\ast}-algebra.
