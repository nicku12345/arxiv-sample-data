The weak operator topology closed operator algebra on L^2(R) generated by the one-parameter semigroups for translation, dilation and multiplication by exp(i\lambda x), \lambda \geq 0, is shown to be a reflexive operator algebra, in the sense of Halmos, with invariant subspace lattice equal to a binest. This triple semigroup algebra, A_{ph}, is antisymmetric in the sense that A_{ph} \cap A_{ph}^*= CI, it has a nonzero proper weakly closed ideal generated by the finite-rank operators, and its unitary automorphism group is R. Furthermore, the 8 choices of semigroup triples provide 2 unitary equivalence classes of operator algebras, with A_{ph} and A_{ph}^* being chiral representatives.
