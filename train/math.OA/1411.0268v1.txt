We study 2-cabled analogs of Voiculescu's trace and free Gibbs states on Jones planar algebras. These states are traces on a tower of graded algebras associated to a Jones planar algebra. Among our results is that, with a suitable definition, finiteness of free Fisher information for planar algebra traces implies that the associated tower of von Neumann algebras consists of factors, and that the standard invariant of the associated inclusion is exactly the original planar algebra. We also give conditions that imply that the associated von Neumann algebras are non-\Gamma non-L^2 rigid factors.
