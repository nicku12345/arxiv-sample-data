The paper is devoted to 2-local derivations on matrix algebras over unital semi-prime Banach algebras. For a unital semi-prime Banach algebra \mathcal{A} with the inner derivation property we prove that any 2-local derivation on the algebra M_{2^n}(\mathcal{A}), n\geq 2, is a derivation. We apply this result to AW^\ast-algebras and show that any 2-local derivation on an arbitrary AW^\ast-algebra is a derivation.
