We examine the theory of the KMS states on Pimsner algebras arising from multivariable unital C*-dynamical systems. As an application we show that Pimsner algebras of piecewise conjugate classical systems attain the same KMS states, even though it is still an open problem whether or not they are *-isomorphic.
