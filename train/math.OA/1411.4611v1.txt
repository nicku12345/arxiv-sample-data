We generalise the notions of semi-regularity, regularity, and bi-regularity to unitary solutions of the braided Pentagon equation in concrete W*-categories with semi-regular/regular/bi-regular braiding, and study their properties. We show, for example, that under bi-regularity-assumptions, the leg-algebras form braided C*-bialgebras. Moreover, we "close the circle" for the representation categories: The braiding on the Yetter-Drinfeld category of a (semi-)regular multiplicative unitary in a category with (semi-)regular braiding is again (semi-)regular.
