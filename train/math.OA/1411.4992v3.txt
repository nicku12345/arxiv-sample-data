We examine Nica-Pimsner algebras associated with semigroup actions of \mathbb{Z}_+^n on a C*-algebra A by *-endomorphisms. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on the dynamics for exactness and nuclearity of the Nica-Pimsner algebras. Furthermore we parameterize the KMS states at finite temperature by the tracial states on A. A parametrization is also shown for KMS states at zero temperature (resp. ground states) by the tracial states on A (resp. states on A). Finally we give a formula for obtaining tracial states on the Nica-Pimsner algebras.
