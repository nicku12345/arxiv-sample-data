Given a Banach space X, there are many operator space structures possible on X, which all have X as their first matrix level. Blecher and Paulsen identified two extreme operator space structures on X, namely Min(X) and Max(X) which represents respectively, the smallest and the largest operator space structures admissible on X. In this note, we consider the subspace and the quotient space structure of minimal and maximal operator spaces.
