In the paper, we consider the question whether a unital full amalgamated free product of quasidiagonal C*-algebras is quasidiagonal again. We give a sufficient condition such that a unital full amalgamated free product of quasidiagonal C*-algebras with amalgamation over a finite dimensional C*- algebra is quasidiagonal. Applying this result, we conclude that a unital full free product of two AF algebras with amalgamation over a finite-dimensional C*-algebra is AF if there are faithful tracial states on each of these two AF algebras such that the restrictions on the common subalgebra agree.
