We prove that, for a complex Hilbert space H with dimension bigger or equal than three, every linear mapping T: B(H)\to B(H) satisfying the 3-local property is a ^*-monomorphism, that is, every linear mapping T: B(H) \to B(H) satisfying that for every a in B(H) and every \xi,\eta in H, there exists a ^*-automorphism \pi_{a,\xi,\eta}: B(H)\to B(H), depending on a, \xi, and \eta, such that T(a) (\xi) = \pi_{a,\xi,\eta} (a) (\xi), \hbox{ and } T(a) (\eta) = \pi_{a,\xi,\eta} (a) (\eta), is a ^*-monomorphism. This solves a question posed by L. Moln\'ar in [\emph{Arch. Math.} \textbf{102}, 83-89 (2014)].
