The adiabatic groupoid \mathcal{G}_{ad} of a smooth groupoid \mathcal{G} is a deformation relating \mathcal{G} with its algebroid. In a previous work, we constructed a natural action of \mathbb{R} on the C*-algebra of zero order pseudodifferential operators on \mathcal{G} and identified the crossed product with a natural ideal J(\mathcal{G}) of C^*(\mathcal{G}_{ad}). In the present paper we show that C^*(\mathcal{G}_{ad}) itself is a pseudodifferential extension of this crossed product in a sense introduced by Saad Baaj. Let us point out that we prove our results in a slightly more general situation: the smooth groupoid \mathcal{G} is assumed to act on a C*-algebra A. We construct in this generalized setting the extension of order 0 pseudodifferential operators \Psi(A,\mathcal{G}) of the associated crossed product A\rtimes \mathcal{G}. We show that \mathbb{R} acts naturally on \Psi(A,\mathcal{G}) and identify the crossed product of A by the action of the adiabatic groupoid \mathcal{G}_{ad} with an extension of the crossed product \Psi(A,\mathcal{G})\rtimes \mathbb{R}. Note that our construction of \Psi(A,\mathcal{G}) unifies the ones of Connes (case A=\mathbb{C} ) and of Baaj (\mathcal{G} is a Lie group).
