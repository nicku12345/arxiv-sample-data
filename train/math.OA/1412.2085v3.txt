We characterize positive convolution operators on a finite quantum group \mathbb{G} which are L_{p}-improving. More precisely, we prove that the convolution operator T_{\varphi}:x\mapsto\varphi\star x given by a state \varphi on C(\mathbb{G}) satisfies \[ \exists1<p<2,\quad\|T_{\varphi}:L_{p}(\mathbb{G})\to L_{2}(\mathbb{G})\|=1 \] if and only if the Fourier series \hat{\varphi} satisfy \|\hat{\varphi}(\alpha)\|<1 for all nontrivial irreducible unitary representations \alpha, if and only if the state (\varphi\circ S)\star\varphi is non-degenerate (where S is the antipode). We also prove that these L_{p}-improving properties are stable under taking free products, which gives a method to construct L_{p}-improving multipliers on infinite compact quantum groups. Our methods for non-degenerate states yield a general formula for computing idempotent states associated to Hopf images, which generalizes earlier work of Banica, Franz and Skalski.
