We present a classification theorem for a class of unital simple separable amenable {\cal Z}-stable C^*-algebras by the Elliott invariant. This class of simple C^*-algebras exhausts all possible Elliott invariant for unital stably finite simple separable amenable {\cal Z}-stable C^*-algebras. Moreover, it contains all unital simple separable amenable C^*-alegbras which satisfy the UCT and have finite rational tracial rank.
