We examine splitting of the quotient map from the full free product A*B, or the unital free product A*_{\mathbb C}B, to the (maximal) tensor product A\otimes B, for unital C*-algebras A and B. Such a splitting is very rare, but we show there is one if A and B are both the Cuntz algebra O_2 or O_\infty, and in a few other cases. The splitting is not explicit (and in principle probably cannot be). We also describe severe K-theoretic obstructions to a splitting.
