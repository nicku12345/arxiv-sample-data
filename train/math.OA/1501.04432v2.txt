For a quasitriangular C*-quantum group, we enrich the twisted tensor product constructed in the first part of this series to a monoidal structure on the category of its continuous coactions on C*-algebras. We define braided C*-quantum groups, where the comultiplication takes values in a twisted tensor product. We show that compact braided C*-quantum groups yield compact quantum groups by a semidirect product construction.
