Main result: If a C*-algebra is simple, \sigma-unital, has finitely many extremal traces, and has strict comparison of positive elements by traces, then its multiplier also has strict comparison of positive elements by traces. The same results holds if "finitely many extremal traces" is replaced by "quasicontinuous scale".   A key ingredient in the proof is that every positive element in the multiplier algebra of an arbitrary \sigma-unital C*-algebra can be approximated by a bi-diagonal series.   An application of strict comparison: If the algebra is a simple separable stable \sigma-unital with real rank zero, stable rank one, strict comparison of positive elements by traces, then whether a positive element is a linear combination of projections depends on the trace values of its range projection.
