We classify equivariant *-homomorphisms between C*-dynamical systems associated to actions of finite groups on C*-algebras with the Rokhlin property. In addition, the given actions are classified. An obstruction is obtained for the Cuntz semigroup of a C*-algebra allowing such an action. We also obtain an equivariant UHF-absorption result.
