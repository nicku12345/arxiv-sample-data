C. Schochet shows K\"unneth theorem for the C^*-algebras in the smallest class of nuclear C^*-algebras which contains the separable Type I algebras and is closed under some operations. We calculate the K-theory for the crossed product of the infinite tensor product of a unital C^*-algebra in this class by the shift. In particular, we calculate the K-theory of the lamplighter group C^*-algebra.
