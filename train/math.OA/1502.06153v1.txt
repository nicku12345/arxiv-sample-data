We discuss the interplay between K-theoretical dynamics and the structure theory for certain C*-algebras arising from crossed products. For noncommutative C*-systems we present notions of minimality and topological transitivity in the K-theoretic framework which are used to prove structural results for reduced crossed products. In the presence of sufficiently many projections we associate to each noncommutative C*-system (A,G) a type semigroup S(A,G) which reflects much of the spirit of the underlying action. We characterize purely infinite as well as stably finite crossed products by means of the infinite or rather finite nature of this semigroup. We explore the dichotomy between stable finiteness and pure infiniteness in certain classes of reduced crossed products by means of paradoxical decompositions.
