Let X be an infinite compact metric space with finite covering dimension and let \alpha, \beta : X\to X be two minimal homeomorphisms. We prove that the crossed product C^*-algebras C(X)\rtimes_\alpha\Z and C(X)\rtimes_\belta\Z are isomorphic if and only if they have isomorphic Elliott invariant. In a more general setting, we show that if X is an infinite compact metric space and if \alpha: X\to X is a minimal homeomorphism such that (X, \alpha) has mean dimension zero, then the tensor product of the crossed product with a UHF-algebra of infinite type has generalized tracial rank at most one. This implies that the crossed product is in a classifiable class of amenable simple C^*-algebras.
