Suppose A is a C^*-algebra and H is a C^*-correspondence over A. If H is regular in the sense that the left action of A is faithful and is given by compact operators, then we compute the K-theory of \mathcal{O}_A(H) \rtimes \mathbb{T} where the action is the usual gauge action. The case where A is an AF-algebra is carefully analyzed. In particular, if A is AF, we show \mathcal{O}_A(H) \rtimes \mathbb{T} is AF. Combining this with Takai duality and an AF-embedding theorem of N. Brown, we show the conditions AF-embeddability, quasidiagonality, and stable finiteness are equivalent for \mathcal{O}_A(H). If H is also assumed to be regular, these finiteness conditions can be characterized in terms of the ordered K-theory of A.
