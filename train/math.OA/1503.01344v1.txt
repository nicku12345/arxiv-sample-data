We introduce and study the class of extremally rich JB^*-triples. We establish new results to determine the distance from an element a in an extremally rich JB^*-triple E to the set \partial_{e} (E_1) of all extreme points of the closed unit ball of E. More concretely, we prove that \hbox{dist} (a,\partial_e (E_1)) =\max \{ 1, \|a\|-1\}, for every a\in E which is not Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertible. As a consequence, we determine the form of the \lambda-function of Aron and Lohman on the open unit ball of an extremally rich JB^*-triple E, by showing that \lambda (a)= \frac12 for every non-BP quasi-invertible element a in the open unit ball of E. We also prove that for an extremally rich JB^*-triple E, the quadratic connorm \gamma^{q}(.) is continuous at a point a\in E if, and only if, either a is not von Neumann regular {\rm(}i.e. \gamma^{q}(a)=0{\rm)} or a is Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertible.
