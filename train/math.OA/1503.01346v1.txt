We introduce the notion of weak-2-local derivation (respectively, ^*-derivation) on a C^*-algebra A as a (non-necessarily linear) map \Delta : A\to A satisfying that for every a,b\in A and \phi\in A^* there exists a derivation (respectively, a ^*-derivation) D_{a,b,\phi}: A\to A, depending on a, b and \phi, such that \phi \Delta (a) = \phi D_{a,b,\phi} (a) and \phi \Delta (b) = \phi D_{a,b,\phi} (b). We prove that every weak-2-local ^*-derivation on M_n is a linear derivation. We also show that the same conclusion remains true for weak-2-local ^*-derivations on finite dimensional C^*-algebras.
