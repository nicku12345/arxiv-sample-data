We show that whenever m \geq 1 and M_1, \dots, M_m are nonamenable factors in a large class of von Neumann algebras that we call \mathcal C_{(\text{AO})} and which contains all free Araki-Woods factors, the tensor product factor M_1 \mathbin{\overline{\otimes}} \cdots \mathbin{\overline{\otimes}} M_m retains the integer m and each factor M_i up to stable isomorphism, after permutation of the indices. Our approach unifies the Unique Prime Factorization (UPF) results from [OP03, Is14] and moreover provides new UPF results in the case when M_1, \dots, M_m are free Araki-Woods factors. In order to obtain the aforementioned UPF results, we show that Connes's bicentralizer problem has a positive solution for all type {\rm III_1} factors in the class \mathcal C_{(\text{AO})}.
