Let (M, \varphi) = (M_1, \varphi_1) \ast (M_2, \varphi_2) be the free product of any \sigma-finite von Neumann algebras endowed with any faithful normal states. We show that whenever Q \subset M is a von Neumann subalgebra with separable predual such that both Q and Q \cap M_1 are the ranges of faithful normal conditional expectations and such that both the intersection Q \cap M_1 and the central sequence algebra Q' \cap M^\omega are diffuse (e.g. Q is amenable), then Q must sit inside M_1. This result generalizes the previous results of the first named author in [Ho14] and moreover completely settles the questions of maximal amenability and maximal property Gamma of the inclusion M_1 \subset M in arbitrary free product von Neumann algebras.
