We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a representation of a lattice ordered semigroup to be regular, in the sense that certain extensions are completely positive definite. This result generalizes a theorem due to Brehmer where the lattice ordered group was taken to be \mathbb{Z}_+^\Omega. As an immediate consequence, we prove that contractive Nica-covariant representations on lattice ordered semigroups are regular, and therefore, its minimal isometric dilation is also Nica-covariant. We also introduce an analog of commuting row contractions on lattice ordered group and show that such a representation is regular.
