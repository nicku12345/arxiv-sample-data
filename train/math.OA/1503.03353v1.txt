We prove a relative analogue of equivalence between nuclearity and CPAP. In its proof, the notion of weak containment for C^*-correspondences plays an important role. As an application we prove KK-equivalence between full and reduced amalgamated free products of C^*-algebras under a strengthened variant of `relative nuclearity'.
