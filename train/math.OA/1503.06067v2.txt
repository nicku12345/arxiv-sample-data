A {\it separated graph} is a pair (E,C) consisting of a directed graph E and a set C=\bigsqcup_{v\in E^0}C_v, where each C_v is a partition of the set of edges whose terminal vertex is v. Given a separated graph (E,C), such that all the sets X\in C are finite, the K-theory of the graph C*-algebra C^*(E,C) is known to be determined by the kernel and the cokernel of a certain map, denoted by 1_C- A_{(E,C)}, from \mathbb Z^{(C)} to \mathbb Z^{(E^0)}. In this paper, we compute the K-theory of the {\it tame} graph C*-algebra \mathcal O(E,C) associated to (E,C), which has been recently introduced by the authors. Letting \pi denote the natural surjective homomorphism from C^*(E,C) onto \mathcal O(E,C), we show that K_1(\pi) is a group isomorphism, and that K_0(\pi) is a split monomorphism, whose cokernel is a torsion-free abelian group. We also prove that this cokernel is a free abelian group when the graph E is finite, and determine its generators in terms of a sequence of separated graphs \{(E_n, C^n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty} naturally attached to (E,C). On the way to showing our main results, we obtain an explicit description of a connecting map arising in a six-term exact sequence computing the K-theory of an amalgamated free product, and we also exhibit an explicit isomorphism between \mathrm{ker} (1_C - A_{(E,C)}) and K_1(C^*(E,C)).
