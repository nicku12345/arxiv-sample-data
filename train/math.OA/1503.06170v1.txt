We give a rigorous account and prove continuity properties for the correspondence between almost flat bundles on a triangularizable compact connected space and the quasi-representations of its fundamental group. For a discrete countable group \Gamma with finite classifying space B\Gamma, we study a correspondence between between almost flat K-theory classes on B\Gamma and group homomorphism K_0(C^*(\Gamma))\to \mathbb{Z} that are implemented by pairs of discrete asymptotic homomorphisms from C^*(\Gamma) to matrix algebras.
