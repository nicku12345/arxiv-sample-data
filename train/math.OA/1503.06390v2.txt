In his article "On the free convolution with a semicircular distribution," Biane found very useful characterizations of the boundary values of the imaginary part of the Cauchy-Stieltjes transform of the free additive convolution of a probability measure on the real line with a Wigner (semicircular) distribution. Biane's methods were recently extended by Huang to measures which belong to the partial free convolution semigroups introduced by Nica and Speicher. This note further extends some of Biane's methods and results to free convolution powers of operator-valued distributions and to free convolutions with operator-valued semicirculars. In addition, it investigates properties of the Julia-Caratheodory derivative of the subordination functions associated to such semigroups, extending certain results from the article "Partially Defined Semigroups Relative to Multiplicative Free Convolution" by Bercovici and the author (reference [7] in the text).
