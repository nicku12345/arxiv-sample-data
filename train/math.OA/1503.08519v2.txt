We introduce filling families with matrix diagonalization as a refinement of the work by R{\o}rdam and the first named author. As an application we improve a result on local pure infiniteness and show that the minimal tensor product of a strongly purely infinite C^*-algebra and a exact C^*-algebra is again strongly purely infinite. Our results also yield a sufficient criterion for the strong pure infiniteness of crossed products A\rtimes_\varphi \mathbb{N} by an endomorphism \varphi of A (cf. Theorem 7.6). Our work confirms that the special class of nuclear Cuntz-Pimsner algebras constructed by Harnisch and the first named author consist of strongly purely infinite C^*-algebras, and thus absorb \mathcal{O}_\infty tensorially.
