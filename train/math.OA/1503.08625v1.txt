Let H^{\infty}(E) be a non commutative Hardy algebra, associated with a W^*-correspondence E. In this paper we construct factorizations of inner-outer type of the elements of H^{\infty}(E) represented via the induced representation, and of the elements of its commutant. These factorizations generalize the classical inner-outer factorization of elements of H^\infty(\mathbb{D}). Our results also generalize some results that were obtained by several authors in some special cases.
