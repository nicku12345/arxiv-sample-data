Let \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{B} be two C^{*}-algebras such that \mathcal{B} is prime. In this paper, we investigate the additivity of map \Phi from \mathcal{A} onto \mathcal{B} that are bijective unital and satisfies \Phi(AP+\eta PA^{*})=\Phi(A)\Phi(P)+\eta \Phi(P)\Phi(A)^{*}, for all A\in\mathcal{A} and P\in\{P_{1},I_{\mathcal{A}}-P_{1}\} where P_{1} is a nontrivial projection in \mathcal{A}. Let \eta be a non-zero complex number such that |\eta|\neq1, then \Phi is additive. Moreover, if \eta is rational then \Phi is \ast-additive.
