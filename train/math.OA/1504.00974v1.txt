Let \mathcal{L} be an algebra generated by the commuting independent nests, \mathcal{M} is an ultra-weakly closed subalgebra of \mathbf{B(H)} which contains alg\mathcal{L} and \phi is a norm continuous linear mapping from alg\mathcal{L} into \mathcal{M}. In this paper we will show that a norm continuous linear derivable mapping at zero point from Alg\mathcal{L} to \mathcal{M} is a derivation
