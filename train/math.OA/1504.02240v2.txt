As a contribution of the programme of Goswami and Mandal (2014), we carry out explicit computations of \mathbb{Q}(\Gamma,S), the quantum isometry group of the canonical spectral triple on C_{r}^{*}(\Gamma) coming from the word length function corresponding to a finite generating set S, for several interesting examples of \Gamma not covered by the previous work Goswami and Mandal (2014). These include the braid group of 3 generators, \mathbb{Z}_4^{*n} etc. Moreover, we give an alternative description of the quantum groups H_s^{+}(n,0) and K_n^{+} (studied in Banica and Skalski (2012), Banica and Skalski (2013)) in terms of free wreath product. In the last section we give several new examples of groups for which \mathbb{Q}(\Gamma) turn out to be doubling of C^*(\Gamma).
