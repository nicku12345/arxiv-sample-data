Let \Gamma^{+} be the positive cone in a totally ordered abelian group \Gamma, and \alpha an action of \Gamma^{+} by extendible endomorphisms of a C^{\ast}-algebra A. Suppose I is an extendible \alpha-invariant ideal of A. We prove that the partial-isometric crossed product \mathcal{I}:=I\times_{\alpha}^{\textrm{piso}}\Gamma^{+} embeds naturally as an ideal of A\times_{\alpha}^{\textrm{piso}}\Gamma^{+}, such that the quotient is the partial-isometric crossed product of the quotient algebra. We claim that this ideal \mathcal{I} together with the kernel of a natural homomorphism \phi: A\times_{\alpha}^{\textrm{piso}}\Gamma^{+}\rightarrow A\times_{\alpha}^{\textrm{iso}}\Gamma^{+} gives a composition series of ideals of A\times_{\alpha}^{\textrm{piso}}\Gamma^{+} studied by Lindiarni and Raeburn.
