Let \A be a C^*-algebra with unit element 1 and unitary group U. Let a=(a_1, ..., a_k) and b=(b_1, ..., b_k) two k-tuples of elements in \A. The elementary operator associated to a and b is defined by  R_{a, b} (x)= \sum_{i=1}^ {k} a_ixb_i. In this paper we prove the following formula for the numerical range of R_{a,b}: V(R_{a, b}, B(\A))= [\cup \{ V(\sum_{i=1}^ {k}u^*a_iub_i, \A): u\in U\} ]^-. This formulat solves the problem 4.5 of \cite{Fi}.
