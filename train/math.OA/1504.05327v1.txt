In this work, for a given inverse semigroup we will define the crossed product of an inverse semigroup by a partial action. Also, we will associate to an inverse semigroup G an inverse semigroup S_G, and we will prove that there is a correspondence between the covariant representation of G and covariant representation of S_G. Finally, we will explore a connection between crossed products of an inverse semigroup actions and crossed products by partial actions of inverse semigroups.
