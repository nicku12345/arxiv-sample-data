We characterize supramenable groups in terms of existence of invariant probability measures for partial actions on compact Hausdorff spaces and existence of tracial states on partial crossed products.   These characterizations show that, in general, one cannot decompose a partial crossed product of a C*-algebra by a semi-direct product of groups as two iterated partial crossed products. We give conditions which ensure that such decomposition is possible.
