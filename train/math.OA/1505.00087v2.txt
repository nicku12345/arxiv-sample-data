In this paper we examine a natural operator system structure on Pisier's self-dual operator space. We prove that this operator system is completely order isomorphic to its dual with the cb-condition number of this isomorphism as small as possible. We examine further properties of this operator system and use it to create a new tensor product on operator systems.
