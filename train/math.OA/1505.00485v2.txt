Let \Lambda be a strongly connected, finite higher-rank graph. In this paper, we construct representations of C^*(\Lambda) on certain separable Hilbert spaces of the form L^2(X,\mu), by introducing the notion of a \Lambda-semibranching function system (a generalization of the semibranching function systems studied by Marcolli and Paolucci). In particular, when \Lambda is aperiodic, we obtain a faithful representation of C^*(\Lambda) on L^2(\Lambda^\infty, M), where M is the Perron-Frobenius probability measure on the infinite path space \Lambda^\infty recently studied by an Huef, Laca, Raeburn, and Sims. We also show how a \Lambda-semibranching function system gives rise to KMS states for C^*(\Lambda). For the higher-rank graphs of Robertson and Steger, we also obtain a representation of C^*(\Lambda) on L^2(X, \mu), where X is a fractal subspace of [0,1] by embedding \Lambda^{\infty} into [0,1] as a fractal subset X of [0,1]. In this latter case we additionally show that there exists a KMS state for C^*(\Lambda) whose inverse temperature is equal to the Hausdorff dimension of X. Finally, we construct a wavelet system for L^2(\Lambda^\infty, M) by generalizing the work of Marcolli and Paolucci from graphs to higher-rank graphs.
