We study certain actions of finitely generated abelian groups on higher dimensional noncommutative tori. Given a dimension d and a finitely generated abelian group G, we apply a certain function to detect whether there is a simple noncommutative d-torus which admits a specific action by G. We also describe the condition of G under which the associated crossed product is an AF algebra.
