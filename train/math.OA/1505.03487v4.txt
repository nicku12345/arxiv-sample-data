A certain type of functor on a category of coactions of a locally compact group on C*-algebras is introduced and studied. These functors are intended to help in the study of the crossed-product functors that have been recently introduced in relation to the Baum-Connes conjecture. The most important coaction functors are the ones induced by large ideals of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra. It is left as an open problem whether the "minimal exact and Morita compatible crossed-product functor" is induced by a large ideal.
