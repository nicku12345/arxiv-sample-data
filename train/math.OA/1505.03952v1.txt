In 1967, Arveson invented a non-commutative generalization of classical H^{\infty}, known as finite maximal subdiagonal subalgebras, for a finite von Neumann algebra \mathcal M with a faithful normal tracial state \tau. In 2008, Blecher and Labuschagne proved a version of Beurling's theorem on H^\infty-right invariant subspaces in a non-commutative L^{p}(\mathcal M,\tau) space for 1\le p\le \infty. In the present paper, we define and study a class of norms {\mathcal{N}}_{c}(\mathcal M, \tau) on \mathcal{M}, called normalized, unitarily invariant, \Vert \cdot \Vert_{1}-dominating, continuous norms, which properly contains the class \{ \Vert \cdot \Vert_{p}:1\leq p< \infty \}. For \alpha \in \mathcal{N}_{c}(\mathcal M, \tau), we define a non-commutative L^{\alpha }({\mathcal{M}},\tau) space and a non-commutative H^{\alpha} space. Then we obtain a version of the Blecher-Labuschagne-Beurling invariant subspace theorem on H^\infty-right invariant subspaces in a non-commutative L^{\alpha }({\mathcal{M}},\tau) space. Key ingredients in the proof of our main result include a characterization theorem of H^\alpha and a density theorem for L^\alpha(\mathcal M,\tau).
