Let G be a finite group and H a normal subgroup. D(H;G) is the crossed product of C(H) and {\Bbb C}G which is only a subalgebra of D(G), the quantum double of G. One can construct a C^*-subalgebra {\mathcal{F}}_{_H} of the field algebra \mathcal{F} of G-spin models, such that {\mathcal{F}}_{_H} is a D(H;G)-module algebra. The concrete construction of D(H;G)-invariant subalgebra {\mathcal{A}}_{_{(H,G)}} of {\mathcal{F}}_{_H} is given. By constructing the quasi-basis of conditional expectation z_{_H} of {\mathcal{F}}_{_H} onto {\mathcal{A}}_{_{(H,G)}}, the C^*-index of z_{_H} is given.
