We investigate structural properties of the reduced cross-sectional algebra C^*_r(\mathcal{B}) of a Fell bundle \mathcal{B} over a discrete group G. Conditions allowing one to determine the ideal structure of C^*_r(\mathcal{B}) are studied. Notions of aperiodicity, paradoxicality and \mathcal{B}-infiniteness for the Fell bundle \mathcal{B} are introduced and investigated by themselves and in relation to the partial dynamical system dual to \mathcal{B}. Several criteria of pure infiniteness of C^*_r(\mathcal{B}) are given. It is shown that they generalize and unify corresponding results obtained in the context of crossed products, by the following duos: Laca, Spielberg; Jolissaint, Robertson; Sierakowski, R{\o}rdam; Giordano, Sierakowski and Ortega, Pardo.   For exact, separable Fell bundles satisfying the residual intersection property primitive ideal space of C^*_r(\mathcal{B}) is determined. The results of the paper are shown to be optimal when applied to graph C^*-algebras. Applications to a class of Exel-Larsen crossed products are presented.
