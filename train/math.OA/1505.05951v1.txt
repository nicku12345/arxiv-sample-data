As recently pointed out by Gabe, a fundamental paper by Elliott and Kucerovsky concerning the absorption theory for C*-algebras contains an error, and as a consequence we must report that Lemma 4.5 in "Classifying C*-algebras with both finite and infinite subquotients" J. Funct. Anal. 265 (2013), no. 3, 449--468 is not true as stated. In this corrigendum, we prove an adjusted statement and explain why the error has no consequences to the main results of that paper. In particular, it is noted that all the authors' claims concerning Morita equivalence or stable isomorphism of graph C*-algebras remain correct as stated.
