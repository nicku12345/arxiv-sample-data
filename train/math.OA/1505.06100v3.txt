It is shown that every Jiang-Su stable approximately subhomogeneous C*-algebra has finite decomposition rank. Previously, it was not even known that such algebras have finite nuclear dimension. A key step in the proof is that subhomogeneous C*-algebra are locally approximated by a certain class of more tractable subhomogeneous algebras, namely, a non-commutative generalization of the class of cell complexes. The result is applied to show that Jiang-Su stable minimal Z-crossed products have finite decomposition rank.
