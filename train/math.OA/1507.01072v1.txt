We prove that if A is a singular MASA in a II_1 factor M and \omega is a free ultrafilter, then for any x\in M\ominus A, with \|x\|\leq 1, and any n\geq 2, there exists a partition of 1 with projections p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\in A^\omega (i.e. a {\it paving}) such that \|\Sigma_{i=1}^n p_i x p_i\|\leq 2\sqrt{n-1}/n, and give examples where this is sharp. Some open problems on optimal pavings are discussed.
