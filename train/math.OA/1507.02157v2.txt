Let I be any nonempty set and (M_i, \varphi_i)_{i \in I} any family of nonamenable factors, endowed with arbitrary faithful normal states, that belong to a large class \mathcal C_{\rm anti-free} of (possibly type III) von Neumann algebras including all nonprime factors, all nonfull factors and all factors possessing a Cartan subalgebra. For the free product (M, \varphi) = \ast_{i \in I} (M_i, \varphi_i), we show that the free product von Neumann algebra M retains the cardinality |I| and each nonamenable factor M_i up to stably inner conjugacy, after permutation of the indices. Our main theorem unifies all previous Kurosh-type rigidity results for free product type II_1 factors and is new for free product type III factors. It moreover provides new rigidity phenomena for type III factors.
