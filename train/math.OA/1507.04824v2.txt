We consider the mixed q-Gaussian algebras introduced by Speicher which are generated by the variables X_i=l_i+l_i^*,i=1,\ldots,N, where l_i^* l_j-q_{ij}l_j l_i^*=\delta_{i,j} and -1<q_{ij}=q_{ji}<1. Using the free monotone transport theorem of Guionnet and Shlyakhtenko, we show that the mixed q-Gaussian von Neumann algebras are isomorphic to the free group von Neumann algebra L(\mathbb{F}_N), provided that \max_{i,j}|q_{ij}| is small enough. The proof relies on some estimates which are generalizations of Dabrowski's results for the special case q_{ij}\equiv q.
