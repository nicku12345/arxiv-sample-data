We study new classes of linear preservers between C^*-algebras and JB^*-triples. Let E and F be JB^*-triples with \partial_{e} (E_1). We prove that every linear map T:E\to F strongly preserving Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertible elements is a triple homomorphism. Among the consequences, we establish that, given two unital C^*-algebras A and B, for each linear map T strongly preserving Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertible elements, then there exists a Jordan ^*-homomorphism S: A\to B satisfying T(x) = T(1) S(x), for every x\in A. We also study the connections between linear maps strongly preserving Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertibility and other clases of linear preservers between C^*-algebras like Bergmann-zero pairs preservers, Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertibility preservers and extreme points preservers.
