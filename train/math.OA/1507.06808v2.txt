In this article, we generalize to the case of regular locally compact quantum groups, two important results concerning actions of compact quantum groups. Let G_1 and G_2 be two monoidally equivalent regular locally compact quantum groups in the sense of De Commer. We introduce an induction procedure and we build an equivalence of the categories {A}^{G_1} and {A}^{G_2} consisting of continuous actions of G_1 and G_2 on C^*-algebras. As an application of this result, we derive a canonical equivalence of the categories {KK}^{G_1} and {KK}^{G_2}. We introduce and investigate a notion of actions on C^*-algebras of measured quantum groupoids on a finite basis. The proof of the equivalence between {KK}^{G_1} and {KK}^{G_2} relies on a version of the Takesaki-Takai duality theorem for continuous actions on C^*-algebras of measured quantum groupoids on a finite basis.
