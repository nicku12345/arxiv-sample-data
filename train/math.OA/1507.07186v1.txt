The aim of this note is to study \v{C}eby\v{s}\"ev JB^*-subtriples of general JB^*-triples. It is established that if F is a non-zero \v{C}eby\v{s}\"ev JB^*-subtriple of a JB^*-triple E, then exactly one of the following statements holds:\begin{enumerate}\item F is a rank one JBW^*-triple with dim(F)\geq 2 (i.e. a complex Hilbert space regarded as a type 1 Cartan factor). Moreover, F may be a closed subspace of arbitrary dimension and E may have arbitrary rank, \item F= \mathbb{C} e, where e is a complete tripotent in E, \item E and F are rank two JBW^*-triples, but F may have arbitrary dimension, \item F has rank greater or equal than three and E=F. \end{enumerate}
