Building on an argument by Toms and Winter, we show that if A is a simple, separable, unital, \mathcal{Z}-stable C*-algebra, then the crossed product of C(X,A) by an automorphism is also Z-stable, provided that the automorphism induces a minimal homeomorphism on X. As a consequence, we observe that if A is nuclear and purely infinite then the crossed product is a Kirchberg algebra.
