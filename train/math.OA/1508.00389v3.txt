We prove lifting theorems for completely positive maps going out of exact C^\ast-algebras, where we remain in control of which ideals are mapped into which. A consequence is, that if \mathsf X is a second countable topological space, \mathfrak A and \mathfrak B are separable, nuclear C^\ast-algebras over \mathsf X, and the action of \mathsf X on \mathfrak A is continuous, then E(\mathsf X; \mathfrak A, \mathfrak B) \cong KK(\mathsf X; \mathfrak A, \mathfrak B) naturally.   As an application, we show that a separable, nuclear, strongly purely infinite C^\ast-algebra \mathfrak A absorbs a strongly self-absorbing C^\ast-algebra \mathscr D if and only if \mathfrak I and \mathfrak I\otimes \mathscr D are KK-equivalent for every two-sided, closed ideal \mathfrak I in \mathfrak A. In particular, if \mathfrak A is separable, nuclear, and strongly purely infinite, then \mathfrak A \otimes \mathcal O_2 \cong \mathfrak A if and only if every two-sided, closed ideal in \mathfrak A is KK-equivalent to zero.
