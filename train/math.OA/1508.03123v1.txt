We study lifting properties for full product C*-algebras with amalgamation over {\mathbb C}1 and give new proofs for some results of Kirchberg and Pisier. We extend the result of Choi on the quasidiagonality of C^*({\mathbb F}_n), proving that the free product with amalgamation over {\mathbb C}1 of a family of unital quasidiagonal C*-algebras is quasidiagonal.
