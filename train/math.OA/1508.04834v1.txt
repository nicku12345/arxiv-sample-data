We extend known results about commutative C^*-algebras generated Toeplitz operators over the unit ball to the supermanifold setup. This is obtained by constructing commutative C^*-algebras of super Toeplitz operators over the super ball \mathbb{B}^{p|q} and the super Siegel domain \mathbb{U}^{p|q} that naturally generalize the previous results for the unit ball and the Siegel domain. In particular, we obtain one such commutative C^*-algebra for each even maximal Abelian subgroup of automorphisms of the super ball.
