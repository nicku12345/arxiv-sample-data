Gelfand - Na\u{i}mark theorem supplies a one to one correspondence between commutative C^*-algebras and locally compact Hausdorff spaces. So any noncommutative C^*-algebra can be regarded as a generalization of a topological space. Similarly a spectral triple is a generalization of a Riemannian manifold. An (infinitely listed) covering of a Riemannian manifold has natural structure of Riemannian manifold. Here we will consider the noncommutative generalization of this result.
