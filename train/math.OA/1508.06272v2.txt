In this paper, we generalize the work of Werner and others to develop two abstract characterizations for self-adjoint operator spaces. The corresponding abstract objects can be represented as self-adjoint subspaces of B(H) in such a way that both a metric structure and an order structure are preserved at each matrix level. We demonstrate a generalization of the Arveson Extension Theorem in this context. We also show that quotients of self-adjoint operator spaces can be endowed with a compatible operator space structure and characterize the kernels of completely positive completely bounded maps on self-adjoint operator spaces.
