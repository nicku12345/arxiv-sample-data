We prove a classification result for a large class of noncommutative Bernoulli crossed products (P,\phi)^\Lambda \rtimes \Lambda without almost periodic states. Our results improve the classification results from [1], where only Bernoulli crossed products built with almost periodic states could be treated. We show that the family of factors (P,\phi)^\Lambda \rtimes \Lambda with P an amenable factor, \phi a weakly mixing state (i.e. a state for which the modular automorphism group is weakly mixing) and \Lambda belonging to a large class of groups, is classified by the group \Lambda and the action \Lambda \curvearrowright (P, \phi)^\Lambda, up to state preserving conjugation of the action.
