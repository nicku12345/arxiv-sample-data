We introduce the fundamental group \r{F}(\c{A}) of a unital C^*-algebra \c{A} with finite dimensional trace space. The elements of fundamental group are restricted by K-theoretical obstruction and positivity. Moreover we show there are uncountably many mutually nonisomorphic simple C^{*}-algebras such that \r{F}(\c{A})=\set{I_{n}}. Our study is due to the results of fundamental group by Nawata and Watatani.
