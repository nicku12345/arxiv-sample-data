Further to the functional representations of C^*-algebras proposed by R. Cirelli, A. Mania and L. Pizzocchero, we consider in this article the uniform K\"ahler bundle (in short, UKB) description of some C^*-algebraic subjects. In particular, we obtain an one-to-one correspondence between closed ideals of a C^*-algebra \mathcal{A} and full uniform K\"ahler sub bundles over open subsets of the base space of the UKB associated with \mathcal{A}. In addition, we will present a geometric description of the pure state space of hereditary C^*-subalgebras and show that that if \mathcal{B} is a hereditary C^*-subalgebra of \mathcal{A}, the UKB of \mathcal{B} is a kind of K\"ahler subbundle of the UKB of \mathcal{A}. As a simple example, we consider hereditary C^*-subalgebras of the C^*-algebra of compact operators on a Hilbert space. Finally, we remark that hereditary C^*-subalgebras also naturally can be characterized as uniform holomorphic Hilbert subbundles.
