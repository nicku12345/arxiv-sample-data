In the present paper 2-local derivations on various algebras of infinite dimensional matrix-valued functions on a compact are considered. It is proved that every 2-local derivation on such algebra is a derivation. Also we explain that the method developed in the given paper can be applied to associative, Jordan and Lie algebras of infinite dimensional matrix-valued functions on a compact.
