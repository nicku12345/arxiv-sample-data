We define \Gamma_q(B,S \otimes H), the generalized q-gaussian von Neumann algebras associated to a sequence of symmetric independent copies (\pi_j,B,A,D) and to a subset 1 \in S = S^* \subset A and, under certain assumptions, prove their strong solidity relative to B. We provide many examples of strongly solid generalized q-gaussian von Neumann algebras. We also obtain non-isomorphism and non-embedability results about some of these von Neumann algebras.
