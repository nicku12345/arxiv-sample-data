The homotopy symmetric C^*-algebras are those separable C^*-algebras for which one can unsuspend in E-theory. We find a new simple condition that characterizes homotopy symmetric nuclear C^*-algebras and use it to show that the property of being homotopy symmetric passes to nuclear C^*-subalgebras and it has a number of other significant permanence properties.   As an application, we show that if I(G) is the kernel of the trivial representation \iota:C^*(G)\to \mathbb{C} for a countable discrete torsion free nilpotent group G, then I(G) is homotopy symmetric and hence the Kasparov group KK(I(G),B) can be realized as the homotopy classes of asymptotic morphisms [[I(G),B \otimes \mathcal{K}]] for any separable C^*-algebra B.
