We introduce and study strongly self-absorbing actions of locally compact groups on C*-algebras. This is an equivariant generalization of a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra to the setting of C*-dynamical systems. The main result is the following equivariant McDuff-type absorption theorem: A cocycle action (\alpha,u): G\curvearrowright A on a separable C*-algebra is cocycle conjugate to its tensorial stabilization with a strongly self-absorbing action \gamma: G\curvearrowright\mathcal{D}, if and only if there exists an equivariant and unital *-homomorphism from \mathcal{D} into the central sequence algebra of A. We also discuss some non-trivial examples of strongly self-absorbing actions.
