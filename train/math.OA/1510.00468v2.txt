We show that if A is a separable, simple and non-type I C^{\ast} algebra, then for every properly infinite hyperfinite von Neumann algebra M with separable predual, its Ocneanu ultrapower M'\cap M^{\omega} arises as a sub-quotient of the central sequence algebra F(A) defined by the second named author. In particular, this answers affirmatively the question of the second named author (Abel Symposium '04): the central sequence C^{\ast}-algebra of the reduced free group C^{\ast}-algebra C_{\rm{red}}^*(\mathbb{F}_2) is non-commutative.
