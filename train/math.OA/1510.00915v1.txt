We introduce and study weak-2-local symmetric maps between C^*-algebras A and B as non necessarily linear nor continuous maps \Delta: A\to B such that for each a,b\in A and \phi\in B^{*}, there exists a symmetric linear map T_{a,b,\phi}: A\to B, depending on a, b and \phi, satisfying \phi \Delta(a) = \phi T_{a,b,\phi}(a) and \phi \Delta(b) = \phi T_{a,b,\phi}(b). We prove that every weak-2-local symmetric map between C^*-algebras is a linear map. Among the consequences we show that every weak-2-local ^*-derivation on a general C^*-algebra is a (linear) ^*-derivation. We also establish a 2-local version of the Kowalski-S{\l}odkowski theorem for general C^*-algebras by proving that every 2-local ^*-homomorphism between C^*-algebras is a (linear) ^*-homomorphism.
