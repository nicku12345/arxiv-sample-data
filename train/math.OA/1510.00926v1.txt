In this paper, we consider the Wiener Hopf algebra, denoted \mathcal{W}(A,P,G,\alpha), associated to an action of a discrete subsemigroup P of a group G on a C^{*}-algebra A. We show that \mathcal{W}(A,P,G,\alpha) can be represented as a groupoid crossed product. As an application, we show that when P=\mathbb{F}_{n}^{+}, the free semigroup on n generators, the K-theory of \mathcal{W}(A,P,G,\alpha) and the K-theory of A coincides.
