In this paper, we consider \text{C}^*-algebras with the ideal property (the ideal property unifies the simple and real rank zero cases). We define two categories related the invariants of the \text{C}^*-algebras with the ideal property. And we showed that these two categories are in fact isomorphic. As a consequence, the Elliott's Invariant and the Stevens' Invariant are isomorphic for \text{C}^*-algebras with the ideal property.
