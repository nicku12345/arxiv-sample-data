Following Jansen and Waldmann, and Kajiwara and Watatani, we shall introduce notions of coactions of a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra on a Hilbert C^*-bimodule of finite type in the sense of Kajiwara and Watatani and define their crossed product. We shall investigate their basic properties and show that the strong Morita equivalence for coactions preserves the Rohlin property for coactions of a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra on unital C^*-algebras.
