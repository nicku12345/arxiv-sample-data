The C^*-algebra of continuous functions on the quantum quaternion sphere H_q^{2n} can be identified with the quotient algebra C(SP_q(2n)/SP_q(2n-2)). In commutative case i.e. for q=1, the topological space SP(2n)/SP(2n-2) is homeomorphic to the odd dimensional sphere S^{4n-1}. In this paper, we prove the noncommutative analogue of this result. Using homogeneous C^*-extension theory, we prove that the C^*-algebra C(H_q^{2n}) is isomorphic to the C^*-algebra C(S_q^{4n-1}). This further implies that for different values of q \in [0,1), the C^*-algebras underlying the noncommutative space H_q^{2n} are isomorphic.
