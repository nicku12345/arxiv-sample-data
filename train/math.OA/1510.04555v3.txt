We define and examine sequentially split *-homomorphisms between \mathrm{C}^*-algebras and \mathrm{C}^*-dynamical systems. For a *-homomorphism, the property of being sequentially split can be regarded as an approximate weakening of being a split-injective inclusion of \mathrm{C}^*-algebras. We show for a sequentially split *-homomorphism that a multitude of \mathrm{C}^*-algebraic approximation properties pass from the target algebra to the domain algebra, including virtually all important approximation properties currently used in the classification theory of \mathrm{C}^*-algebras. We also discuss various settings in which sequentially split *-homomorphisms arise naturally from context. One particular class of examples arises from compact group actions with the Rokhlin property. This allows us to recover and extend the presently known permanence properties of Rokhlin actions with a unified conceptual approach and a simple proof. Moreover, this perspective allows us to obtain new results about such actions, such as a generalization of Izumi's original K-theory formula for the fixed point algebra, or duality between the Rokhlin property and approximate representability.
