We show that C*-algebras generated by irreducible representations of finitely generated nilpotent groups satisfy the universal coefficient theorem of Rosenberg and Schochet. This result combines with previous work to show that these algebras are classifiable by their Elliott invariants within the class of unital, simple, separable, nuclear C*-algebras with finite nuclear dimension that satisfy the universal coefficient theorem. We also show that these C*-algebras are central cutdowns of twisted group C*-algebras with homotopically trivial cocycles.
