Let X=\mathbb R^2 and let q\in\mathbb C, |q|=1. For x=(x^1,x^2) and y=(y^1,y^2) from X^2, we define a function Q(x,y) to be equal to q if x^1<y^1, to \bar q if x^1>y^1, and to \Re q if x^1=y^1. Let \partial_x^+, \partial_x^- (x\in X) be operator-valued distributions such that \partial_x^+ is the adjoint of \partial_x^-. We say that \partial_x^+, \partial_x^- satisfy the anyon commutation relations (ACR) if \partial^+_x\partial_y^+=Q(y,x)\partial_y^+\partial_x^+ for x\ne y and \partial^-_x\partial_y^+=\delta(x-y)+Q(x,y)\partial_y^+\partial^-_x for (x,y)\in X^2. In particular, for q=1, the ACR become the canonical commutation relations and for q=-1, the ACR become the canonical anticommutation relations. We define the ACR algebra as the algebra generated by operator-valued integrals of \partial_x^+, \partial_x^-. We construct a class of gauge-invariant quasi-free states on the ACR algebra. Each state from this class is completely determined by a positive self-adjoint operator T on the real space L^2(X,dx) which commutes with any operator of multiplication by a bounded function \psi(x^1). In the case \Re q<0, the operator T additionally satisfies 0\le T\le -1/\Re q. Further, for T=\kappa^2\mathbf 1 (\kappa>0), we discuss the corresponding particle density \rho(x):=\partial_x^+\partial_x^-. For \Re q\in(0,1], using a renormalization, we rigorously define a vacuum state on the commutative algebra generated by operator-valued integrals of \rho(x). This state is given by a negative binomial point process. A scaling limit of these states as \kappa\to\infty gives the gamma random measure, depending on parameter \Re q.
