In the previous article, we proved that a topological correspondence (X,\lambda) from a locally compact groupoid with a Haar system (G,\alpha) to another one, (H,\beta), produces a C^*-correspondence \mathcal{H}(X) from C^*(G,\alpha) to C^*(H,\beta). In the present article, we describe how to form a composite of two topological correspondences when the bispaces are Hausdorff and second countable in addition to being locally compact.
