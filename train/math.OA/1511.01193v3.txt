Let A be an N\times N irreducible matrix with entries in \{0,1\}. We present an easy way to find an (N+3)\times (N+3) irreducible matrix \bar{A} with entries in \{0,1\} such that their Cuntz--Krieger algebras {\mathcal{O}}_A and {\mathcal{O}}_{\bar{A}} are isomorphic and  \det(1 -A) = - \det(1-\bar{A}).  As a consequence, we know that two Cuntz--Krieger algebras {\mathcal{O}}_A and {\mathcal{O}}_B are isomorphic if and only if the one-sided topological Markov shift (X_A, \sigma_A) is continuously orbit equivalent to (X_B, \sigma_B) or (X_{\bar{B}}, \sigma_{\bar{B}}).
