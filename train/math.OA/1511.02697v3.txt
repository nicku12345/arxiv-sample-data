We show that a separable, nuclear C*-algebra satisfies the UCT if it has a Cartan subalgebra. Furthermore, we prove that the UCT is closed under crossed products by group actions which respect Cartan subalgebras. This observation allows us to deduce, among other things, that a crossed product \mathcal O_2\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb Z_p  satisfies the UCT if there is some automorphism \gamma of \mathcal O_2 with the property that \gamma(\mathcal D_2)\subseteq \mathcal O_2\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb Z_p is regular, where \mathcal D_2 denotes the canonical masa of \mathcal O_2. We prove that this condition is automatic if \gamma(\mathcal D_2)\subseteq \mathcal O_2\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb Z_p is not a masa or \alpha(\gamma(\mathcal D_2)) is inner conjugate to \gamma(\mathcal D_2). Finally, we relate the UCT problem for separable, nuclear, M_{2^\infty}-absorbing C*-algebras to Cartan subalgebras and order two automorphisms of \mathcal O_2.
