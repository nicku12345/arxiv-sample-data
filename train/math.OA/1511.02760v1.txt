Recently, it was proved by Tikuisis, White and Winter that any faithful trace on a separable, nuclear C^\ast-algebras in the UCT class is quasidiagonal. Building on their work, we generalise the result, and show that any faithful, amenable trace on a separable, exact C^\ast-algebras in the UCT class is quasidiagonal. We also prove that any amenable trace on a separable, exact, quasidiagonal C^\ast-algebra in the UCT class is quasidiagonal.
