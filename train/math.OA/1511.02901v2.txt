We make some observations about Rosenberg's Levi-Civita connections on noncommutative tori, noting the non-uniqueness of torsion-free metric-compatible connections without prescribed connection operator for the inner *-derivations, the nontrivial curvature form of the inner *-derivations, and the validity of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for two classes of non-conformal deformations of the flat metric on the noncommutative two-tori, including the case of non-commuting scalings along the principal directions of a two-torus.
