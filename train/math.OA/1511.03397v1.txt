We generalize the main result of Kamalov and show that if G is an amenable discrete group with an action \alpha on a finite nuclear unital C^*-algebra A such that the reduced crossed product A\rtimes_{\alpha,r} G has property T, then G is finite and A is finite dimensional. As an application, an infinite discrete group H is non-amenable if and only if the uniform Roe algebra C^*_u(H) has property T.
