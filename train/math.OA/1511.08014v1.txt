We show that for a linear space of operators {\mathcal M}\subseteq {\mathcal B}(H_1,H_2) the following assertions are equivalent.   (i) {\mathcal M}  is reflexive in the sense of Loginov--Shulman. (ii) There exists an order-preserving map \Psi=(\psi_1,\psi_2) on a bilattice   Bil({\mathcal M}) of subspaces determined by {\mathcal M}, with P\leq \psi_1(P,Q) and Q\leq \psi_2(P,Q), for any pair (P,Q)\in Bil({\mathcal M}), and   such that an operator T\in {\mathcal B}(H_1,H_2) lies in {\mathcal M} if and only if \psi_2(P,Q)T\psi_1(P,Q)=0 for all   (P,Q)\in Bil( {\mathcal M}). This extends to reflexive spaces the Erdos--Power type characterization of weakly closed bimodules over a nest algebra.
