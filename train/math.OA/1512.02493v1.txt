We give two different proofs of the existence of the AH+2 subfactor, which is a 3-supertransitive self-dual subfactor with index \frac{9+\sqrt{17}}{2} . The first proof is a direct construction using connections on graphs and intertwiner calculus for bimodule categories. The second proof is indirect, and deduces the existence of AH+2 from a recent alternative construction of the Asaeda-Haagerup subfactor and fusion combinatorics of the Brauer-Picard groupoid.
