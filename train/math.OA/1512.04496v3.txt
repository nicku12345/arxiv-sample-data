We investigate the K-theory of unital UCT Kirchberg algebras \mathcal{Q}_S arising from families S of relatively prime numbers. It is shown that K_*(\mathcal{Q}_S) is the direct sum of a free abelian group and a torsion group, each of which is realized by another distinct C^*-algebra naturally associated to S. The C^*-algebra representing the torsion part is identified with a natural subalgebra \mathcal{A}_S of \mathcal{Q}_S. For the K-theory of \mathcal{Q}_S, the cardinality of S determines the free part and is also relevant for the torsion part, for which the greatest common divisor g_S of \{p-1 : p \in S\} plays a central role as well. In the case where \lvert S \rvert \leq 2 or g_S=1 we obtain a complete classification for \mathcal{Q}_S. Our results support the conjecture that \mathcal{A}_S coincides with \otimes_{p \in S} \mathcal{O}_p. This would lead to a complete classification of \mathcal{Q}_S, and is related to a conjecture about k-graphs.
