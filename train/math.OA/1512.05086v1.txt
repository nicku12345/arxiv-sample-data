The paper contains a description of a connection between diagonal actions and certain KMS weights on groupoid C^{*}-algebras. It furthermore contains the realization of a graph C^{*}-algebra of a countable graph as the groupoid C^{*}-algebra of a local homeomorphism and applies the theory obtained on these algebras.
