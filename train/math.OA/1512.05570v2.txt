We construct a weak conditional expectation from the section C*-algebra of a Fell bundle over a unital inverse semigroup to its unit fibre. We use this to define the reduced C*-algebra of the Fell bundle. We study when the reduced C*-algebra for an inverse semigroup action on a groupoid by partial equivalences coincides with the reduced groupoid C*-algebra of the transformation groupoid, giving both positive results and counterexamples.
