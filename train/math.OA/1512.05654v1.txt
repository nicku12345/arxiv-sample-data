Actions of locally compact groups and quantum groups on W*-ternary rings of operators are discussed and related crossed products introduced. The results generalise those for von Neumann algebraic actions with proofs based mostly on passing to the linking von Neumann algebra. They are motivated by the study of fixed point spaces for convolution operators generated by contractive, non-necessarily positive measures, both in the classical and in the quantum context.
