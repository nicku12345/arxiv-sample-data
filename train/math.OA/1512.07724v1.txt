Let A be a C^*-algebra and H a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra with its dual C^*-Hopf algebra H^0. Let (\rho, u) be a twisted coaction of H^0 on A. We shall define the (\rho, u, H)-equivariant Picard group of A, which is denoted by \Pic_H^{\rho, u}(A), and discuss basic properties of \Pic_H^{\rho, u}(A). Also, we suppose that (\rho, u) is the coaction of H^0 on the unital C^*-algebra A, that is, u=1\otimes 1^0. We investigate the relation between \Pic(A^s ), the ordinary Picard group of A^s and \Pic_H^{\rho^s}(A^s ) where A^s is the stable C^*-algebra of A and \rho^s is the coaction of H^0 on A^s induced by \rho. Furthermore, we shall show that \Pic_{H^0}^{\widehat{\rho}}(A\rtimes_{\rho, u}H) is isomorphic to \Pic_H^{\rho, u}(A), where \widehat{\rho} is the dual coaction of H on the twisted crossed product A\rtimes_{\rho, u}H of A by the twisted coaction (\rho, u) of H^0 on A.
