Let V be an operator space and \iso(V) be the group of all completely isometric bijective linear mappings on V. Let G act on V via a strongly continuous group homomorphism \alpha:G \to \iso (V). We define the full (and reduced) operator space crossed product V\rtimes^{\op}_{\alpha,(r)}G and show that for a C^*-algebra with its canonical operator space structure, it coincides with the corresponding C^*-algebra crossed product.   Unfortunately, the proof of Theorem 4.3 of the paper contains a serious gap, which leads to the withdrawal of the paper.
