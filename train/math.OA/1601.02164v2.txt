Two new notions of equivalence for representations of a Toeplitz algebra \mathcal{E}_n, n<\infty, on a common Hilbert space are defined. Our main results apply to C^*-dynamics and the conjugacy of certain *-endomorphisms. One particular case of the relations is shown to coincide with the multiplicity of a representation. Previously known results due to Laca and Enomoto-Watatani are recovered as special cases.
