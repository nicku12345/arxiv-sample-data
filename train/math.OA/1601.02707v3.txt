We prove that noncommutative solenoids are limits, in the sense of the Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity, of quantum tori. From this observation, we prove that noncommutative solenoids can be approximated by finite dimensional quantum compact metric spaces, and that they form a continuous family of quantum compact metric spaces over the space of multipliers of the solenoid, properly metrized.
