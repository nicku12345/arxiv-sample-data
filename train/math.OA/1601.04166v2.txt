We describe how Lie groupoids are used in singular analysis, index theory and non-commutative geometry and give a brief overview of the theory. We also expose groupoid proofs of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and discuss the Baum-Connes conjecture for Lie groupoids. With the help of the general framework of Lie groupoids and related structures we survey recent progress on problems which were outside the scope of the original work of Atiyah and Singer. This includes the Atiyah-Singer type index problem for many classes of non-compact manifolds (e.g. manifolds with a Lie structure at infinity). We also consider generalizations of the pseudodifferential calculus on Lie groupoids, e.g. for boundary value problems.
