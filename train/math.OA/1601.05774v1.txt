In this work, we investigate the existence of a factorization for a unital completely positive map, between non-commutative probability space which do not change the expectation values of the events. These maps are called in literature stochastic maps. Using the Stinespring representations of completely positive map and assuming the existence of anti-unitary operator on Hilbert space related to these representations which satisfying some modular relations, we prove that stochastic maps with adjoint, admits a factorization.
