We prove that a tracially continuous W^*-bundle \mathcal{M} over a compact Hausdorff space X with all fibres isomorphic to the hyperfinite II_1-factor \mathcal{R} that is locally trivial already has to be globally trivial. The proof uses the contractibility of the automorphism group \mathrm{Aut}({\mathcal{R}}) shown by Popa and Takesaki. There is no restriction on the covering dimension of X.
