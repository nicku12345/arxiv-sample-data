For a C*-algebra A we consider the problem of when the set TM_0(A) of all two-sided multiplications x \mapsto axb (a,b \in A) on A is norm closed, as a subset of B(A). We first show that TM_0(A) is norm closed for all prime C*-algebras A. On the other hand, if A\cong \Gamma_0(E ) is an n-homogeneous C*-algebra, where E is the canonical \mathbb{M}_n -bundle over the primitive spectrum X of A, we show that TM_0(A) fails to be norm closed if and only if there exists a \sigma-compact open subset U of X and a phantom complex line subbundle L of E over U (i.e. L is not globally trivial, but is trivial on all compact subsets of U). This phenomenon occurs whenever n \geq 2 and X is a CW-complex (or a topological manifold) of dimension 3 \leq d<\infty.
