We give a notion of branching systems on ultragraphs. From this we build concrete representations of ultragraph C*-algebras on the bounded linear operators of Hilbert spaces. To each branching system of an ultragraph we describe the associated Perron-Frobenius operator in terms of the induced representation. We show that every permutative representation of an ultragraph C*-algebra is unitary equivalent to a representation arising from a branching system. We give a sufficient condition on ultragraphs such that a large class of representations of the C*-algebras of these ultragraphs is permutative. To give a sufficient condition on branching systems so that their induced representations are faithful we generalize Szyma{\'n}ski's version of the Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem for ultragraph C*-algebras.
