Given two correspondences X and Y and a discrete group G which acts on X and coacts on Y, one can define a twisted tensor product X\boxtimes Y which simultaneously generalizes ordinary tensor products and crossed products by group actions and coactions. We show that, under suitable conditions, the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of this product, \mathcal O_{X\boxtimes Y}, is isomorphic to a "balanced" twisted tensor product \mathcal O_X\boxtimes_\mathbb T\mathcal O_Y of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebras of the original correspondences. We interpret this result in several contexts and connect it to existing results on Cuntz-Pimsner algebras of crossed products and tensor products.
