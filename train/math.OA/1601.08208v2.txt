It is shown that, for nested fractals [T.Lindstrom, Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 420, 1990], the main structural data, such as the Hausdorff dimension and measure, the geodesic distance (when it exists) induced by the immersion in R^n, and the self-similar energy can all be recovered by the description of the fractals in terms of the spectral triples considered in [D.Guido, T.Isola, in "Advances in Operator Algebras and Mathematical Physics", Theta Series in Advanced Mathematics, Bucharest 2005].
