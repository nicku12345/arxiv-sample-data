This is a continuation of the study of strongly self-absorbing actions of locally compact groups on C*-algebras. Given a strongly self-absorbing action \gamma: G\curvearrowright\mathcal{D}, we establish permanence properties for the class of separable C*-dynamical systems absorbing \gamma tensorially up to cocycle conjugacy. Generalizing results of both Toms-Winter and Dadarlat-Winter, it is proved that the desirable equivariant analogues of the classical permanence properties hold in this context. For the permanence with regard to equivariant extensions, we need to require a mild extra condition on \gamma, which replaces K_1-injectivity assumptions in the classical theory. This condition turns out to be automatic for equivariantly Jiang-Su absorbing C*-dynamical systems, yielding a large class of examples. It is left open whether this condition is redundant for all strongly self-absorbing actions, and we do consider examples that satisfy this condition but are not equivariantly Jiang-Su absorbing.
