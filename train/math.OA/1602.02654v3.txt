Recently C. Houdayer and Y. Isono have proved among other things that every biexact group \Gamma has the property that for any non-singular strongly ergodic action \Gamma\curvearrowright (X,\mu) on a standard measure space the group measure space von Neumann algebra \Gamma\ltimes L^\infty(X) is full. In this note, we prove the same property for a wider class of groups, notably including \mathrm{SL}(3,{\mathbb Z}). We also prove that for any connected simple Lie group G with finite center, any lattice \Gamma\le G, and any closed non-amenable subgroup H\le G, the non-singular action \Gamma\curvearrowright G/H is strongly ergodic and the von Neumann factor \Gamma\ltimes L^\infty(G/H) is full.
