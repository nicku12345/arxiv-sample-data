Using an analogy with the rank theorem in differential geometry, it is shown that for a finite n-tuple X in a tracial von Neumann algebra and any finite m-tuple F of *-polynomials in n noncommuting indeterminates, \begin{eqnarray*} \delta_0(X) & \leq & \text{Nullity}(D^sF(X)) + \delta_0(F(X):X) \end{eqnarray*} where \delta_0 is the (modified) microstates free entropy dimension and D^sF(X) is a kind of derivative of F evaluated at X. When F(X) =0 and |D^sF(X)| has nonzero Fuglede-Kadison-L\"uck determinant, then X is \alpha-bounded in the sense of \cite{j3} where \alpha = \text{Nullity}(D^sF(X)). Using Linnell's L^2 integral domain results in \cite{l} as well as Elek and Szab\'o's work on L\"uck's determinant conjecture for sofic groups in \cite{es} the following result is proven. Suppose \Gamma is a sofic, left-orderable, discrete group with 2 generators and \Gamma \neq \{0\}. The following conditions are equivalent:   (1) \Gamma \not\simeq \mathbb F_2.   (2) L(\Gamma) \not\simeq L(\mathbb F_2).   (3) L(\Gamma) is strongly 1-bounded.   (4) \delta_0(X) = 1 for any finite set of generators X for L(\Gamma).   From Brodski\u{i} and Howie's results on local indicability (\cite{b}, \cite{h}), it follows that a sofic, torsion-free, one-relator group von Neumann algebra on two generators with nontrivial relator is strongly 1-bounded. It also follows from the residual solvability of the positive one relator groups (\cite{baum}) that a one-relator group von Neumann algebra on two generators whose relator is a nontrivial, positive, non-proper word in the generators is strongly 1-bounded.
