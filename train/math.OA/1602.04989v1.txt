Quantum analogs of Stiefel manifolds SU_{q}(n)/SU_q(n-m) were introduced by Podkolzin \& Vainerman. The underlying C^*-algebra C(SU_{q}(n)/SU_q(n-m)) can be described as the C^*-subalgebra of C(SU_q(n)) generated by elements of last m rows of the fundamental matrix of SU_q(n). Using R-matrix of type A_{n-1}, one can find certain relations involving elements of last m rows only. In this paper, by analyzing these relations and using a result of Neshveyev \& Tuset, we establish C(SU_{q}(n)/SU_q(n-m)) as a universal C^*-algbera given by finite sets of generators and relations.
