We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for embeddability of an operator system into \mathcal{O}_2. Using Kirchberg's theorems on a tensor product of \mathcal{O}_2 and \mathcal{O}_{\infty}, we establish results on their operator system counterparts \mathcal{S}_2 and \mathcal{S}_{\infty}. Applications of the results proved, including some examples describing C^*-envelopes of operator systems, are also discussed.
