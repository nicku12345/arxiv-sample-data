This is a survey of recent progress in the structure and classification theory of nuclear C*-algebras. In particular, I outline how the Universal Coefficient Theorem ensures a positive answer to the quasidiagonality question in the presence of faithful traces. This has strong consequences for the regularity conjecture and the classification problem for separable, simple, nuclear C*-algebras. Moreover, it entails a positive solution to Rosenberg's conjecture on quasidiagonality of reduced C*-algebras of discrete amenable groups. This note is largely based on a joint paper with Aaron Tikuisis and Stuart White.
