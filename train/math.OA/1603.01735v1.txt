In 2008, Blecher and Labuschagne extended Beurling's classical theorem to H^\infty-invariant subspaces of L^p(\mathcal{M},\tau) for a finite von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M} with a finite, faithful, normal tracial state \tau when 1\le p\le \infty. In this paper, using Arveson's non-commutative Hardy space H^\infty in relation to a von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M} with a semifinite, faithful, normal tracial weight \tau, we prove a Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne theorem for H^\infty-invariant spaces of L^p(\mathcal{M},\tau) when 0<p\leq\infty. The proof of the main result relies on proofs of density theorems for L^p(\mathcal{M},\tau) and semifinite versions of several other known theorems from the finite case. Using the main result, we are able to completely characterize all H^\infty-invariant subspaces of L^p(\mathcal M\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb Z,\tau), where \mathcal M\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb Z  is a crossed product of a semifinite von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M} by the integer group \mathbb Z and H^\infty is a non-selfadjoint crossed product of \mathcal{M} by \mathbb Z^+. As an example, we characterize all H^\infty-invariant subspaces of the Schatten p-class S^p(\mathcal{H}), where H^\infty is the lower triangular subalgebra of B(\mathcal H), for each 0<p\leq\infty.
