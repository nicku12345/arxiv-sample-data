Let A and B be arbitrary C^*-algebras, we prove that the existence of a Hilbert A-B-bimodule of finite index ensures that the WEP, QWEP, and LLP along with other finite-dimensional approximation properties such as CBAP and (S)OAP are shared by A and B. For this, we first study the stability of the WEP, QWEP and LLP under Morita equivalence of C^*-algebras.   We present examples of Hilbert A-B-bimodules which are not of finite index, while such properties are shared between A and B. To this end, we study twisted crossed products by amenable discrete groups.
