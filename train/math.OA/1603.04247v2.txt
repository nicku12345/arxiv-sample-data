We extend some classical results of Cowling and Meda to the noncommutative setting. Let (T_t)_{t>0} be a symmetric contraction semigroup on a noncommutative space L_p(\mathcal{M}), and let the functions \phi and \psi be regularly related. We prove that the semigroup (T_t)_{t>0} is \phi-ultracontractive, i.e. \|T_t x\|_\infty \leq C \phi(t)^{-1} \|x\|_1 for all x\in L_1(\mathcal{M}) and  t>0 if and only if its infinitesimal generator L has the Sobolev embedding properties: \|\psi(L)^{-\alpha} x\|_q \leq C'\|x\|_p for all x\in L_p(\mathcal{M}), where 1<p<q<\infty and \alpha =\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{q}. We establish some noncommutative spectral multiplier theorems and maximal function estimates for generator of \phi-ultracontractive semigroup. We also show the equivalence between \phi-ultracontractivity and logarithmic Sobolev inequality for some special \phi. Finally, we gives some results on local ultracontractivity.
