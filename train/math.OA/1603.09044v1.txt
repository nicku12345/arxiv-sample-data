It was shown recently by Conti, R{\o}rdam and Szyma\'{n}ski that there exist endomorphisms \lambda_u of the Cuntz algebra \mathcal{O}_n such that \lambda_u (\mathcal{F}_n)\subseteq\mathcal{F}_n but u\not\in\mathcal{F}_n, and a question was raised if for such a u there must always exist a unitary v\in\mathcal{F}_n with \lambda_u|_{\mathcal{F}_n} = \lambda_v|_{\mathcal{F}_n}. In the present paper, we answer this question to the negative. To this end, we analyze the structure of such endomorphisms \lambda_u for which the relative commutant \lambda_u(\mathcal{F}_n)'\cap\mathcal{F}_n is finite dimensional.
