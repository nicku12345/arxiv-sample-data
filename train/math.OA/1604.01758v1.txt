For minimal unique ergodic diffeomorphisms \alpha_n of S^{2n+1} (n>0) and \alpha_m of S^{2m+1}(m>0), the C^*-crossed product algebra C(S^{2n+1})\rtimes_{\alpha_n} \mathbb{Z} is isomorphic to C(S^{2m+1})\rtimes_{\alpha_m} \mathbb{Z} even though n\neq m . However, by cyclic cohomology, we show that smooth crossed product algebra C^\infty(S^{2n+1})\rtimes_{\alpha_n} \mathbb{Z} is not isomorphic to C^\infty(S^{2m+1})\rtimes_{\alpha_m} \mathbb{Z} if n\neq m.
