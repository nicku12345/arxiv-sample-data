For a C_0(X)-algebra A, we study C(K)-algebras B that we regard as compactifications of A, generalising the notion of (the algebra of continuous functions on) a compactification of a completely regular space. We show that A admits a Stone-\v{C}ech-type compactification A^{\beta}, a C(\beta X)-algebra with the property that every bounded continuous section of the C^*-bundle associated with A has a unique extension to a continuous section of the bundle associated with A^{\beta}. Moreover, A^{\beta} satisfies a maximality property amongst compactifications of A (with respect to appropriately chosen morphisms) analogous to that of \beta X. We investigate the structure of the space of points of \beta X for which the fibre algebras of A^{\beta} are non-zero, and partially characterise those C_0(X)-algebras A for which this space is precisely \beta X.
