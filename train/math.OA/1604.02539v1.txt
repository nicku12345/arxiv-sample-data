We describe (infinite-dimensional) irreducible representations of the crossed product C^*-algebra associated with a topological dynamical system (based on Z) and we show that their restrictions to the underling \ell^1-Banach *-algebra are not algebraically irreducible under mild conditions on the dynamical system. The above description of irreducible representations has two ingredients, ergodic measures on the space and ergodic extensions for the tensor product with type I factors; the latter which may not have been explicitly taken up before will be explored by examples. A new class of ergodic measures is also constructed for irrational rotations on the circle.
