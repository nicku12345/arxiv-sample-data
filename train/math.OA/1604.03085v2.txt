We show that a C^*-algebra \mathfrak{A} which is stably isomorphic to a unital graph C^*-algebra, is isomorphic to a graph C^*-algebra if and only if it admits an approximate unit of projections. As a consequence, a hereditary C^*-subalgebra of a unital real rank zero graph C^*-algebra is isomorphic to a graph C^*-algebra. Furthermore, if a C^*-algebra \mathfrak{A} admits an approximate unit of projections, then its minimal unitization is isomorphic to a graph C^*-algebra if and only if \mathfrak{A} is stably isomorphic to a unital graph C^*-algebra.
