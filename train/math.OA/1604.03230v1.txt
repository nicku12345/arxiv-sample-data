We study uniform perturbations of crossed product C^*-algebras by amenable groups. Given a unital inclusion of C^*-algebras C\subseteq D and sufficiently close separable intermediate C^*-subalgebras A, B for this inclusion with a conditional expectation from D onto B, if A=C\rtimes G with G discrete amenable, then A and B are isomorphic. Furthermore, if C\subseteq D is irreducible, then A=B.
