Suppose M is a von Neumann algebra equipped with a faithful normal state \varphi and generated by a finite set G=G^*, |G|\geq 2. We show that if G consists of eigenvectors of the modular operator \Delta_\varphi with finite free Fisher information, then the centralizer M^\varphi is a \mathrm{II}_1 factor and M is either a type \mathrm{II}_1 factor or a type \mathrm{III}_\lambda factor, 0<\lambda\leq 1, depending on the eigenvalues of G. Furthermore, (M^\varphi)'\cap M=\mathbb{C}, M^\varphi does not have property \Gamma, and M is full provided it is type \mathrm{III}_\lambda, 0<\lambda<1.
