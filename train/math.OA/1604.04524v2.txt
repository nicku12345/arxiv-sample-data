Given n\geq 2, z_{ij}\in\mathbb{T} such that z_{ij}=\overline z_{ji} for 1\leq i,j\leq n and z_{ii}=1 for 1\leq i\leq n, and integers p_1,...,p_n\geq 1, we show that the universal \mathrm{C}^*-algebra generated by unitaries u_1,...,u_n such that u_i^{p_i}u_j^{p_j}=z_{ij}u_j^{p_j}u_i^{p_i} for 1\leq i,j \leq n is not simple if at least one exponent p_i is at least two. We indicate how the method of proof by `working with various quotients' can be used to establish nonsimplicity of universal \mathrm{C}^*-algebras in other cases.
