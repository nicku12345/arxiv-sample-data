We show that a number of key structural properties transfer between sufficiently close II_1 factors, including solidity, strong solidity, uniqueness of Cartan masas and property \Gamma. We also examine II_1 factors close to tensor product factors, showing that such factors also factorise as a tensor product in a fashion close to the original.
