For a large class of finite graphs E, we show that whenever \alpha is a vertex-fixing quasi-free automorphism of the corresponding graph C^*-algebra C^*(E) such that \alpha({\mathcal D}_E) \neq{\mathcal D}_E, where {\mathcal D}_E is the canonical MASA in C^*(E), then \alpha({\mathcal D}_E)\neq w{\mathcal D}_E w^* for all unitaries w\in C^*(E). That is, the two MASAs {\mathcal D}_E and \alpha({\mathcal D}_E) of C^*(E) are outer but not inner conjugate. Passing to an isomorphic C^*-algebra by changing the underlying graph makes this result applicable to certain non quasi-free automorphisms as well.
