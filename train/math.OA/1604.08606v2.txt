We show that if \Gamma is an infinite finitely generated finitely presented sofic group with zero first L^{2} Betti number then the von Neumann algebra L(\Gamma) is strongly 1-bounded in the sense of Jung. In particular, L(\Gamma)\not\cong L(\Lambda) if \Lambda is any group with free entropy dimension >1, for example a free group. The key technical result is a short proof of an estimate of Jung using non-microstates entropy techniques.
