Examples of noncommutative self-coverings are described, and spectral triples on the base space are extended to spectral triples on the inductive family of coverings, in such a way that the covering projections are locally isometric. Such triples are shown to converge, in a suitable sense, to a semifinite spectral triple on the direct limit of the tower of coverings, which we call noncommutative solenoidal space. Some of the self-coverings described here are given by the inclusion of the fixed point algebra in a C^*-algebra acted upon by a finite abelian group. In all the examples treated here, the noncommutative solenoidal spaces have the same metric dimension and volume as on the base space, but are not quantum compact metric spaces, namely the pseudo-metric induced by the spectral triple does not produce the weak^* topology on the state space.
