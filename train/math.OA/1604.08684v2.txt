This paper is a continuation of our work on D. Voiculescu's topological free entropy dimension in unital C*-algebras. In this paper we first prove the topological free entropy dimension of a MF-nuclear and inner QD algebra is irrelevant to its generating family. Then we give the relation between the topological orbit dimension K_{top}^2 and the modified free orbit dimension K_2^2 by using MF-traces. We also introduce a new invariant K_{top}^3 which is a modification of the topological orbit dimension K_{top}^2 when K_{top}^2 is defined. As the applications of K_{top}^3, We prove that K_{top}^3(A)=0 if A has property  c^*-{\Gamma} and has no finite-dimensional representations. We also give the definition of property MF-c^*-{\Gamma}. We then conclude that, for the unital MF  C^*-algebra with no finite-dimensional representations, if A has property MF-c*-{\Gamma}, then K_{top}^3(A)=0.
