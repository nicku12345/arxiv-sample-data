We characterize when there exists a diagonal preserving *-isomorphism between two graph C^*-algebras in terms of the dynamics of the boundary path spaces. In particular, we refine the notion of "orbit equivalence" between the boundary path spaces of the directed graphs E and F and show that this is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a diagonal preserving *-isomorphism between the graph C^*-algebras C^*(E) and C^*(F).
