Taking a groupoid C*-algebra approach to the study of the quantum complex projective spaces \mathbb{P}^{n}\left( \mathcal{T}\right)  constructed from the multipullback quantum spheres introduced by Hajac and collaborators, we analyze the structure of the C*-algebra C\left( \mathbb{P}^{1}\left( \mathcal{T}\right) \right)  realized as a concrete groupoid C*-algebra, and find its K-groups. Furthermore after a complete classification of the unitary equivalence classes of projections or equivalently the isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective modules over the C*-algebra C\left( \mathbb{P}^{1}\left( \mathcal{T}\right) \right) , we identify those quantum principal U\left( 1\right) -bundles introduced by Hajac and collaborators among the projections classified.
