We study analogues of classical Hilbert transforms as fourier multipliers on free groups. We prove their complete boundedness on non commutative L^p spaces associated with the free group von Neumann algebras for all 1<p<\infty. This implies that the decomposition of the free group \F_\infty into reduced words starting with distinct free generators is completely unconditional in L^p. We study the case of Voiculescu's amalgamated free products of von Neumann algebras as well. As by-products, we obtain a positive answer to a compactness-problem posed by Ozawa, a length independent estimate for Junge-Parcet-Xu's free Rosenthal inequality, a Littlewood-Paley-Stein type inequality for geodesic paths of free groups, and a length reduction formula for L^p-norms of free group von Neumann algebras.
