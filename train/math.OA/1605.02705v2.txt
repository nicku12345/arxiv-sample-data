By analogy with the classical construction due to Forrest, Samei and Spronk we associate to every compact quantum group \mathbb{G} a completely contractive Banach algebra A_\Delta(\mathbb{G}), which can be viewed as a deformed Fourier algebra of \mathbb{G}. To motivate the construction we first analyse in detail the quantum version of the integration over the diagonal subgroup, showing that although the quantum diagonal subgroups in fact never exist, as noted earlier by Kasprzak and So{\l}tan, the corresponding integration represented by a certain idempotent state on C(\mathbb{G}) makes sense as long as \mathbb{G} is of Kac type. Finally we analyse as an explicit example the algebras A_\Delta(O_N^+), N\ge 2, associated to Wang's free orthogonal groups, and show that they are not operator weakly amenable.
