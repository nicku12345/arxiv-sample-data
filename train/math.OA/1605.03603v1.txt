Given a topological graph E, we give a complete description of tracial states on the C*-algebra \mathrm{C}^*(E) which are invariant under the gauge action; there is an affine homeomorphism between the space of gauge invariant tracial states on \mathrm{C}^*(E) and Radon probability measures on the vertex space E^0 which are, in a suitable sense, invariant under the action of the edge space E^1. It is shown that if E has no cycles, then every tracial state on \mathrm{C}^*(E) is gauge invariant. When E^0 is totally disconnected, the gauge invariant tracial states on \mathrm{C}^*(E) are in bijection with the states on \mathrm{K}_0(\mathrm{C}^*(E)).
