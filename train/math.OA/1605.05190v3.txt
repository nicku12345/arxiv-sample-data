A classical result of Sherman says that if the space of self-adjoint elements in a C^*-algebra \mathcal{A} is a lattice with respect to its canonical order, then \mathcal{A} is commutative. We give a new proof of this theorem which shows that it is intrinsically connected with the spectral theory of positive operator semigroups. Our methods also show that some important Perron--Frobenius like spectral results fail to hold in any non-commutative C^*-algebra.
