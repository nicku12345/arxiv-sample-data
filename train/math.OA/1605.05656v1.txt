Let \Omega be a compact Hausdorff space and let A be a C^*-algebra. We prove that if every weak-2-local derivation on A is a linear derivation and every derivation on C(\Omega,A) is inner, then every weak-2-local derivation \Delta:C(\Omega,A)\to C(\Omega,A) is a {\rm(}linear{\rm)} derivation. As a consequence we derive that, for every complex Hilbert space H, every weak-2-local derivation \Delta : C(\Omega,B(H)) \to C(\Omega,B(H)) is a (linear) derivation. We actually show that the same conclusion remains true when B(H) is replaced with an atomic von Neumann algebra. With a modified technique we prove that, if B denotes a compact C^*-algebra (in particular, when B=K(H)), then every weak-2-local derivation on C(\Omega,B) is a (linear) derivation. Among the consequences, we show that for each von Neumann algebra M and every compact Hausdorff space \Omega, every 2-local derivation on C(\Omega,M) is a (linear) derivation.
