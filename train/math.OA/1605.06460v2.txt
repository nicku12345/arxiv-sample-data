Motivated by Exel's inverse semigroup approach to combinatorial C*-algebras, in a previous work the authors defined an inverse semigroup associated with a labelled space. We construct a representation of the C*-algebra of a labelled space, inspired by how one might cut or glue labelled paths together, that proves that non-zero elements in the inverse semigroup correspond to non-zero elements in the C*-algebra. We also show that the spectrum of its diagonal C*-subalgebra is homeomorphic to the tight spectrum of the inverse semigroup associated with the labelled space.
