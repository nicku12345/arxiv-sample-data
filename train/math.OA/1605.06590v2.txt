We present solutions to local connectivity problems in matrix representations of the form C([-1,1]^{N}) \to A_{n,\varepsilon} \leftarrow C_{\varepsilon}(\mathbb{T}^{2}) for any \varepsilon\in[0,2] and any integer n\geq 1, where A_{n,\varepsilon}\subseteq M_n and where C_{\varepsilon}(\mathbb{T}^{2}) denotes the {\bf Soft Torus}. We solve the connectivity problems by introducing the so called toroidal matrix links, which can be interpreted as normal contractive matrix analogies of free homotopies in differential algebraic topology.   In order to deal with the locality constraints, we have combined some techniques introduced in this document with some techniques from matrix geometry, combinatorial optimization, classification and representation theory of C^*-algebras.
