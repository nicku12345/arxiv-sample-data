We investigate the position of amenable subalgebras in arbitrary amalgamated free product von Neumann algebras M = M_1 \ast_B M_2. Our main result states that under natural analytic assumptions, any amenable subalgebra of M that has a large intersection with M_1 is actually contained in M_1. The proof does not rely on Popa's asymptotic orthogonality property but on the study of non normal conditional expectations.
