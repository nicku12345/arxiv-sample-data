Let G be a discrete group acting on a von Neumann algebra M by properly outer *-automorphisms. In this paper we study the containment M \subseteq M\rtimes_\alpha G of M inside the crossed product. We characterize the intermediate von Neumann algebras, extending earlier work of other authors in the factor case. We also determine the M-bimodules that are closed in the Bures topology and which coincide with the w^*-closed ones under a mild hypothesis on G. We use these results to obtain a general version of Mercer's theorem concerning the extension of certain isometric w^*-continuous maps on M-bimodules to *-automorphisms of the containing von Neumann algebras.
