The Gelfand - Na\u{i}mark theorem supplies the one to one correspondence between commutative C^*-algebras and locally compact Hausdorff spaces. So any noncommutative C^*-algebra can be regarded as a generalization of a topological space. Generalizations of several topological invariants can be defined by algebraical methods. This article contains a pure algebraical construction of (noncommutative) covering projections with finite cyclic groups of covering transformations.
