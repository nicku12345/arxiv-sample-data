We use free groups to settle a couple questions about the values of the Pimsner-Popa-Voiculescu modulus of quasidiagonality for a set of operators \Omega, denoted by qd(\Omega). Along the way we deduce information about the operator space structure of finite dimensional subspaces of \mathbb{C}[\mathbb{F}_d]\subseteq C^*_{\ell^p}(\mathbb{F}_d) where C^*_{\ell^p}(\mathbb{F}_d) is the so-called \ell^p-completion of \mathbb{C}[\mathbb{F}_d]. Roughly speaking, we use free groups and qd(\Omega) to put a quantitative face on the two known qualitative obstructions to quasidiagonality; absence of an amenable trace or the presence of a proper isometry. The modulus of quasidiagonality for a proper isometry is equal to 1. We show that qd(\{\lambda_a,\lambda_b\})\in [1/2,\sqrt{3}/2] where a and b are free group generators and \lambda is the left regular representation. In another direction, we use certain \ell^p representations of free groups constructed by Pytlik and Szwarc and a recent result of Ruan and Wiersma to show that qd(\Omega) may be positive, yet arbitrarily close to zero when \Omega is a set of unitaries.
