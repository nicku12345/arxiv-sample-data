Let \mathbb{G} be a free (unitary or orthogonal) quantum group. We prove that for any non-amenable subfactor N\subset L^\infty(\mathbb{G}), which is an image of a faithful normal conditional expectation, and for any \sigma-finite factor B, the tensor product N \otimes B has no Cartan subalgebras. This generalizes our previous work that provides the same result when B is finite. In the proof, we establish Ozawa--Popa and Popa--Vaes's weakly compact action on the continuous core of N \otimes B as the one relative to B, by using an operator valued weight to B and the central weak amenability of \mathbb{G}.
