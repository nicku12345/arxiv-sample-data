We define a C*-hull for a *-algebra, given a notion of integrability for its representations on Hilbert modules. We establish a local-global principle which, in many cases, characterises integrable representations on Hilbert modules through the integrable representations on Hilbert spaces. The induction theorem constructs a C*-hull for a certain class of integrable representations of a graded *-algebra, given a C*-hull for its unit fibre.
