We introduce completely semi-\varphi-maps on Hilbert C^*-modules as a generalization of \varphi-maps. This class of maps provides examples of CP-extendable maps which are not CP-H-extendable, in Skeide-Sumesh's sense. Using the CP-extendability of completely semi-\varphi-maps, we give a representation theorem, similar to Stinespring's representation theorem, for this class of maps which can be considered as strengthened and generalized form of Asadi's and Bhat-Ramesh-Sumesh's analogues of Stinespring representation theorem for \varphi-maps.   We also define an order relation on the set of all completely semi-\varphi-maps and establish a Radon-Nikodym type theorem for this class of maps in terms of their representations.
