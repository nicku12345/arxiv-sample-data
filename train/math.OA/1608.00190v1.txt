In this paper, we show that every completely semi-\phi-map on a submodule of a Hilbert C^*-module has a completely semi-\phi-map extension on the whole of module. We also investigate the extendability of \phi-maps and provide examples of \phi-maps which has no \phi-map extension. Finally, we introduce a category of Hilbert C^*-module and determine injective objects in this category.
