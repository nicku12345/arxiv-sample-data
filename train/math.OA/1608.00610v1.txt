We introduce a cohomology theory for spatial super- product systems and compute the 2-cocycles for some basic examples called as Clifford super-product systems, thereby distinguish them up to isomorphism. This consequently proves that a family of E_0-semigroups on type III factors, which we call as CAR flows, are non-cocycle-conjugate for different ranks. Similar results follows for the even CAR flows as well. We also compute the automorphsim group of the Clifford super-product systems.
