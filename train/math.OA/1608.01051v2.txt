We study Rokhlin dimension of Z^m-actions on simple separable stably finite nuclear C*-algebras. We prove that under suitable assumptions, a strongly outer Z^m-action has finite Rokhlin dimension. This extends the known result for automorphisms. As an application, we show that for a large class of C*-algebras, the Z^m-Bernoulli action on the infinite tensor product has finite Rokhlin dimension.
