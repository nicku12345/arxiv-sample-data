The C^{\ast}-algebra \mathcal{U}_{nc}(n) is the universal C^{\ast}-algebra generated by n^2 generators u_{ij} that make up a unitary matrix. We prove that Kirchberg's formulation of Connes' embedding problem has a positive answer if and only if \mathcal{U}_{nc}(2) \otimes_{\min} \mathcal{U}_{nc}(2)=\mathcal{U}_{nc}(2) \otimes_{\max} \mathcal{U}_{nc}(2). Our results follow from properties of the finite-dimensional operator system \mathcal{V}_n spanned by 1 and the generators of \mathcal{U}_{nc}(n). We show that \mathcal{V}_n is an operator system quotient of M_{2n} and has the OSLLP. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on \mathcal{V}_n for there to be a positive answer to Kirchberg's problem. Finally, in analogy with recent results of Ozawa, we show that a form of Tsirelson's problem related to \mathcal{V}_n is equivalent to Connes' Embedding problem.
