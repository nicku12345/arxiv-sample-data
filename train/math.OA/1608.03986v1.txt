Let A=\underrightarrow{\lim}{A_n} be an AF algebra, G be a compact group. We consider inductive limit actions of the form \alpha=\underrightarrow{\lim}{\alpha_n}, where \alpha_n\colon G\curvearrowright A_n is an action on the finite dimensional C*-algebra A_n which fixes each matrix summand. If each \alpha_n is inner, such actions are classified by equivariant K-theory by Handelman and Rossmann. However, if the actions \alpha_n are not inner, we show that such actions are not classifiable by equivariant K-theory. We give a complete classification of such actions using twisted equivariant K-theory.
