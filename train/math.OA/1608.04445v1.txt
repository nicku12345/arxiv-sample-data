We prove that every bounded self-adjoint operator in Hilbert space is a real linear combination of 4 orthoprojections. Also we show that operators of the form identity minus compact positive operator can not be decomposed in a real linear combination of 3 orthoprojections. Using ideas applied in infinite dimensional space, we find n\times n matrices that are not real linear combinations of 3 orthoprojections for every n\ge 76.
