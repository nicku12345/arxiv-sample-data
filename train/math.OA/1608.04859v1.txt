In this paper, we will introduce a notion of basis related Morita equivalence in the Cuntz--Krieger algebras ({{\mathcal{O}}_A}, \{S_a\}_{a \in E_A}) with the canonical right finite basis \{S_a\}_{a \in E_A} as Hilbert C^*-bimodule, and prove that two nonnegative irreducible matrices A and B are elementary equivalent, that is, A = CD, B = DC for some nonnegative rectangular matrices C, D, if and only if the Cuntz--Krieger algebras ({{\mathcal{O}}_A}, \{S_a\}_{a \in E_A}) and ({{\mathcal{O}}_B}, \{ S_b\}_{b\in E_B}) with the canonical right finite bases are basis relatedly elementary Morita equivalent.
