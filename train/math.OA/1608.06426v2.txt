Let M be a \rm II_1 factor and let \mathcal{F}(M) denote the fundamental group of M. In this article, we study the following property of M: for arbitrary \rm II_1 factor B, we have \mathcal{F}(M \overline{\otimes} B)=\mathcal{F}(M)\mathcal{F}(B). We prove that for any subgroup G\leq \mathbb{R}^*_+ which is realized as a fundamental group of a \rm II_1 factor, there exists a \rm II_1 factor M which satisfies this property and whose fundamental group is G. Using this, we deduce that if G,H \leq \mathbb{R}^*_+ are realized as fundamental groups of \rm II_1 factors (with separable predual), then so are groups G \cdot H and G \cap H.
