In this paper we apply algebraic K-theory techniques to construct a Fuglede-Kadison type determinant for a semi-finite von Neumann algebra equipped with a fixed trace. Our construction is based on the approach to determinants for Banach algebras developed by Skandalis and de la Harpe. This approach can be extended to the semi-finite case since the first topological K-group of the trace ideal in a semi-finite von Neumann algebra is trivial. On our way we also improve the methods of Skandalis and de la Harpe by considering relative K-groups with respect to an ideal instead of the usual absolute K-groups. Our construction recovers the determinant homomorphism introduced by Brown, but all the relevant algebraic properties are automatic due to the algebraic K-theory framework.
