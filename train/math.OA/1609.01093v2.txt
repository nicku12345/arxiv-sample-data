We study nuclearity and exactness for module maps on C^{*}-algebras which are C^*-module over another C^*-algebra with compatible actions and study finite dimensional approximation properties of such C^*-modules. We prove module versions of the results of Kirchberg and Choi-Effros. As a concrete example we extend the finite dimensional approximation properties of reduced C^*-algebras and von Neumann algebras on discrete groups to these operator algebras on inverse semigroups with the module structure coming from the action of the C^*-algebras on the subsemigroup of idempotents.
