This paper studies injective envelopes of groupoid dynamical systems and the corresponding boundaries. Analogue to the group case, we associate a bundle of compact Hausdorff spaces to any (discrete) groupoid (the Hamana boundary of the groupoid). We study bundles of compact topological spaces equipped with an action of a groupoid. We show that any groupoid has a minimal boundary (the Furstenberg boundary of the groupoid). We prove that the Hamana and Furstenberg boundaries are the same, for (discrete) groupoids. We find the relation between the reduced crossed product of the \G-injective envelop of a groupoid dynamical system and the injective envelope of the reduced crossed product of the original system.
