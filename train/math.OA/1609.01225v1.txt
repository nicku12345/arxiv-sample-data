Let A be a unital C^*-algebra and let \sigma be a one-parameter automorphism group of A. We consider \operatorname{QSS}_\sigma(A), the set of all quantum symmetric states on *_1^\infty A that are also KMS states (for a fixed inverse temperature, for specificity taken to be -1) for the free product automorphism group *_1^\infty\sigma. We characterize the elements of \operatorname{QSS}_\sigma(A), we show that \operatorname{QSS}_\sigma(A) is a Choquet simplex whenever it is nonempty and we characterize its extreme points.
