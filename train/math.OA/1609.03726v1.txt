Motivated by the notion of a set of uniqueness in a locally compact group G, we introduce and study ideals of uniqueness in the Fourier algebra A(G) of G, and their accompanying operator version, masa-bimodules of uniqueness. We establish a transference between the two notions, and use this result to show that the property of being an ideal of uniqueness is preserved under natural operations.
