Let A and B be C^*-algebras. A linear map T:A\to B is said to be a ^*-homomorphism at an element z\in A if a b^*=z in A implies T (a b^*) =T (a) T (b)^* =T(z), and  c^* d=z in A gives T (c^* d) =T (c)^* T (d) =T(z). Assuming that A is unital, we prove that every linear map T: A\to B which is a ^*-homomorphism at the unit of A is a Jordan ^*-homomorphism. If A is simple and infinite, then we establish that a linear map T: A\to B is a ^*-homomorphism if and only if T is a ^*-homomorphism at the unit of A. For a general unital C^*-algebra A and a linear map T:A\to B, we prove that T is a ^*-homomorphism if, and only if, T is a ^*-homomorphism at 0 and at 1. Actually if p is a non-zero projection in A, and T is a ^*-homomorphism at p and at 1-p, then we prove that T is a Jordan ^*-homomorphism. We also study bounded linear maps that are ^*-homomorphisms at a unitary element in A.
