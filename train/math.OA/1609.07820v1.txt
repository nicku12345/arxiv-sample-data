In this paper, we introduce the notion of conditionally bi-free independence in an amalgamated setting. We define operator-valued conditionally bi-multiplicative pairs of functions and construct operator-valued conditionally bi-free moment and cumulant functions. It is demonstrated that conditionally bi-free independence with amalgamation is equivalent to the vanishing of mixed operator-valued bi-free and conditionally bi-free cumulants. Furthermore, an operator-valued conditionally bi-free partial \mathcal{R}-transform is constructed and various operator-valued conditionally bi-free limit theorems are studied.
