In this article, we give explicit examples of maximal amenable subalgebras of the q-Gaussian algebras, namely, the generator subalgebra is maximal amenable inside the q-Gaussian algebras for real numbers q with its absolute value sufficiently small. To achieve this, we construct a Riesz basis in the spirit of R\u{a}dulescu and develop a structural theorem for the q-Gaussian algebras.
