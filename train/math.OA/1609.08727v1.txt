In this paper, we generalize the results of Laca, Larsen, and Neshveyev on the \mathrm{GL}_2-Connes-Marcolli system to the \mathrm{GL}_n systems. We introduce the \mathrm{GL}_n-Connes-Marcolli systems and discuss the question of the existence and the classification of KMS equilibrium states at different inverse temperatures \beta. In particular, using an ergodicity argument, we prove that in the range n-1 <\beta\leq n, there is only one KMS state. We show that there are no KMS states for \beta<n-1 and not an integer, while we construct KMS states for integer values of \beta in the range 1\leq\beta\leq n-1, and we classify extremal KMS states for \beta>n.
