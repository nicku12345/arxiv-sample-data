For any reduced amalgamated free product \mathrm{C}^*-algebra (A,E)=(A_1, E_1) \ast_D (A_2,E_2), we introduce and study a canonical ambient \mathrm{C}^*-algebra \Delta\mathbf{T}(A,E) of A which generalizes the crossed product arising from the canonical action of an amalgamated free product group on the compactification of the associated Bass--Serre tree. Using an explicit identification of \Delta \mathbf{T}(A,E) with a Cuntz--Pimsner algebra we prove two kinds of "amenability" results for \Delta \mathbf{T}(A,E); nuclearity and universality. As applications of our framework, we provide new conceptual, and simpler proofs of several known theorems on approximation properties, embeddability, and KK-theory for reduced amalgamated free product \mathrm{C}^*-algebras.
