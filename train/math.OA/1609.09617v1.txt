In this paper, we give examples of maximal amenable subalgebras of the free group factor of two generators. More precisely, we consider two copies of the hyperfinite factor R_i of type \mathrm{II}_1. From each R_i, we take a Haar unitary u_i which generates a Cartan subalgebra of it. We show that the von Neumann subalgebra generated by the self-adjoint operator u_1+u_1^{-1}+u_2+u_2^{-1} is maximal amenable in the free product. This provides infinitely many non-unitary conjugate maximal amenable MASAs.
