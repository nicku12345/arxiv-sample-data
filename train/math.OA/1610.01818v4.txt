For an arbitrary state \omega on a Cuntz algebra, we define a number 1\leq \kappa(\omega)\leq \infty such that if the GNS representations of \omega and \omega' are unitarily equivalent, then \kappa(\omega)=\kappa(\omega'). By using \kappa, we define minimal states and it is shown that the classification problem of states is reduced to that of minimal states. By using results of Dutkay, Haussermann, and Jorgensen, we give a sufficient condition of the minimality of a state. Properties of \kappa and examples are shown. As an application, a new invariant of a certain class of endomorphisms of {\cal B}({\cal H}) is given.
