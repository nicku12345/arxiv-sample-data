We show an equivariant Kirchberg-Phillips-type absorption theorem for pointwise outer actions of discrete amenable groups on Kirchberg algebras with respect to natural model actions on the Cuntz algebras \mathcal{O}_\infty and \mathcal{O}_2. This generalizes results known for finite groups and poly-\mathbb{Z} groups. The model actions are shown to be determined, up to strong cocycle conjugacy, by natural abstract properties, which are verified for some examples of actions arising from tensorial shifts. We also show the following homotopy rigidity result, which may be understood as a precursor to a general Kirchberg-Phillips-type classification theory: If two outer actions of an amenable group on a unital Kirchberg algebra are equivariantly homotopy equivalent, then they are conjugate. This marks the first C*-dynamical classification result up to cocycle conjugacy that is applicable to actions of all amenable groups.
