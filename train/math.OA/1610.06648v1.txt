We study the equilibrium or KMS states of the Toeplitz C*-algebra of a finite higher-rank graph which is reducible. The Toeplitz algebra carries a gauge action of a higher-dimensional torus, and a dynamics arises by choosing an embedding of the real numbers in the torus. Here we use an embedding which leads to a dynamics which has previously been identified as "preferred", and we scale the dynamics so that 1 is a critical inverse temperature. As with 1-graphs, we study the strongly connected components of the vertices of the graph. The behaviour of the KMS states depends on both the graphical relationships between the components and the relative size of the spectral radii of the vertex matrices of the components.   We test our theorems on graphs with two connected components. We find that our techniques give a complete analysis of the KMS states with inverse temperatures down to a second critical temperature beta_c<1.
