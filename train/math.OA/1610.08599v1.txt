We study the order theoretic properties of relative weak injectivity, w.r.i., in short, in the category of C*-algebras. We prove that Arveson's extension theorem, with additional order assumption on the morphisms, is tightly connected with relative weak injectivity. We prove that (2,3)-Riesz-Arveson property, defined below, is equivalent to w.r.i. Likewise tight Riesz interpolation property yields another characterization of w.r.i. We exhibit, with examples, that these C*-algebraic properties fail in general operator systems. Several order theoretic characterization of Connes' embedding problem is given.
