We consider an iterative procedure for constructing maximal abelian ^*-subalgebras (MASAs) satisfying prescribed properties in II_1 factors. This method pairs well with the intertwining by bimodules technique and with properties of the MASA and of the ambient factor that can be described locally. We obtain such a local characterization for II_1 factors M that have an {\it s-MASA}, A\subset M (i.e., for which A \vee JAJ is maximal abelian in \Cal B(L^2M)), and use this strategy to prove that any factor in this class has uncountably many non-intertwinable singular (respectively semiregular) s-MASAs.
