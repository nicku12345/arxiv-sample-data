In this note we demonstrate an equivalent condition for bi-freeness, inspired by the well-known "vanishing of alternating centred moments" condition from free probability. We show that all products satisfying a centred condition on maximal monochromatic \chi-intervals have vanishing moments if and only if the family of pairs of faces they come from is bi-free, and show that similar characterisations hold for the amalgamated and conditional settings. In addition, we construct a bi-free unitary Brownian motion and show that conjugation by this process asymptotically creates bi-freeness; these considerations lead to another characterisation of bi-free independence.
