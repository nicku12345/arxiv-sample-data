We define a noncommutative space we call the quantum solid torus. It is an example of a noncommutative manifold with a noncommutative boundary. We study quantum Dirac type operators subject to Atiyah-Patodi-Singer like boundary conditions on the quantum solid torus. We show that such operators have compact inverse, which means that the corresponding boundary value problem is elliptic.
