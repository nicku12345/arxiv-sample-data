We prove that every 2-local derivation from the algebra M_n(\mathcal{A})(n>2) into its bimodule M_n(\mathcal{M}) is a derivation, where \mathcal{A} is a unital Banach algebra and \mathcal{M} is a unital \mathcal{A}-bimodule such that each Jordan derivation from \mathcal{A} into \mathcal{M} is an inner derivation, and that every 2-local derivation on a C*-algebra with a faithful traceable representation is a derivation. We also characterize local and 2-local Lie derivations on some algebras such as von Neumann algebras, nest algebras, Jiang-Su algebra and UHF algebras.
