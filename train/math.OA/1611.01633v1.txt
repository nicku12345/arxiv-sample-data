A linear mapping \phi on an algebra \mathcal{A} is called a centralizable mapping at G\in\mathcal{A} if \phi(AB)=\phi(A)B=A\phi(B) for each A and B in \mathcal{A} with AB=G, and \phi is called a derivable mapping at G\in\mathcal{A} if \phi(AB)=\phi(A)B+A\phi(B) for each A and B in \mathcal{A} with AB=G. A point G in \mathcal{A} is called a full-centralizable point (resp. full-derivable point) if every centralizable (resp. derivable) mapping at G is a centralizer (resp. derivation). We prove that every point in a von Neumann algebra or a triangular algebra is a full-centralizable point. We also prove that a point in a von Neumann algebra is a full-derivable point if and only if its central carrier is the unit.
