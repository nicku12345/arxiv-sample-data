It is a wide open problem to give an intrinsic criterion for a II_1 factor M to admit a Cartan subalgebra A. When A \subset M is a Cartan subalgebra, the A-bimodule L^2(M) is "simple" in the sense that the left and right action of A generate a maximal abelian subalgebra of B(L^2(M)). A II_1 factor M that admits such a subalgebra A is said to be s-thin. Very recently, Popa discovered an intrinsic local criterion for a II_1 factor M to be s-thin and left open the question whether all s-thin II_1 factors admit a Cartan subalgebra. We answer this question negatively by constructing s-thin II_1 factors without Cartan subalgebras.
