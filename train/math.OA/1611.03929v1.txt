Based on the fact that the Cuntz algebra O_n is generated by the operators consisting of a finite operatorional partition, we study the notion of operational extreme points (which we introduce here) by using several completely positive maps on O_n. As a typical example, we show that the Cuntz's canonical endomorphism Phi_n is an operational extreme point in the set of completely positive maps on O_n and that it induces a completely positive map which is extreme but not operational extreme, etc.
