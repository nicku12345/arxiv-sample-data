Let \mathcal{U}=\left[   \begin{array}{cc}   \mathcal{A} & \mathcal{M}   \mathcal{N}& \mathcal{B}   \end{array}   \right] be a generalized matrix ring, where \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{B} are 2-torsion free. We prove that if \phi :\mathcal{U}\rightarrow \mathcal{U} is an additive mapping such that \phi(U)\circ V+U\circ \phi(V)=0 whenever UV=VU=0, then \phi=\delta+\eta, where \delta is a Jordan derivation and \eta is a multiplier. As its applications, we prove that the similar conclusion remains valid on full matrix algebras, unital prime rings with a nontrivial idempotent, unital standard operator algebras, CDCSL algebras and von Neumann algebras.
