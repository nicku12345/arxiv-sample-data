We present a stable uniqueness theorem for non-unital C*-algebras. Generalized tracial rank one is defined for stably projectionless simple C*-algebras. Let A and B be two stably projectionless separable simple amenable C*-algebras with gTR(A)\le 1and gTR(B)\le 1. Suppose also that KK(A, D)=KK(B,D)=\{0\} for all C*-algebras D. Then A\cong B if and only if they have the same tracial cones with scales. We also show that every separable simple C*-algebra, A with finite nuclear dimension which satisfies the UCT with non-zero traces must have gTR(A)\le 1 if K_0(A) is torsion. In the next part of this research, we show similar results without the restriction on K-theory.
