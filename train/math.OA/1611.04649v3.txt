Given a simple, acyclic dimension group G_{0} and countable, torsion-free, abelian group G_{1}, we construct a minimal, amenable, \'{e}tale equivalence relation R on a Cantor set whose associated groupoid C^{*}-algebra, C^{*}(R), is tracially AF, and hence classifiable in the Elliott classification scheme for simple, amenable, separable C^{*}-algebras, and with K_{*}(C^{*}(R)) \cong(G_{0}, G_{1}).
