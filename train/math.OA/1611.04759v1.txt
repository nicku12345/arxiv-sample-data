We derive Paschke's GNS construction for completely positive maps on unital pro-C*-algebras from the KSGNS construction, presented by M. Joita [J. London Math. Soc. {\bf 66} (2002), 421--432], and then we deduce an analogue of Stinespring theorem for Hilbert modules over pro-C*-algebras. Also, we obtain a Radon-Nikodym type theorem for operator valued completely positive maps on Hilbert modules over pro-C*-algebras.
