We define a category \mathcal{QSI} of quantum semigroups with involution which carries a corepresentation-based duality map M\mapsto \widehat M. Objects in \mathcal{QSI} are von Neumann algebras with comultiplication and coinvolution, we do not suppose the existence of a Haar weight or of a distinguished spatial realisation. In the case of a locally compact quantum group \mathbb G, the duality \;\widehat{\ }\; in \mathcal{QSI} recovers the universal duality of Kustermans: \widehat{L^\infty(\mathbb G)} = C_0^u(\hat {\mathbb G})^{**}= \widehat{ C_0^u(\mathbb G)^{**}}, and \widehat{L^\infty(\hat{\mathbb G})} = C_0^u(\mathbb G)^{**} = \widehat{ C_0^u(\hat{\mathbb G})^{**}}. Other various examples are given.
