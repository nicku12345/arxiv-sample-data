The class of simple separable KK-contractible (KK-equivalent to \{0\}) C*-algebras which have finite nuclear dimension is shown to classified by the Elliott invariant. In particular, the class of C*-algebras A\otimes \mathcal W is classifiable, where A is a simple separable C*-algebra with finite nuclear dimension and \mathcal W is the simple inductive limit of Razak algebras with unique trace, which is bounded.
