We show that the tensor product M \mathbin{\overline{\otimes}} N of any two full factors M and N (possibly of type {\rm III}) is full and we compute Connes' invariant \tau(M \mathbin{\overline{\otimes}} N) in terms of \tau(M) and \tau(N). The key novelty is an enhanced spectral gap property for full factors of type {\rm III}. Moreover, for full factors of type {\rm III} with almost periodic states, we prove an optimal spectral gap property. As an application of our main result, we also show that for any full factor M and any non-type {\rm I} amenable factor P, the tensor product factor M \mathbin{\overline{\otimes}} P has a unique McDuff decomposition, up to stable unitary conjugacy.
