We introduce and analyze the full \mathcal{NT}_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathcal{K}) and the reduced \mathcal{NT}_{\mathcal{L}}^r(\mathcal{K}) Nica-Toeplitz algebra associated to an ideal \mathcal{K} in a right tensor C^*-precategory \mathcal{L} over a right LCM semigroup P. Our main results are uniqueness theorems in the spirit of classical Coburn's theorem, generalizing uniqueness results for Toeplitz-type C^*-algebras associated to single C^*-correspondences, quasi-lattice ordered semigroups, and crossed products twisted by product systems of C^*-correspondences obtained by Fowler, Laca and Raeburn.   We formulate geometric conditions on a representation \Phi of \mathcal{K} so that the C^*-algebra it generates, C^*(\Phi(\mathcal{K})), naturally lies between \mathcal{NT}_{\mathcal{L}}^r(\mathcal{K}) and \mathcal{NT}_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathcal{K}). Under suitable amenability hypotheses, C^*(\Phi(\mathcal{K})) and \mathcal{NT}_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathcal{K}) are isomorphic. The geometric conditions are necessary for our uniqueness result when the right tensoring preserves \mathcal{K} and in general they capture uniqueness of the C^*-algebra generated by a natural extension of \Phi to \mathcal{L}. In particular, the latter algebra could be viewed as a Doplicher-Roberts version of \mathcal{NT}_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathcal{K}).
