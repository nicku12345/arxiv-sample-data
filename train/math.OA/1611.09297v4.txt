Triangular algebras, and maximal triangular algebras in particular, have been objects of interest for over fifty years. Rich families of examples have been studied in the context of many w^*- and C^*-algebras, but there remains a dearth of concrete examples in B(H). In previous work, we described a family of maximal triangular algebras of finite multiplicity. Here, we investigate a related family of maximal triangular algebras with infinite multiplicity, and unearth new asymptotic structure which these algebras exhibit.
