The unitary correlation sets defined by the first author in conjunction with tensor products of \mathcal{U}_{nc}(n) are further studied. We show that Connes' embedding problem is equivalent to deciding whether or not two smaller versions of the unitary correlation sets are equal. Moreover, we obtain the result that Connes' embedding problem is equivalent to deciding whether or not two cross norms on M_n \otimes M_n are equal for all n \geq 2.
