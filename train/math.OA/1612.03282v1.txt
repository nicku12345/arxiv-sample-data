Suppose A is a pro-C*-algebra. Let L_{A}(E) be the pro-C*-algebra of adjointable operators on a Hilbert A-module E and let K_{A}(E) be the closed two sided *-ideal of all compact operators on E. We prove that if E be a full Hilbert A-module, the innerness of derivations on K_{A}(E) implies the innerness of derivations on L_{A}(E). We show that if A is a commutative pro-C*-algebra and E is a Hilbert A-bimodule then every derivation on K_{A}(E) is zero. Moreover, if A is a commutative \sigma-C*-algebra and E is a Hilbert A-bimodule then every derivation on L_{A}(E) is zero, too.
