We introduce a new approach to traces on the principal ideal \mathcal L_{1,\infty} generated by any positive compact operator whose singular value sequence is the harmonic sequence. Distinct from the well-known construction of J.~Dixmier, the new approach provides the explicit construction of every trace of every operator in \mathcal L_{1,\infty} in terms of translation invariant functionals applied to a sequence of restricted sums of eigenvalues. The approach is based on a remarkable bijection between the set of all traces on \mathcal L_{1,\infty} and the set of all translation invariant functionals on l_\infty. This bijection allows us to identify all known and commonly used subsets of traces (Dixmier traces, Connes-Dixmier traces, etc.) in terms of invariance properties of linear functionals on l_\infty, and definitively classify the measurability of operators in \mathcal L_{1,\infty} in terms of qualified convergence of sums of eigenvalues. This classification has led us to a resolution of several open problems (for the class \mathcal L_{1,\infty}) from~\cite{CS}. As an application we extend Connes' classical trace theorem to positive normalised traces.
