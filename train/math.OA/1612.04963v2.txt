We describe representations of groupoid C*-algebras on Hilbert modules over arbitrary C*-algebras by a universal property. For Hilbert space representations, our universal property is equivalent to Renault's Integration-Disintegration Theorem. For a locally compact group, it is related to the automatic continuity of measurable group representations. It implies known descriptions of groupoid C*-algebras as crossed products for \'etale groupoids and transformation groupoids of group actions on spaces.
