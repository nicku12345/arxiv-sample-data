We define the complete numerical radius norm for homomorphisms from any operator algebra into {\mathcal B}({\mathcal H}), and show that this norm can be computed explicitly in terms of the completely bounded norm. This is used to show that if K is a complete C-spectral set for an operator T, then it is a complete M-numerical radius set, where M=\frac12(C+C^{-1}). In particular, in view of Crouzeix's theorem, there is a universal constant M (less than 5.6) so that if P is a matrix polynomial and T \in {\mathcal B}({\mathcal H}), then w(P(T)) \le M \|P\|_{W(T)}. When W(T) = \overline{\mathbb D}, we have M = \frac54.
