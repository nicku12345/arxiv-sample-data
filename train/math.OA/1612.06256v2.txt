We consider a "twisted" noncommutative join procedure for unital C^*-algebras which admit actions by a compact abelian group G and its discrete abelian dual \Gamma, so that we may investigate an analogue of Baum-Dabrowski-Hajac noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam theory in the twisted setting. Namely, under what conditions is it guaranteed that an equivariant map \phi from a unital C^*-algebra A to the twisted join of A and C^*(\Gamma) cannot exist? This pursuit is motivated by the twisted analogues of even spheres, which admit the same K_0 groups as even spheres and have an analogous Borsuk-Ulam theorem that is detected by K_0, despite the fact that the objects are not themselves deformations of a sphere. We find multiple sufficient conditions for twisted Borsuk-Ulam theorems to hold, one of which is the addition of another equivariance condition on \phi that corresponds to the choice of twist. However, we also find multiple examples of equivariant maps \phi that exist even under fairly restrictive assumptions. Finally, we consider an extension of unital contractibility (in the sense of Dabrowski-Hajac-Neshveyev) "modulo k."
