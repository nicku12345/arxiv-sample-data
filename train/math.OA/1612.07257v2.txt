Given a short exact sequence of locally compact abelian groups 0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0 and a continuous C-valued 1-cocycle \phi on a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid \Gamma we construct a twist of \Gamma by A that is trivial if and only if \phi lifts. The cocycle determines a strongly continuous action of \widehat{C} into \operatorname{Aut} C^*(\Gamma) and we prove that the C^*-algebra of the twist is isomorphic to the induced algebra of this action if \Gamma is amenable. We apply our results to a groupoid determined by a locally finite cover of a space X and a cocycle provided by a \v{C}ech 1-cocycle with coefficients in the sheaf of germs of continuous \mathbb{T}-valued functions. We prove that the C^*-algebra of the resulting twist is continuous trace and we compute its Dixmier-Douady invariant.
