We show that there is a functor from the category of positive admissible ternary rings to the category of *-algebras, which induces an isomorphism of partially ordered sets between the families of C^*-norms on the ternary ring and its corresponding *-algebra. We apply this functor to obtain Morita-Rieffel equivalence results between cross sectional C^*-algebras of Fell bundles, and to extend the theory of tensor products of C^*-algebras to the larger category of full Hilbert C^*-modules. We prove that, like in the case of C^*-algebras, there exist maximal and minimal tensor products. As applications we give simple proofs of the invariance of nuclearity and exactness under Morita-Rieffel equivalence of C^*-algebras.
