Given a locally compact group G and a unitary representation \rho:G\to U({\mathcal H}) on a Hilbert space {\mathcal H}, we construct a C^*-correspondence {\mathcal E}(\rho)={\mathcal H}\otimes_{\mathbb C} C^*(G) over C^*(G) and study the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra {\mathcal O}_{{\mathcal E}(\rho)}. We prove that for G compact, {\mathcal O}_{{\mathcal E}(\rho)} is strong Morita equivalent to a graph C^*-algebra. If \lambda is the left regular representation of an infinite, discrete and amenable group G, we show that {\mathcal O}_{{\mathcal E}(\lambda)} is simple and purely infinite, with the same K-theory as C^*(G). If G is compact abelian, any representation decomposes into characters and determines a skew product graph. We illustrate with several examples and we compare {\mathcal E}(\rho) with the crossed product C^*-correspondence.
