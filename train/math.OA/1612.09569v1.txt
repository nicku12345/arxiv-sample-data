This paper studies weakly mixing (singular) and mixing masas in type \rm{II}_{1} factors from a bimodule point of view. Several necessary and sufficient conditions to characterize the normalizing algebra of a masa are presented. We also study the structure of mixing inclusions, with special attention paid to masas of product class. A recent result of Jolissaint and Stalder concerning mixing masas arising out of inclusions of groups is revisited. One consequence of our structural results rules out the existence of certain Koopman-realizable measures, arising from semidirect products, which are absolutely continuous but not Lebesgue. We also show that there exist uncountably many pairwise non--conjugate mixing masas in the free group factors each with Puk\'{a}nszky invariant \{1,\infty\}.
