We describe the tube algebra and its representations in the cases of diagonal and Bisch-Haagerup subfactors possibly with a scalar 3-cocycle obstruction. We show that these categories are additively equivalent to the direct product over conjugacy classes of representation category of a centralizer subgroup (corresponding to the conjugacy class) twisted by a scalar 2-cocycle obtained from the 3-cocycle obstruction.
