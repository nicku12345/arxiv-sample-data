In this paper we revisit the theory of induced representations in the setting of locally compact quantum groups. In the case of induction from open quantum subgroups, we show that constructions of Kustermans and Vaes are equivalent to the classical, and much simpler, construction of Rieffel. We also prove in general setting the continuity of induction in the sense of Vaes with respect to weak containment.
