For a simple C^*-algebra A and any other C^*-algebra B, it is proved that every closed ideal of A \otimes^{\min} B is a product ideal if either A is exact or B is nuclear. Closed commutator of a closed ideal in a Banach algebra whose every closed ideal possesses a quasi-central approximate identity is described in terms of the commutator of the Banach algebra. If \alpha is either the Haagerup norm, the operator space projective norm or the C^*-minimal norm, then this allows us to identify all closed Lie ideals of A \otimes^{\alpha} B, where A and B are simple, unital C^*-algebras with one of them admitting no tracial functionals, and to deduce that every non-central closed Lie ideal of B(H) \otimes^{\alpha} B(H) contains the product ideal K(H) \otimes^{\alpha} K(H). Closed Lie ideals of A \otimes^{\min} C(X) are also determined, A being any simple unital C^*-algebra with at most one tracial state and X any compact Hausdorff space. And, it is shown that closed Lie ideals of A \otimes^{\alpha} K(H) are precisely the product ideals, where A is any unital C^*-algebra and \alpha any completely positive uniform tensor norm.
