We study w*-semicrossed products over actions of the free semigroup and the free abelian semigroup on (possibly non-selfadjoint) w*-closed algebras. We show that they are reflexive when the dynamics are implemented by uniformly bounded families of invertible row operators. Combining with results of Helmer we derive that w*-semicrossed products over factors (on a separable Hilbert space) are reflexive. Furthermore we show that w*-semicrossed products of automorphic actions on maximal abelian selfadjoint algebras are reflexive. In all cases we prove that the w*-semicrossed products have the bicommutant property if and only if so does the ambient algebra of the dynamics.
