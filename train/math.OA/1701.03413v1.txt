We study the ideal structure of reduced crossed product of topological dynamical systems of a countable discrete group. More concretely, for a compact Hausdorff space X with an action of a countable discrete group \Gamma, we consider the absence of a non-zero ideals in the reduced crossed product C(X) \rtimes_r \Gamma which has a zero intersection with C(X). We characterize this condition by a property for amenable subgroups of the stabilizer subgroups of X in terms of the Chabauty space of \Gamma. This generalizes Kennedy's algebraic characterization of the simplicity for a reduced group \mathrm{C}^{*}-algebra of a countable discrete group.
