We give several equivalent characterization of aperiodicity of an element on locally compact group G, and give an intuition for "How strong does the aperiodicity of an element affect the existence of hypercyclic weighted translation operators?". In fact, if a is an aperiodic element in G, then there exists a mixing, chaotic and frequently hypercyclic weighted translation T_{a,w} on L^p(G).
