In this paper, we present two new ways to associate a spectral triple to a higher-rank graph \Lambda. Moreover, we prove that these spectral triples are intimately connected to the wavelet decomposition of the infinite path space of \Lambda which was introduced by Farsi, Gillaspy, Kang, and Packer in 2015. We first introduce the concept of stationary k-Bratteli diagrams, to associate a family of ultrametric Cantor sets to a finite, strongly connected higher-rank graph \Lambda. Then we show that under mild hypotheses, the Pearson-Bellissard spectral triples of such Cantor sets have a regular \zeta-function, whose abscissa of convergence agrees with the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set, and that the measure \mu induced by the associated Dixmier trace agrees with the measure M on the infinite path space \Lambda^\infty of \Lambda which was introduced by an Huef, Laca, Raeburn, and Sims. Furthermore, we prove that \mu = M is a rescaled version of the Hausdorff measure of the ultrametric Cantor set. From work of Julien and Savinien, we know that for \zeta-regular Pearson-Bellissard spectral triples, the eigenspaces of the associated Laplace-Beltrami operator constitute an orthogonal decomposition of L^2(\Lambda^\infty, \mu); we show that this orthogonal decomposition refines the wavelet decomposition of Farsi et al. In addition, we generalize a spectral triple of Consani and Marcolli from Cuntz-Krieger algebras to higher-rank graph C^*-algebras, and prove that the wavelet decomposition of Farsi et al.~describes the eigenspaces of its Dirac operator.
