In previous work, we defined and studied \Sigma^*-modules, a class of Hilbert C^*-modules over \Sigma^*-algebras (the latter are C^*-algebras that are sequentially closed in the weak operator topology). The present work continues this study by developing the appropriate \Sigma^*-algebraic analogue of the notion of strong Morita equivalence for C^*-algebras. We define strong \Sigma^*-Morita equivalence, prove a few characterizations, look at the relationship with equivalence of categories of a certain type of Hilbert space representation, study \Sigma^*-versions of the interior and exterior tensor products, and prove a \Sigma^*-version of the Brown-Green-Rieffel stable isomorphism theorem.
