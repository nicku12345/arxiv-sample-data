The Hardy-Littlewood inequality on \mathbb{T} compares the L^p-norm of a function with a weighted \ell^p-norm of its Fourier coefficients. The approach has recently been studied for compact homogeneous spaces and we study a natural analogue in the framework of compact quantum groups. Especially, in the case of the reduced group C^*-algebras and free quantum groups, we establish explicit L^p-\ell^p inequalities through inherent information of underlying quantum group, such as growth rate and rapid decay property. Moreover, we show sharpness of the inequalities in a large class, including C(G) with compact Lie group, C_r^*(G) with polynomially growing discrete group and free quantum groups O_N^+, S_N^+.
