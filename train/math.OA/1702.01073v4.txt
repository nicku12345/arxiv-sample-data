We present a classification theorem for amenable simple stably projectionless C*-algebras with generalized tracial rank one whose K_0 vanish on traces which satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. One of them is denoted by {\cal Z}_0 which has a unique tracial state and K_0({\cal Z}_0)=\mathbb{Z} and K_1({\cal Z}_0)=\{0\}.   Let A and B be two separable simple C^*-algebras satisfying the UCT and have finite nuclear dimension. We show that A\otimes {\cal Z}_0\cong B\otimes {\cal Z}_0 if and only if {\rm Ell}(B\otimes {\cal Z}_0)={\rm Ell}(B\otimes {\cal Z}_0). A class of simple separable C^*-algebras which are approximately sub-homogeneous whose spectra having bounded dimension is shown to exhaust all possible Elliott invariant for C^*-algebras of the form A\otimes {\cal Z}_0, where A is any finite separable simple amenable C^*-algebras. Suppose that A and B are two finite separable simple C^*-algebras with finite nuclear dimension satisfying the UCT such that traces vanishe on K_0(A) and K_0(B)   (but arbitrary K_1). One consequence of the main results in this situation is that A\cong B if and only if A and B have the isomorphic Elliott invariant.
