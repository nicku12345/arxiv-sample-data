We show that abstract Cuntz semigroups form a closed symmetric monoidal category. Thus, given Cuntz semigroups S and T, there is another Cuntz semigroup [[S,T]] playing the role of morphisms from S to T. Applied to C^*-algebras A and B, the semigroup [[\mathrm{Cu}(A),\mathrm{Cu}(B)]] should be considered as the target in analogues of the UCT for bivariant theories of Cuntz semigroups.   Abstract bivariant Cuntz semigroups are computable in a number of interesting cases. We also show that order-zero maps between C^*-algebras naturally define elements in the respective bivariant Cuntz semigroup.
