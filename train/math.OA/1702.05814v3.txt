In this paper, we study the boundary quotient C*-algebras associated to products of odometers. One of our main results shows that the boundary quotient C*-algebra of the standard product of k odometers over n_i-letter alphabets (1\le i\le k) is always nuclear, and that it is a UCT Kirchberg algebra if and only if \{\ln n_i: 1\le i\le k\} is rationally independent, if and only if the associated single-vertex k-graph C*-algebra is simple. To achieve this, one of our main steps is to construct a topological k-graph such that its associated Cuntz-Pimsner C*-algebra is isomorphic to the boundary quotient C*-algebra. Some relations between the boundary quotient C*-algebra and the C*-algebra \Q_\bN introduced by Cuntz are also investigated. As an easy consequence of our main results, it settles a boundary quotient C*-algebra constructed by Brownlowe-Ramagge-Robertson-Whittaker.
