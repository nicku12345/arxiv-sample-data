Let \(\mathcal{A}\) be a unital Banach algebra such that any Jordan derivation from \(\mathcal{A}\) into any \(\mathcal{A}\)-bimodule \(\mathcal{M}\) is a derivation. We prove that any 2-local derivation from the algebra M_n(\mathcal{A}) into M_n(\mathcal{M}) (n\geq 3) is a derivation. We apply this result to show that any 2-local derivation on the algebra of locally measurable operators affiliated with a von Neumann algebra without direct abelian summands is a derivation.
