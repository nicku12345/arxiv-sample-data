We associate to each synchronous game an algebra whose representations determine if the game has a perfect deterministic strategy, perfect quantum strategy or one of several other perfect strategies. when applied to the graph coloring game, this leads to characterizations in terms of properties of an algebra of various quantum chromatic numbers that have been studied in the literature. This allows us to develop a correspondence between various chromatic numbers of a graph and ideals in this algebra which can then be approached via various Grobner basis methods.
