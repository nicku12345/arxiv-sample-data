It is proved that for every surjective linear isometry V on a perfect Banach symmetric ideal \mathcal C_E\neq \mathcal C_2 of compact operators, acting in a complex separable infnite-dimensional Hilbert space \mathcal H there exist unitary operators u and v on \mathcal H such that V(x)=uxv or V(x) = ux^tv for all x\in \mathcal C_E, where x^t is the transpose of an operator x with respect to a fixed orthonormal basis in \mathcal H. In addition, it is shown that any surjective 2-local isometry on a perfect Banach symmetric ideal \mathcal C_E \neq \mathcal C_2 is a linear isometry on \mathcal C_E.
