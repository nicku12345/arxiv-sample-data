In this paper, we consider pure infiniteness of generalized Cuntz-Krieger algebras associated to labeled spaces (E,\mathcal{L},\mathcal{E}). It is shown that a C^*-algebra C^*(E,\mathcal{L},\mathcal{E}) is purely infinite in the sense that every nonzero hereditary subalgebra contains an infinite projection (we call this property (IH)) if (E, \mathcal{L},\mathcal{E}) is disagreeable and every vertex connects to a loop. We also prove that under the condition analogous to (K) for usual graphs, C^*(E,\mathcal{L},\mathcal{E})=C^*(p_A, s_a) is purely infinite in the sense of Kirchberg and R{\o}rdam if and only if every generating projection p_A, A\in \mathcal{E}, is properly infinite, and also if and only if every quotient of C^*(E,\mathcal{L},\mathcal{E}) has the property (IH).
