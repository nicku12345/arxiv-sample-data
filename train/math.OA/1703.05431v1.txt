We define branching systems for finitely aligned higher-rank graphs. From these we construct concrete representations of higher-rank graph C*-algebras on Hilbert spaces. We prove a generalized Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem for periodic single-vertex 2-graphs. We use this result to give a sufficient condition under which representations of periodic single-vertex 2-graph C*-algebras arising from branching systems are faithful.
