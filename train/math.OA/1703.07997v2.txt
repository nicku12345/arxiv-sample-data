We extend the \lambda-theory of operator spaces given by Defant and Wiesner (2014), that generalizes the notion of the projective, Haagerup and Schur tensor norm for operator spaces to matrix ordered spaces and Banach *-algebras. Given matrix regular operator spaces and operator systems, we introduce cones related to \lambda for the algebraic tensor product that respect the matricial structure of matrix regular operator spaces and operator systems, respectively. The ideal structure of \lambda-tensor product of C^*-algebras has also been discussed.
