The Baumslag-Solitar group is an example of an HNN extension. Spielberg showed that it has a natural positive cone, and that it is then a quasi-lattice ordered group in the sense of Nica. We give conditions for an HNN extension of a quasi-lattice ordered group (G,P) to be quasi-lattice ordered. In that case, if (G,P) is amenable as a quasi-lattice ordered group, then so is the HNN extension.
