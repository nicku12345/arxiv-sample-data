Let A, B be separable C*-algebras, B stable. Elements of the E-theory group E(A,B) are represented by asymptotic homomorphisms from the second suspension of A to B. Our aim is to represent these elements by (families of) maps from A itself to B. We have to pay for that by allowing these maps to be even further from *-homomorphisms. We prove that E(A,B) can be represented by pairs (\varphi^+,\varphi^-) of maps from A to B that are not necessarily asymptotic homomorphisms, but have the same deficiency from being ones. Not surprisingly, such pairs of maps can be viewed as pairs of asymptotic homomorphisms from some C*-algebra C that surjects onto A, and the two maps in a pair should agree on the kernel of this surjection. We give examples of full surjections C\to A, i.e. those, for which all classes in E(A,B) can be obtained from pairs of asymptotic homomorphisms from C.
