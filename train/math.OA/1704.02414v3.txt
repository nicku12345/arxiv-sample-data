We classify trace scaling automorphisms of \mathcal{W}\otimes\mathbb{K} up to outer conjugacy, where \mathcal{W} is a certain simple separable nuclear stably projectionless C^*-algebra having trivial K-groups. Also, we show that all automorphisms of \mathcal{W} with the Rohlin property are outer conjugate to each other. Moreover, we show that the central sequence C^*-algebra F(\mathcal{W}) of \mathcal{W} is infinitee, which answers a question of Kirchberg.
