Let \mathcal{L}(H) be the *-algebra of all bounded operators on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space H and let (\mathcal{I}, \|\cdot\|_{\mathcal{I}}) be an ideal in \mathcal{L}(H) equipped with a Banach norm which is distinct from the Schatten-von Neumann ideal \mathcal{L}_p(\mathcal{H}), 1\leq p<2. We prove that \mathcal{I} isomorphically embeds into an L_p-space \mathcal{L}_p(\mathcal{R}), 1\leq p<2, (here, \mathcal{R} is the hyperfinite II_1-factor) if its commutative core (that is, Calkin space for \mathcal{I}) isomorphically embeds into L_p(0,1). Furthermore, we prove that an Orlicz ideal \mathcal{L}_M(H)\neq\mathcal{L}_p(H) isomorphically embeds into \mathcal{L}_p(\mathcal{R}), 1\leq p<2, if and only if it is an interpolation space for the Banach couple (\mathcal{L}_p(H),\mathcal{L}_2(H)). Finally, we consider isomorphic embeddings of (\mathcal{I}, \|\cdot\|_{\mathcal{I}}) into L_p-spaces associated with arbitrary finite von Neumann algebras.
