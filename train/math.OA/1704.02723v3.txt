We consider the center of Hamana's equivariant injective envelope of a unital C^*-algebra equipped with an action of a discrete group. We show that the center of the equivariant injective envelope always contains a ^*-algebraic copy of the equivariant injective envelope of the center of the injective envelope. We also show that the intersection property of a group action on a C^*-algebra is equivalent to the intersection property of the action on the equivariant injective envelope. Finally, we give applications of these results in the case when the group is C^*-simple.
