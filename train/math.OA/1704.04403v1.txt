We define a relation < for dual operator algebras. We say that B < A if there exists a projection p in A such that B and pAp are Morita equivalent in our sense. We show that < is transitive, and we investigate the following question: If A < B and B < A, then is it true that A and B are stably isomorphic? We propose an analogous relation < for dual operator spaces, and we present some properties of < in this case.
