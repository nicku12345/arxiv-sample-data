We show that any type {\rm III_1} factor with separable predual satisfying Connes' Bicentralizer Property (CBP) has a singular maximal abelian \ast-subalgebra that is the range of a normal conditional expectation. We also investigate stability properties of CBP under finite index extensions/restrictions of type {\rm III_1} factors.
