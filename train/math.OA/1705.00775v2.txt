Fowler introduced the notion of a product system: a collection of Hilbert bimodules \mathbf{X}=\left\{\mathbf{X}_p:p\in P\right\} indexed by a semigroup P, endowed with a multiplication implementing isomorphisms \mathbf{X}_p\otimes_A \mathbf{X}_q\cong \mathbf{X}_{pq}. When P is quasi-lattice ordered, Fowler showed how to associate a C^*-algebra \mathcal{NT}_\mathbf{X} to \mathbf{X}, generated by a universal representation satisfying some covariance condition. In this article we prove a uniqueness theorem for these so called Nica-Toeplitz algebras.
