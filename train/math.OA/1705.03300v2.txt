For a C^*-algebra A and a set X we give a Stinespring-type characterisation of the completely positive Schur A-multipliers on K(\ell^2(X))\otimes A. We then relate them to completely positive Herz-Schur multipliers on C^*-algebraic crossed products of the form A\rtimes_{\alpha,r} G, with G a discrete group, whose various versions were considered earlier by Anantharaman-Delaroche, B\'edos and Conti, and Dong and Ruan. The latter maps are shown to implement approximation properties, such as nuclearity or the Haagerup property, for A\rtimes_{\alpha,r} G.
