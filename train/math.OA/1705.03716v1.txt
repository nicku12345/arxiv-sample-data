We study the uniform Roe algebras associated to locally finite groups. We show that for two countable locally finite groups \Gamma and \Lambda, the associated uniform Roe algebras C^*_u(\Gamma) and C^*_u(\Lambda) are *-isomorphic if and only if their K_0 groups are isomorphic as ordered abelian groups with units. This can be seen as a non-separable non-simple analogue of the Glimm-Elliott classification of UHF algebras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first classification result for a class of non-separable unital C^*-algebras. Along the way we also obtain a rigidity result: two countable locally finite groups are bijectively coarsely equivalent if and only if the associated uniform Roe algebras are *-isomorphic.   Finally, we give a summary of C^*-algebraic characterizations for (not necessarily countable) locally finite discrete groups in terms of their uniform Roe algebras. In particular, we show that a discrete group \Gamma is locally finite if and only if the associated uniform Roe algebra \ell^\infty(\Gamma)\rtimes_r \Gamma is locally finite-dimensional.
