Let \mathcal A be a simple, \sigma-unital, non-unital, non-elementary C*-algebra and let I_{min} be the intersection of all the ideals of \mathcal M(\mathcal A) that properly contain \mathcal A. I_{min} coincides with the ideal defined by Lin (Simple C*-algebras with continuous scales and simple corona algebras. 112, (1991) Proc. Amer.Math. Soc) in terms of approximate units of \mathcal A and I_{min}/\mathcal A is purely infinite and simple. If \mathcal A is separable, or if \mathcal A has the (SP) property and its dimension semigroup D(\mathcal A) of Murray-von Neumann equivalence classes of projections of \mathcal A is order separable, or if \mathcal A has strict comparison of positive elements by traces, then \mathcal A\ne I_{min}. If the tracial simplex  \mathcal T(\mathcal A) is nonempty, let  I_{con} be the closure of the linear span of the elements A\in\mathcal M(\mathcal A)_+ such that the evaluation map \hat A(\tau)=\tau(A) is continuous. If \mathcal A has strict comparison of positive element by traces then I_{min}= I_{con}. Furthermore, I_{min} too has strict comparison of positive elements in the sense that if A, B\in (I_{min})_+, B\not \in\mathcal A and d_\tau(A)< d_\tau(B) for all \tau\in \mathcal T(\mathcal A) for which d_\tau(B)< \infty, then A\preceq B. However if \mathcal A does not have strict comparison of positive elements by traces then I_{min}\ne I_{con} can occur: a counterexample is provided by Villadsen's AH algebras without slow dimension growth. If the dimension growth is flat,  I_{con} is the largest proper ideal of \mathcal M(\mathcal A).
