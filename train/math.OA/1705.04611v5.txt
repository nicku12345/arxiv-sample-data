We work on the classification of isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective modules over the C*-algebras C\left( \mathbb{P}^{n}\left( \mathcal{T}\right) \right)  and C\left( \mathbb{S}_{H}^{2n+1}\right)  of the quantum complex projective spaces \mathbb{P}^{n}\left( \mathcal{T} \right)  and the quantum spheres \mathbb{S}_{H}^{2n+1}, and the quantum line bundles L_{k} over \mathbb{P}^{n}\left( \mathcal{T}\right) , studied by Hajac and collaborators. Motivated by the groupoid approach of Curto, Muhly, and Renault to the study of C*-algebraic structure, we analyze C\left( \mathbb{P}^{n}\left( \mathcal{T}\right) \right) , C\left( \mathbb{S}_{H}^{2n+1}\right) , and L_{k} in the context of groupoid C*-algebras, and then apply Rieffel's stable rank results to show that all finitely generated projective modules over C\left( \mathbb{S}_{H} ^{2n+1}\right)  of rank higher than \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor +3 are free modules. Furthermore, besides identifying a large portion of the positive cone of the K_{0}-group of C\left( \mathbb{P}^{n}\left( \mathcal{T}\right) \right) , we also explicitly identify L_{k} with concrete representative elementary projections over C\left( \mathbb{P} ^{n}\left( \mathcal{T}\right) \right) .
