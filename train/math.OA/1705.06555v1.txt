A trace \tau on a separable C*-algebra A is called matricial field (MF) if there is a trace-preserving morphism from A to Q_\omega, where Q_\omega denotes the norm ultrapower of the universal UHF-algebra Q. In general, the trace \tau induces a state on the Cuntz semigroup Cu(A). We show there is always a state-preserving morphism from Cu(A) to Cu(Q_\omega).   As an application, if A is an AI-algebra and F is a free group acting on A, then every trace on the reduced crossed product A \rtimes F is MF. This further implies the same result when A is an AH-algebra with the ideal property such that K_1(A) is a torsion group. We also use this to characterize when A \rtimes F is MF (i.e. admits an isometric morphism into Q_\omega) for many simple, nuclear C*-algebras A.
