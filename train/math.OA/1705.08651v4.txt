It is well-known that any covering space of a Riemannian manifold has the natural structure of a Riemannian manifold. This article contains a noncommutative generalization of this fact. Since any Riemannian manifold with a Spin-structure defines a spectral triple, the spectral triple can be regarded as a noncommutative Spin-manifold. Similarly there is an algebraic construction which is a noncommutative generalization of topological covering. This article contains a construction of spectral triple on the "noncommutative covering space".
