We prove that for any two elements A, B in a factor M, if B commutes with all the unitary conjugates of A, then either A or B is in \mathbb{C}I. Then we obtain an equivalent condition for the situation that the C-numerical radius \omega_{C}(\cdot) is a weakly unitarily invariant norm on finite factors and we also prove some inequalities on the C-numerical radius on finite factors. As an application, we show that for an invertible operator T in a finite factor M, f(\bigtriangleup_{\lambda}(T)) is in the weak operator closure of the set \{\sum_{i=1}^{n}z_{i}U_{i}f(T)U_{i}^{*}|n\in\mathbb{N},(U_{i})_{1\leq i\leq n}\in \mathscr{U}(M),\sum_{i=1}^{n}|z_{i}|\leq 1\}, where f is a polynomial, \bigtriangleup_{\lambda}(T) is the \lambda-Aluthge transform of T and 0\leq\lambda \leq 1.
