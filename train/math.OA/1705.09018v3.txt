Let M be a finite von Neumann algebra (resp. a type II_{1} factor) and let N\subset M be a II_{1} factor (resp. N\subset M have an atomic part). We prove that the inclusion N\subset M is amenable implies the identity map on M has an approximate factorization through M_m(\mathbb{C})\otimes N  via trace preserving normal unital completely positive maps, which is a generalization of a result of Haagerup. We also prove two permanence properties for amenable inclusions. One is weak Haagerup property, the other is weak exactness.
