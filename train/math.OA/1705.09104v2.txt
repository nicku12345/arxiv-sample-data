There are known three ways to construct the minimal dilation of the discrete semigroup generated by a normal unital completely positive map on a von Neumann algebra, which are given by Arveson, Bhat-Skeide and Muhly-Solel. In this paper, we clarify the relation of the constructions by Bhat-Skeide and Muhly-Solel.
