For a commutative C*-algebra \mathcal A with unit e and a Hilbert~\mathcal A-module \mathcal M, denote by End_{\mathcal A}(\mathcal M) the algebra of all bounded \mathcal A-linear mappings on \mathcal M, and by End^*_{\mathcal A}(\mathcal M) the algebra of all adjointable mappings on \mathcal M. We prove that if \mathcal M is full, then each derivation on End_{\mathcal A}(\mathcal M) is \mathcal A-linear, continuous, and inner, and each 2-local derivation on End_{\mathcal A}(\mathcal M) or End^{*}_{\mathcal A}(\mathcal M) is a derivation. If there exist x_0 in \mathcal M and f_0 in \mathcal M^{'}, such that f_0(x_0)=e, where \mathcal M^{'} denotes the set of all bounded \mathcal A-linear mappings from \mathcal M to \mathcal A, then each \mathcal A-linear local derivation on End_{\mathcal A}(\mathcal M) is a derivation.
