It is known that any covering space of a topological group has the natural structure of a topological group. This article discusses a noncommutative generalization of this fact. A noncommutative generalization of the topological group is a quantum group. Also there is a noncommutative generalization of a covering. The combination of these algebraic constructions yields a motive to research the generalization of coverings of topological groups. In contrary to a topological group a covering space of a quantum group does not have the natural structure of the quantum group. However a covering space of a quantum group satisfies to a condition which is weaker than the condition of a covering space of a topological group.
