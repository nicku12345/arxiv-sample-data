Let a discrete group G act on a unital simple C^*-algebra A by outer automorphisms. We establish a Galois correspondence H\mapsto A\rtimes_{\alpha,r}H between subgroups of G and C^*-algebras B satisfying A\subseteq B \subseteq A\rtimes_{\alpha,r}G, where A\rtimes_{\alpha,r}G denotes the reduced crossed product. For a twisted dynamical system (A,G,\alpha,\sigma), we also prove the corresponding result for the reduced twisted crossed product A\rtimes^\sigma_{\alpha,r}G.
