In this article we have shown that the quantum isometry group of C_r^*(\mathbb{Z}), denoted by \mathbb{Q}(\mathbb{Z},S) as in \cite{gos_man}, with respect to a symmetric generating set S does not depend on the generating set S. Moreover, we have proved that the result is no longer true if the group \mathbb{Z} is replaced by \underbrace{\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \times\cdots \times \mathbb{Z}}_{n \ copies} for n>1.
