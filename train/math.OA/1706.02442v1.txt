Let A be a C^*-algebra and E\colon A \to A a conditional expectation. The Kadison-Schwarz inequality for completely positive maps, E(x)^*E(x) \leq E(x^* x), implies that      \|E(x)\|^2 \leq \|E(x^* x)\|.   In this note we show that E is a homomorphism if and only if   \|E(x)\|^2 = \|E(x^*x)\|, for every x in A.   We also prove that a homomorphic conditional expectation on a commutative C^*-algebra C_0(X) is given by composition with a continuous retraction of X.   One may therefore consider homomorphic conditional expectations as noncommutative retractions.
