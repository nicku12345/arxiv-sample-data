Let P be a closed convex cone in \mathbb{R}^{n}. Assume that P is spanning i.e. P-P=\mathbb{R}^{n} and pointed i.e. P \cap -P=\{0\}. Let \alpha:=\{\alpha_{x}:x \in P\} be a \sigma-weakly continuous family of unital normal endomorphisms on B(H). Denote the "product system" associated to \alpha by \mathcal{E}_{\alpha}. We show that \mathcal{E}_{\alpha} is a concrete product system and \alpha, up to cocycle conjugacy, can be recovered completely from \mathcal{E}_{\alpha}
