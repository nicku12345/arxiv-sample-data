We prove uniqueness of representations of Nica-Toeplitz algebras associated to product systems of C^*-correspondences over right LCM semigroups by applying our previous abstract uniqueness results developed for C^*-precategories. Our results provide an interpretation of conditions identified in work of Fowler and Fowler-Raeburn, and apply also to their crossed product twisted by a product system, in the new context of right LCM semigroups, as well as to a new, Doplicher-Roberts type C^*-algebra associated to the Nica-Toeplitz algebra. As a derived construction we develop Nica-Toeplitz crossed products by actions with completely positive maps. This provides a unified framework for Nica-Toeplitz semigroup crossed products by endomorphisms and by transfer operators. We illustrate these two classes of examples with semigroup C^*-algebras of right and left semidirect products.
