To every convex body K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d, one may associate a minimal matrix convex set \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{min}}(K), and a maximal matrix convex set \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{max}}(K), which have K as their ground level. The main question treated in this paper is: under what conditions on a given pair of convex bodies K,L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d does \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{max}}(K) \subseteq \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{min}}(L) hold? For a convex body K, we aim to find the optimal constant \theta(K) such that \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{max}}(K) \subseteq \theta(K) \cdot \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{min}}(K); we achieve this goal for all the \ell^p unit balls, as well as for other sets. For example, if \overline{\mathbb{B}}_{p,d} is the closed unit ball in \mathbb{R}^d with the \ell^p norm, then \[ \theta(\overline{\mathbb{B}}_{p,d}) = d^{1-|1/p - 1/2|}. \] This constant is sharp, and it is new for all p \neq 2. Moreover, for some sets K we find a minimal set L for which \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{max}}(K) \subseteq \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{min}}(L). In particular, we obtain that a convex body K satisfies \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{max}}(K) = \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{min}}(K) if and only if K is a simplex.   These problems relate to dilation theory, convex geometry, operator systems, and completely positive maps. We discuss and exploit these connections as well. For example, our results show that every d-tuple of self-adjoint operators of norm less than or equal to 1, can be dilated to a commuting family of self-adjoints, each of norm at most \sqrt{d}. We also introduce new explicit constructions of these (and other) dilations.
