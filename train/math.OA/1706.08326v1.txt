We prove new results on generalized derivations on C^*-algebras. By considering the triple product \{a,b,c\} =2^{-1} (a b^* c + c b^* a), we introduce the study of linear maps which are triple derivations or triple homomorphisms at a point. We prove that a continuous linear T map on a unital C^*-algebra is a generalized derivation whenever it is a triple derivation at the unit element. If we additionally assume T(1)=0, then T is a ^*-derivation and a triple derivation. Furthermore, a continuous linear map on a unital C^*-algebra which is a triple derivation at the unit element is a triple derivation. Similar conclusions are obtained for continuous linear maps which are derivations or triple derivations at zero.   We also give an automatic continuity result, that is, we show that generalized derivations on a von Neumann algebra and linear maps on a von Neumann algebra which are derivations or triple derivations at zero are all continuous even if not assumed a priori to be so.
