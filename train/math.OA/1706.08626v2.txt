In this article we study how decompositions of a quasi-lattice ordered group (G,P) relate to decompositions of the Nica-Toeplitz algebra \mathcal{NT}_\mathbf{X} and Cuntz-Nica-Pimsner algebra \mathcal{NO}_\mathbf{X} of a compactly aligned product system \mathbf{X} over P. In particular, we are interested in the situation where (G,P) may be realised as the semidirect product of quasi-lattice ordered groups. Our results generalise Deaconu's work on iterated Toeplitz and Cuntz-Pimsner algebras - we show that the Nica-Toeplitz algebra and Cuntz-Nica-Pimsner algebra of a compactly aligned product system over \mathbb{N}^k may be realised as k-times iterated Toeplitz and Cuntz-Pimsner algebras respectively.
