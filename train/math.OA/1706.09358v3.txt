We use product systems of C^*-correspondences to introduce twisted C^*-algebras of topological higher-rank graphs. We define the notion of a continuous \mathbb{T}-valued 2-cocycle on a topological higher-rank graph, and present examples of such cocycles on large classes of topological higher-rank graphs. To every proper, source-free topological higher-rank graph \Lambda, and continuous \mathbb{T}-valued 2-cocycle c on \Lambda, we associate a product system X of C_0(\Lambda^0)-correspondences built from finite paths in \Lambda. We define the twisted Cuntz--Krieger algebra C^*(\Lambda,c) to be the Cuntz--Pimsner algebra \mathcal{O}(X), and we define the twisted Toeplitz algebra \mathcal{T} C^*(\Lambda,c) to be the Nica--Toeplitz algebra \mathcal{NT}(X). We also associate to \Lambda and c a product system Y of C_0(\Lambda^\infty)-correspondences built from infinite paths. We prove that there is an embedding of \mathcal{T} C^*(\Lambda,c) into \mathcal{NT}(Y), and an isomorphism between C^*(\Lambda,c) and \mathcal{O}(Y).
