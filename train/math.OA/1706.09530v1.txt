Let A and B be unital C^*-algebras and let H be a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra. Let H^0 be its dual C^*-Hopf algebra. Let (\rho, u) and (\sigma, v) be twisted coactions of H^0 on A and B, respectively. In this paper, we shall show the following theorem: We suppose that the unital inclusions A\subset A\rtimes_{\rho, u}H and B\subset B\rtimes_{\sigma, v}H are strongly Morita equivalent. If A'\cap (A\rtimes_{\rho, u}H)=\BC1, then there is a C^*-Hopf algebra automorphism \lambda^0 of H^0 such that the twisted coaction (\rho, u) is strongly Morita equivalent to the twisted coaction ((\id_B \otimes\lambda^0 )\circ\sigma \, , \, (\id_B \otimes\lambda^0 \otimes\lambda^0 )(v)) induced by (\sigma, v) and \lambda^0.
