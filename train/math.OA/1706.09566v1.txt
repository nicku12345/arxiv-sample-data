In the paper, we prove an analogue of the Kato-Rosenblum theorem in a semifinite von Neumann algebra. Let \mathcal{M} be a countably decomposable, properly infinite, semifinite von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space \mathcal{H} and let \tau be a faithful normal semifinite tracial weight of \mathcal M. Suppose that H and H_1 are self-adjoint operators affiliated with \mathcal{M}. We show that if H-H_1 is in \mathcal{M}\cap L^{1}\left(\mathcal{M},\tau\right), then the {norm} absolutely continuous parts of H and H_1 are unitarily equivalent. This implies that the real part of a non-normal hyponormal operator in \mathcal M is not a perturbation by \mathcal{M}\cap L^{1}\left(\mathcal{M},\tau\right) of a diagonal operator. Meanwhile, for n\ge 2 and 1\leq p<n, by modifying Voiculescu's invariant we give examples of commuting n-tuples of self-adjoint operators in \mathcal{M} that are not arbitrarily small perturbations of commuting diagonal operators modulo \mathcal{M}\cap L^{p}\left(\mathcal{M},\tau\right).
