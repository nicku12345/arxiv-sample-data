Let \mathbb{G} be a locally compact quantum group. We give a 1-1 correspondence between group-like projections in L^\infty(\mathbb{G}) preserved by the scaling group and idempotent states on the dual quantum group \widehat{\mathbb{G}}. As a byproduct we give a simple proof that normal integrable coideals in L^\infty(\mathbb{G}) which are preserved by the scaling group are in 1-1 correspondence with compact quantum subgroups of \mathbb{G}.
