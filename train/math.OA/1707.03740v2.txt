In this paper, we study the ideal structure of reduced C^*-algebras C^*_r(G) associated to \'etale groupoids G. In particular, we characterize when there is a one-to-one correspondence between the closed, two-sided ideals in C_r^*(G) and the open invariant subsets of the unit space G^{(0)} of G. As a consequence, we show that if G is an inner exact, essentially principal, ample groupoid, then C_r^*(G) is (strongly) purely infinite if and only if every non-zero projection in C_0(G^{(0)}) is properly infinite in C_r^*(G). We also establish a sufficient condition on the ample groupoid G that ensures pure infiniteness of C_r^*(G) in terms of paradoxicality of compact open subsets of the unit space G^{(0)}.   Finally, we introduce the type semigroup for ample groupoids and also obtain a dichotomy result: Let G be an ample groupoid with compact unit space which is minimal and topologically principal. If the type semigroup is almost unperforated, then C_r^*(G) is a simple C^*-algebra which is either stably finite or strongly purely infinite.
