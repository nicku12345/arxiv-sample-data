By a labeled graph C^*-algebra we mean a C^*-algebra associated to a labeled space (E,\mathcal L,\mathcal E) consisting of a labeled graph (E,\mathcal L) and the smallest normal accommodating set \mathcal E of vertex subsets. Every graph C^*-algebra C^*(E) is a labeled graph C^*-algebra and it is well known that C^*(E) is simple if and only if the graph E is cofinal and satisfies Condition (L). Bates and Pask extend these conditions of graphs E to labeled spaces, and show that if a set-finite and receiver set-finite labeled space (E,\mathcal L, \mathcal E) is cofinal and disagreeable, then its C^*-algebra C^*(E,\mathcal L, \mathcal E) is simple. In this paper, we show that the converse is also true.
