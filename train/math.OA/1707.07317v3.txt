Let M be a II_1 factor with a von Neumann subalgebra Q\subset M that has infinite index under any projection in Q'\cap M (e.g., Q abelian; or Q an irreducible subfactor with infinite Jones index). We prove that given any separable subalgebra B of the ultrapower II_1 factor M^\omega, for a non-principal ultrafilter \omega on \Bbb N, there exists a unitary element u\in M^\omega such that uBu^* is orthogonal to Q^\omega.
