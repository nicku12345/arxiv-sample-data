We define a tracial analogue of the sequentially split *-homomorphism between C^*-algebras of Barlak and Szab\'{o} and show that several important approximation properties related to the classification theory of C^*-algebras pass from the target algebra to the domain algebra. Then we show that the tracial Rokhlin property of the finite group G action on a C^*-algebra A gives rise to a tracial version of sequentially split *-homomorphism from A\rtimes_{\alpha}G to M_{|G|}(A) and the tracial Rokhlin property of an inclusion C^*-algebras A\subset P with a conditional expectation E:A \to P of a finite Watatani index generates a tracial version of sequentially split map. By doing so, we provide a unified approach to permanence properties related to tracial Rokhlin property of operator algebras.
