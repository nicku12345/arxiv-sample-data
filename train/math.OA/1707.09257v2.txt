We define spatial L^p AF algebras for p \in [1, \infty) \setminus \{ 2 \}, and prove the following analog of the Elliott AF algebra classification theorem. If A and B are spatial L^p AF algebras, then the following are equivalent: 1) A and B have isomorphic scaled preordered K_0-groups. 2) A \cong B as rings. 3) A \cong B (not necessarily isometrically) as Banach algebras. 4) A is isometrically isomorphic to B as Banach algebras. 5) A is completely isometrically isomorphic to B as matrix normed Banach algebra. As background, we develop the theory of matrix normed L^p operator algebras, and show that there is a unique way to make a spatial L^p AF algebra into a matrix normed L^p operator algebra. We also show that any countable scaled Riesz group can be realized as the scaled preordered K_0-group of a spatial L^p AF algebra.
