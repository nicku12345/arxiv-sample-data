Let G be a discrete group acting on a unital C^*-algebra \mathcal{A} by *-automorphisms. We characterize (in terms of the dynamics) when the inclusion \mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{A} \rtimes_r G has a unique conditional expectation, and when it has a unique pseudo-expectation (in the sense of Pitts). Likewise for the inclusion \mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{A} \rtimes G. As an application, we (slightly) strengthen results of Kishimoto and Archbold-Spielberg concerning C^*-simplicity of \mathcal{A} \rtimes_r G.
