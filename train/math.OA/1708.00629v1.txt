We consider fiberwise singly generated Fell-bundles over etale groupoids. Given a continuous real-valued 1-cocycle on the groupoid, there is a natural dynamics on the cross-sectional algebra of the Fell bundle. We study the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger equilibrium states for this dynamics. Following work of Neshveyev on equilibrium states on groupoid C*-algebras, we describe the equilibrium states of the cross-sectional algebra in terms of measurable fields of traces on the C*-algebras of the restrictions of the Fell bundle to the isotropy subgroups of the groupoid. As a special case, we obtain a description of the trace space of the cross-sectional algebra. We apply our result to generalise Neshveyev's main theorem to twisted groupoid C*-algebras, and then apply this to twisted C*-algebras of strongly connected finite k-graphs.
