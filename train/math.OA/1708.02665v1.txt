Let G be a finite group, A a unital separable finite simple nuclear C*-algebra, and \alpha an action of G on A. Assume that A absorbs the Jiang-Su algebra \mathcal{Z}, the extremal boundary of the trace space of A is compact and finite dimensional and that \alpha fixes any tracial state of A. Then tsr(A \rtimes_\alpha G) = 1. In particular, when A has a unique tracial state, we conclude it without above conditons on a tracial state space of A.
