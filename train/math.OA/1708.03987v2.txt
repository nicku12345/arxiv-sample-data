Let G be a discrete group acting on a unital C^*-algebra \mathcal{A} by *-automorphisms. In this note, we show that the inclusion \mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{A} \rtimes_r G has the pure extension property (so that every pure state on \mathcal{A} extends uniquely to a pure state on \mathcal{A} \rtimes_r G) if and only if G acts freely on \mathcal{\widehat{A}}, the spectrum of \mathcal{A}. The same characterization holds for the inclusion \mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{A} \rtimes G. This generalizes what was already known for \mathcal{A} abelian.
