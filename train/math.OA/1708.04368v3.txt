Naimark's problem asks whether a C*-algebra that has only one irreducible *-representation up to unitary equivalence is isomorphic to the C*-algebra of compact operators on some (not necessarily separable) Hilbert space. This problem has been solved in special cases, including separable C*-algebras and Type I C*-algebras. However, in 2004 Akemann and Weaver used the diamond principle to construct a C*-algebra with \aleph_1 generators that is a counterexample to Naimark's Problem. More precisely, they showed that the statement "There exists a counterexample to Naimark's Problem that is generated by \aleph_1 elements." is independent of the axioms of ZFC. Whether Naimark's problem itself is independent of ZFC remains unknown. In this paper we examine Naimark's problem in the setting of graph C*-algebras, and show that it has an affirmative answer for (not necessarily separable) AF graph C*-algebras as well as for C*-algebras of graphs in which each vertex emits a countable number of edges.
