A subset \mathcal{G} generating a C^*-algebra A is said to be hyperrigid if for every faithful nondegenerate *-representation A\subseteq B(H) and a sequence \phi_n:B(H) \to B(H) of unital completely positive maps, we have that \[ \lim_{n\to\infty}\phi_n(g)= g~~\text{for all } g\in \mathcal{G} ~~ \implies ~~ \lim_{n\to\infty}\phi_n(a)= a~~\text{for all } a\in A \] where all convergence are in norm. In this paper, we show that for the Cuntz-Krieger algebra \mathcal{O}(G) associated to a row-finite directed graph G with no isolated vertices, the set of partial isometries \mathcal{E}=\{S_e:e\in E\} is hyperrigid.   In addition, we define and examine a closely related notion: the property of rigidity at 0. A generating subset \mathcal{G} of a C^*-algebra A is said to be rigid at 0 if for every sequence of contractive positive maps \varphi_n:A\to \mathbb C satisfying \lim_{n\to \infty}\varphi_n(g)=0 for every g\in \mathcal{G}, we have that \lim_{n\to \infty}\varphi_n(a)=0 for every a\in A.   We show that, when combined, hyperrigidity and rigidity at 0 are equivalent to a somewhat stronger notion of hyperrigidity, and we connect this to the unique extension property. This, however, is not the case for the generating set \mathcal{E}. More precisely, we show that for any graph G, subsets of the Cuntz-Krieger family generating \mathcal{O}(G) are rigid at 0 if and only if they contain every vertex projection.
