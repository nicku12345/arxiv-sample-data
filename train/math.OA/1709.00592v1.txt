In this monograph we undertake a comprehensive study of separable representations (as well as their unitary equivalence classes) of C^*-algebras associated to strongly connected finite k-graphs \Lambda. We begin with the representations associated to the \Lambda-semibranching function systems introduced by Farsi, Gillaspy, Kang, and Packer in \cite{FGKP}, by giving an alternative characterization of these systems which is more easily verified in examples. We present a variety of such examples, one of which we use to construct a new faithful separable representation of any row-finite source-free k-graph. Next, we analyze the monic representations of C^*-algebras of finite k-graphs. We completely characterize these representations, generalizing results of Dutkay and Jorgensen \cite{dutkay-jorgensen-monic} and Bezuglyi and Jorgensen \cite{bezuglyi-jorgensen} for Cuntz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras respectively. We also describe a universal representation for non-negative monic representations of finite, strongly connected k-graphs. To conclude, we characterize the purely atomic and permutative representations of k-graph C^*-algebras, and discuss the relationship between these representations and the classes of representations introduced earlier.
