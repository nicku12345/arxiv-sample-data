We study distinguished subalgebras and automorphisms of boundary quotients arising from algebraic dynamical systems (G,P,\theta). Our work includes a complete solution to the problem of extending Bogolubov automorphisms from the Cuntz algebra in 2 \leq p<\infty generators to the p-adic ring C^*-algebra. For the case where P is abelian and C^*(G) is a maximal abelian subalgebra, we establish a picture for the automorphisms of the boundary quotient that fix C^*(G) pointwise. This allows us to show that they form a maximal abelian subgroup of the entire automorphism group. The picture also leads to the surprising outcome that, for integral dynamics, every automorphism that fixes one of the natural Cuntz subalgebras pointwise is necessarily a gauge automorphism. Many of the automorphisms we consider are shown to be outer.
