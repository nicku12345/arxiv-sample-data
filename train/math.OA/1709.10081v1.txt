We introduce a class of recursive subhomogeneous algebras that we call diagonal subhomogeneous and we give a notion of diagonal maps between these algebras. We show that any simple limit of diagonal subhomogeneous algebras with diagonal maps has stable rank one. As an application we show that for any minimal homeomorphism of a compact Hausdorff space the associated crossed product has stable rank one.
