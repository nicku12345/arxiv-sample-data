For a number of properties of C*-algebras, including real rank zero, stable rank one, pure infiniteness, residual hereditary infiniteness, the combination of pure infiniteness and the ideal property, the property of being an AT algebra with real rank zero, and stability under tensoring with a strongly selfabsorbing C*-algebra, we prove the following. Consider an arbitrary action of a second countable compact abelian group on a separable C*-algebra. Then the fixed point algebra under the action has the given property if and only if the crossed product has the same property.
