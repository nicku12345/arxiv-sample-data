Let A be the inductive limit of a sequence A_1\, \xrightarrow{\phi_{1,2}} \,A_2\,\xrightarrow{\phi_{2,3}} \,A_3\rightarrow\cdots with A_n=\oplus_{i=1}^{n_i}A_{[n,i]}, where all the A_{[n,i]} are Elliott-Thomsen algebras and \phi_{n,n+1} are homomorphisms, in this paper, we will prove that A can be written as another inductive limit B_1\,\xrightarrow{\psi_{1,2}} \,B_2\,\xrightarrow{\psi_{2,3}} \,B_3\rightarrow\cdots with B_n=\oplus_{i=1}^{n_i}B_{[n,i]}, where all the B_{[n,i]} are Elliott-Thomsen building blocks and with the extra condition that all the \phi_{n,n+1} are injective.
