A continuous groupoid homomorphism c on a locally compact second countable Hausdorff \'etale groupoid \mathcal{G} gives rise to a C^{*}-dynamical system in which every \beta-KMS state can be associated to a e^{-\beta c}-quasi-invariant measure \mu on \mathcal{G}^{(0)}. Letting \Delta_{\mu} denote the set of KMS states associated to such a \mu, we will prove that \Delta_{\mu} is a simplex for a large class of groupoids, and we will show that there is an abelian group that acts transitively and freely on the extremal points of \Delta_{\mu}. This group can be described using the support of \mu, so our theory of symmetries can be used to obtain a description of all KMS states by describing the e^{-\beta c}-quasi-invariant measures. To illustrate this we will describe the KMS states for the Cuntz-Krieger algebras of all finite higher rank graphs without sources and a large class of continuous one-parameter groups.
