Let P \subset \mathbb{R}^{d} be a closed convex cone. Assume that P is pointed, i.e. the intersection P \cap -P=\{0\} and P is spanning, i.e. P-P=\mathbb{R}^{d}. Denote the interior of P by \Omega. Let E be a product system over \Omega. We show that there exists an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space \mathcal{H} and a semigroup \alpha:=\{\alpha_x\}_{x \in P} of unital normal *-endomorphisms of B(\mathcal{H}) such that E is isomorphic to the product system associated to \alpha.
