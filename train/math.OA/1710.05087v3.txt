In this paper, we study the partial bi-free S-transform of a pair (a,b) of random variables, and the S-transform of the 2\times 2 matrix-valued random variable \left(\begin{matrix}a&0\\0&b\end{matrix}\right) associated with (a,b) when restricted to upper triangular 2\times 2 matrices. We first derive an explicit expression of bi-free multiplicative convolution (of probability measures on the bi-unit-sphere \mathbb{T}^2 of \mathbb{C}^2, or on \mathbb{R}^2_+ in \mathbb{C}^2) from a subordination equation for bi-free multiplicative convolution. We then show that, when (a_1, b_1) and (a_2,b_2) are bi-free, the S-transforms of X_1=\left(\begin{matrix}a_1&0\\0&b_1\end{matrix}\right), X_2=\left(\begin{matrix}a_2&0\\0&b_2\end{matrix}\right) satisfy Dykema's twisted multiplicative equation for free operator-valued random variables if and only if at least one of the two partial bi-free S-transforms of the pairs of random variables is the constant function 1 in a neighborhood of (0,0). This is the case if and only if one of the two pairs, say (a_1,b_1), has factoring two-band moments (that is, \varphi(a_1^mb_1^n)=\varphi(a_1^m)\varphi(b_1^n), for all m,n=1, 2, \cdots). We thus find tons of bi-free pairs of random variables to which the S-transforms of the corresponding matrix-value random variables do not satisfy Dykema's twisted multiplicative formula. Finally, if both (a_1,b_1) and (a_2,b_2) have factoring two-band moments, we prove that the \Psi-transforms of X_1, X_2, and X_1X_2 satisfy a subordination equation.
