Let \Gamma^{+} be the positive cone of a totally ordered abelian discrete group \Gamma, and \alpha an action of \Gamma^{+} by extendible endomorphisms of a C^*-algebra A. We prove that the partial-isometric crossed product A\times_{\alpha}^{\textrm{piso}}\Gamma^{+} is a full corner of a group crossed product \mathcal{B}\times_{\beta}\Gamma, where \mathcal{B} is a subalgebra of \ell^{\infty}(\Gamma,A) generated by a collection of faithful copies of A, and the action \beta on \mathcal{B} is induced by shift on \ell^{\infty}(\Gamma,A). We then use this realization to show that A\times_{\alpha}^{\textrm{piso}}\Gamma^{+} has an essential ideal J, which is a full corner in an ideal \mathcal{I}\times_{\beta}\Gamma of \mathcal{B}\times_{\beta}\Gamma.
