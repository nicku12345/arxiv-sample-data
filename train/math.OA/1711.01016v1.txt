We compute the semiflat positive cone K_0^{+SF}(A_\theta^\sigma) of the K_0-group of the irrational rotation orbifold A_\theta^\sigma under the noncommutative Fourier transform \sigma and show that it is determined by classes of positive trace and the vanishing of two topological invariants. The semiflat orbifold projections are 3-dimensional and come in three basic topological genera: (2,0,0), (1,1,2), (0,0,2). (A projection is called semiflat when it has the form h + \sigma(h) where h is a flip-invariant projection such that h\sigma(h)=0.) Among other things, we also show that every number in (0,1) \cap (2\mathbb Z + 2\mathbb Z\theta) is the trace of a semiflat projection in A_\theta. The noncommutative Fourier transform is the order 4 automorphism \sigma: V \to U \to V^{-1} (and the flip is \sigma^2: U \to U^{-1},\ V \to V^{-1}), where U,V are the canonical unitary generators of the rotation algebra A_\theta satisfying VU = e^{2\pi i\theta} UV.
