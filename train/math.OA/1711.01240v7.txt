We study a class of stably projectionless simple C*-algebras which may be viewed as having generalized tracial rank one in analogy with the unital case. Some structural question concerning these simple C*-algebras are studied. The paper also serves as a technical support for the classification of separable stably projectionless simple amenable Jiang-Su stable C*-algebras.
