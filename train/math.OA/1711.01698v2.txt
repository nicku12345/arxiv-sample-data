Given a finitely aligned k-graph \Lambda, we let \Lambda^i denote the (k-1)-graph formed by removing all edges of degree e_i from \Lambda. We show that the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger algebra of \Lambda, denoted by \mathcal{T}C^*(\Lambda), may be realised as the Toeplitz algebra of a Hilbert \mathcal{T}C^*(\Lambda^i)-bimodule. When \Lambda is locally-convex, we show that the Cuntz-Krieger algebra of \Lambda, which we denote by C^*(\Lambda), may be realised as the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of a Hilbert C^*(\Lambda^i)-bimodule. Consequently, \mathcal{T}C^*(\Lambda) and C^*(\Lambda) may be viewed as iterated Toeplitz and iterated Cuntz-Pimsner algebras over c_0(\Lambda^0) respectively.
