We define a notion of quantum automorphism group of Graph C*-algebras for finite, connected graphs. Under the assumption that the underlying graph does not have any multiple edge or loop, the quantum automorphism group of underlying directed graph in the sense of T. banica is shown to be a quantum subgroup of quantum automorphism group in our sense. Quantum symmetries for some concrete graph C*-algebras have been computed.
