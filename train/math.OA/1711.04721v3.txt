Let A be a separable, unital, simple C*-algebra with stable rank one. We show that every strictly positive, lower semicontinuous, affine function on the simplex of normalized quasitraces of A is realized as the rank of an operator in the stabilization of A.   Assuming moreover that A has locally finite nuclear dimension, we deduce that A is \mathcal{Z}-stable if and only if it has strict comparison of positive elements. In particular, the Toms-Winter conjecture holds for separable, unital, simple, approximately subhomogeneous C*-algebras with stable rank one.
