Let \theta, \theta' be irrational numbers and A, B be matrices in SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) of infinite order. We compute the K-theory of the crossed product \mathcal{A}_{\theta}\rtimes_A \mathbb{Z} and show that \mathcal{A}_{\theta} \rtimes_A\mathbb{Z} and \mathcal{A}_{\theta'} \rtimes_B \mathbb{Z} are *-isomorphic if and only if \theta = \pm\theta' \pmod{\mathbb{Z}} and I-A^{-1} is matrix equivalent to I-B^{-1}. Combining this result and an explicit construction of equivariant bimodules, we show that \mathcal{A}_{\theta} \rtimes_A\mathbb{Z} and \mathcal{A}_{\theta'} \rtimes_B \mathbb{Z} are Morita equivalent if and only if \theta and \theta' are in the same GL_2(\mathbb{Z}) orbit and I-A^{-1} is matrix equivalent to I-B^{-1}. Finally, we determine the Morita equivalence class of \mathcal{A}_{\theta} \rtimes F for any finite subgroup F of SL_2(\mathbb{Z}).
