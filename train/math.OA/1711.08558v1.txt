This is an expository note focused upon one example, the irrational rotation C^*-algebra. We discuss how this algebra arises in nature - in quantum mechanics, group actions, and foliations, and we explain how K-theory is used to get information out of it.   Our goal is to write as if we are sitting in Starbucks and explaining an idea to a good friend (on napkins, of course). So we are interested in getting an idea across but not at all interested in the technical details that, in any event, would be lost if the coffee spilled. So come with us for a drink at Starbucks!
