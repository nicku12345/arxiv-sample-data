Let A be a C*^-algebra. Given a representation A\subset B(L) in a Hilbert space L, the set G^+\subset A of positive invertible elements can be thought as the set of inner products in L, related to A, which are equivalent to the original inner product. The set G^+ has a rich geometry, it is a homogeneous space of the invertible group G of A, with an invariant Finsler metric. In the present paper we study the tangent bundle TG^+ of G^+, as a homogenous Finsler space of a natural group of invertible matrices in M_2(A), identifying TG^+ with the {\it Poincar\'e halfspace} H of A,  H=\{h\in A: Im(h)\ge 0, Im(h) \hbox{ invertible}\}.  We show that \h\simeq TG^+ has properties similar to those of a space of non-positive constant curvature.
