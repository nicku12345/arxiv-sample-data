We define a measure of noncompactness \lambda on the standard Hilbert C^*-module l^2(\mathcal A) over a unital C^*-algebra, such that \lambda(E)=0 if and only if E is \mathcal A-precompact (i.e.\ it is \varepsilon-close to a finitely generated projective submodule for any \varepsilon>0) and derive its properties. Further, we consider the known, Kuratowski, Hausdorff and Istr\u{a}\c{t}escu measure of noncomapctnes on l^2(\mathcal A) regarded as a locally convex space with respect to a suitable topology, and obtain their properties as well as some relationship between them and introduced measure of noncompactness \lambda.
