A one-sided shift of finite type (X_A,\sigma_A) determines on the one hand a Cuntz-Krieger algebra \mathcal{O}_A with a distinguished abelian subalgebra \mathcal{D}_A and a certain completely positive map \tau_A on \mathcal{O}_A. On the other hand, (X_A,\sigma_A) determines a groupoid \mathcal{G}_A together with a certain homomorphism \epsilon_A on \mathcal{G}_A. We show that this data completely characterizes the one-sided conjugacy class of X_A. This strengthens a result of Cuntz and Krieger. We also exhibit an example of two irreducible shifts of finite type which are eventually conjugate but not conjugate. This answers a question of Matsumoto of whether eventual conjugacy implies conjugacy in the negative.
