We show that the UCT problem for separable, nuclear \mathrm C^*-algebras relies only on whether the UCT holds for crossed products of certain finite cyclic group actions on the Razak-Jacelon algebra. This observation is analogous to and in fact recovers a characterization of the UCT problem in terms of finite group actions on the Cuntz algebra \mathcal O_2 established in previous work by the authors. Although based on a similar approach, the new conceptual ingredients in the finite context are the recent advances in the classification of stably projectionless \mathrm C^*-algebras, as well as a known characterization of the UCT problem in terms of certain tracially AF \mathrm C^*-algebras due to Dadarlat.
