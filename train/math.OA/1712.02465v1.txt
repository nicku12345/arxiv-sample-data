In this paper, we develop the notion of free-Boolean independence in an amalgamation setting. We construct free-Boolean cumulants and show that the vanishing of mixed free-Boolean cumulants is equivalent to our free-Boolean independence with amalgamation. We also provide a characterization of free-Boolean independence by conditions in terms of mixed moments. In addition, we study free-Boolean independence over a C^*-algebra and prove a positivity property.
