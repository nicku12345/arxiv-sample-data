Any oriented Riemannian manifold with a Spin-structure defines a spectral triple, so the spectral triple can be regarded as a noncommutative Spin-manifold. Otherwise for any unoriented Riemannian manifold there is the two-fold covering by oriented Riemannian manifold. Moreover there are noncommutative generalizations of finite-fold coverings. This circumstances yield a notion of unoriented spectral triple which is covered by oriented one.
