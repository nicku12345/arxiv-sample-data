We first construct a real family of SL(2,\mathbb{R})-invariant symbol composition product \{\sharp_\theta\}_{\theta\in,\mathbb{R}} on the analogue of the Schwartz space S(\mathbb{D}) on the hyperbolic plane \mathbb{D}\;:=\;SL(2,\mathbb{R})/SO(2). The value \theta=0 consists in the pointwise commutative product of functions on \mathbb{D}. And admits an asymptotic expansion that deforms the pointwise product in the direction of the canonical SL(2,\mathbb{R}) -invariant Kahler two form on \mathbb{D}.   We then extend this construction to any (non-homogeneous) compact surface by considering the left action of an arithmetic Fuschian group \Gamma\subset SL(2,\mathbb{R}) on \mathbb{D} with associated Riemann surface \Sigma_\Gamma\;:=\;\Gamma\backslash\mathbb{D}. More precisely, the product \sharp_\theta extends from S(\mathbb{D}) to a smooth SL(2,\mathbb{R})- sub-module of C^\infty(\mathbb{D}) that contains the \Gamma-invariants C^\infty(\mathbb{D})^\Gamma\simeq C^\infty(\Sigma_\Gamma) in C^\infty(\mathbb{D}). In particular, \sharp_\theta defines a Fr\'echet algebra structure on C^\infty(\Sigma_\Gamma). The resulting algebra is pre - C^\ast and admits a continuous trace.
