Let M and N be arbitrary von Neumann algebras. For any a in M or in N, let \Delta_{\lambda}(a) denote the \lambda-Aluthge transform of a. Suppose that M has no abelian direct summand. We prove that every bijective map \Phi:M\to N satisfying \Phi(\Delta_{\lambda}(a\circ b^*))=\Delta_{\lambda}(\Phi(a) \circ \Phi(b)^*), \hbox{ for all } a,\;b\in M, (for a fixed \lambda\in [0,1]), maps the hermitian part of M onto the hermitian part of N (i.e. \Phi (M_{sa}) = N_{sa}) and its restriction \Phi|_{M_{sa}} : M_{sa}\to N_{sa} is a Jordan isomorphism. If we also assume that \Phi (x +i y ) = \Phi (x) +\Phi (i y) for all x,y\in M_{sa}, then there exists a central projection p_c in M such that \Phi|_{p_c M} is a complex linear Jordan ^*-isomorphism and \Phi|_{(\textbf{1}-p_c) M} is a conjugate linear Jordan ^*-isomorphism.   Given two complex Hilbert spaces H and K with dim(H)\geq 2, we also establish that every bijection \Phi: \mathcal{B}(H)\to \mathcal{B}(K) satisfying \Phi(\Delta_{\lambda}(a b^*))=\Delta_{\lambda}(\Phi(a) \Phi(b)^*), \hbox{ for all } a,\;b\in \mathcal{B}(H), must be a complex linear or a conjugate linear ^*-isomorphism.
