Categories of paths are a generalization of several kinds of oriented discrete data that have been used to construct C^*-algebras. The techniques introduced to study these constructions apply almost verbatim to the more general situation of left cancellative small categories. We develop this theory and derive the structure of the C^*-algebras in the most general situation. We analyze the regular representation, and the Wiener-Hopf algebra in the case of a subcategory of a groupoid.
