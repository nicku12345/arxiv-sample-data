In this paper, we introduce a notion of a self-similar action of a group G on a k-graph \Lambda, and associate it a universal C*-algebra \O_{G,\Lambda}. We prove that \O_{G,\Lambda} can be realized as the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of a product system. If G is amenable and the action is pseudo free, then \O_{G,\Lambda} is shown to be isomorphic to a "path-like" groupoid C*-algebra. This facilitates studying the properties of \O_{G,\Lambda}. We show that \O_{G,\Lambda} is always nuclear and satisfies the Universal Coefficient Theorem; we characterize the simplicity of \O_{G,\Lambda} in terms of the underlying action; and we prove that, whenever \O_{G,\Lambda} is simple, there is a dichotomy: it is either stably finite or purely infinite, depending on whether \Lambda has nonzero graph traces or not. Our main results generalize the recent work of Exel and Pardo on self-similar graphs.
