For each 1\le p<\infty and each countable oriented graph Q we introduce an L^p-operator algebra \mathcal{O}^p(Q) which contains the Leavitt path \mathbb{C}-algebra L_Q as a dense subalgebra and is universal for those L^p-representations of L_Q which are spatial in the sense of N.C. Phillips. For \mathcal{R}_n the graph with one vertex and n loops (2\le n\le \infty), \mathcal{O}^p(\mathcal{R}_n)=\mathcal{O}^p_n, the L^p-Cuntz algebra introduced by Phillips. If p\notin\{1,2\} and \mathcal{S}(Q) is the inverse semigroup generated by Q, \mathcal{O}^p(Q)=F_{\operatorname{tight}}^p(\mathcal{S}(Q)) is the tight semigroup L^p-operator algebra introduced by Gardella and Lupini. We prove that \mathcal{O}^p(Q) is simple as an L^p-operator algebra if and only if L_Q is simple, and that in this case it is isometrically isomorphic to the closure \overline{\rho(L_Q)} of the image of any nonzero spatial L^p-representation \rho:L_Q\to\mathscr{L}(L^p(X)). We also show that if L_Q is purely infinite simple and p\ne p', then there is no nonzero continuous homomorphism \mathcal{O}^p(Q)\to\mathcal{O}^{p'}(Q). Our results generalize those obtained by Phillips for L^p-Cuntz algebras.
