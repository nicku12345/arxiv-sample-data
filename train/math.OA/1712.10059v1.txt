Let the groupoid G with unit space G^0 act via a representation \rho on a C^*-correspondence {\mathcal H} over the C_0(G^0)-algebra A. By the universal property, G acts on the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H} which becomes a C_0(G^0)-algebra. The action of G commutes with the gauge action on {\mathcal O}_{{\mathcal H}}, therefore G acts also on the core algebra {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H}^{\mathbb T}.   We study the crossed product {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H}\rtimes G and the fixed point algebra {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H}^G and obtain similar results as in \cite{D}, where G was a group. Under certain conditions, we prove that {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H}\rtimes G\cong {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H\rtimes G}, where \mathcal H\rtimes G is the crossed product C^*-correspondence and that {\mathcal O}_{\mathcal H}^G\cong{\mathcal O}_\rho, where {\mathcal O}_\rho is the Doplicher-Roberts algebra defined using intertwiners.   The motivation of this paper comes from groupoid actions on graphs. Suppose G with compact isotropy acts on a discrete locally finite graph E with no sources. Since C^*(G) is strongly Morita equivalent to a commutative C^*-algebra, we prove that the crossed product C^*(E)\rtimes G is stably isomorphic to a graph algebra. We illustrate with some examples.
