We introduce a class of unitarily invariant, locally \|\cdot\|_1-dominating, mutually continuous norms with repect to \tau on a von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M} with a faithful, normal, semifinite tracial weight \tau. We prove a Beurling-Chen-Hadwin-Shen theorem for H^\infty-invariant spaces of L^\alpha(\mathcal{M},\tau), where \alpha is a unitarily invariant, locally \|\cdot\|_1-dominating, mutually continuous norm with respect to \tau, and H^\infty is an extension of Arveson's noncommutative Hardy space. We use our main result to characterize the H^\infty-invariant subspaces of a noncommutative Banach function space \mathcal I(\tau) with the norm \|\cdot\|_{E } on \mathcal{M}, the crossed product of a semifinite von Neumann algebra by an action \beta, and B(\mathcal{H}) for a separable Hilbert space \mathcal{H}.
