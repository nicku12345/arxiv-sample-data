In the current paper, we generalize the "compact operator" part of the Voiculescu's non-commutative Weyl-von Neumann theorem on approximate equivalence of unital *-homomorphisms of an commutative C^* algebra \mathcal{A} into a semifinite von Neumann algebra. A result of D. Hadwin for approximate summands of representations into a finite von Neumann factor \mathcal{R} is also extended.
