We study conditions that ensure uniqueness theorems of Cuntz-Krieger type for relative Cuntz-Pimsner algebras \mathcal{O}(J,X) associated to a C^*-correspondence X over a C^*-algebra A. We give general sufficient conditions phrased in terms of a multivalued map \widehat{X} acting on the spectrum \widehat{A} of A. When X(J) is of Type I we construct a directed graph dual to X and prove a uniqueness theorem using this graph. When X(J) is liminal, we show that topological freeness of this graph is equivalent to the uniqueness property for \mathcal{O}(J,X), as well as to an algebraic condition, which we call J-acyclicity of X.   As an application we improve the Fowler-Raeburn uniqueness theorem for the Toeplitz algebra \mathcal{T}_X. We give new simplicity criteria for \mathcal{O}_X. We generalize and enhance uniqueness results for relative quiver C^*-algebras of Muhly and Tomforde. We also discuss applications to crossed products by endomorphisms.
