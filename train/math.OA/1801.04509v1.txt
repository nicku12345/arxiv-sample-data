A sequence of scalars is said to be admissible for a positive operator A on a Hilbert space if it is the diagonal of VAV* for some partial isometry V having as domain the closure of the range of A. When A is a projection, the celebrated Kadison's carpenter theorem provides a sufficient condition for a sequence to be admissible for A. We prove that the same condition is sufficient for the sequence to be admissible for A when A is a sum of projections (converging in the SOT). This provides an independent proof of Kadison's carpenter theorem.
