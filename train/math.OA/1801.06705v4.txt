We identify all closed Lie ideals of A \otimes^{\alpha} B and B(H) \otimes^{\alpha} B(H), where \otimes^{\alpha} is either the Haagerup tensor product, the Banach space projective tensor product or the operator space projective tensor product, A is any simple C*-algebra, B is any C*-algebra with one of them admitting no tracial states, and H is an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space. Further, generalizing a result of Marcoux, we also identify all closed Lie ideals of A\otimes^{\min} B, where A is a simple C*-algebra with at most one tracial state and B is any commutative C*-algebra.
