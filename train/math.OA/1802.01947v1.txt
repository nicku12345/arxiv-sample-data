In this paper, firstly we investigate conditions under which the action of an operator on a K-frame, remain again a K-frame for Hilbert module E. We also give a generalization of Douglas Theorem and we shall use it to prove the sum of two K-frame under certain condition is again a K-frame. Finally, we characterize the K-frame generators for a unitary system in terms of operators.
