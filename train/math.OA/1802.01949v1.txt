In this note, a general version of Bessel multipliers in Hilbert C^*-modules is presented and then, many results obtained for multipliers are extended. Also the conditions for invertibility of generalized multipliers are investigated in details. The invertibility of multipliers is very important because it helps us to obtain more reconstruction formula.
