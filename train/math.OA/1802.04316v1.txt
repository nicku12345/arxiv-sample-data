In this paper we generalize the result valid for associative rings due \cite[Martindale III]{Mart} and \cite[Bre\check{s}ar]{bresar} to alternative rings. Let \mathfrak{R} be an unital alternative ring, and \mathfrak{D}: \mathfrak{R} \rightarrow \mathfrak{R} is a Lie multiplicative derivation. Then \mathfrak{D} is the form \delta + \tau where \delta is an additive derivation of \mathfrak{R} and \tau is a map from \mathfrak{R} into its center \mathcal{Z}(\mathfrak{R}), which maps commutators into the zero.
