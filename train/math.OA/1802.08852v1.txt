We introduce weighted cb maps and \Lambda_\mu-cb maps on operator spaces which are generalizations of completely bounded maps and a certain class of bilinear maps on operator spaces which we call \lambda_\mu-cb bilinear maps. Some basic properties of these maps and an operator space tensor product associated to \lambda_\mu-cb bilinear maps have been studied.
