We demonstrate von Neumann algebra arising from an icc group \Gamma in Chifan's, Ioana's, and Kida's class of poly-\mathcal{C}_\text{rss} , such as a poly-hyperbolic group with no amenable factors in its composition series, satisfies the following rigidity phenomenon discovered in DHI16 (see also CdSS17): every tensor decomposition of the II_1 factor L(\Gamma)  must arise from direct product decomposition of \Gamma  by groups which are poly- \mathcal{C}_\text{rss}. Through heavy usage and developments of the techniques in CdSS15, we improve the second author's and their collaborator's work in CKP14 by providing group-level criteria for determining whether a group von Neumann algebra is prime: L(\Gamma)  is prime precisely when the group is indecomposable as a direct product of non-amenable groups. We further demonstrate that all tensor decompositions of finite index subalgebras of L(\Gamma)  correspond to a splitting of \Gamma  as a product by groups which are also poly-\mathcal{C}_\text{rss} up to commensurability.
