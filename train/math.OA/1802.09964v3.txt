We prove that any free cocycle action of a countable amenable group \Gamma on any II_1 factor N can be perturbed by inner automorphisms to a genuine action. This {\em vanishing cohomology} property, that we call \mathcal V\mathcal C, is also closed to free products with amalgamation over finite groups. But beyond this no other examples of \mathcal V\mathcal C-groups are known. In turn, by considering special cocycle actions \Gamma \curvearrowright N in the case N is the hyperfinite II_1 factor R, respectively the free group factor N=L(\Bbb F_\infty), we exclude many groups from being \mathcal V\mathcal C. We also show that any free action \Gamma \curvearrowright R gives rise to a free cocycle \Gamma-action on the II_1 factor R'\cap R^\omega whose vanishing cohomology is equivalent to Connes' Approximate Embedding property for the II_1 factor R\rtimes \Gamma.
