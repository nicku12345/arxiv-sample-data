We construct projective limit of projective sequence in the following categories: Archimedean order unit spaces with unital positive maps and operator systems with unital completely positive maps. We prove that inductive limit and projective limit in these categories are in duality, provided that the dual objects remain in the same categories and the maps are order embeddings. We generalize a result of Choi and Effros on matrix-ordered duals of finite-dimensional operator systems to separable case.
