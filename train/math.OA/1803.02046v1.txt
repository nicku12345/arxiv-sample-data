Let \mathcal R be a ring, \mathcal{M} be a \mathcal R-bimodule and m,n be two fixed nonnegative integers with m+n\neq0. An additive mapping \delta from \mathcal R into \mathcal{M} is called an \emph{(m,n)-Jordan derivation} if (m+n)\delta(A^{2})=2mA\delta(A)+2n\delta(A)A for every A in \mathcal R. In this paper, we prove that every (m,n)-Jordan derivation from a C^{*}-algebra into its Banach bimodule is zero. An additive mapping \delta from \mathcal R into \mathcal{M} is called a (m,n)-Jordan derivable mapping at W in \mathcal R if (m+n)\delta(AB+BA)=2m\delta(A)B+2m\delta(B)A+2nA\delta(B)+2nB\delta(A) for each A and B in \mathcal R with AB=BA=W. We prove that if \mathcal{M} is a unital \mathcal A-bimodule with a left (right) separating set generated algebraically by all idempotents in \mathcal A, then every (m,n)-Jordan derivable mapping at zero from \mathcal A into \mathcal{M} is identical with zero. We also show that if \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{B} are two unital algebras, \mathcal{M} is a faithful unital (\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})-bimodule and \mathcal{U}={\left[\begin{array}{cc}\mathcal{A} &\mathcal{M} \\\mathcal{N} & \mathcal{B} \\\end{array}\right]} is a generalized matrix algebra, then every (m,n)-Jordan derivable mapping at zero from \mathcal{U} into itself is equal to zero.
