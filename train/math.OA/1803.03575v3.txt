This paper is the first part of a two-paper series whose aim is to give a thorough account on Connes' pseudodifferential calculus on noncommutative tori. This pseudodifferential calculus has been used in numerous recent papers, but a detailed description is still missing. In this paper, we focus on constructing an oscillating integral for noncommutative tori and laying down the main functional analysis ground for understanding Connes' pseudodifferential calculus. In particular, this allows us to give a precise explanation of the definition of pseudodifferential operators on noncommutative tori. More generally, this paper introduces the main technical tools that are used in the 2nd part of the series to derive the main properties of these operators. In addition, we establish the equivalence between our class of operators and the toroidal pseudo differential operators considered by other authors.
