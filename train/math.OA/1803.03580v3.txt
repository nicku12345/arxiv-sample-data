This paper is the 2nd part of a two-paper series whose aim is to give a detailed description of Connes' pseudodifferential calculus on noncommutative n-tori, n\geq 2. We make use of the tools introduced in the 1st part to deal with the main properties of pseudodifferential operators on noncommutative tori of any dimension n\geq 2. This includes the main results mentioned in the original notes of Connes and Baaj. We also obtain further results regarding action on Sobolev spaces, spectral theory of elliptic operators, and Schatten-class properties of pseudodifferential operators of negative order, including a trace-formula for pseudodifferential operators of order <-n.
