Starting with a left ideal J of L^1(G) we consider its annihilator J^{\perp} in L^{\infty}(G) and the generated {\rm VN}(G)-bimodule in \mathcal{B}(L^2(G)), {\rm Bim}(J^{\perp}). We prove that {\rm Bim}(J^{\perp})=({\rm Ran} J)^{\perp} when G is weakly amenable discrete, compact or abelian, where {\rm Ran} J is a suitable saturation of J in the trace class. We define jointly harmonic functions and jointly harmonic operators and show that, for these classes of groups, the space of jointly harmonic operators is the {\rm VN}(G)-bimodule generated by the space of jointly harmonic functions. Using this, we give a proof of the following result of Izumi and Jaworski - Neufang: the non-commutative Poisson boundary is isomorphic to the crossed product of the space of harmonic functions by G.
