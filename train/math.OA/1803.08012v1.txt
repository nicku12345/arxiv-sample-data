We give a notion of quantum automorphism group of graph C*-algebras without sink at critical inverse temperature. This is defined to be the universal object of a category of CQG's having a linear action in the sense of [11] and preserving the KMS state at critical inverse temperature. We show that this category for a certain KMS state at critical inverse temperature coincides with the category introduced in [11] for a class of graphs. We also introduce an orthogonal filtration on Cuntz algebra with respect to the unique KMS state and show that the category of CQG's preserving the orthogonal filtration coincides with the category introduced in this paper.
