Let P \subset A be an inclusion of \sigma-unital C*-algebras with a finite index in the sense of Izumi. Then we introduce the Rokhlin property for a conditional expectation E from A onto P and show that if A is simple and satisfies any of the property (1) \sim (12) listed in the below, and E has the Rokhlin property, then so does P.   (1) Simplicity;(2) Nuclearity;(3) C*-algebras that absorb a given strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra \mathcal{D}; (4)C*-algebras of stable rank one; (5) C*-algebras of real rank zero;(6) C*-algebras of nuclear dimension at most n, where n \in Z^+; (7)C*-algebras of decomposition rank at most n, where n \in Z^+; (8) Separable simple C*-algebras that are stably isomorphic to AF algebras; (9) Separable simple C*-algebras that are stably isomorphic to AI algebras; (10) Separable simple C*-algebras that are stably isomorphic to AT algebras; (11) Separable simple C*-algebras that are stably isomorphic to sequential direct limits of one dimensional NCCW complexes; (12) Separable C*-algebras with strict comparison of positive elements. In particular, when \alpha : G \rightarrow \rm{Aut}(A) is an action of a finite group G on A with the Rokhlin property in the sense of Nawata, the properties (1) \sim (12) are inherited to the fixed point algebra A^\alpha and the crossed product algebra A \rtimes_\alpha G from A.
