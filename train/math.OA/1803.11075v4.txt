Nicolas Monod introduced the class of groups with the fixed-point property for cones, characterized by always admitting a non-zero fixed point whenever acting (suitably) on proper weakly complete cones. He proved that his class of groups contains the class of groups with subexponential growth and is contained in the class of supramenable groups. In this paper we investigate what Monod's results say about the existence of invariant traces on (typically non-unital) C*-algebras equipped with an action of a group with the fixed-point property for cones. As an application of these results we provide results on the existence (and non-existence) of traces on the (non-uniform) Roe algebra.
