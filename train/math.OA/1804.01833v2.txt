The notion of permutative representation is generalized to the 2-adic ring C^*-algebra \mathcal{Q}_{2}. Permutative representations of \mathcal{Q}_2 are then investigated with a particular focus on the inclusion of the Cuntz algebra \mathcal{O}_2\subset\mathcal{Q}_2. Notably, every permutative representation of \mathcal{O}_2 is shown to extend automatically to a permutative representation of \mathcal{Q}_2 provided that an extension whatever exists. Moreover, all permutative extensions of a given representation of \mathcal{O}_2 are proved to be unitarily equivalent to one another. Irreducible permutative representations of \mathcal{Q}_2 are classified in terms of irreducible permutative representations of the Cuntz algebra. Apart from the canonical representation of \mathcal{Q}_2, every irreducible representation of \mathcal{Q}_2 is the unique extension of an irreducible permutative representation of \mathcal{O}_2. Furthermore, a permutative representation of \mathcal{Q}_2 will decompose into a direct sum of irreducible permutative subrepresentations if and only if it restricts to \mathcal{O}_2 as a regular representation in the sense of Bratteli-Jorgensen. As a result, a vast class of pure states of \mathcal{O}_2 is shown to enjoy the unique pure extension property with respect to the inclusion \mathcal{O}_2\subset\mathcal{Q}_2.
