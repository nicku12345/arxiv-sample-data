In this paper, we establish a connection between Rokhlin dimension and the absorption of certain model actions on strongly self-absorbing C*-algebras. Namely, as to be made precise in the paper, let G be a well-behaved locally compact group. If \mathcal D is a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra, and \alpha: G\curvearrowright A is an action on a separable, \mathcal D-absorbing C*-algebra that has finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers, then \alpha tensorially absorbs every semi-strongly self-absorbing G-actions on \mathcal D. This contains several existing results of similar nature as special cases. We will in fact prove a more general version of this theorem, which is intended for use in subsequent work. We will then discuss some non-trivial applications. Most notably it is shown that for any k\geq 1 and on any strongly self-absorbing Kirchberg algebra, there exists a unique \mathbb R^k-action having finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers up to (very strong) cocycle conjugacy.
