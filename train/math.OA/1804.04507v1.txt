Let E and P be subsets of a Banach space X, and let us define the unit sphere around E in P as the set Sph(E;P) :=\left\{ x\in P : \|x-b\|=1 \hbox{ for all } b\in E \right\}. Given a C^*-algebra A, and a subset E\subset A, we shall write Sph^+ (E) or Sph_A^+ (E) for the set Sph(E;S(A^+)), where S(A^+) stands for the set of all positive operators in the unit sphere of A. We prove that, for an arbitrary complex Hilbert space H, then a positive element a in the unit sphere of B(H) is a projection if and only if Sph^+_{B(H)} \left( Sph^+_{B(H)}(\{a\}) \right) =\{a\}. We also prove that the equivalence remains true when B(H) is replaced with an atomic von Neumann algebra or with K(H_2), where H_2 is an infinite-dimensional and separable complex Hilbert space. In the setting of compact operators we prove a stronger conclusion by showing that the identity Sph^+_{K(H_2)} \left( Sph^+_{K(H_2)}(a) \right) =\left\{ b\in S(K(H_2)^+) : \!\! \begin{array}{c} s_{_{K(H_2)}} (a) \leq s_{_{K(H_2)}} (b), \hbox{ and } \textbf{1}-r_{_{B(H_2)}}(a)\leq \textbf{1}-r_{_{B(H_2)}}(b) \end{array}\!\! \right\}, holds for every a in the unit sphere of K(H_2)^+, where r_{_{B(H_2)}}(a) and s_{_{K(H_2)}} (a) stand for the range and support projections of a in B(H_2) and K(H_2), respectively.
