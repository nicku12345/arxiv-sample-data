I show that quasidiagonality and AF embeddability are equivalent properties for traceless \mathrm C^\ast-algebras and are characterised in terms of the primitive ideal space. For nuclear \mathrm C^\ast-algebras the same characterisation determines when Connes and Higson's E-theory can be unsuspended.
