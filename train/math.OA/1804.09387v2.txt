Let A and B be C^*-algebras with A\subseteq M(B). Exploiting the duality between sober spaces and spatial locales, and the adjunction between restriction and induction for ideals in A and B, we identify conditions that allow to define a quasi-orbit space and a quasi-orbit map for A\subseteq M(B). These objects generalise classical notions for group actions. We characterise when the quasi-orbit space is an open quotient of the primitive ideal space of A and when the quasi-orbit map is open and surjective. We apply these results to cross section C^*-algebras of Fell bundles over locally compact groups, regular C^*-inclusions, tensor products, relative Cuntz--Pimsner algebras, and crossed products for actions of locally compact Hausdorff groupoids and quantum groups.
