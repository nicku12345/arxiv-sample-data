Let P be a unital subsemigroup of a group G. We propose an approach to \mathrm{C}^*-algebras associated to product systems over P. We call the \mathrm{C}^*-algebra of a given product system \mathcal{E} its covariance algebra and denote it by A\times_{\mathcal{E}}P, where A is the coefficient \mathrm{C}^*-algebra. We prove that our construction does not depend on the embedding P\hookrightarrow G and that a representation of A\times_{\mathcal{E}}P is faithful on the fixed-point algebra for the canonical coaction of G if and only if it is faithful on A. We compare this with other constructions in the setting of irreversible dynamical systems, such as Cuntz--Nica--Pimsner algebras, Fowler's Cuntz--Pimsner algebra, semigroup \mathrm{C}^*-algebras of Xin Li and Exel's crossed products by interaction groups.
