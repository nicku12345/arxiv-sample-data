We introduce and study a notion of Rokhlin property for an inclusion of unital C^*-algebras which could have no projections like the Jiang-Su algebra. We also introduce a notion of approximate representability and show a duality between them. We demonstrate the importance of these notions by showing the permanence of the tracial \mathcal{Z}-absorbingness and the strict comparison property.
