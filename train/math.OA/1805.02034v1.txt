Let \eta\neq -1 be a non-zero complex number, and let \phi be a not necessarily linear bijection between two von Neumann algebras, one of which has no central abelian projections preserving the Jordan \eta-\ast-n-product. It is showed that \phi is a linear \ast-isomorphism if \eta is not real and \phi is the sum of a linear \ast-isomorphism and a conjugate linear \ast-isomorphism if \eta is real.
