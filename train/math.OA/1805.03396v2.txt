Let A be a unital separable simple C^*-algebra with tracial rank zero and let x, \, y\in A be two normal elements. We show that x is in the closure of the convex full of the unitary obit of y if and only if there exists a sequence of unital completely positive linear maps \phi_n from A to A such that the sequence \phi_n(y) convergent to x in norm and also approximately preserves the trace values. A purely measure theoretical description for normal elements in the closure of convex hull of unitary orbit of y is also given. In the case that A has a unique tracial state some classical results about the closure of the convex hull of the unitary orbits in von Neumann algebras are proved to be hold in C^*-algebras setting.
