We investigate surjective isometries between projection lattices of two von Neumann algebras. We show that such a mapping is characterized by means of Jordan ^*-isomorphisms. In particular, we prove that two von Neumann algebras without type I_1 direct summands are Jordan ^*-isomorphic if and only if their projection lattices are isometric. Our theorem extends the recent result for type I factors by G.P. Geh\'er and P. \v{S}emrl, which is a generalization of Wigner's theorem.
