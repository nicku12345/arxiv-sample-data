In this paper, we prove a non-commutative version of the Weyl-von Neumann theorem for representations of unital, separable AH algebras into countably decomposable, semifinite, properly infinite, von Neumann factors, where an AH algebra means an approximately homogeneous {\rm C}^{\ast}-algebra. We also prove a result for approximate summands of representations of unital, separable AH algebras into finite von Neumann factors.
