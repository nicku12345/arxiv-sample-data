We present an alternative approach to the theory of free Gibbs states with convex potentials. Instead of solving SDE's, we combine PDE techniques with a notion of asymptotic approximability by trace polynomials for a sequence of functions on M_N(\mathbb{C})_{sa}^m to prove the following. Suppose \mu_N is a probability measure on on M_N(\mathbb{C})_{sa}^m given by uniformly convex and semi-concave potentials V_N, and suppose that the sequence DV_N is asymptotically approximable by trace polynomials. Then the moments of \mu_N converge to a non-commutative law \lambda. Moreover, the free entropies \chi(\lambda), \underline{\chi}(\lambda), and \chi^*(\lambda) agree and equal the limit of the normalized classical entropies of \mu_N.
