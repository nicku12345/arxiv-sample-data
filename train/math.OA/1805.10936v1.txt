Let \mathcal M be a factor von Neumann algebra with separable predual and let T\in \mathcal M. We call T an irreducible operator (relative to \mathcal M) if W^*(T) is an irreducible subfactor of \mathcal M, i.e., W^*(T)'\cap \mathcal M={\mathbb C} I. In this note, we show that the set of irreducible operators in \mathcal M is a dense G_\delta subset of \mathcal M in the operator norm. This is a natural generalization of a theorem of Halmos.
