Let D,X \in B(H) be bounded operators on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space H. If the commutator [D,X] = DX-XD lies within \varepsilon in operator norm of the identity operator 1_{B(H)}, then it was observed by Popa that one has the lower bound \| D \| \|X\| \geq \frac{1}{2} \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon} on the product of the operator norms of D,X; this is a quantitative version of the Wintner-Wielandt theorem that 1_{B(H)} cannot be expressed as the commutator of bounded operators. On the other hand, it follows easily from the work of Brown and Pearcy that one can construct examples in which \|D\| \|X\| = O(\varepsilon^{-2}). In this note, we improve the Brown-Pearcy construction to obtain examples of D,X with \| [D,X] - 1_{B(H)} \| \leq \varepsilon and \| D\| \|X\| = O( \log^{5} \frac{1}{\varepsilon} ).
