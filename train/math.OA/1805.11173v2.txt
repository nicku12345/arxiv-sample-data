We develop a framework suitable for obtaining simplicity criteria for reduced C^*-algebras of Hausdorff etale groupoids. This is based on the study of certain non-degenerate C^*-subalgebras (in the case of groupoids, the C^*-algebra of the interior isotropy bundle), for which one can control (non-unique) state extensions to the ambient C*-algebra. As an application, we give simplicity criteria for reduced crossed products of abelian C^*-algebras by discrete groups.
