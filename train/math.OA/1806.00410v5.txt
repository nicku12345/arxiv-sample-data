Given a noncommutative (nc) variety \mathfrak{V} in the nc unit ball \mathfrak{B}_d, we consider the algebra H^\infty(\mathfrak{V}) of bounded nc holomorphic functions on \mathfrak{V}. We investigate the problem of when two algebras H^\infty(\mathfrak{V}) and H^\infty(\mathfrak{W}) are isomorphic. We prove that these algebras are weak-* continuously isomorphic if and only if there is an nc biholomorphism G : \widetilde{\mathfrak{W}} \to \widetilde{\mathfrak{V}} between the similarity envelopes that is bi-Lipschitz with respect to the free pseudo-hyperbolic metric. Moreover, such an isomorphism always has the form f \mapsto f \circ G, where G is an nc biholomorphism. These results also shed some new light on automorphisms of the noncommutative analytic Toeplitz algebras H^\infty(\mathfrak{B}_d) studied by Davidson--Pitts and by Popescu. In particular, we find that \operatorname{Aut}(H^\infty(\mathfrak{B}_d)) is a proper subgroup of \operatorname{Aut}(\widetilde{\mathfrak{B}}_d).   When d<\infty and the varieties are homogeneous, we remove the weak-* continuity assumption, showing that two such algebras are boundedly isomorphic if and only if there is a bi-Lipschitz nc biholomorphism between the similarity envelopes of the nc varieties. We provide two proofs. In the noncommutative setting, our main tool is the noncommutative spectral radius, about which we prove several new results. In the free commutative case, we use a new free commutative Nullstellensatz that allows us to bootstrap techniques from the fully commutative case.
