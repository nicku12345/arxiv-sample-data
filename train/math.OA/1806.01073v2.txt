We introduce L^{2}-Wasserstein distances on densities of tracial W^{*}-algebras based on a Benamou-Brenier formulation, replacing multiplication by densities with multiplication operators arising as the logarithmic mean under a functional calculus. Furthermore, we concern ourselves with L^{2}-Wasserstein distances induced by decomposed derivations on C^{*}-algebras of continuous sections of a \mathcal{K}(H)-bundle vanishing at infinity. We prove a distintegration theorem for such distances, introduce mean entropic curvature bounds in case H is finite-dimensional and show control of these by the essential infimum of the entropic curvature bounds on the fibres. To conclude, we give sufficient conditions for disintegrating arbitrary L^{2}-Wasserstein distances for unital C^{*}-algebras that are Morita equivalent to a commutative unital C^{*}-algebra.
