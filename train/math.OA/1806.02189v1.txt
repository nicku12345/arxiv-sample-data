For a given ring \mathfrak{R} and a locally finite pre-ordered set (X, \leq), consider I(X, \mathfrak{R}) to be the incidence algebra of X over \mathfrak{R}. Motivated by a Xiao's result which states that every Jordan derivation of I(X,\mathfrak{R}) is a derivation in the case \mathfrak{R} is 2-torsion free, one proves that each generalized Jordan derivation of I(X,\mathfrak{R}) is a generalized derivation provided \mathfrak{R} is 2-torsion free, getting as a consequence the above mentioned result.
