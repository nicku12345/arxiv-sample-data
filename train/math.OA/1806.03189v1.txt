Let \mathcal{A} be a unital associative algebra and \mathcal{M} be an \mathcal{A}-bimodule. A linear mapping \varphi from \mathcal{A} into an \mathcal{A}-bimodule \mathcal{M} is called a Lie derivation if \varphi[A,B]=[\varphi(A),B]+[A,\varphi(B)] for each A,B in \mathcal{A}, and \varphi is called a \emph{local Lie derivation} if for every A in \mathcal{A}, there exists a Lie derivation \varphi_{A} (depending on A) from \mathcal{A} into \mathcal{M} such that \varphi(A)=\varphi_{A}(A). In this paper, we prove that every local Lie derivation on von Neumann algebras is a Lie derivation; and we show that if \mathcal M is a type I von Neumann algebra with atomic lattice of projections, then every local Lie derivation on LS(\mathcal M) is a Lie derivation.
