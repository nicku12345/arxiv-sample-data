We prove a uniqueness theorem and give a characterization of simplicity for Steinberg algebras associated to non-Hausdorff ample groupoids. We also prove a uniqueness theorem and give a characterization of simplicity for the C*-algebra associated to non-Hausdorff \'etale groupoids. Then we show how our results apply in the setting of tight representations of inverse semigroups, groups acting on graphs, and self-similar actions. In particular, we show that C*-algebra and the complex Steinberg algebra of the self-similar action of the Grigorchuk group are simple but the Steinberg algebra with coefficients in \mathbb{Z}_2 is not simple.
