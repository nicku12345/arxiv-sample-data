We show that Ringrose's diagonal ideals are primitive ideals in a nest algebra (subject to the Continuum Hypothesis). This provides for the first time concerete descriptions of enough primitive ideals to obtain the Jacobson radical as their intersection. Separately, we provide a standard form for all left ideals of a nest algebra, which leads to insights into the maximal left ideals. In the case of atomic nest algebras we show how primitive ideals can be categorized by their behaviour on the diagonal, and provide concrete examples of all types.
