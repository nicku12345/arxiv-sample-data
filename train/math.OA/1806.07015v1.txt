We introduce an abstract theory of the principal symbol mapping for pseudodifferential operators extending the results of a preceding paper and providing a simple algebraic approach to the theory of pseudodifferential operators in settings important in noncommutative geometry. We provide a variant of Connes' trace theorem which applies to certain noncommutative settings, with a minimum of technical preliminaries. Our approach allows us to consider in a operators with non-smooth symbols, and we demonstrate the power of our approach by extending Connes' trace theorem to operators with non-smooth symbols in three examples: the Lie group \mathrm{SU}(2), noncommutative tori and Moyal planes.
