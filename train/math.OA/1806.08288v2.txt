Using different descriptions of the Cuntz semigroup and of the Pedersen ideal, it is shown that \sigma-unital simple C^*-algebras with almost unperforated Cuntz semigroup, a unique lower semicontinuous 2-quasitrace and whose stabilization has almost stable rank 1 are either stable or algebraically simple.
