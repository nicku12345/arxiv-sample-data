Let T be an adjointable operator between two Hilbert C^*-modules and T^* be the adjoint operator of T. The polar decomposition of T is characterized as T=U(T^*T)^\frac12 and \mathcal{R}(U^*)=\overline{\mathcal{R}(T^*)}, where U is a partial isometry, \mathcal{R}(U^*) and \overline{\mathcal{R}(T^*)} denote the range of U^* and the norm closure of the range of T^*, respectively. Based on this new characterization of the polar decomposition, an application to the study of centered operators is carried out.
