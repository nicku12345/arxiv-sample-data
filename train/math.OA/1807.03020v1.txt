In this paper we consider a bootstrap class \mathfrak C of countable discrete groups, which is closed under countable unions and extensions by the integers, and we study actions of such groups on C*-algebras. This class includes all torsion-free abelian groups, poly-\mathbb Z-groups, as well as other examples. Using the interplay between relative Rokhlin dimension and semi-strongly self-absorbing actions established in prior work, we obtain the following two main results for any group \Gamma\in\mathfrak C and any strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra \mathcal D: (1) There is a unique strongly outer \Gamma-action on \mathcal D up to (very strong) cocycle conjugacy. (2) If \alpha: \Gamma\curvearrowright A is a strongly outer action on a separable, unital, nuclear, simple, \mathcal D-stable C*-algebra with at most one trace, then it absorbs every \Gamma-action on \mathcal D up to (very strong) cocycle conjugacy. In fact we establish more general relative versions of these two results for actions of amenable groups that have a predetermined quotient in the class \mathfrak C. For the monotracial case, the proof comprises an application of Matui--Sato's equivariant property (SI) as a key method.
