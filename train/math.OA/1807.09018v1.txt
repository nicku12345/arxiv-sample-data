For each unital C^*-algebra A, we denote cel_{CU}(A)=\sup\{cel(u):u\in CU(A)\}, where cel(u) is the exponential length of u and CU(A) is the closure of the commutator subgroup of U_0(A). In this paper, we prove that cel_{CU}(A)=2\pi provided that A is an AH algebras with slow dimension growth whose real rank is not zero. On the other hand, we prove that cel_{CU}(A)\leq 2\pi when A is an AH algebra with ideal property and of no dimension growth (if we further assume A is not of real rank zero, we have cel_{CU}(A)= 2\pi).
