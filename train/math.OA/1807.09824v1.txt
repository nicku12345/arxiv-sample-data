An E_0-semigroup of B(H) is a one parameter strongly continuous semigroup of *-endomorphisms of B(H) that preserve the identity. Every E_0-semigroup that possesses a strongly continuous intertwining semigroup of isometries is cocycle conjugate to an E_0-semigroup induced by the Bhat induction of a CP-flow over a separable Hilbert space K. We say an E_0-semigroup \alpha is q-pure if the CP-subordinates \beta of norm one (i.e. \Vert\beta_t(I)\Vert = 1 and \alpha_t-\beta_t is completely positive for all t \geq 0) are totally ordered in the sense that if \beta and \gamma are two CP-subordinates of \alpha of norm one, then \beta \geq \gamma or \gamma \geq \beta. This paper shows how to construct and classify all q-pure E_0-semigroups induced by CP-flows over a finite-dimensional Hilbert space K up to cocycle conjugacy.
