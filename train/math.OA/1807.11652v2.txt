Let \mathscr{M} be a finite von Neumann algebra with a faithful normal tracial state \tau and \mathfrak{A} be a finite subdiagonal subalgebra of \mathscr{M} with respect to a \tau-preserving faithful normal conditional expectation \Phi on \mathscr{M}. Let \Delta denote the Fuglede-Kadison determinant corresponding to \tau. For X \in \mathscr{M}, define |X| := (X^*X)^{\frac{1}{2}}. In 2005, Labuschagne proved the so-called Jensen's inequality for finite subdiagonal algebras i.e. \Delta(\Phi(A)) \le \Delta(A) for an operator A \in \mathfrak{A}, thus resolving a long-standing open problem posed by Arveson in 1967. In this article, we prove the following more general result: \tau(f( |\Phi(A)|)) \le \tau(f( |A|)) for A \in \mathfrak{A} and any increasing continuous function f : [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R} such that f \circ \exp is convex on \mathbb{R}. Under the additional hypotheses that A is invertible in \mathscr{M} and f \circ \exp is strictly convex, we have \tau(f( |\Phi(A)|)) = \tau(f( |A|)) \Longleftrightarrow \Phi(A) = A. As an application, we show that for A \in \mathfrak{A} the point spectrum of A is contained in the point spectrum of \Phi(A), though such a conclusion does not hold in general for their spectra.
