A derivation \delta on a C^*-algebra has kernel stabilization if for all n\in \mathbb{N}, \ker \delta^n=\ker \delta. Our main result shows that a weakly-defined derivation studied recently by E. Christensen has kernel stabilization. As corollaries, we (1) show that a family of *-derivations on C^*-algebras studied by Bratteli and Robinson has kernel stabilization and (2) provide sufficient conditions for when operators satisfying the Heisenberg Commutation Relation must both be unbounded.
