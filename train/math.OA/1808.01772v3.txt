We introduce the notion of a pre-spectral triple, which is a generalisation of a spectral triple (\mathcal{A}, H, D) where D is no longer required to be self-adjoint, but closed and symmetric. Despite having weaker assumptions, pre-spectral triples allow us to introduce noncompact noncommutative geometry with boundary. In particular, we derive the Hochschild character theorem in this setting. We give a detailed study of Dirac operators with Dirichlet boundary conditions on open subsets of \mathbb{R}^d, d \geq 2.
