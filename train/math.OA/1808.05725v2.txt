Let \Theta=(\theta_{j,k})_{3\times 3} be a non-degenerate real skew-symmetric 3\times 3 matrix, where \theta_{j,k}\in [0,1). For any \varepsilon>0, we prove that there exists \delta>0 satisfying the following: if v_1,v_2,v_3 are three unitaries in any unital simple separable C^*-algebra A with tracial rank at most one, such that \|v_kv_j-e^{2\pi i \theta_{j,k}}v_jv_k\|<\delta \,\,\,\, \mbox{and}\,\,\,\, \frac{1}{2\pi i}\tau(\log_{\theta}(v_kv_jv_k^*v_j^*))=\theta_{j,k} for all \tau\in T(A) and j,k=1,2,3, where \log_{\theta} is a continuous branch of logarithm for some real number \theta\in [0, 1), then there exists a triple of unitaries \tilde{v}_1,\tilde{v}_2,\tilde{v}_3\in A such that \tilde{v}_k\tilde{v}_j=e^{2\pi i\theta_{j,k} }\tilde{v}_j\tilde{v}_k\,\,\,\,\mbox{and}\,\,\,\,\|\tilde{v}_j-v_j\|<\varepsilon,\,\,j,k=1,2,3.   The same conclusion holds if \Theta is rational or non-degenerate and A is a nuclear purely infinite simple C^*-algebra (where the trace condition is vacuous).   If \Theta is degenerate and A has tracial rank at most one or is nuclear purely infinite simple, we provide some additional injectivity condition to get the above conclusion.
