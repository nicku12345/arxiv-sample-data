In this paper, we prove a general version of Thomsen-Li's Theorem--a Krein-Milman type theorem for C*-algebras. To be precise, for a Markov operator on C[0,1] which preserves certain subspace of C[0,1], we approximate it by an average of homomorphisms on C[0,1] in the strong operator topology, additionally we require that this average also preserves the same subspace. Such results could be useful for constructing homomorphisms for subhomogeneous C*-algebras.
