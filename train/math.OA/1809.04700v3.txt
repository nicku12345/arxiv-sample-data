Operator algebras generated by partial isometries and their adjoints form the basis for some of the most well studied classes of C*-algebras. The primary object of this paper is the norm-closed operator algebra generated by a left invertible T together with its Moore-Penrose inverse T^\dagger. We denote this algebra by \mathfrak{A}_T. In the isometric case, T^\dagger = T^* and \mathfrak{A}_T is a representation of the Toeplitz algebra. Of particular interest is the case when T satisfies a non-degeneracy condition called analytic. We show that T is analytic if and only if T^* is Cowen-Douglas. When T is analytic with Fredholm index -1, the algebra \mathfrak{A}_T contains the compact operators, and any two such algebras are boundedly isomorphic if and only if they are similar.
