A linear mapping \phi from an algebra \mathcal{A} into its bimodule \mathcal M is called a centralizable mapping at G\in\mathcal{A} if \phi(AB)=\phi(A)B=A\phi(B) for each A and B in \mathcal{A} with AB=G. In this paper, we prove that if \mathcal M is a von Neumann algebra without direct summands of type \mathrm{I}_1 and type \mathrm{II}, \mathcal A is a *-subalgebra with \mathcal M\subseteq\mathcal A\subseteq LS(\mathcal{M}) and G is a fixed element in \mathcal A, then every continuous (with respect to the local measure topology t(\mathcal M)) centralizable mapping at G from \mathcal A into \mathcal M is a centralizer.
