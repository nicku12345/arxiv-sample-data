We prove simplicity of all intermediate C^*-algebras C^*_{r}(\Gamma)\subseteq \mathcal{B} \subseteq \Gamma\ltimes_r C(X) in the case of minimal actions of C^*-simple groups \Gamma on compact spaces X. For this, we use the notion of stationary states, recently introduced by Hartman and Kalantar (arXiv:1712.10133v2). We show that the Powers' averaging property holds for the reduced crossed product \Gamma\ltimes_r \mathcal{A} for any action \Gamma\curvearrowright \mathcal{A} of a C^*-simple group \Gamma on a unital C^*-algebra \mathcal{A}, and use it to prove a one-to-one correspondence between stationary states on \mathcal{A} and those on \Gamma\ltimes_r \mathcal{A}.
