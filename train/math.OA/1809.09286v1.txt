The K-groups of the crossed product of the rotation C*-algebra A_\theta by free and amalgamated products of the cyclic groups \mathbb Z_n, for n=2,3,4,6, are calculated. The actions here arise from the canonical actions of these groups on the rotation algebra under the flip, cubic, Fourier, and hexic automorphisms, respectively. An interesting feature in this study is that although the inclusion A_\theta \to A_\theta \rtimes \mathbb Z_n induces injective maps on their K_0-groups, the same is not the case for the inclusions A_\theta \rtimes \mathbb Z_d \to A_\theta \rtimes \mathbb Z_n for 2\le d < n \le 6 and d|n, which we endeavor to calculate. Further, while for free products K_1(A_\theta \rtimes [\mathbb Z_{m} \ast \mathbb Z_{n}]) = 0, for amalgamated products K_1(A_\theta \rtimes [\mathbb Z_{m} \ast_{\mathbb Z_{d}} \mathbb Z_{n}]) = \mathbb Z^k is non-vanishing (k=1,2).
