Given a finite, directed, connected graph \Gamma equipped with a weighting \mu on its edges, we provide a construction of a von Neumann algebra equipped with a faithful, normal, positive linear functional (\mathcal{M}(\Gamma,\mu),\varphi). When the weighting \mu is instead on the vertices of \Gamma, the first author showed the isomorphism class of (\mathcal{M}(\Gamma,\mu),\varphi) depends only on the data (\Gamma,\mu) and is an interpolated free group factor equipped with a scaling of its unique trace (possibly direct sum copies of \mathbb{C}). Moreover, the free dimension of the interpolated free group factor is easily computed from \mu. In this paper, we show for a weighting \mu on the edges of \Gamma that the isomorphism class of (\mathcal{M}(\Gamma,\mu),\varphi) depends only on the data (\Gamma,\mu), and is either as in the vertex weighting case or is a free Araki-Woods factor equipped with a scaling of its free quasi-free state (possibly direct sum copies of \mathbb{C}). The latter occurs when the subgroup of \mathbb{R}^+ generated by \mu(e_1)\cdots \mu(e_n) for loops e_1\cdots e_n in \Gamma is non-trivial, and in this case the point spectrum of the free quasi-free state will be precisely this subgroup. As an application, we give the isomorphism type of some infinite index subfactors considered previously by Jones and Penneys.
