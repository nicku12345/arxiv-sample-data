For unital C^*-algebras A and B, we completely characterize the isometric (*-) automorphisms of their Banach space projective tensor product A\otimes^\gamma B. This leads to the characterization of inner and outer isometric *-automorphisms of A\otimes^\gamma B, as well. As an application, we provide a partial affirmative answer to a question posed by Kaijser and Sinclair, viz., we prove that for unital C^*-algebras A and B, the set of norm-one unitaries of A\otimes^\gamma B coincides with U(A) \otimes U(B), where U(A) is the unitary group of A. We also establish the fact that the relative commutant of A\otimes^\gamma \mathbb{C} 1 in A \otimes^\gamma B is same as Z(A) \otimes^\gamma B, where B is a subhomogenous unital C^*-algebra, and A is any C^*-algebra.
