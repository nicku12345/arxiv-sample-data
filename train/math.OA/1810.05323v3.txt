We consider a family of higher-dimensional noncommutative tori, which are twisted analogues of the algebras of continuous functions on ordinary tori, and their Toeplitz extensions. Just as solenoids are inverse limits of tori, our Toeplitz noncommutative solenoids are direct limits of the Toeplitz extensions of noncommutative tori. We consider natural dynamics on these Toeplitz algebras, and compute the equilibrium states for these dynamics. We find a large simplex of equilibrium states at each positive inverse temperature, parametrised by the probability measures on an (ordinary) solenoid.
