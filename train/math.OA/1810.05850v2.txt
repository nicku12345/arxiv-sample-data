Toward the complete classification of poly-\mathbb{Z} group actions on Kirchberg algebras, we prove several fundamental theorems that are used in the classification. In addition, as an application of them, we classify outer actions of poly-\mathbb{Z} groups of Hirsch length not greater than three on unital Kirchberg algebras up to KK-trivial cocycle conjugacy.
