Let a and b be elements in the closed ball of a unital C^*-algebra A (if A is not unital we consider its natural unitization). We shall say that a and b are domain (respectively, range) absolutely compatible (a\triangle_d b, respectively, a\triangle_r b, in short) if \Big| |a| -|b| \Big| + \Big| 1-|a|-|b| \Big| =1 (resp., \Big| |a^*| -|b^*| \Big| + \Big| 1-|a^*|-|b^*| \Big| =1), where |a|^2= a^* a. We shall say that a and b are absolutely compatible (a\triangle b in short) if they are both range and domain absolutely compatible. In general, a\triangle_d b (respectively, a\triangle_r b and a\triangle b) is strictly weaker than ab^*=0  (respectively, a^* b =0 and a\perp b). Let T: A\to B be a contractive linear mapping between C^*-algebras. We prove that if T preserves domain absolutely compatible elements (i.e., a\triangle_d b\Rightarrow T(a)\triangle_d T(b)) then T is a triple homomorphism. A similar statement is proved when T preserves range absolutely compatible elements. It is finally shown that T is a triple homomorphism if, and only if, T preserves absolutely compatible elements.
