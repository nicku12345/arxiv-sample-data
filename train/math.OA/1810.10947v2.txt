The semigroups of unital extensions of separable C^\ast-algebras come in two flavours: a strong and a weak version. By the unital \mathrm{Ext}-groups, we mean the groups of invertible elements in these semigroups. We use the unital \mathrm{Ext}-groups to obtain K-theoretic classification of both unital and non-unital extensions of C^\ast-algebras, and in particular we obtain a complete K-theoretic classification of full extensions of UCT Kirchberg algebras by stable AF algebras.
