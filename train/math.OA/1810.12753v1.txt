We use a weighted analogue of a trace to define a weighted non-commutative decreasing rearrangement and show it's relationship with the singular value function. We further show an alternative approach to constructing weighted non-commutative Banach function spaces using weighted non-commutative decreasing rearrangements and prove that this approach is equivalent to the original approach by Labuschagne and Majewski.
