The goal of this note is to apply ideas from commutative algebra (a.k.a. affine algebraic geometry) to the question of constrained Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation. More precisely, we consider subalgebras A \subset \mathbb{C}[z_1,\ldots,z_d], such that the map from the affine space to the spectrum of A is an isomorphism except for finitely many points. Letting \mathfrak{A} be the weak-* closure of A in \mathcal{M}_d -- the multiplier algebra of the Drury-Arveson space. We provide a parametrization for the Nevanlinna-Pick family of M_k(\mathfrak{A}) for k \geq 1. In particular, when k=1 the parameter space for the Nevanlinna-Pick family is the Picard group of A.
