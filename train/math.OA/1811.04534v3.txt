The dual modular propinquity is a complete metric, up to full modular quantum isometry, on the class metrical quantum vector bundles, i.e. of Hilbert modules endowed with a type of densely defined norm, called a D-norm, which generalize the operator norm given by a connection on a Riemannian manifold. The dual modular propinquity is weaker than the modular propinquity yet it is complete, which is the main purpose of its introduction.
