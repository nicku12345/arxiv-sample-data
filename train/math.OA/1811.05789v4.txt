We prove that any weak* continuous semigroup (T_t)_{t \geq 0} of Markov Fourier multipliers acting on a group von Neumann algebra \mathrm{VN}(G) associated to a locally compact group G can be dilated by a weak* continuous group of Markov *-automorphisms on a bigger von Neumann algebra. Our construction relies on probabilistic tools and is even new for the group \mathbb{R}^n. Our results imply the boundedness of the McIntosh's \mathrm{H}^\infty functional calculus of the generators of these semigroups on the associated noncommutative \mathrm{L}^p-spaces.
