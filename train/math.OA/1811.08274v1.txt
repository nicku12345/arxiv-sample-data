Let M be an arbitrary factor and \sigma : \Gamma \curvearrowright M an action of a discrete group. In this paper, we study the fullness of the crossed product M \rtimes_\sigma \Gamma. When \Gamma is amenable, we obtain a complete characterization: the crossed product factor M \rtimes_\sigma \Gamma is full if and only if M is full and the quotient map \overline{\sigma} : \Gamma \rightarrow \mathrm{Out}(M) has finite kernel and discrete image. This answers a question of Jones from 1981. When M is full and \Gamma is arbitrary, we give a sufficient condition for M \rtimes_\sigma \Gamma to be full which generalizes both Jones' criterion and Choda's criterion. In particular, we show that if M is any full factor (possibly of type \mathrm{III}) and \Gamma is a non-inner amenable group, then the crossed product M \rtimes_\sigma \Gamma is full.
