We previously showed that abstract Cuntz semigroups form a closed symmetric monoidal category. This automatically provides additional structure in the category, such as a composition and an external tensor product, for which we give concrete constructions in order to be used in applications.   We further analyse the structure of not necessarily commutative Cu-semi-rings and we obtain, under mild conditions, a new characterization of solid Cu-semirings R by the condition that R\cong [\![ R,R ]\!].
