We prove that any separable II_1 factor M admits a {\it coarse decomposition} over the hyperfinite II_1 factor R, i.e., there exists an embedding R\hookrightarrow M such that L^2M\ominus L^2R is a multiple of the coarse Hilbert R-bimodule L^2R \overline{\otimes} L^2R^{op} (equivalently, the von Neumann algebra generated by left and right multiplication by R on L^2M\ominus L^2R is isomorphic to R\overline{\otimes}R^{op}). Moreover, if Q\subset M is an infinite index irreducible subfactor, then R\hookrightarrow M can be constructed so that to also be coarse with respect to Q. This result implies existence of MASAs that are mixing, strongly malnormal, and with infinite multiplicity, in any separable II_1 factor.
