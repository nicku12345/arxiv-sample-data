We show that for a large class of actions \Gamma \curvearrowright \mathcal{A} of C^*-simple groups \Gamma on unital C^*-algebras \mathcal{A}, including any non-faithful action of a hyperbolic group with trivial amenable radical, every intermediate C^*-subalgebra \mathcal{B}, C_{\lambda}^*(\Gamma)\subseteq \mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{A}\rtimes_{r}\Gamma, is of the form \mathcal{A}_1\rtimes_{r}\Gamma, where \mathcal{A}_1 is a unital \Gamma-C^*-subalgebra of \mathcal{A}.
