We define a groupoid from a labelled space and show that it is isomorphic to the tight groupoid arising from an inverse semigroup associated with the labelled space. We then define a local homeomorphism on the tight spectrum that is a generalization of the shift map for graphs, and show that the defined groupoid is isomorphic to the Renault-Deaconu groupoid for this local homeomorphism. Finally, we show that the C*-algebra of this groupoid is isomorphic to the C*-algebra of the labelled space as introduced by Bates and Pask.
