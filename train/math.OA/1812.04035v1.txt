For a von Neumann algebra \mathcal M we study the order topology associated with the hermitian part \mathcal M_*^s and to intervals of the predual \mathcal M_*. It is shown that the order topology on \mathcal M_*^s coincides with the topology induced by the norm. In contrast to this, it is proved that the condition of having the order topology associated to the interval [0,\varphi] equal to that induced by the norm for every \varphi\in \mathcal M_*^+, is necessary and sufficient for the commutativity of \mathcal M. It is also proved that if \varphi is a positive bounded linear functional on a C^\ast-algebra \mathcal A, then the norm-null sequences in [0,\varphi] coincide with the null sequences with respect to the order topology on [0,\varphi] if and only if the von Neumann algebra \pi_{\varphi}(\mathcal A)' is of finite type (where \pi_{\varphi} denotes the corresponding GNS representation). This fact allows us to give a new topological characterization of finite von Neumann algebras. Moreover, we demonstrate that convergence to zero for norm and order topology on order-bounded parts of dual spaces are nonequivalent for all C^\ast-algebras that are not of Type I.
