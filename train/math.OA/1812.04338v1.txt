We define a strong Morita-type equivalence \sim _{\sigma \Delta } for operator algebras. We prove that A\sim _{\sigma \Delta }B if and only if A and B are stably isomorphic. We also define a relation \subset _{\sigma \Delta } for operator algebras. We prove that if A and B are C^*-algebras, then A\subset _{\sigma \Delta } B if and only if there exists an onto *-homomorphism \theta :B\otimes \mathcal K \rightarrow A\otimes \mathcal K, where \mathcal K is the set of compact operators acting on an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space. Furthermore, we prove that if A and B are C^*-algebras such that A\subset _{\sigma \Delta } B and B\subset _{\sigma \Delta } A , then there exist projections r, \hat r in the centers of A^{**} and B^{**}, respectively, such that Ar\sim _{\sigma \Delta }B\hat r and A (id_{A^{**}}-r) \sim _{\sigma \Delta }B(id_{B^{**}}-\hat r).
