Given a finite-index and finite-depth subfactor, we define the notion of \textit{quantum double inclusion} - a certain unital inclusion of von Neumann algebras constructed from the given subfactor - which is closely related to that of Ocneanu's asymptotic inclusion. We show that the quantum double inclusion when applied to the Kac algebra subfactor R^H \subset R produces Drinfeld double of H where H is a finite-dimensional Kac algebra acting outerly on the hyperfinite II_1 factor R and R^H denotes the fixed-point subalgebra. More precisely, quantum double inclusion of R^H \subset R is isomorphic to R \subset R \rtimes D(H)^{cop} for some outer action of D(H)^{cop} on R where D(H) denotes the Drinfeld double of H.
