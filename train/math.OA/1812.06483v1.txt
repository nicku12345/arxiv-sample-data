For a given C*-algebra \mathcal{A}, we establish the existence of maximal and minimal operator \mathcal{A}-system structures on an AOU \mathcal{A}-space. In the case \mathcal{A} is a W*-algebra, we provide an abstract characterisation of dual operator \mathcal{A}-systems, and study the maximal and minimal dual operator \mathcal{A}-system structures on a dual AOU \mathcal{A}-space. We introduce operator-valued Schur multipliers, and provide a Grothendieck-type characterisation. We study the positive extension problem for a partially defined operator-valued Schur multiplier \varphi and, under some richness conditions, characterise its affirmative solution in terms of the equality between the canonical and the maximal dual operator \mathcal{A}-system structures on an operator system naturally associated with the domain of \varphi.
