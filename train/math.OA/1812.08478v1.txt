We investigate the structure of crossed product von Neumann algebras arising from Bogoljubov actions of countable groups on Shlyakhtenko's free Araki-Woods factors. Among other results, we settle the questions of factoriality and Connes' type classification. We moreover provide general criteria regarding fullness and strong solidity. As an application of our main results, we obtain examples of type {\rm III_0} factors that are prime, have no Cartan subalgebra and possess a maximal amenable abelian subalgebra. We also obtain a new class of strongly solid type {\rm III} factors with prescribed Connes' invariants that are not isomorphic to any free Araki-Woods factors.
