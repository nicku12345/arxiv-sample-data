We describe the general structure of unbounded derivations in the quantum cylinder. We prove a noncommutative analog of reflection positivity for Laplace-type operators in a noncommutative cylinder following the ideas of Jaffe and Ritter proof of reflection positivity for Laplace operators on manifolds equipped with a reflection.
