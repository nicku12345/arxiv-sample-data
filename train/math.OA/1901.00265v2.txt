Let P be a closed convex cone in \mathbb{R}^{d} which we assume to be spanning and pointed i.e. P-P=\mathbb{R}^{d} and P \cap -P=\{0\}. In this article, we consider CCR flows over P associated to isometric representations that arises out of P-invariant closed subsets, also called as P-modules, of \mathbb{R}^{d}. We show that for two P-modules the associated CCR flows are cocycle conjugate if and only if the modules are translates of each other.
