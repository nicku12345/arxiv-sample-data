Let \Gamma be a discrete group satisfying the approximation property (AP). Let X, Y be \Gamma-spaces and \pi \colon Y \to X be a proper factor map which is injective on the non-free part. We prove the one-to-one correspondence between intermediate {\rm C}^\ast-algebras of C_0(X) \rtimes_r \Gamma \subset C_0(Y) \rtimes \Gamma and intermediate \Gamma-{\rm C}^\ast-algebras of C_0(X) \subset C_0(Y). This is a generalization of Suzuki's theorem that proves the statement for free actions.
