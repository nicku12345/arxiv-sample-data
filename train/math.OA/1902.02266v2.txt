Let V be a standard subspace in the complex Hilbert space H and G be a finite dimensional Lie group of unitary and antiunitary operators on H containing the modular group (\Delta_V^{it})_{t \in R} of V and the corresponding modular conjugation~J_V. We study the semigroup \[ S_V = \{ g\in G \cap U(H) : gV \subseteq V\} \] and determine its Lie wedge L(S_V) = \{ x \in L(G) : exp(R_+ x) \subseteq S_V\}, i.e., the generators of its one-parameter subsemigroups in the Lie algebra L(G) of~G. The semigroup S_V is analyzed in terms of antiunitary representations and their analytic extension to semigroups of the form G exp(iC), where C \subseteq L(G) is an Ad(G)-invariant closed convex cone.   Our main results assert that the Lie wedge L(S_V) spans a 3-graded Lie subalgebra in which it can be described explicitly in terms of the involution \tau of L(G) induced by J_V, the generator h \in L(G)^\tau of the modular group, and the positive cone of the corresponding representation. We also derive some global information on the semigroup S_V itself
