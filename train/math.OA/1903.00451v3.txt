Let \mathcal{A} be a prime \ast-algebra and \Phi preserves triple \ast-Jordan derivation on \mathcal{A}, that is, for every A,B \in \mathcal{A}, \Phi(A\diamond B \diamond C)=\Phi(A)\diamond B\diamond C+A\diamond \Phi(B)\diamond C+A\diamond B\diamond \Phi(C) where A\diamond B = AB + BA^{\ast} then \Phi is additive. Moreover, if \Phi(\alpha I) is self-adjoint for \alpha\in\{1,i\} then \Phi is a \ast-derivation.
