We discuss the relationship between tight and cover-to-join representations of semilattices and inverse semigroups, showing that a slight extension of the former, together with an appropriate selection of co-domains, makes the two notions equivalent. As a consequence, when constructing universal objects based on them, one is allowed to substitute cover-to-join for tight and vice-versa.
