We determine the group structure of the homotopy set whose target is the automorphism group of the Cuntz algebra O_{n+1} for finite n in terms of K-theory. We show that there is an example of a space for which the homotopy set is a non-commutative group, and hence the classifying space of the automorphism group of the Cuntz algebra for finite n is not an H-space. We also make an improvement of Dadarlat's classification of continuous fields of the Cuntz algebras in terms of vector bundles.
