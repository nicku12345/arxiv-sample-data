We show a rigidity result for subfactors that are normalized by a representation of a lattice \Gamma in a higher rank simple Lie group with trivial center into a finite factor. This implies that every subfactor of L\Gamma which is normalized by the natural copy of \Gamma is trivial or of finite index.
