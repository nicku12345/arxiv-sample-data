We show that if M is a full factor and N \subset M is a co-amenable subfactor with expectation, then N is also full. This answers a question of Popa from 1986. We also generalize a theorem of Tomatsu by showing that if M is a full factor and \sigma \colon G \curvearrowright M is an outer action of a compact group G, then \sigma is automatically minimal and M^G is a full factor which has w-spectral gap in M. Finally, in the appendix, we give a proof of the fact that several natural notions of co-amenability for an inclusion N\subset M of von Neumann algebras are equivalent, thus closing the cycle of implications given in Anantharaman-Delaroche's paper in 1995.
