Motivated by Popa's seminal work \cite{Po04}, in this paper, we provide a fairly large class of examples of group actions \Gamma \curvearrowright X satisfying the extended Neshveyev-St{\o}rmer rigidity phenomenon \cite{NS03}: whenever \Lambda \curvearrowright Y is a free ergodic pmp action and there is a \ast-isomorphism \Theta:L^\infty(X)\rtimes \Gamma \rightarrow L^\infty(Y)\rtimes \Lambda such that \Theta(L(\Gamma))=L(\Lambda) then the actions \Gamma\curvearrowright X and \Lambda \curvearrowright Y are conjugate (in a way compatible with \Theta). We also obtain a complete description of the intermediate subalgebras of all (possibly non-free) compact extensions of group actions in the same spirit as the recent results of Suzuki \cite{Suzuki}. This yields new consequences to the study of rigidity for crossed product von Neumann algebras and to the classification of subfactors of finite Jones index.
