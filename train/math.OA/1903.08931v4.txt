We prove that, given a constant K> 2 and a bounded linear operator T from a JB^*-triple E into a complex Hilbert space H, there exists a norm-one functional \psi\in E^* satisfying \|T(x)\| \leq K \, \|T\| \, \|x\|_{\psi}, for all x\in E. Applying this result we show that, given G > 8 (1+2\sqrt{3}) and a bounded bilinear form V on the Cartesian product of two JB^*-triples E and B, there exist norm-one functionals \varphi\in E^{*} and \psi\in B^{*} satisfying |V(x,y)| \leq G \ \|V\| \, \|x\|_{\varphi} \, \|y\|_{\psi} for all (x,y)\in E \times B. These results prove a conjecture pursued during almost twenty years.
