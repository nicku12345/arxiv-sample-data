We relate factorizable quantum channels on M_n, for n \ge 2, via their Choi matrix, to certain correlation matrices, which, in turn, are shown to be parametrized by traces on the unital free product M_n * M_n. Factorizable maps that admit a finite dimensional ancilla are parametrized by finite dimensional traces on M_n * M_n, and factorizable maps that approximately factor through finite dimensional C*-algebras are parametrized by traces in the closure of the finite dimensional ones. The latter set is shown to be equal to the set of hyperlinear traces on M_n * M_n. We finally show that each metrizable Choquet simplex is a face of the simplex of tracial states on M_n * M_n.
