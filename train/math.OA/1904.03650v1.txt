We study the unitary orbit of a compact Hermitian diagonal operator with spectral multiplicity one under the action of the unitary group U_(K+C) of the unitization of the compact operators K(H)+C, or equivalently, the quotient U_(K+C)/ U_Diag(K+C). We relate this and the action of different unitary subgroups to describe metric geodesics (using a natural distance) which join end points. As a consequence we obtain a local Hopf-Rinow theorem. We also explore cases about the uniqueness of short curves and prove that there exist some of these that cannot be parameterized using minimal anti-Hermitian operators of K(H)+C.
