This paper is motivated primarily by the question of when the maximal and reduced crossed products of a G-C^*-algebra agree (particularly inspired by results of Matsumura and Suzuki), and the relationships with various notions of amenability and injectivity. We give new connections between these notions. Key tools in this include the natural equivariant analogues of injectivity, and of Lance's weak expectation property: we also give complete characterizations of these equivariant properties, and some connections with injective envelopes in the sense of Hamana.
