In this note we study asymptotic properties of the *-distribution of traces of some matrices, with respect to the free Haar trace on the unitary dual group. The considered matrices are powers of the unitary matrix generating the Brown algebra. We proceed in two steps, first computing the free cumulants of any R-cyclic family, then characterizing the asymptotic *-distributions of the traces of powers of the generating matrix, thanks to these free cumulants. In particular, we obtain that these traces are asymptotic *-free circular variables.
