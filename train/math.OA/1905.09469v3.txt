Let A be a simple separable nuclear C^*-algebra with a unique tracial state and no unbounded traces, and let \alpha be a strongly outer action of a finite group G on A. In this paper, we show that \alpha\otimes \mathrm{id} on A\otimes\mathcal{W} has the Rohlin property, where \mathcal{W} is the Razak-Jacelon algebra. Combing this result with the recent classification results and our previous result, we see that such actions are unique up to conjugacy.
