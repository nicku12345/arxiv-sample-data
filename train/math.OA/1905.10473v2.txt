We show that hyperrigidity for a C*-correspondence (A,X) is equivalent to non-degeneracy of the left action of the Katsura ideal \mathcal{J}_X on X. Due to the work of Katsoulis and Ramsey, our result shows that if G is a locally compact group acting on (A,X) and the Katsura ideal \mathcal{J}_X acts on X non-degenerately then the Hao-Ng isomorphism problem for reduced crossed products has a positive solution and the Hao-Ng isomorphism problem for full crossed products has a partial solution.
