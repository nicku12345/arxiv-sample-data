We study (quasi-)cohomological properties through an analysis of quantum Markov semi-groups. We construct higher order Hochschild cocycles using gradient forms associated with a quantum Markov semi-group. By using Schatten-\mathcal{S}_p estimates we analyze when these cocycles take values in the coarse bimodule. For the 1-cocycles (the derivations) we show that under natural conditions they imply the Akemann-Ostrand property (using the Riesz transform). We apply this to q-Gaussian algebras \Gamma_q(H). As a result q-Gaussians satisfy AO^+ for | q | \leqslant \dim(H)^{-1/2}. This includes a new range of q in low dimensions compared to Shlyakhtenko.
