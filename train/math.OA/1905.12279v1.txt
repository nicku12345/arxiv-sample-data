We compute the K-theory of crossed products of rotation algebras \mathcal{A}_\theta, for any real angle \theta, by matrices in \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) with infinite order. Using techniques of continuous fields, we show that the canonical inclusion of \mathcal{A}_\theta into the crossed products is injective at the level of K_0-groups. We then give an explicit set of generators for the K_0-groups and compute the tracial ranges concretely.
