Elliott dimension drop interval algebra is an important class among all C^*-algebras in the classification theory. Especially, they are building stones of \mathcal{AHD} algebra and the latter contains all AH algebras with the ideal property of no dimension growth.   In this paper, we will show two decomposition theorems related to the Elliott dimension drop interval algebra. Our results are key steps in classifying all AH algebras with the ideal property of no dimension growth.
