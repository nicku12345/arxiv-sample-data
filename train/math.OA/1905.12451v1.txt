An ATAI (or ATAF, respectively) algebra, introduced in [Jiang1] (or in [Fa] respectively) is an inductive limit \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty}(A_{n}=\bigoplus\limits_{i=1}A_{n}^{i},\phi_{nm}), where each A_{n}^{i} is a simple separable nuclear TAI (or TAF) C*-algebra with UCT property. In [Jiang1], the second author classified all ATAI algebras by an invariant consisting orderd total K-theory and tracial state spaces of cut down algebras under an extra restriction that all element in K_{1}(A) are torsion. In this paper, we remove this restriction, and obtained the classification for all ATAI algebras with the Hausdorffized algebraic K_{1}-group as an addition to the invariant used in [Jiang1]. The theorem is proved by reducing the class to the classification theorem of \mathcal{AHD} algebras with ideal property which is done in [GJL1]. Our theorem generalizes the main theorem of [Fa] and [Jiang1] (see corollary 4.3).
