Let \mathcal{M} be a \sigma-finite von Neumann algebra, equipped with a   normal faithful state \varphi, and let \mathcal{A} be maximal subdiagonal subalgebra of \mathcal{M}. We prove a Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne theorem for \mathcal{A}-invariant subspaces of L^p(\mathcal{M}) when 1\le p<\infty.   As application, we give a characterization of outer operators in Haagerup noncommutative H^{p}-spaces associated with \mathcal{A}.
