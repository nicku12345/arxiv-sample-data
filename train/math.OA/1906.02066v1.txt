We show that every nuclear \mathcal O_\infty-stable *-homomorphism with a separable exact domain has nuclear dimension at most 1. In particular separable, nuclear, \mathcal O_\infty-stable C*-algebras have nuclear dimension 1. We also characterise when \mathcal O_\infty-stable C*-algebras have finite decomposition rank in terms of quasidiagonality and primitive-ideal structure, and determine when full \mathcal O_2-stable *-homomorphisms have nuclear dimension 0.
