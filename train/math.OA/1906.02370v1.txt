Muhly and Solel developed a notion of Morita equivalence for C^{*}- correspondences, which they used to show that if two C^{*}-correspondences E and F are Morita equivalent then their tensor algebras \mathcal{T}_{+}(E) and \mathcal{T}_{+}(F) are (strongly) Morita equivalent operator algebras. We give the weak^{*} version of this result by considering (weak) Morita equivalence of W^{*}-correspondences and employing Blecher and Kashyap's notion of Morita equivalence for dual operator algebras. More precisely, we show that weak Morita equivalence of W^{*}-correspondences E and F implies weak Morita equivalence of their Hardy algebras H^{\infty}(E) and H^{\infty}(F). We give special attention to W^{*}-graph correspondences and show a number of results related to their Morita equivalence.
