Suppose \mathcal{G} is a second-countable locally compact Hausdorff \'{e}tale groupoid, G is a discrete group containing a unital subsemigroup P, and c:\mathcal{G}\rightarrow G is a continuous cocycle. We derive conditions on the cocycle such that the reduced groupoid C^*-algebra C_r^*(\mathcal{G}) may be realised naturally as the covariance algebra of a product system over P with coefficient algebra C_r^*(c^{-1}(e)). When (G,P) is a quasi-lattice ordered group, we also derive conditions that allow C_r^*(\mathcal{G}) to be realised as the Cuntz--Nica--Pimsner algebra of a compactly aligned product system.
