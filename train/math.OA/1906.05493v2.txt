In this paper, we revisit Arveson's characterisation of CCR flows in terms of decomposibility of the product system in the multiparameter context. We show that a multiparameter E_0-semigroup is a CCR flow if and only if it is decomposable and admits a unit. In contrast to the one parameter situtation, we exhibit uncountably many examples of decomposable E_0-semigroups which do not admit any unit. As applications, we show that for a pure isometric representation V, the associated CCR flow \alpha^{V} remembers the unitary equivalence class of V. We also compute the positive contractive local cocycles and projective local cocycles of a CCR flow. A necessary and a sufficient condition for a CCR flow to be prime is obtained.
