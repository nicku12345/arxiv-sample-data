Let A be a ring and \sigma: A \to A a ring endomorphism. A generalized skew (or \sigma-)derivation of A is an additive map d: A \to A for which there exists a map \delta:A \to A such that d(xy)=\delta(x)y+\sigma(x)d(y) for all x,y \in A. If A is a prime C^*-algebra and \sigma is surjective, we determine the structure of generalized \sigma-derivations of A that belong to the cb-norm closure of elementary operators \mathcal{E}\ell(A) on A; all such maps are of the form d(x)=bx+axc for suitable elements a,b,c of the multiplier algebra M(A). As a consequence, if an epimorphism \sigma: A \to A lies in the cb-norm closure of \mathcal{E}\ell(A), then \sigma must be an inner automorphism. We also show that these results cannot be extended even to relatively well-behaved non-prime C^*-algebras like C(X,\mathbb{M}_2 ).
