In this paper, we show that the homomorphisms between two unital one-dimensional NCCW complexes with the same KK-class are stably homotopic, i.e., with adding on a common homomorphism (with finite dimensional image), they are homotopic. As a consequence, any one-dimensional NCCW complex has the Property (H).
