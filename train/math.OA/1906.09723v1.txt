Let A be a unital C^*-algebra with unity 1_A. A pair of elements 0 \le a, b \le 1_A in A is said to be \emph{absolutely compatible} if, \vert a - b \vert + \vert 1_A - a - b \vert = 1_A. In this paper we provide a complete description of absolutely compatible pair of strict elements in a von Neumann algebra. The end form of such a pair has a striking resemblance with that of a `generic pair' of projections on a complex Hilbert space introduced by Halmos.
