A famous question of Halmos asks whether every operator on a separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space is a norm limit of reducible operators. In [30] , Voiculescu gave this problem an affirmative answer by his remarkable non-commutative Weyl-von Neumann theorem. We investigate the existence or non-existence of an analogue of Voiculescu's result in factors of type {\rm II}_1.   In the paper we prove that, in the operator norm topology, the set of reducible operators is {\it nowhere} dense in a non-\Gamma factor \mathcal M of type {\rm II}_1, where separable and non-separable cases of \mathcal M are both considered. Main tools developed in the paper are a new characterization of Murray and von Neumann's Property \Gamma for a factor of type {\rm II}_1 and a spectral gap property for a single operator in a non-\Gamma factor of type {\rm II}_1.
