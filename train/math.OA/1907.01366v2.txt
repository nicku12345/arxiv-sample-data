Since their inception in the 30's by von Neumann, operator algebras have been used in shedding light in many mathematical theories. Classification results for self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint operator algebras manifest this approach, but a clear connection between the two was sought since their emergence in the late 60's.   We connect these seemingly separate type of results by uncovering a hierarchy of classification for non-self-adjoint operator algebras and C^*-algebras with additional C^*-algebraic structure. Our approach naturally applies to algebras arising from C^*-correspondences to resolve self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint isomorphism problems in the literature. We apply our strategy to completely elucidate this newly found hierarchy for operator algebras arising from directed graphs.
