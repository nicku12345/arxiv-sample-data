Building on previous papers by Anantharaman-Delaroche we introduce and study the notion of AD-amenability for partial actions and Fell bundles over discrete groups. If the Fell bundle is AD-amenable, the full and reduced crossed products coincide. We prove that the cross-sectional C*-algebra of the Fell bundle is nuclear if and only if the underlying unit fibre is nuclear and the Fell bundle is AD-amenable. If a partial action is globalisable, then it is AD-amenable if and only if its globalisation is AD-amenable. Moreover, we prove that AD-amenabity is invariant under (weak) equivalence of Fell bundles and show that AD-amenabity is equivalent to a weak form of the approximation property introduced by Exel. For Fell bundles whose unit fibre is (Morita equivalent to) a commutative C*-algebra we prove that AD-amenability is equivalent to the approximation property.
