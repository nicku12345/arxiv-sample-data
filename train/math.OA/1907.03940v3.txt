Let \mathcal{A} be a *-algebra and \mathcal{M} be a *-\mathcal A-bimodule, we study the local properties of *-derivations and *-Jordan derivations from \mathcal{A} into \mathcal{M} under the following orthogonality conditions on elements in \mathcal A: ab^*=0, ab^*+b^*a=0 and ab^*=b^*a=0. We characterize the mappings on zero product determined algebras and zero Jordan product determined algebras. Moreover, we give some applications on C^*-algebras, group algebra, matrix algebras, algebras of locally measurable operators and von Neumann algebras.
