We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for pure infiniteness of the path groupoid C^*-algebra of a row-finite graph without sinks. In particular we show that for such a path groupoid \mathcal{G}_E, the properties of being essential principal and the existence of a basis of (\mathcal{G}_E^a, 2, 1)-paradoxical sets for the topology are not only sufficient, but also necessary.
