Alain Connes introduced the use of Lie groupoids in noncommutative geometry in his pioneering work on the index theory of foliations. In the present paper, we recall the basic notion involved: groupoids, their C*-algebras, their pseudodifferential calculus... We review several recent and older advances on the involvement of Lie groupoids in noncommutative geometry. We then propose some open questions and possible developments of the subject.
