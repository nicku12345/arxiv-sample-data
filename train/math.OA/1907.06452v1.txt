In this article we show that positive surjective isometries between symmetric spaces associated with semi-finite von Neumann algebras are projection disjointness preserving if they are finiteness preserving. This is subsequently used to obtain a structural description of such isometries. Furthermore, it is shown that if the initial symmetric space is a strongly symmetric space with absolutely continuous norm, then a similar structural description can be obtained without requiring positivity of the isometry.
