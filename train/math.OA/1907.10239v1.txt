Let E_1,\;E_2 be symmetric quasi Banach spaces on [0,\alpha)\;(0<\alpha\le\8). We collected and proved some properties of the space E_1\odot E_2, where \odot means the pointwise product of symmetric quasi Banach spaces. Under some natural assumptions, we proved (E_1,E_2)_\theta=E_1^{(\frac{1}{\theta})}\odot E_2^{(\frac{1}{1-\theta})}\;(0<\theta<1). As application, we extend this results to the noncommutative symmetric quasi spaces and the noncommutative symmetric quasi Hardy spaces case. We also obtained the real case of Peter Jones' theorem for noncommutative symmetric quasi Hardy spaces.
