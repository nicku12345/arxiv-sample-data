We use here a recent idea of studying functions of free random variables using Boolean cumulants. We develop idea of explicit calculations of conditional expectation using Boolean cumulants. We demonstrate Boolean cumulants approach allows to calculate explicitly some conditional expectations of functions in free random variables. We present how Boolean cumulants together with subordination simplify proofs of some results which are known in research literature.
