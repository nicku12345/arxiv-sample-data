Recently it is proved in arXiv:1906.05493v1 [math.OA] that CCR flows over convex cones are cocycle conjugate if and only if the associated isometric representations are conjugate. We provide a very short, simple and direct proof of that. Using the same idea we prove the analogous statement for CAR flows as well. Further we show that CCR flows are not cocycle conjugate to the CAR flows when the (multi-parameter) isometric representation is `proper', a condition which is satisfied by all known examples.
