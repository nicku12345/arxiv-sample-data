We prove that Kellendonk's C^*-algebra of an aperiodic and repetitive tiling with finite local complexity is classifiable by the Elliott invariant. Our result follows from showing that tiling C^*-algebras are \mathcal{Z}-stable, and hence have finite nuclear dimension. To prove \mathcal{Z}-stability, we extend Matui's notion of almost finiteness to the setting of \'etale groupoid actions following the footsteps of Kerr. To use some of Kerr's techniques we have developed a version of the Ornstein-Weiss quasitiling theorem for general \'etale groupoids.
