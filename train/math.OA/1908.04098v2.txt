W. Paschke's version of Stinespring's theorem associates a Hilbert C^*-module along with a generating vector to every completely positive map. Building on this, to every quantum dynamical semigroup (QDS) on a C^*-algebra \mathcal A one may associate an inclusion system E=(E_t) of Hilbert \mathcal A-\mathcal A-modules with a generating unit \xi =(\xi_t). Suppose \mathcal B is a von Neumann algebra, consider M_2(\mathcal B), the von Neumann algebra of 2\times 2 matrices with entries from \mathcal B. Suppose (\Phi_t)_{t\ge 0} with \Phi_t=\begin{pmatrix} \phi_t^1& \psi_t \psi_t^*&\phi_t^2 \end{pmatrix}, is a QDS on M_2(B) which acts block-wise and let (E^i_t)_{t\ge 0} be the inclusion system associated to the diagonal QDS (\phi^i_t)_{t\ge 0} with the generating unit (\xi_t^i)_{t\ge 0}, i=1,2. It is shown that there is a contractive (bilinear) morphism T=(T_t)_{t\ge0} from (E^2_t)_{t\ge 0} to (E^1_t)_{t\ge 0} such that \psi_t(a)=\langle \xi^1_t, T_t a\xi^2_t\rangle  for all a\in\mathcal B. We also prove that any contractive morphism between inclusion systems of von Neumann \mathcal B-\mathcal B-modules can be lifted as a morphism between the product systems generated by them. We observe that the E_0-dilation of a block quantum Markov semigroup (QMS) on a unital C^*-algebra is again a semigroup of block maps.
