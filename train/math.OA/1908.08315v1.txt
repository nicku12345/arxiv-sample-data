Given a one-sided subshift X on a finite alphabet, we consider the semigroup S_X =L_X \cup \{0\}, where L_X  is the language of X , equipped with the multiplication operation given by concatenation, when allowed, and set to vanish otherwise. We then study the inverse hull H(S_X ), relating it with C*-algebras that have been discussed in the literature in association with subshifts.
