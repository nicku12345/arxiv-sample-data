We define exact sequences in the enchilada category of C^*-algebras and correspondences, and prove that the reduced-crossed-product functor is not exact for the enchilada categories. Our motivation was to determine whether we can have a better understanding of the Baum-Connes conjecture by using enchilada categories. Along the way we prove numerous results showing that the enchilada category is rather strange.
