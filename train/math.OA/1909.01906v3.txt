We revisit the connection between index and relative entropy for an inclusion of finite von Neumann algebras. We observe that the Pimsner-Popa index connects to sandwiched Renyi p-relative entropy for all 1/2\le p\le \infty, including Umegaki's relative entropy at p=1. Based on that, we introduce a new notation of relative entropy to a subalgebra which generalizes subfactors index. This relative entropy has application in estimating decoherence time of quantum Markov semigroups.
