We study the topic of quantum differentiability on quantum Euclidean d-dimensional spaces (otherwise known as Moyal d-spaces), and we find conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the singular values of the quantised differential to have decay O(n^{-\alpha}) for 0 < \alpha \leq \frac{1}{d}. This result is substantially more difficult than the analogous problems for Euclidean space and for quantum d-tori.
