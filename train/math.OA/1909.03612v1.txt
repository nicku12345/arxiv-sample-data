For p\in [1,\infty), we show that every unital L^p-operator algebra contains a unique maximal C^*-subalgebra, which we call the C^*-core. When p\neq 2, the C^*-core of an L^p-operator algebra is abelian. Using this, we canonically associate to every unital L^p-operator algebra A an \'etale groupoid \mathcal{G}_A, which in many cases of interest is a complete invariant for A. By calculating this groupoid for large classes of examples, we obtain a number of rigidity results that display a stark contrast with the case p=2; the most striking one being that of crossed products by essentially free actions.   These rigidity results give answers to questions concerning the existence of homomorphisms or isomorphisms between different algebras. Among others, we show that for the L^p-analog \mathcal{O}_2^p of the Cuntz algebra, there is no isometric isomorphism between \mathcal{O}_2^p and \mathcal{O}_2^p\otimes_p\mathcal{O}_2^p, when p\neq 2. In particular, we deduce that there is no L^p-version of Kirchberg's absorption theorem, and that there is no K-theoretic classification of purely infinite simple amenable L^p-operator algebras for p\neq 2.
