We prove that Cuntz semigroups of C*-algebras satisfy Edwards' condition with respect to every quasitrace. This condition is a key ingredient in the study of the realization problem of functions on the cone of quasitraces as ranks of positive elements. In the course of our investigation, we identify additional structure of the Cuntz semigroup of an arbitrary C*-algebra and of the cone of quasitraces.
