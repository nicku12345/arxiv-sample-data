A classification theorem is obtained for a class of unital simple separable amenable Z-stable C*-algebras which exhausts all possible values of the Elliott invariant for unital stably finite simple separable amenable Z-stable C*-algebras. Moreover, it contains all unital simple separable amenable C*-algebras which satisfy the UCT and have finite rational tracial rank
