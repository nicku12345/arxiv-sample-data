For an action \alpha of a locally compact group G on a dual operator space X by w*-continuous completely isometric isomorphisms one can define two generally different notions of crossed products, namely the Fubini crossed product X\rtimes_{\alpha}^{F}G and the spatial crossed product X\overline{\rtimes}_{\alpha} G. It is shown that X\rtimes_{\alpha}^{F}G=X\overline{\rtimes}_{\alpha} G if and only if the dual comodule action \widehat{\alpha} of the group von Neumann algebra L(G) on the Fubini crossed product of X\rtimes_{\alpha}^{F}G is non-degenerate. As an application, this yields an alternative proof of the result of Crann and Neufang that the two notions coincide when G satisfies the approximation property (AP) of Haagerup and Kraus. Also, it is proved that the L(G)-bimodules Bim(J^{\perp}) and Ran(J)^{\perp} defined by Anoussis, Katavolos and Todorov for a left closed ideal J of L^{1}(G) can be identified respectively with a spatial crossed product and a Fubini crossed product of the annihilator of J by G. Therefore a necessary and sufficient condition so that Bim(J^{\perp})=Ran(J)^{\perp} is obtained by the main result.
