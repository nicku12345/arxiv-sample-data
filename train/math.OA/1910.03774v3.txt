We consider two twisted actions of a countable discrete group on \sigma-unital C^*-algebras. Then by taking the reduced crossed products, we get two inclusions of C^*-algebras. We suppose that they are strongly Morita equivalent as inclusions of C^*-algebras. Also, we suppose that one of the inclusions is irreducible, that is, the relative commutant of one of the \sigma-unital C^*-algebra in the multiplier C^*-algebra of the reduced twisted crossed product is trivial. We show that the two actions are then strongly Morita equivalent up to some automorphism of the group.
