An inclusion of von Neumann factors M \subset \Cal M is {\it ergodic} if it satisfies the irreducibility condition M'\cap \Cal M=\Bbb C. We investigate the relation between this and several stronger ergodicity properties, such as R-{\it ergodicity}, which requires M to admit an embedding of the hyperfinite II_1 factor R\hookrightarrow M that's ergodic in \Cal M. We prove that if M is {\it continuous} (i.e., non type I) and contains a maximal abelian ^*-subalgebra of \Cal M, then M\subset \Cal M is R-ergodic. This shows in particular that any continuous factor contains an ergodic copy of R.
