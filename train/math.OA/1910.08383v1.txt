We give a shorter proof of the fact that the Jiang-Su algebra is strongly self-absorbing. This is achieved by introducing and studying so-called unitarily suspended endomorphisms of generalized dimension drop algebras. Along the way we prove uniqueness and existence results for maps between dimension drop algebras and UHF-algebras.
