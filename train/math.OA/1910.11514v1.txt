We geometrically describe the relation induced on a set of graphs by isomorphism of their associated graph C*-algebras as the smallest equivalence relation generated by five types of moves. The graphs studied have finitely many vertices and finitely or countably infinitely many edges, corresponding to unital and separable C*-algebras.
