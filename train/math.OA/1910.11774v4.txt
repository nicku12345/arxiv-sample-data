By computing the completely bounded norm of the flip map on the Haagerup tensor product C_0 Y_1\otimes_{C_0 X} C_0 Y_2 associated to a pair of continuous mappings of locally compact Hausdorff spaces Y_1\rightarrow X\leftarrow Y_2, we establish a simple characterisation of the Beck-Chevalley condition for base change of operator modules over commutative C^*-algebras, and a descent theorem for continuous fields of Hilbert spaces.
