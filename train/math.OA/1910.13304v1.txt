In this article we show that there are branching systems (which induce representations of the graph algebra C^*(E)) associated to each row-countable graph E. For row-countable graphs, we characterize the condition (L) via branching systems. Moreover, we show that each permutative representation in Hilbert spaces operators is unitarily equivalent to one induced by a branching system, even the spaces being not separable. Furthermore, under some hypothesis on the graph, we show that each representation of the graph C*-algebra is permutative.
