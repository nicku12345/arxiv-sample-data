We continue our investigation on contractively complemented subspaces of noncommutative \mathrm{L}^p-spaces, started in [Arh1] and whose the description is explicitely asked in the seminal and influential work of Arazy and Friedman [Memoirs AMS 1992]. We show that the range of a contractively decomposable projection on an arbitrary noncommutative \mathrm{L}^p-space is completely isometrically isomorphic to some kind of \mathrm{L}^p-ternary ring of operators. In addition, we introduce the notion of n-pseudo-decomposable map where n is an integer and we essentially reduce the study of the contractively n-pseudo-decomposable projections on noncommutative \mathrm{L}^p-spaces to the study of weak* contractive projections on \mathrm{W}^*-ternary rings of operators. Our approach is independent of the one of Arazy and Friedman.
