A II_1 factor M has the {\it stable single generation} ({\it SSG}) property if any amplification M^t, t>0, can be generated as a von Neumann algebra by a single element. We discuss a conjecture stating that if M is SSG, then M has a {\it tight} decomposition, i.e., there exists a pair of hyperfinite II_1 subfactors R_0, R_1 \subset M such that R_0 \vee R_1^{op}=\Cal B(L^2M). We explain why this conjecture is interesting and discuss possible approaches to prove it. We also prove some related results.
