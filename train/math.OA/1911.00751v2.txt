The Clifford spectrum is an elegant way to define the joint spectrum of several Hermitian operators. While it has been know that for examples as small as three 2-by-2 matrices the Clifford spectrum can be a two-dimensional manifold, few concrete examples have been investigated. Our main goal is to generate examples of the Clifford spectrum of three or four matrices where, with the assistance of a computer algebra package, we can calculate the Clifford spectrum.
