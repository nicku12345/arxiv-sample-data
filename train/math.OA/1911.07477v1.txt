Let A and B be \sigma-unital C^*-algebras and X and Y an A-A-equivalence bimodule and a B-B-equivalence bimodule, respectively. Also, let A\rtimes_X \mathbb{Z} and B\rtimes_Y \mathbb{Z} be the crossed products of A and B by X and Y, respectively. Furthermore, let A\subset A\rtimes_X \mathbb{Z} and B\subset B\rtimes_Y \mathbb{Z} be the inclusions of C^*-algebras induced by X and Y, respectively. We suppose that A' \cap M(A\rtimes_X \mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{C} 1. In this paper we shall show that the inclusions A\subset A\rtimes_X \mathbb{Z} and B\subset B\rtimes_Y \mathbb{Z} are strongly Morita equivalent if and only if there is an A-B-equivalence bimodule M such that Y\cong \widetilde{M}\otimes_A X \otimes_A M or \widetilde{Y}\cong \widetilde{M}\otimes_A X \otimes_A M as B-B-equivalence bimodules, where \widetilde{M} and \widetilde{Y} are the dual B-A-equivalence bimodule and the dual B-B-equivalence bimodule of M and Y, respectively. Applying this result, we shall compute the Picard group of the inclusion A\subset A\rtimes_X \mathbb{Z} under the assumption that A' \cap M(A\rtimes_X \mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{C} 1.
