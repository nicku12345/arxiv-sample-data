In [10], Halmos proved an interesting result that the set of irreducible operators is dense in \mathcal B(\mathcal H) in the sense of Hilbert-Schmidt approximation. In a von Neumann algebra \mathcal M with separable predual, an operator a\in \mathcal M is said to be {irreducible in} \mathcal M if W^*(a) is an irreducible subfactor of \mathcal M, i.e., W^*(a)'\cap \mathcal M={\mathbb C} \cdot I. In this paper, let \Phi(\cdot) be a \Vert\cdot\Vert-dominating, unitarily invariant norm (see Definition 2.1), where by \Vert\cdot\Vert we denote the operator norm. We prove that in every semifinite von Neumann factor \mathcal M with separable predual, if the norm \Phi(\cdot) satisfies a natural restriction introduced in (1.1), then irreducible operators are \Phi(\cdot)-norm dense in \mathcal M. In particular, the operator norm \Vert\cdot\Vert and the \max\{\Vert\cdot\Vert, \Vert\cdot\Vert_p\}-norm (for each p>1) naturally satisfy the condition in (1.1), where \tau is a faithful, normal, semifinite, tracial weight and \Vert x\Vert_p=\tau(|x|^p)^{1/p} for all x\in \mathcal M \cap L^{p}(\mathcal M,\tau) (see [18, Preliminaries]). This can be viewed as a (stronger) analogue of a theorem of Halmos in [10], proved with different techniques developed in semifinite, properly infinite von Neumann factors.   Meanwhile, for every \Vert\cdot\Vert-dominating, unitarily invariant norm \Phi(\cdot), we develop another method to prove that each normal operator in \mathcal M is a sum of an irreducible operator in \mathcal M and an arbitrarily small \Phi(\cdot)-norm perturbation, where the \Phi(\cdot)-norm isn't restricted by (1.1). Particularly, the \Phi(\cdot)-norm can be the \max\{\Vert\cdot\Vert, \Vert\cdot\Vert_1\}-norm.
