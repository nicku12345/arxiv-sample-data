In the current article, we prove the cross product C^*-algebra by a Rokhlin action of finite group on a strongly quasidiagonal C^*-algbra is strongly quasidiagonal again. We also show that a just-infinite C^*-algebra is quasidiagonal if and only if it is inner quasidiagonal. Finally, we compute the topological free entropy dimension in just-infinite C^*-algebras.
