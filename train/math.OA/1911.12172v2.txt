We enlarge the class of C^*-algebras of Boolean dynamical systems in order to include all weakly left-resolving normal labelled space C^*-algebras in it. We prove a gauge-invariant uniqueness theorem and classify all gauge-invariant ideals of these C^*-algebras of generalized Boolean dynamical systems and describe the corresponding quotients as C^*-algebras of relative generalized Boolean dynamical systems.
