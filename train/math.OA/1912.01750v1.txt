We consider C^*-algebras constructed from compact group actions on complex vector bundles E\to X endowed with a Hermitian metric. An action of G by isometries on E\to X induces an action on the C^*-correspondence \Gamma(E) over C(X) consisting of continuous sections, and on the associated Cuntz-Pimsner algebra \mathcal O_E, so we can study the crossed product \mathcal O_E\rtimes G. If the action is free and rank E=n, then we prove that \mathcal O_E\rtimes G is Morita-Rieffel equivalent to a field of Cuntz algebras \mathcal O_n over the orbit space X/G. If the action is fiberwise, then \mathcal O_E\rtimes G becomes a continuous field of crossed products \mathcal O_n\rtimes G. For transitive actions, we show that \mathcal O_E\rtimes G is Morita-Rieffel equivalent to a graph C^*-algebra.
