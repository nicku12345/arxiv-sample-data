While Jordan algebras are commutative, their non-associativity makes it so that the Jordan product operators do not necessarily commute. When the product operators of two elements commute, the elements are said to operator commute. In some Jordan algebras operator commutation can be badly behaved, for instance having elements a and b operator commute, while a^2 and b do not operator commute. In this paper we study JB-algebras, real Jordan algebras which are also Banach spaces in a compatible manner, of which C*-algebras are examples. We show that elements a and b in a JB-algebra operator commute if and only if they span an associative sub-algebra of mutually operator commuting elements, and hence operator commutativity in JB-algebras is as well-behaved as it can be. Letting Q_a denote the quadratic operator of a, we also show that positive a and b operator commute if and only if Q_a b^2 = Q_b a^2. We use this result to conclude that the unit interval of a JB-algebra is a sequential effect algebra as defined by Gudder and Greechie.
