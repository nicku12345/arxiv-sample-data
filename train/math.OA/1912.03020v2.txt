We define norms on L_p(\mathcal{M}) \otimes M_n where \mathcal{M} is a von Neumann algebra and M_n is the complex n \times n matrices. We show that a linear map T: L_p(\mathcal{M}) \to L_q(\mathcal{N}) is decomposable if \mathcal{N} is an injective von Neumann algebra, the maps T \otimes Id_{M_n} have a common upper bound with respect to our defined norms, and p = \infty or q = 1. For 2p < q < \infty we give an example of a map T with uniformly bounded maps T \otimes Id_{M_n} which is not decomposable.
