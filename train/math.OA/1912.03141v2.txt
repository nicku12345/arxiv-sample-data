Given a right LCM semigroup S and a homomorphism N\colon S\to[1,+\infty), we use the groupoid approach to study the KMS_\beta-states on C^*(S) with respect to the dynamics induced by N. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of KMS_\beta-states. As an application, we show that the sufficient condition for the uniqueness obtained for so-called generalized scales is necessary as well. Our most complete results are obtained for inverse temperatures \beta at which the \zeta-function of N is finite. In this case we get an explicit bijective correspondence between the KMS_\beta-states on C^*(S) and the tracial states on C^*(\operatorname{ker} N).
