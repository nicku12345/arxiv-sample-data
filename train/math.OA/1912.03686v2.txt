Let A be a C^*-algebra and let D be a Cartan subalgebra of A. We study the following question: if B is a C^*-algebra such that D \subseteq B \subseteq A, is D a Cartan subalgebra of B? We give a positive answer in two cases: the case when there is a faithful conditional expectation from A onto B, and the case when A is nuclear and D is a C^*-diagonal of A. In both cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the intermediate C^*-algebras B, and a class of open subgroupoids of the groupoid G, where \Sigma \rightarrow G is the twist associated with the embedding D \subseteq A.
