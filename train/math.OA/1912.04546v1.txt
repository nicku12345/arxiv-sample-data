We show a close relationship between non-degenerate smooth commuting squares of II_1-factors with all inclusions of finite index and inclusions of subfactor planar algebras by showing that each leads to a construction of the other. One direction of this uses the Guionnet-Jones-Shlyakhtenko construction.
