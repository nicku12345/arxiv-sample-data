We investigate the use of Popa's asymptotic orthogonality to establish maximal amenability for amalgamated free product von Neumann algebras. Although new techniques have recently been developed to consider amalgamated free products, we find that the technique developed by Popa in the 1980s can be used to demonstrate maximal amenability for a certain family of amalgamated free product von Neumann algebras.
