Consider the pair (G,P) consisting of an abelian lattice-ordered discrete group G and its positive cone P. Let \alpha be an action of P by extendible endomorphisms of a C^*-algebra A. We show that the Nica-Toeplitz algebra \mathcal{T}_{\textrm{cov}}(A\times_{\alpha} P) is a full corner of a group crossed product \mathcal{B}\rtimes_{\beta}G, where \mathcal{B} is a subalgebra of \ell^{\infty}(G,A) generated by a collection of faithful copies of A, and the action \beta on \mathcal{B} is given by the shift on \ell^{\infty}(G,A). By using this realization, we show that the ideal \mathcal{I} of \mathcal{T}_{\textrm{cov}}(A\times_{\alpha} P) for which the quotient algebra \mathcal{T}_{\textrm{cov}}(A\times_{\alpha} P)/\mathcal{I} is the isometric crossed product A\times_{\alpha}^{\textrm{iso}} P is also a full corner in an ideal \mathcal{J}\rtimes_{\beta}G of \mathcal{B}\rtimes_{\beta}G.
