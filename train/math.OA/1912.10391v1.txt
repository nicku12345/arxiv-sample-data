For a conjugation C on a separable, infinite dimensional, complex Hilbert space \mathcal H, the set \mathcal{S}_C of C-symmetric operators on \mathcal H forms a weakly closed, selfadjoint, Jordan operator algebra, which has been studied under the name of Cartan factor of type II. We study \mathcal{S}_C in comparison with the algebra \mathcal{B(H)} of all bounded linear operators on \mathcal H, and develop some algebraic properties of \mathcal{S}_C as well as some properties of individual elements.   We determine the Jordan ideals of \mathcal{S}_C and their dual spaces. Jordan automorphisms of \mathcal{S}_C are classified. We describe C^*-algebras contained in \mathcal{S}_C and determine the C^*-algebra generated by \mathcal{S}_C. It is proved that invertible operators in \mathcal{S}_C constitute a dense, path connected subset of \mathcal{S}_C. We establish the Weyl-von Neumann-Berg Theorem in \mathcal{S}_C, that is, every normal operator in \mathcal{S}_C is the sum of a diagonal and a small compact operator in \mathcal{S}_C. As an application, it is proved that each operator in \mathcal{S}_C is a small compact perturbation of irreducible ones in \mathcal{S}_C. We discuss a Brown-Douglas-Fillmore type theorem for \mathcal{S}_C. We determine the spectra of Jordan multiplication operators on \mathcal{S}_C.
