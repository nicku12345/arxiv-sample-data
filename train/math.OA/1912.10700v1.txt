We define operator-valued Schur and Herz--Schur multipliers in terms of module actions, and show that the standard properties of these multipliers follow from well-known facts about these module actions and duality theory for group actions. These results are applied to study the Herz--Schur multipliers of an abelian group acting on its Pontryagin dual: it is shown that a natural subset of these Herz--Schur multipliers can be identified with the classical Herz--Schur multipliers of the direct product of the group with its dual group.
