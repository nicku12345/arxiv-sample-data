Suppose that X is a (real or complex) Banach space, dimX \geq 2, and \mathcal{N} is a nest on X, with each N in \mathcal{N} is complemented in X whenever N_{-}=N. A ternary derivation of Alg\mathcal{N} is a triple of linear maps (\gamma, \delta, \tau) of Alg\mathcal{N} such that \gamma(AB)=\delta(A)B +A\tau(B) for all A,B \in Alg\mathcal{N}. We show that for linear maps \delta, \tau on Alg\mathcal{N} there exists a unique linear map \gamma from Alg\mathcal{N} into Alg\mathcal{N} defined by \gamma(A)=RA+AT for some R, T in Alg\mathcal{N} such that (\gamma, \delta, \tau) is a ternary derivation of Alg\mathcal{N} if and only if \delta, \tau satisfy \delta(A)B+A\tau(B)=0 for any A,B in Alg\mathcal{N} with AB=0. We also prove that every ternary derivation on Alg\mathcal{N} is an inner ternary derivation. Our results are applied to characterize the (right or left) centralizers and derivations through zero products, local right (left) centralizers, right (left) ideal preserving maps and local derivations on nest algebras.
