Given a normal subgroup bundle \mathcal A of the isotropy bundle of a groupoid \Sigma, we obtain a twisted action of the quotient groupoid \Sigma/\mathcal A on the bundle of group C^*-algebras determined by \mathcal A whose twisted crossed product recovers the groupoid C^*-algebra C^*(\Sigma). Restricting to the case where \mathcal A is abelian, we describe C^*(\Sigma) as the C^*-algebra associated to a \mathbf T-groupoid over the tranformation groupoid obtained from the canonical action of \Sigma/\mathcal A on the Pontryagin dual space of \mathcal A. We give some illustrative examples of this result.
