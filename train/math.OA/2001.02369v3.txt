A Dirichlet operator algebra is a nonself-adjoint operator algebra \mathcal{A} with the property that \mathcal{A} + \mathcal{A}^* is norm-dense in the C^*-envelope of \mathcal{A}. We show that, under certain restrictions, \mathcal{A} has a family of completely contractive representations \{\pi_i\} with the property that the invariant subspaces of \pi_i(\mathcal{A}) are totally ordered, and such that, for all a \in \mathcal{A}, \ ||a|| = \sup_i ||\pi_i(a)||. The class of Dirichlet algebras includes strongly maximal triangular AF algebras, certain semicrossed product algebras, and gauge-invariant subalgebras of Cuntz C^*-algebras.   The main tool is the duality theory for essentially principal etale groupoids.
