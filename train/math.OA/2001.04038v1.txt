Given a directed graph E and a labeling \mathcal{L}, one forms the labeled graph C^*-algebra by taking a weakly left--resolving labeled space (E, \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{B}) and considering a universal generating family of partial isometries and projections. In this paper, we work on ideals for a labeled graph C^*-algebra when the graph contains sinks. Using some of the tools we build, we compute C^*(E, \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{B}) when E is a finite graph.
