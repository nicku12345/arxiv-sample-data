We give a number of equivalent conditions (including weak centrality) for a general C^*-algebra to have the centre-quotient property. We show that every C^*-algebra A has a largest weakly central ideal J_{wc}(A). For an ideal I of a unital C^*-algebra A, we find a necessary and sufficient condition for a central element of A/I to lift to a central element of A. This leads to a characterisation of the set V_A of elements of an arbitrary C^*-algebra A which prevent A from having the centre-quotient property. The complement \mathrm{CQ}(A):= A \setminus V_A always contains Z(A)+J_{wc}(A) (where Z(A) is the centre of A), with equality if and only if A/J_{wc}(A) is abelian. Otherwise, \mathrm{CQ}(A) fails spectacularly to be a C^*-subalgebra of A.
