In this paper we develop the notion of Herz-Schur multipliers to the context of Fell bundle, and we give a necessary and sufficient condition if the reduced cross-sectional C^{\ast}-algebra C_r^{\ast}(\mathfrak{B}) of Fell bundle \mathfrak{B} over discrete group G is nuclear in terms of this generalized notion. As an application, we prove that if C_r^{\ast}(\mathfrak{B}) is nuclear, then for any subgroup H \subset G, the C^{\ast}-algebra C_r^{\ast}(\mathfrak{B}_H) is nuclear.
