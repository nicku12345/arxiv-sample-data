Renault proved in 2008 that if G is a topologically principal groupoid, then C_0(G^{(0)}) is a Cartan subalgebra in C^*_r(G, \Sigma) for any twist \Sigma over G. However, there are many groupoids which are not topologically principal, yet their (twisted) C^*-algebras admit Cartan subalgebras. This paper gives a dynamical description of a class of such Cartan subalgebras, by identifying conditions on a 2-cocycle c on G and a subgroupoid S \subseteq G under which C^*_r(S, c) is Cartan in C^*_r(G, c). When G is a discrete group, we also describe the Weyl groupoid and twist associated to these Cartan pairs, under mild additional hypotheses.
