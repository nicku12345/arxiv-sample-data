Let A \subset C and B \subset D be unital inclusions of unital C^*-algebras. Let {}_A \mathbf{B}_A (C, A) (resp. {}_B \mathbf{B}_B (D, B)) be the space of all bounded A-bimodule (resp. B-bimodule) linear maps from C (resp. D) to A (resp. B). We suppose that A \subset C and B \subset D are strongly Morita equivalent. We shall show that there is an isometric isomorphism f of {}_A \mathbf{B}_A (C, A) onto {}_B \mathbf{B}_B (D, B) and we shall study on basic properties about f.
