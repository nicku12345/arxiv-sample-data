Classical pseudo-differential operators of order zero on a graded nilpotent Lie group G form a ^*-subalgebra \Psi^0_{c} of the bounded operators on L^2(G). We show that its C^*-closure C^*(\Psi^0_c) is as an extension of a noncommutative algebra of principal symbols C^*(\dot{S}_c^0) by compact operators. As a new approach, we use the generalized fixed point algebra of an \mathbb{R}_{>0}-action on a certain ideal in the C^*-algebra of the tangent groupoid of G. The action takes the graded structure of G into account. Our construction allows to compute the K-theory of the algebra of symbols C^*(\dot{S}_c^0).
