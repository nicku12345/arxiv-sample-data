The Local Lifting Property (LLP) is a localized version of projectivity for completely positive maps between \mathrm{C}^*-algebras. Outside of the nuclear case, very few \mathrm{C}^*-algebras are known to have the LLP. In this article, we show that the LLP holds for the algebraic contraction \mathrm{C}^*-algebras introduced by Hadwin and further studied by Loring and Shulman. We also show that the universal Pythagorean \mathrm{C}^*-algebras introduced by Brothier and Jones have the Lifting Property.
