We bound the nuclear dimension of crossed products associated to some partial actions of finite groups or \mathbb{Z} on finite dimensional locally compact Hausdorff second countable spaces. Our results apply to globalizable partial actions, finite group partial actions, minimal partial automorphisms, and partial automorphisms acting on zero-dimensional spaces, or a class of one dimensional spaces, containing 1-dimensional CW complexes. This extends work on global systems by Hirshberg and Wu.
