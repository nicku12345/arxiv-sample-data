Given a C^*-dynamical system (A,G,\alpha), with G a discrete group, Schur A-multipliers and Herz--Schur (A,G,\alpha)-multipliers are used to implement approximation properties, namely exactness and the strong operator approximation property (SOAP), of A \rtimes_{\alpha , r} G. The resulting characterisations of exactness and SOAP of A \rtimes_{\alpha , r} G generalise the corresponding statements for the reduced group C^*-algebra.
