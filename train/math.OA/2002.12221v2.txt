In this paper we show that for an almost finite minimal ample groupoid G, its reduced \mathrm{C}^*-algebra C_r^*(G) has real rank zero and strict comparison even though C_r^*(G) may not be nuclear in general. Moreover, if we further assume G being also second countable and non-elementary, then its Cuntz semigroup {\rm Cu}(C_r^*(G)) is almost divisible and {\rm Cu}(C_r^*(G)) and {\rm Cu}(C_r^*(G)\otimes \mathcal{Z}) are canonically order-isomorphic, where \mathcal{Z} denotes the Jiang-Su algebra.
