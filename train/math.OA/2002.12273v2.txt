We explore the optimality of the constants making valid the recently established Little Grothendieck inequality for JB^*-triples and JB^*-algebras. In our main result we prove that for each bounded linear operator T from a JB^*-algebra B into a complex Hilbert space H and \varepsilon>0, there is a norm-one functional \varphi\in B^* such that \|Tx\|\le(\sqrt{2}+\varepsilon)\|T\|\|x\|_\varphi\quad\mbox{ for }x\in B. The constant appearing in this theorem improves the best value known up to date (even for C^*-algebras). We also present an easy example witnessing that the constant cannot be strictly smaller than \sqrt2, hence our main theorem is `asymptotically optimal'. For type I JBW^*-algebras we establish a canonical decomposition of normal functionals which may be used to prove the main result in this special case and also seems to be of an independent interest. As a tool we prove a measurable version of the Schmidt representation of compact operators on a Hilbert space.
