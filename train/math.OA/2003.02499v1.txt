In this paper we extend the Pietsch correspondence for ideals of compact operators and traces on them to the semifinite setting. We prove that a shift-monotone space E(\Z) of sequences indexed by \Z defines a Calkin space E(\cM,\tau) of \tau-measurable operators affiliated with a semifinite von Neumann algebra \cM equipped with a faithful normal semifinite trace \tau. Furthermore, we show that shift-invariant functionals on E(\Z) generate symmetric functionals on E(\cM,\tau). In the special case, when the algebra \cM is atomless or atomic with atoms of equal trace, the converse also holds and we have a bijective correspondence between all shift-monotone spaces E(\Z) and Calkin spaces E(\cM,\tau) as well as a bijective correspondence between shift-invariant functionals on E(\Z) and symmetric functionals on E(\cM,\tau). The bijective correspondence E(\Z)\leftrightarrows E(\cM,\tau) extends to a correspondence between complete symmetrically \Delta-normed spaces E(\cM,\tau) and complete \Delta-normed shift-monotone spaces E(\Z).
