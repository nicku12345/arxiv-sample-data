We pose a conjecture on the K-theory of the self-similar k-graph C*-algebra of a standard product of odometers. We generalize the C*-algebra \mathcal{Q}_S to any subset of \mathbb{N}^\times \setminus \{1\} and then realize it as the self-similar k-graph C*-algebra of a standard product of odometers.
