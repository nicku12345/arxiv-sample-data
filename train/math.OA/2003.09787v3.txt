We establish four results concerning connections between actions on separable C*-algebras with Rokhlin-type properties and absorption of the Jiang-Su algebra Z. For actions of residually finite groups or of the reals which have finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers, we show that if the action of any nontrivial group element is approximately inner then the C*-algebra acted upon is Z-stable. Without the assumption on approximate innerness, we show that the crossed product has good divisibility properties under mild assumptions. We also establish an analogous result for the generalized tracial Rokhlin property and tracial versions of approximate innerness and Z-absorption for actions of finite groups and of the integers. For actions of a single automorphism which have the Rokhlin property, we show that a condition which is strictly weaker than requiring that some power of the automorphism is approximately inner is sufficient to obtain that the crossed product absorbs Z even when the original algebra is not.
