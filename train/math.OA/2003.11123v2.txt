Let A and A' be two Cstar-algebras with identities I_A and I_A', respectively, and P_1 and P_2 = I_A - P_1 nontrivial projections in A. In this paper we study the characterization of multiplicative star-Lie-Jordan-type maps, where the notion of these maps arise here. In particular, if M_A is a von Neumann algebra relative Cstar-algebra A without central summands of type I_1 then every bijective unital multiplicative star-Lie-Jordan-type maps are star-ring isomorphisms.
