We shall introduce a notion of free coactions of a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra on a C^*-algebra modifying a notion of free actions of a discrete group on a C^*-algebra and we shall study several properties on coactions of a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra on C^*-algebras, which are relating to strong Morita equivalence for inclusions of C^*-algebras.
