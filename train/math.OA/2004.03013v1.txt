Let X be a compact metric space, let A be a unital AH algebra with large matrix sizes, and let B be a stably finite unital C*-algebra.   Then we give a lower bound for the radius of comparison of C(X) \otimes B and prove that   the dimension-rank ratio satisfies \operatorname{drr} (A) = \operatorname{drr} \left(C(X)\otimes A\right). We also give a class of unital AH algebras A with \operatorname{rc} \left(C(X) \otimes A\right) = \operatorname{rc} (A). We further give a class of stably finite exact \mathcal{Z}-stable   unital C*-algebras with nonzero radius of comparison.
