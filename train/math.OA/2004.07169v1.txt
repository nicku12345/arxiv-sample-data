Let  G  be a locally compact group. We study the categories of  L^{\infty}(G) -comodules and  L(G) -comodules in the setting of dual operator spaces and the associated crossed products. It is proved that every  L^{\infty}(G) -comodule is non-degenerate and saturated, whereas every  L(G) -comodule is non-degenerate if and only if every  L(G) -comodule is saturated if and only if  G  has the approximation property in the sense of Haagerup and Kraus [14]. This allows us to extend known results from the duality theory of crossed products of von Neumann algebras (such as Takesaki-duality and the Digernes-Takesaki theorem) to the recent theory of crossed products of dual operator spaces. As applications, we obtain a characterization of groups with the approximation property in terms of the related crossed products improving a recent result of Crann and Neufang [9] and we generalize a theorem of Anoussis, Katavolos and Todorov [2] providing a less technical proof of it. Furthermore, this approach provides an answer to a question raised by the authors in [2].
