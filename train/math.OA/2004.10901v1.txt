We revisit the notion of tracial approximation for unital simple C*-algebras. We show that a unital simple separable C*-algebra A is asymptotically tracially in the class of C*-algebras with finite nuclear dimension if and only if A is asymptotically tracially in the class of simple nuclear Z-stable C*-algebras.
