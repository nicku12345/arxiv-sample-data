Anar A. Dosiev in [Local operator spaces, unbounded operators and multinormed C^*-algebras, J. Funct. Anal. 255 (2008), 1724-1760], obtained a Stinespring's theorem for local completely positive maps (in short: local CP-maps) on locally C^{\ast}-algebras. In this article a suitable notion of minimality for this construction has been identified so as to ensure uniqueness up to unitary equivalence for the associated representation. Using this a Radon-Nikodym type theorem for local completely positive maps has been proved.   Further, a Stinespring's theorem for unbounded operator valued local completely positive maps on Hilbert modules over locally C^{\ast}-algebras (also called as local CP-inducing maps) has been presented. Following a construction of M. Joi\c{t}a, a Radon-Nikodym type theorem for local CP-inducing maps has been shown. In both cases the Radon-Nikodym derivative obtained is a positive contraction on some complex Hilbert space with an upward filtered family of reducing subspaces.
