We introduce a subclass of recursive subhomogeneous algebras, in which each of the pullback maps is diagonal in a suitable sense. We define the notion of a diagonal map between two such algebras and show that every simple inductive limit of these algebras with diagonal maps has stable rank one. As an application, we prove that for any infinite compact metric space T and minimal homeomorphism h\colon T\to T, the associated dynamical crossed product \mathrm{C^*}(\mathbb{Z},T,h) has stable rank one. This affirms a conjecture of Archey, Niu, and Phillips. We also show that the Toms-Winter Conjecture holds for such crossed products.
