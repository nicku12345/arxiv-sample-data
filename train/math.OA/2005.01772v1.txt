We determine the structure of the weak*-closed G-invariant ideals in the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra B(G) of certain groups G by means of a K-theoretical obstruction. The groups to which this applies are groups whose only irreducible unitary representations that are not weakly contained in the left regular representation are class-one representations. In particular, this is the case for the groups \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) and \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C}), which we consider as explicit examples.
