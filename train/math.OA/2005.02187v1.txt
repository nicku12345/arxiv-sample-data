In this thesis we generalise the six-term exact sequence in graded KK-theory obtained in a paper of Kumjian, Pask and Sims (2017) to allow correspondences with non-compact left action. In particular, this allows us to compute the graded KK-theory of row-infinite graphs. We develop the theory necessary for following the arguments of Kumjian, Pask and Sims and of Pimsner (1997), with detailed sections on Hilbert modules, C^*-correspondences, Crossed products, Toeplitz algebras, Cuntz-Pimsner algebras and KK-theory.
