We give complete descriptions of the tracial states on both the universal and reduced crossed products of a C*-dynamical system consisting of a unital C*-algebra and a discrete group. In particular, we also answer the question of when the tracial states are in canonical bijection with the invariant tracial states on the original C*-algebra. This generalizes the unique trace property for discrete groups. The analysis simplifies greatly in various cases, for example when the conjugacy classes of the original group are all finite, and in other cases gives previously known results, for example when the original C*-algebra is commutative. We also obtain results and examples in the case of abelian groups that appear to contradict existing results in the literature.
