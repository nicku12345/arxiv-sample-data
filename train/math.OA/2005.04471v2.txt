In this paper, we construct, for a certain class of semigroup dynamical systems, two operator algebras that are universal with respect to their corresponding covariance conditions: one being self-adjoint, and another being non-self-adjoint. We prove that the C^*-envelope of the non-self-adjoint operator algebra is precisely the self-adjoint one. This result leads to a number of new examples of operator algebras and their C^*-envelopes, with many from number fields and commutative rings. We further establish the functoriality of these operator algebras along with their applications.
