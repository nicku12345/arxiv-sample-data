We investigate the pure infiniteness and stable finiteness of the Exel-Pardo C^*-algebras \mathcal{O}_{G,E} for countable self-similar graphs (G,E,\varphi). In particular, we associate a specific ordinary graph \widetilde{E} to (G,E,\varphi) such that some properties such as simpleness, stable finiteness or pure infiniteness of the graph C^*-algebra C^*(\widetilde{E}) imply that of \mathcal{O}_{G,E}. Among others, this follows a dichotomy for simple \mathcal{O}_{G,E}: if (G,E,\varphi) contains no G-circuits, then \mathcal{O}_{G,E} is stably finite; otherwise, \mathcal{O}_{G,E} is purely infinite.   Furthermore, Li and Yang recently introduced self-similar k-graph C^*-algebras \mathcal{O}_{G,\Lambda}. We also show that when |\Lambda^0|<\infty and \mathcal{O}_{G,\Lambda} is simple, then it is purely infinite.
