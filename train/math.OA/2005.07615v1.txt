In this paper we introduce primigraph spaces, which are topological spaces together with a sheaf of C^*-algebras that can be covered by some Prim A's, that is, by the primitive spectra of some C^*-algebras endowed with Jacobson topology and together with the sheaf of bounded continuous functions on them. This notion is analoguous, in some sense, to the ones of schemes and perfectoid spaces. Our first main result here is that every topological space gives rise to a primigraph space; this will imply, thanks to Theorem 4.1, that primigraph spaces also constitute a new kind of topological invariant.
