Suppose A is a unital subhomogeneous C*-algebra. We show that every central sequence in A is hypercentral if and only if every pointwise limit of a sequence of irreducible representations is multiplicity free. We also show that every central sequence in A is trivial if and only if every pointwise limit of irreducible representations is irreducible. We also give a nice repesentation of the latter algebras.
