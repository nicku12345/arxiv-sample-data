The class of AD algebras of real rank zero is classified by an exact sequence of K-groups with coefficients, equipped with certain order structures. Such a sequence is always split, and one may ask why, then, the middle group is relevant for classification. The answer is that the splitting map can not always be chosen to respect the order structures involved.   This may be rephrased in terms of the ideals of the C*-algebras in question. We prove that when the C*-algebra has only finitely many ideals, a splitting map respecting these always exists. Hence AD algebras of real rank zero with finitely many ideals are classified by (classical) ordered K-theory. We also indicate how the methods generalize to the full class of ASH algebras with slow dimension growth and real rank zero.
