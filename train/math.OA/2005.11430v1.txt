Let \mathfrak{A} and \mathfrak{A}' be two C^*-algebras with identities I_{\mathfrak{A}} and I_{\mathfrak{A}'}, respectively, and P_1 and P_2 = I_{\mathfrak{A}} - P_1 nontrivial projections in \mathfrak{A}. In this paper we study the characterization of multiplicative *-Jordan-type maps. In particular, if \mathcal{M} is a factor von Neumann algebra then every bijective unital multiplicative *-Jordan-type maps are *-ring isomorphisms.
