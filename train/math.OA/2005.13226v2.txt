For any injective von Neumann algebra R and any discrete, countable group G, which acts by *-automorphisms on R, we construct an idempotent mapping of an ultra-weakly dense subspace of B(H) onto the reducerd crossed product von Neumann algebra, such that it is R-bimodular and satisfies some nice relations with respect to positivity. In the case of an amenable group our unbounded expectation turns into a usual conditional expectation of norm 1.
