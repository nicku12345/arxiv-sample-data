We classify all essential extensions of the form 0 \rightarrow \W \rightarrow \D \rightarrow A \rightarrow 0 where \W is the unique separable simple C*-algebra with a unique tracial state, with finite nuclear dimension and with K_i(\W)=\{0\} (i=0,1) which satisfies the Universal Coefficient theorem (UCT), and A is a separable amenable \W-embeddable C*-algebra which satisfies the UCT. We actually prove more general results.   We also classify a class of amenable \CA s which have only one proper closed ideal \W.
