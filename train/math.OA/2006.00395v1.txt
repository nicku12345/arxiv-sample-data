Let C^*(E) be the graph C^*-algebra of a row-finite graph E. We give a complete description of the vertex sets of the gauge-invariant regular ideals of C^*(E). It is shown that when E satisfies Condition (L) the regular ideals C^*(E) are a class of gauge-invariant ideals which preserve Condition (L) under quotients. That is, we show that if E satisfies Condition (L) then a regular ideal J \unlhd C^*(E) is necessarily gauge-invariant. Further, if J \unlhd C^*(E) is a regular ideal, it is shown that C^*(E)/J \simeq C^*(F) where F satisfies Condition (L).
