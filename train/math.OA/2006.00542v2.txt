We study the general and connected stable ranks for C^{\ast}-algebras. We estimate these ranks for certain C(X)-algebras, and use that to do the same for certain group C^{\ast}-algebras. Furthermore, we also give estimates for the ranks of crossed product C^{\ast}-algebras by finite group actions with the Rokhlin property.
