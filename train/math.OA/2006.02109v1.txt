We introduce the quantum Cayley graphs associated to quantum discrete groups and study them in the case of trees. We focus in particular on the notion of quantum ascending orientation and describe the associated space of edges at infinity, which is an outcome of the non-involutivity of the edge-reversing operator and vanishes in the classical case. We end with applications to Property AO and K-theory.
