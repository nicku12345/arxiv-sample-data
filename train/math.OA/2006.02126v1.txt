The basic notions and results of equivariant KK-theory concerning crossed products can be extended to the case of locally compact quantum groups. We recall these constructions and prove some usefull properties of subgroups and amalgamated free products of discrete quantum groups. Using these properties and a quantum analogue of the Bass-Serre tree, we establish the K-amenability of amalgamated free products of amenable discrete quantum groups.
