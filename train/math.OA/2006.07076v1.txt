We study the quantum (C^*) convexity structure of normalized positive operator valued measures (POVMs) on measurable spaces. In particular, it is seen that unlike extreme points under classical convexity, C^*-extreme points of normalized POVMs on countable spaces (in particular for finite sets) are always spectral measures (normalized projection valued measures). More generally it is shown that atomic C^*-extreme points are spectral. A Krein-Milman type theorem for POVMs has also been proved. As an application it is shown that a map on any commutative unital C^*-algebra with countable spectrum (in particular {\mathbb C}^n) is C^*-extreme in the set of unital completely positive maps if and only if it is a unital *-homomorphism.
