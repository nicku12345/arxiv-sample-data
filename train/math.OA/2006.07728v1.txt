It is shown that for any approximately central (AC) projection e in the Flip orbifold A_\theta^\Phi (of the irrational rotation C*-algebra A_\theta), and any modular automorphism \alpha (arising from SL(2,\mathbb Z)), the AC projection \alpha(e) is centrally Murray-von Neumann equivalent to one of the projections e,\ \sigma(e),\ \kappa(e),\ \kappa^2(e), \sigma\kappa(e),\ \sigma\kappa^2(e) in the S_3-orbit of e, where \sigma, \kappa are the Fourier and Cubic transforms of A_\theta. (The equivalence being implemented by an approximately central partial isometry in A_\theta^\Phi.) For smooth automorphisms \alpha,\beta of the Flip orbifold A_\theta^\Phi, it is also shown that if \alpha_*=\beta_* on K_0(A_\theta^\Phi), then \alpha(e) and \beta(e) are centrally equivalent for each AC projection e.
