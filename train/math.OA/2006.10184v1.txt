Let E be a W^{*}-correspondence and let H^{\infty}(E) be the associated Hardy algebra. The unit disc of intertwiners \mathbb{D}((E^{\sigma})^{*}) plays a central role in the study of H^{\infty}(E). We show a number of results related to the automorphism groups of both H^{\infty}(E) and \mathbb{D}((E^{\sigma})^{*}). We find a matrix representation for these groups and describe several features of their algebraic structure. Furthermore, we show an application of Aut(\mathbb{D}({(E^{\sigma}})^*)) to the study of Morita equivalence of W^{*}-correspondences.
