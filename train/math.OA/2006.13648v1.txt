Recently, Brannan and Vergnioux showed that the free orthogonal quantum group factors \mathcal{L}\mathbb{F}O_M have Jung's strong 1-boundedness property, and hence are not isomorphic to free group factors. We prove an analogous result for the other unimodular case, where the parameter matrix is the standard symplectic matrix in 2N dimensions J_{2N}. We compute free derivatives of the defining relations by introducing self-adjoint generators through a decomposition of the fundamental representation in terms of Pauli matrices, resulting in 1-boundedness of these generators. Moreover, we prove that under certain conditions, one can add elements to a 1-bounded set without losing 1-boundedness. In particular this allows us to include the character of the fundamental representation, proving strong 1-boundedness.
