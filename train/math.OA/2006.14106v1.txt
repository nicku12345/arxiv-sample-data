We introduce certain C^*-algebras and k-graphs associated to k finite dimensional unitary representations \rho_1,...,\rho_k of a compact group G. We define a higher rank Doplicher-Roberts algebra \mathcal{O}_{\rho_1,...,\rho_k}, constructed from intertwiners of tensor powers of these representations. Under certain conditions, we show that this C^*-algebra is isomorphic to a corner in the C^*-algebra of a row finite rank k graph \Lambda with no sources. For G finite and \rho_i faithful of dimension at least 2, this graph is irreducible, it has vertices \hat{G} and the edges are determined by k commuting matrices obtained from the character table of the group. We illustrate with some examples when \mathcal{O}_{\rho_1,...,\rho_k} is simple and purely infinite, and with some K-theory computations.
