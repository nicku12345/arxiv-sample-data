In this paper, we answer a question of Blecher-Muhly-Paulsen pertaining to identifying topological invariants for completely bounded Morita equivalences of holomorphic cross-section algebras. Given a certain natural subcontext of a strong Morita context of n-homogeneous C^*-algebras whose spectrum T is an annulus, Blecher-Muhly-Paulsen are able to estimate the norm of a lifting of the identity of a holomorphic subalgebra by a conformal invariant of the annulus and a property of the associated matrix bundle. We give a generalization of the above example in which T is a bordered Riemann surface. While constructing this generalization, we develop a sufficient criterion for when a unital completely bounded Morita equivalence can be factored into a similarity and a strong Morita equivalence.
