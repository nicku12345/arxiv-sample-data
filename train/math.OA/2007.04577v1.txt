For any semifinite von Neumann algebra {\mathcal M} and any 1\leq p<\infty, we introduce a natutal S^1-valued noncommutative L^p-space L^p({\mathcal M};S^1). We say that a bounded map T\colon L^p({\mathcal M})\to L^p({\mathcal N}) is S^1-bounded (resp. S^1-contractive) if T\otimes I_{S^1} extends to a bounded (resp. contractive) map T\overline{\otimes} I_{S^1} from  L^p({\mathcal M};S^1) into L^p({\mathcal N};S^1). We show that any completely positive map is S^1-bounded, with \Vert T\overline{\otimes} I_{S^1}\Vert =\Vert T\Vert. We use the above as a tool to investigate the separating maps T\colon L^p({\mathcal M})\to L^p({\mathcal N}) which admit a direct Yeadon type factorization, that is, maps for which there exist a w^*-continuous *-homomorphism J\colon{\mathcal M}\to{\mathcal N}, a partial isometry w\in{\mathcal N} and a positive operator B affiliated with {\mathcal N} such that w^*w=J(1)=s(B), B commutes with the range of J, and T(x)=wBJ(x) for any x\in {\mathcal M}\cap L^p({\mathcal M}). Given a separating isometry T\colon L^p({\mathcal M})\to L^p({\mathcal N}), we show that T is S^1-contractive if and only if it admits a direct Yeadon type factorization. We further show that if p\not=2, the above holds true if and only if T is completely contractive.
