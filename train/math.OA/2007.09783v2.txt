Let G be a finite group, let A be an infinite-dimensional stably finite simple unital C*-algebra, and let \alpha \colon G \to \operatorname{Aut} (A) be a tracially strictly approximately inner action of G on A. Then the radius of comparison satisfies \operatorname{rc} (A) \leq \operatorname{rc} \big( C^*(G, A, \alpha) \big) and if C^*(G, A, \alpha) is simple, then \operatorname{rc} (A) \leq \operatorname{rc} \big( C^*(G, A, \alpha) \big) \leq \operatorname{rc} (A^{\alpha}). Further, the inclusion of A in C^*(G, A, \alpha) induces an isomorphism from the purely positive part of the Cuntz semigroup \operatorname{Cu} (A) to its image in \operatorname{Cu} \left(C^*(G, A, \alpha)\right). If \alpha is strictly approximately inner, then in fact \operatorname{Cu} (A) \to \operatorname{Cu} \left(C^*(G, A, \alpha) \right) is an ordered semigroup isomorphism onto its range. Also, for every finite group G and for every \eta \in \left(0, \frac{1}{\operatorname{card} (G)}\right), we construct a simple separable unital AH algebra A with stable rank one and a strictly approximately inner action \alpha \colon G \to \operatorname{Aut} (A) such that:   (1) \alpha is pointwise outer and doesn't have the weak tracial Rokhlin property.   (2) \operatorname{rc} (A) =\operatorname{rc} \left(C^*(G, A, \alpha)\right)= \eta.
