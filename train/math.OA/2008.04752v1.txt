Let P be a closed convex cone in \mathbb{R}^d which is assumed to be spanning \mathbb{R}^d and contains no line. In this article, we consider a family of CAR flows over P and study the decomposability of the associated product systems. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for CAR flow to be decomposable. As a consequence we show that there are uncountable many CAR flows which are cocycle conjugate to the corresponding CCR flows.
