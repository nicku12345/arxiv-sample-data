Suppose \mathcal{A} is a separable unital ASH C*-algebra, \mathcal{R} is a sigma-finite II_{\infty} factor von Neumann algebra, and \pi,\rho :\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{R} are unital \ast-homomorphisms such that, for every a\in\mathcal{A}, the range projections of \pi\left( a\right)  and \rho\left( a\right)  are Murray von Neuman equivalent in \mathcal{R}% . We prove that \pi and \rho are approximately unitarily equivalent modulo \mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{R}}, where \mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{R}} is the norm closed ideal generated by the finite projections in \mathcal{R}. We also prove a very general result concerning approximate equivalence in arbitrary finite von Neumann algebras.
