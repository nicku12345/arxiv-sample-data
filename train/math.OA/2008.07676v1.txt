We show that Bunce-Deddens algebras, which are AT-algebras, are also limits of circle algebras for Rieffel's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance, and moreover, form a continuous family indexed by the Baire space. To this end, we endow Bunce-Deddens algebras with a quantum metric structure, a step which requires that we reconcile the constructions of the Latremoliere's Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity and Rieffel's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance when working on order-unit quantum metric spaces. This work thus continues the study of the connection between inductive limits and metric limits.
