We discuss the relative K-theory for a C^{*}-algebra, A, together with a C^{*}-subalgebra, A' \subseteq A. The relative group is denoted K_{i}(A';A), i = 0, 1, and is due to Karoubi. We present a situation of two pairs A' \subseteq A and B' \subseteq B are related so that there is a natural isomorphism between their respective relative K-theories. We also discuss applications to the case where A and B are C^{*}-algebras of a pair of locally compact, Hausdorff topological groupoids, with Haar systems.
