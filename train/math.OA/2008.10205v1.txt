We classify outer actions (or \mathscr{G}-kernels) of discrete amenable groupoids on injective factors. Our method based on unified approach for classification of discrete amenable groups actions, and cohomology reduction theorem of discrete amenable equivalence relations. We do not use Katayama-Takesaki type resolution group approach.
