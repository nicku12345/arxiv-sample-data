Combing Elliott, Gong, Lin and Niu's result and Castillejos and Evington's result, we see that if A is a simple separable nuclear monotracial C^*-algebra, then A\otimes\mathcal{W} is isomorphic to \mathcal{W} where \mathcal{W} is the Razak-Jacelon algebra. In this paper, we give another proof of this. In particular, we show that if \mathcal{D} is a simple separable nuclear monotracial M_{2^{\infty}}-stable C^*-algebra which is KK-equivalent to \{0\}, then \mathcal{D} is isomorphic to \mathcal{W} without considering tracial approximations of C^*-algebras with finite nuclear dimension. Our proof is based on Matui and Sato's technique, Schafhauser's idea in his proof of the Tikuisis-White-Winter theorem and properties of Kirchberg's central sequence C^*-algebra F(\mathcal{D}) of \mathcal{D}. Note that some results for F(\mathcal{D}) is based on Elliott-Gong-Lin-Niu's stable uniqueness theorem. Also, we characterize \mathcal{W} by using properties of F(\mathcal{W}). Indeed, we show that a simple separable nuclear monotracial C^*-algebra D is isomorphic to \mathcal{W} if and only if D satisfies the following properties:(i) for any \theta\in [0,1], there exists a projection p in F(D) such that \tau_{D, \omega}(p)=\theta,(ii) if p and q are projections in F(D) such that 0<\tau_{D, \omega}(p)=\tau_{D, \omega}(q), then p is Murray-von Neumann equivalent to q,(iii) there exists a homomorphism from D to \mathcal{W}.
