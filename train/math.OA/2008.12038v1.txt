Using a non-negative curvature condition, we prove the complete version of modified log-Sobolev inequalities for central Markov semigroups on various compact quantum groups, including group von Neumann algebras, free orthogonal group and quantum automorphism groups. We also prove that the "geometric Ricci curvature lower bound" introduced by Junge-Li-LaRacuente is stable under tensor products and amalgamated free products. As an application, we obtain the geometric Ricci curvature lower bound and complete modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for word-length semigroups on free group factors and amalgamated free product algebras.
