We give a decomposition of the equivariant Kasparov category for discrete quantum group with torsions. As an outcome, we show that the crossed product by a discrete quantum group in a certain class preserves the UCT. We then show that quasidiagonality of a reduced C*-algebra of a countable discrete quantum group \Gamma implies that \Gamma is amenable, and deduce from the work of Tikuisis, White and Winter, and the results in the first part of the paper, the converse (i.e. the quantum Rosenberg Conjecture) for a large class of countable discrete unimodular quantum groups. We also note that the unimodularity is a necessary condition.
