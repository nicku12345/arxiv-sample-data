Given a Fell bundle \mathcal{B} (saturated or not) over G and a closed subgroup H\subset G, we prove that any *-representation of the reduction \mathcal{B}_H can be induced to \mathcal{B}. We observe that Exel-Ng's reduced cross sectional C*-algebra C^*_r(\mathcal{B}) is universal for the *-representations induced from B_e=\mathcal{B}_{\{e\}} and construct a cross sectional C*-algebra of \mathcal{B}, C^*_H(\mathcal{B}), that is universal for the *-representations induced from \mathcal{B}_H. We prove an absorption principle for C^*_H(\mathcal{B}) with respect to tensor products of *-representations of \mathcal{B} and *-representations of G induced from H. Using this principle we show, among other results, that given closed normal subgroups of G, H\subset K, there exists a quotient map q^{\mathcal{B}}_{KH}\colon C^*_K(\mathcal{B})\to C^*_H(\mathcal{B}) which is a C*-isomorphism if and only if q^{\mathcal{B}_K}_{KH}\colon C^*(\mathcal{B}_K)\to C^*_H(\mathcal{B}_K) is a C*-isomorphism. We also prove the two conditions above hold if q^G_{KH}\colon C^*_K(G)\to C^*_H(G) is a C*-isomorphism. All the constructions are performed using Banach *-algebraic bundles having a strong approximate unit.
