We study Borel homomorphisms \theta : G\rightarrow H for arbitrary locally compact second countable groups G and H for which the measure \theta_*(\mu )(\alpha )=\mu (\theta ^{-1}(\alpha ))\quad \text{for } \quad \alpha \subseteq H  is absolutely continuous with respect to \nu, where \mu  (resp. \nu ) is a Haar measure for G, (resp. H).   We define a natural mapping \mathcal G from the class of maximal abelian selfadjoint algebra bimodules (masa bimodules) in B(L^2(H)) into the class of masa bimodules in B(L^2(G)) and we use it to prove that if k\subseteq G\times G is a set of operator synthesis, then (\theta \times \theta)^{-1} (k) is also a set of operator synthesis and if E\subseteq H is a set of local synthesis for the Fourier algebra A(H), then \theta ^{-1}(E)\subseteq G is a set of local synthesis for A(G). We also prove that if \theta ^{-1}(E) is an M-set (resp. M_1-set), then E is an M-set (resp. M_1-set) and if Bim(I^\bot ) is the masa bimodule generated by the annihilator of the ideal I in VN(G), then there exists an ideal J such that \mathcal G(Bim(I^\bot ))=Bim(J^\bot ). If this ideal J is an ideal of multiplicity then I is an ideal of multiplicity. In case \theta_*(\mu ) is a Haar measure for \theta (G) we show that J is equal to the ideal \rho_*(I) generated by \rho (I), where \rho (u)=u\circ \theta , \;\;\forall \;u\;\in \;I.
