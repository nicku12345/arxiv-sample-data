Let A\subset C and B\subset D be inclusions of C^*-algebras with \overline{AC}=C, \overline{BD}=D. Let {}_A \mathbf{B}_A (C, A) (resp. {}_B \mathbf{B}_B (D, B)) be the space of all bounded A-bimodule (resp. B-bimodule) linear maps from C (resp. D) to A (resp. B). We suppose that A\subset C and B\subset D are strongly Morita equivalent. In this paper, we shall show that there is an isometric isomorphism f of {}_B \mathbf{B}_B (D, B) onto {}_A \mathbf{B}_A (C, A) and we shall study on basic properties about f. And, we define the Picard group for a bimodule linear map and discuss on the Picard group of a bimodule linear map.
