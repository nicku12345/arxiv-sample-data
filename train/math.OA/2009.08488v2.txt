We construct a functor that maps C^*-correspondences to their Cuntz-Pimsner algebras. The objects in our domain category are C^*-correspondences, and the morphisms are the isomorphism classes of C^*-correspondences satisfying certain conditions. As an application, we recover a well-known result of Muhly and Solel. In fact, we show that functoriality leads us to a more generalized result: strongly Morita equivalent C^*-correspondences have Morita equivalent Cuntz-Pimsner algebras.
