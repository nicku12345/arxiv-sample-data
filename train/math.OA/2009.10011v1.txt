Given a Galois covering of complete spin manifolds where the base metric has PSC near infinity, we prove that for small enough epsilon > 0, the epsilon spectral projection of the Dirac operator has finite trace in the Atiyah von Neumann algebra. This allows us to define the L2 index in the even case and we prove its compatibility with the Xie-Yu higher index. We also deduce L2 versions of the classical Gromov-Lawson relative index theorems. Finally, we briefly discuss some Gromov-Lawson L2 invariants.
