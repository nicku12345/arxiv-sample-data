We introduce the notion of \Delta and \sigma\,\Delta- pairs for operator algebras and characterise \Delta- pairs through their categories of left operator modules over these algebras. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of \Delta-Morita equivalent operator spaces and prove a similar theorem about their algebraic extensions. We prove that \sigma\Delta-Morita equivalent operator spaces are stably isomorphic and vice versa. Finally, we study unital operator spaces, emphasising their left (resp. right) multiplier algebras, and prove theorems that refer to \Delta-Morita equivalence of their algebraic extensions.
