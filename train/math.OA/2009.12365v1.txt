We construct centrally large subalgebras in crossed products of C (X, D) by automorphisms in which D is simple, X is compact metrizable, the automorphism induces a minimal homeomorphism of X, and a mild technical assumption holds. We use this construction to prove structural properties of the crossed product, such as (tracial) Z-stability, stable rank one, real rank zero, and pure infiniteness, in a number of examples. Our examples are not accessible via methods based on finite Rokhlin dimension, either because D is not Z-stable or because X is infinite dimensional.
