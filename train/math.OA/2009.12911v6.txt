We characterize the lifting property (LP) of a separable C^*-algebra A by a property of its maximal tensor product with other C^*-algebras, namely we prove that A has the LP if and only if for any family (\{D_i\mid i\in I\} of C^*-algebras the canonical map  {\ell_\infty(\{D_i\}) \otimes_{\max} A}\to {\ell_\infty(\{D_i \otimes_{\max} A\}) } is isometric. Equivalently, this holds if and only if M \otimes_{\max} A= M \otimes_{\rm nor} A for any von Neumann algebra M.
