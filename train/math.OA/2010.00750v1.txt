We investigate an invariant for continuous fields of the Cuntz algebra \mathcal{O}_{n+1} introduced in our previous work, and find a way to obtain a continuous field of \mathbb{M}_n(\mathcal{O}_\infty) from that of \mathcal{O}_{n+1} using the construction of the invariant. By Brown's representability theorem, this gives a bijection from the set of the isomorphism classes of continuous fields of \mathcal{O}_{n+1} to those of \mathbb{M}_n(\mathcal{O}_\infty). As a consequence, we obtain a new proof for M. Dadarlat's classification result of continuous fields of \mathcal{O}_{n+1} arising from vector bundles, which corresponds to those of \mathbb{M}_n(\mathcal{O}_\infty) stably isomorphic to the trivial field.
