We show that two separable stably projectionless simple C*-algebras A and B with gTR(A) \le 1 and gTR(B) \le 1 which satisfy the UCT are isomorphic if and only if they have the isomorphic Elliott invariant. A description of Elliott invariant is given. We show all possible simple scaled Elliott invariants can be reached by C*-algebras in the class. We show that these results imply that two separable simple C*-algebras with stable rank one and finite nuclear dimension which satisfy the UCT are isomorphic if and only if they have the same Elliott invariant.
