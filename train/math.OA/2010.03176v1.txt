The present paper is devoted to study of ring isomorphisms of \ast-subalgebras of Murray--von Neumann factors. Let \cM, \cN be von Neumann factors of type II_1, and let S(\cM), S(\cN) be the \ast-algebras of all measurable operators affiliated with \cM and  \cN, respectively. Suppose that \cA\subset S(\cM), \cB\subset S(\cN) are their \ast-subalgebras such that \cM\subset \cA, \cN\subset \cB. We prove that for every ring isomorphism \Phi: \cA \to \cB there exist a positive invertible element a \in \cB with a^{-1}\in \cB and a real \ast-isomorphism \Psi: \cM \to \cN (which extends to a real \ast-isomorphism from \cA onto \cB) such that \Phi(x) = a\Psi(x)a^{-1} for all x \in \cA. In particular, \Phi is real-linear and continuous in the measure topology. In particular, noncommutative Arens algebras and noncommutative \cL_{log}-algebras associated with von Neumann factors of type II_1 satisfy the above conditions and the main Theorem implies the automatic continuity of their ring isomorphisms in the corresponding metrics. We also present an example of a \ast-subalgebra in S(\cM), which shows that the condition \cM\subset \cA is essential in the above mentioned result.
