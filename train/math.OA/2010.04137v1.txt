When the reduced twisted C^*-algebra C^*_r(\mathcal{G}, c) of a non-principal groupoid \mathcal{G} admits a Cartan subalgebra, Renault's work on Cartan subalgebras implies the existence of another groupoid description of C^*_r(\mathcal{G}, c). In an earlier paper, joint with Reznikoff and Wright, we identified situations where such a Cartan subalgebra arises from a subgroupoid \mathcal{S} of \mathcal{G}. In this paper, we study the relationship between the original groupoids \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{G} and the Weyl groupoid and twist associated to the Cartan pair. We first identify the spectrum \mathfrak{B} of the Cartan subalgebra C^*_r(\mathcal{S}, c). We then show that the quotient groupoid \mathcal{G}/\mathcal{S} acts on \mathfrak{B}, and that the corresponding action groupoid is exactly the Weyl groupoid of the Cartan pair. Lastly we show that, if the quotient map \mathcal{G}\to\mathcal{G}/\mathcal{S} admits a continuous section, then the Weyl twist is also given by an explicit continuous 2-cocycle on \mathcal{G}/\mathcal{S} \ltimes \mathfrak{B}.
