Let M be a type {\rm II} factor and let \tau be the faithful positive semifinite normal trace, unique up to scalar multiples in the type {\rm II}_\infty case and normalized by \tau(I)=1 in the type {\rm II}_1 case. Given A\in M^+, we denote by A_+=(A-I)\chi_A(1,\|A\|] the excess part of A and by A_-=(I-A)\chi_A(0,1) the defect part of A. V. Kaftal, P. Ng and S. Zhang provided necessary and sufficient conditions for a positive operator to be the sum of a finite or infinite collection of projections (not necessarily mutually orthogonal) in type {\rm I} and type {\rm III} factors. For type {\rm II} factors, V. Kaftal, P. Ng and S. Zhang proved that \tau(A_+)\geq \tau(A_-) is a necessary condition for an operator A\in M^+ which can be written as the sum of a finite or infinite collection of projections and also sufficient if the operator is "diagonalizable". In this paper, we prove that if A\in M^+ and \tau(A_+)\geq \tau(A_-), then A can be written as the sum of a finite or infinite collection of projections. This result answers affirmatively a question raised by V. Kaftal, P. Ng and S. Zhang.
