Let A be a separable simple exact {\cal Z}-stable C^*-algebra. We show that the unitay group of {\tilde A} has the cancellation property. If A has continuous scale, the Cuntz semigroup of \tilde A has the strict comparison property and a weak cancellation property. Let C be a 1-dimensional non-commutative CW complex with K_1(C)=\{0\}. Suppose that \lambda: {\rm Cu}^\sim(C)\to {\rm Cu}^\sim(A) is a morphism in Cuntz semigroups which is strictly positive. Then there exists a sequence of homomorphisms \phi_n: C\to A such that \lim_{n\to\infty}{\rm Cu}^\sim(\phi_n)=\lambda. This result leads to the proof that every separable amenable simple C^*-algebra in the UCT class has rationally generalized tracial rank at most one.
