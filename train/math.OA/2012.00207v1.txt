Let G be a group and X be a product system over a semigroup P. Suppose G has a left action on P and P has a right action on G, so that one can form a Zappa-Sz\'ep product P\bowtie G. We define a Zappa-Sz\'ep action of G on X to be a collection of functions on X that are compatible with both actions from P\bowtie G in a certain sense. Given a Zappa-Sz\'ep action of G on X, we construct a new product system X\bowtie G over P\bowtie G, called the Zappa-Sz\'ep product of X by G. We then associate to X\bowtie G several universal C*-algebras and prove their respective Hao-Ng type isomorphisms. A special case of interest is when a Zappa-Sz\'{e}p action is homogeneous. This case naturally generalizes group actions on product systems in the literature. For this case, besides the Zappa-Sz\'ep product system X\bowtie G, one can also construct a new type of Zappa-Sz\'{e}p product X \widetilde\bowtie G over P. Some essential differences arise between these two types of Zappa-Sz\'ep product systems and their associated C*-algebras.
