Let \mathcal{M} be a type {\rm II_1} factor and let \tau be the faithful normal tracial state on \mathcal{M}. In this paper, we prove that given an X \in \mathcal{M}, X=X^*, then there is a decomposition of the identity into N \in \mathbb{N} mutually orthogonal nonzero projections E_j\in\mathcal{M}, I=\sum_{j=1}^NE_j, such that E_jXE_j=\tau(X) E_j for all j=1,\cdots,N. Equivalently, there is a unitary operator U \in \mathcal{M} with U^N=I and \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}{U^*}^jXU^j=\tau(X)I. As the first application, we prove that a positive operator A\in \mathcal{M} can be written as a finite sum of projections in \mathcal{M} if and only if \tau(A)\geq \tau(R_A), where R_A is the range projection of A. This result answers affirmatively Question 6.7 of [9]. As the second application, we show that if X\in \mathcal{M}, X=X^* and \tau(X)=0, then there exists a nilpotent element Z \in \mathcal{M} such that X is the real part of Z. This result answers affirmatively Question 1.1 of [4]. As the third application, we show that let X_1,\cdots,X_n\in \mathcal{M}. Then there exist unitary operators U_1,\cdots,U_k\in\mathcal{M} such that \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^kU_i^{-1}X_jU_i=\tau(X_j)I,\quad \forall 1\leq j\leq n. This result is a stronger version of Dixmier's averaging theorem for type {\rm II}_1 factors.
