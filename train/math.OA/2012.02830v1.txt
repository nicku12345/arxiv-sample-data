We show that if every element a vector subspace of a C*-algebra can be averaged to zero by means of unitary mixing operators, then all the elements of the subspace can be simultaneously averaged to zero by a net of unitary mixing operators. Moreover, such subspaces admit a simple description in terms of commutators and kernels of states on the C*-algebra. We apply this result to center-valued expectations in C*-algebras with the Dixmier property.
