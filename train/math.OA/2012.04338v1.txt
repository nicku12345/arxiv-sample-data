We introduce a new invariant for separable C*-algebras of stable rank one that merges the Cuntz semigroup information together with the K_1-group information. This semigroup, termed the Cu_1-semigroup, is constructed as equivalence classes of pairs consisting of a positive element in the stabilization of the given C*-algebra together with a unitary element of the unitization of hereditary subalgebra generated by the given positive element. We show that the Cu_1-semigroup is a well-defined continuous functor from C* to a suitable codomain category that we write Cu^\sim. Furthermore, we compute the Cu_1-semigroup of some specific classes of C*-algebras. Finally, in the course of our investigation, we show that we can recover functorially Cu, K_1 and K_* := K_0 \oplus K_1 from Cu_1.
