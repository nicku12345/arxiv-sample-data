In this paper we study conditions under which, for an inclusion of finite von Neumann algebras N \subseteq M s.t. N is embeddable into R^\omega and M embeds into \prod_{k \rightarrow \omega} \mathbb{M}_{n(k)} \otimes N, the reduced amalgamated free product M \ast_N M is embeddable into (R \bar{\otimes} N)^\omega and therefore still embeddable into R^\omega, where R is the hyperfinite \textrm{II}_1 factor.
