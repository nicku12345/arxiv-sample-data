We define a notion of ideals in the category of ordered monoids satisfying the Cuntz axioms introduced in [2] and termed Cu^\sim. We show that the set of ideals of a Cu^\sim-semigroup S has a complete lattice structure. In fact, we prove that for any separable C*-algebra with stable rank one A, the assignment \, I \mapsto Cu_1(I) defines a complete lattice isomorphism between Lat(A) and Lat(Cu_1(A)). Further, we introduce the notion of quotient ideals and exactness for the (non abelian) category Cu^\sim. We show that Cu_1(A)/Cu_1(I) \simeq Cu_1(A/I) for any I \in Lat(A) and that the functor Cu_1 is exact. Finally, we link S , S_+ and S_{max} in a split-exact sequence that allows us to extract additional information that lies within the unitary Cuntz semigroup of a separable C*-algebra of stable rank one.
