In this paper, we give a definition of the relative equivariant coarse index for proper actions and derive a relative equivariant coarse index theorem connecting this index with the localized equivariant coarse indices. This is an equivariant version of Roe's relative coarse index theorem in arXiv:arch-ive/1210.6100. Furthermore, we present a definition of the relative L^2-index and prove a relative L^2-index theorem which is a relative version of Atiyah's L^2-index theorem.
