Given a self-similar groupoid action (G,E) on the path space of a finite graph, we study the associated Exel-Pardo \'etale groupoid {\mathcal G}(G,E) and its C^*-algebra C^*(G,E). We review some facts about groupoid actions, skew products and semi-direct products and generalize a result of Renault about similarity of groupoids which resembles Takai duality. We also describe a general strategy to compute the K-theory of C^*(G,E) and the homology of {\mathcal G}(G,E) in certain cases and illustrate with an example.
