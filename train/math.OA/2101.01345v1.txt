For an approximately central (AC) Powers-Rieffel projection e in the irrational Flip orbifold C*-algebra A_\theta^\Phi, where \Phi is the Flip automorphism of the rotation C*-algebra A_\theta, we compute the Connes-Chern character of the cutdown of any projection by e in terms of K-theoretic invariants of these projections. This result is then applied to computing a complete K-theoretic invariant for the projection e with respect to central equivalence (within the orbifold). Thus, in addition to the canonical trace, there is a 4\times6 K-matrix invariant K(e) arising from unbounded traces of the cutdowns of a canonically constructed basis for K_0(A_\theta^\Phi) = \mathbb Z^6. Thanks to a theorem of Kishimoto, this enables us to tell when AC projections in A_\theta^\Phi are Murray-von Neumann equivalent via an approximately central partial isometry (or unitary) in A_\theta^\Phi. As additional application, we obtain the K-matrix of canonical SL(2,\mathbb Z)-automorphisms of e and show that there is a subsequence of e such that e, \sigma(e), \kappa(e), \kappa^2(e), \sigma\kappa(e), \sigma\kappa^2(e) -- which are the orbit elements of e under the symmetric group S_3 \subset SL(2,\mathbb Z) -- are pairwise centrally not equivalent, and that each SL(2,\mathbb Z) image of e is centrally equivalent to one of these, where \sigma, \kappa are the Fourier and Cubic transform automorphisms of the rotation algebra.
