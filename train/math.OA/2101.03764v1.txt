Let \mathfrak A be a type 1 subdiagonal algebra in a \sigma-finite von Neumann algebra \mathcal M with respect to a faithful normal conditional expectation \Phi. We consider a Riesz type factorization theorem in noncommutative H^p spaces associated with \mathfrak A. It is shown that if 1\leq r,p,q<\infty such that \frac1r=\frac1p+\frac1q, then for any h\in H^r, there exist h_p\in H^p and h_q\in H^q such that h=h_ph_q. Beurling type invariant subspace theorem for noncommutative L^p(1< p<\infty) space is obtained. Furthermore, we show that a \sigma-weakly closed subalgebra containing \mathfrak A of \mathcal M is also a type 1 subdiagonal algebra. As an application, We prove that the relative invariant subspace lattice Lat_{\mathcal M}\mathfrak A of \mathfrak A in \mathcal M is commutative.
