This paper introduces the notion of exponential arcs in Hilbert space and of exponential arcs connecting vector states on a sigma-finite von Neumann algebra in its standard representation. Results from Tomita-Takesaki theory form an essential ingredient. Starting point is a non-commutative Radon-Nikodym theorem that involves positive operators affiliated with the commutant algebra. It is shown that exponential arcs are differentiable and that parts of an exponential arc are again exponential arcs. Special cases of probability theory and of quantum probability are used to illustrate the approach.
