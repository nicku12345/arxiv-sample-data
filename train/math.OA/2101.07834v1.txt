We resolve the isomorphism problem for tensor algebras of unital multivariable dynamical systems. Specifically we show that unitary equivalence after a conjugation for multivariable dynamical systems is a complete invariant for complete isometric isomorphisms between their tensor algebras. In particular, this settles a conjecture of Davidson and Kakariadis relating to work of Arveson from the sixties, and extends related work of Kakariadis and Katsoulis.
