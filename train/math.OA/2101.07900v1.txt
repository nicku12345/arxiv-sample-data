We construct two types of unital separable simple C^*-alebras A_z^{C_1} and A_z^{C_2}, one is exact but not amenable, and the other is non-exact. Both have the same Elliott invariant as the Jiang-Su algebra, namely, A_z^{C_i} has a unique tracial state, (K_0(A_z^{C_i}), K_0(A_z^{C_i})_+, [1_{A_z^{C_i}} ])=(\mathbb Z, \mathbb Z_+,1) and K_{1}(A_z^{C_i})=\{0\} (i=1,2). We show that A_z^{C_i} (i=1,2) is essentially tracially in the class of separable {\cal Z}-stable C^*-alebras of nuclear dimension 1. A_z^{C_i} has stable rank one, strict comparison for positive elements and no 2-quasitrace other than the unique tracial state. We also produce models of unital separable simple non-exact C^*-alebras which are essentially tracially in the class of simple separable nuclear {\cal Z}-stable C^*-alebras and the models exhaust all possible weakly unperforated Elliott invariants. We also discuss some basic properties of essential tracial approximation.
