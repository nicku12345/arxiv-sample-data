In this note, we introduce and study a notion of bi-exactness for creation operators acting on full, symmetric and anti-symmetric Fock spaces. This is a generalization of our previous work, in which we studied the case of anti-symmetric Fock spaces. As a result, we obtain new examples of solid actions as well as new proofs for some known solid actions. We also study free wreath product groups in the same context.
