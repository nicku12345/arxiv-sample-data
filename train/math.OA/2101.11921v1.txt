In this paper, we introduce a class of generalized tracial approximation {\rm C^*}-algebras. Let \mathcal{P} be a class of unital {\rm C^*}-algebras which have tracially \mathcal{Z}-absorbing (tracial nuclear dimension at most n, \rm SP property, m-almost divisible, weakly (m, n)-divisible). Then A has tracially \mathcal{Z}-absorbing (tracial nuclear dimension at most n, \rm SP property, weakly m-almost divisible, secondly weakly (m, n)-divisible) for any simple unital {\rm C^*}-algebra A in the class of this generalized tracial approximation {\rm C^*}-algebras. As an application, Let A be an infinite dimensional unital simple {\rm C^*}-algebra, and let B be a centrally large subalgebra of A. If B is tracially \mathcal{Z}-absorbing, then A is tracially \mathcal{Z}-absorbing. This result was obtained by Archey, Buck and Phillips in \cite{AJN}.
