This paper examines actions of right LCM semigroups by endomorphisms of C*-algebras that encode an additional structure of the right LCM semigroup. We define contractive covariant representations for these semigroup dynamical systems and prove a generalized Stinespring's dilation theorem showing that these representations can be dilated if and only if the map on the C*-algebra is unital and completely positive. This generalizes earlier results about dilations of right LCM semigroups of contractions. In addition, we also give sufficient conditions under which a contractive covariant representation of a right LCM system can be dilated to an isometric representation of the boundary quotient.
