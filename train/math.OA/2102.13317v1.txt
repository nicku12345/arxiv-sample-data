We will introduce the notion of strong Morita equivalence for completely positive linear maps and study its basic properties. Also, we will discuss the relation between strong Morita equivalence for bounded C^*-bimodule linear maps and strong Morita equivalence for completely positive linear maps. Furthermore, we will show that if two unital C^*-algebras are strongly Morita equivalent, then there is a 1-1 correspondence between the two sets of all strong Morita equivalence classes of completely positive linear maps on the two unital C^*-algebras and we will show that the corresponding two classes of the completely positive linear maps are also strongly Morita equivalent.
