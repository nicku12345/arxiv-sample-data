In recent joint work of the authors with Laca, we precisely formulated the notion of partition function in the context of C*-dynamical systems. Here, we compute the partition functions of C*-dynamical systems arising from Toeplitz algebras of graphs, and we explicitly recover graph-theoretic information in terms of C*-dynamical invariants. In addition, we compute the type for KMS states on C*-algebras of finite (reducible) graphs and prove that the extremal KMS states at critical inverse temperatures give rise to type III_\lambda factors. Our starting point is an independent result parameterising the partition functions of a certain class of C*-dynamical systems arising from groupoid C*-algebras in terms of \beta-summable orbits.
