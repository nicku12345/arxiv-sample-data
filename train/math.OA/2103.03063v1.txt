We present a uniqueness theorem for the reduced C*-algebra of a twist \mathcal{E} over a Hausdorff \'etale groupoid \mathcal{G}. We show that the interior \mathcal{I}^\mathcal{E} of the isotropy of \mathcal{E} is a twist over the interior \mathcal{I}^\mathcal{G} of the isotropy of \mathcal{G}, and that the reduced twisted groupoid C*-algebra C_r^*(\mathcal{I}^\mathcal{G}; \mathcal{I}^\mathcal{E}) embeds in C_r^*(\mathcal{G}; \mathcal{E}). We also investigate the full and reduced twisted C*-algebras of the isotropy groups of \mathcal{G}, and we provide a sufficient condition under which states of (not necessarily unital) C*-algebras have unique state extensions. We use these results to prove our uniqueness theorem, which states that a C*-homomorphism of C_r^*(\mathcal{G}; \mathcal{E}) is injective if and only if its restriction to C_r^*(\mathcal{I}^\mathcal{G}; \mathcal{I}^\mathcal{E}) is injective.
