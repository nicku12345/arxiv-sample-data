In this paper, we establish the full L_p boundedness of noncommutative Bochner-Riesz means on two-dimensional quantum tori, which completely resolves an open problem raised in \cite{CXY13} in the sense of the L_p convergence for two dimensions. The main ingredients are sharper estimates of noncommutative Kakeya maximal functions and geometric estimates in the plain. We make the most of noncommutative theories of maximal/square functions, together with microlocal decompositions in both proofs of sharper estimates of Kakeya maximal functions and Bochner-Riesz means. We point out that even geometric estimates in the plain are different from that in the commutative case.
