In this note we include two remarks about bounded (\underline{not} necessarily contractive) linear projections on a von Neumann-algebra. We show that if M is a von Neumann-subalgebra of B(H) which is complemented in B(H) and isomorphic to M \otimes M then M is injective (or equivalently M is contractively complemented). We do not know how to get rid of the second assumption on M. In the second part,we show that any complemented reflexive subspace of a C^*- algebra is necessarily linearly isomorphic to a Hilbert space.
