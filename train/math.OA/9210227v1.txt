We present the analytic foundation of a unified B-D-F extension functor \operatorname{Ext}_\tau on the category of noncommutative smooth algebras, for any Fr\'echet operator ideal \Cal K_\tau. Combining the techniques devised by Arveson and Voiculescu, we generalize Voiculescu's theorem to smooth algebras and Fr\'echet operator ideals. A key notion involved is \tau-smoothness, which is verified for the algebras of smooth functions, via a noncommutative Sobolev lemma. The groups \operatorname{Ext}_\tau are computed for many examples.
