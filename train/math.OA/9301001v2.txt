A general classification of linear differential and finite-difference operators possessing a finite-dimensional invariant subspace with a polynomial basis (the generalized Bochner problem) is given. The main result is that any operator with the above property must have a representation as a polynomial element of the universal enveloping algebra of some algebra of differential (difference) operators in finite-dimensional representation plus an operator annihilating the finite-dimensional invariant subspace. In low dimensions a classification is given by algebras sl_2({\bold R}) (for differential operators in {\bold R}) and sl_2({\bold R})_q (for finite-difference operators in {\bold R}), osp(2,2) (operators in one real and one Grassmann variable, or equivalently, 2 \times 2 matrix operators in {\bold R}), sl_3({\bold R}), sl_2({\bold R}) \oplus sl_2({\bold R}) and gl_2 ({\bold R}) \ltimes {\bold R}^{r+1}\ , r a natural number (operators in {\bold R^2}). A classification of linear operators possessing infinitely many finite-dimensional invariant subspaces with a basis in polynomials is presented. A connection to the recently-discovered quasi-exactly-solvable spectral problems is discussed.
