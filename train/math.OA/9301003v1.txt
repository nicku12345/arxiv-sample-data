We show that if E is a Frechet G\rtimes S(M)-module, for which the canonical map from the projective completion G\rtimes S(M) {\widehat \otimes} E to E is surjective, then every element of E can be written as a finite sum of elements of the form ae where e\in E and a is an element of the smooth crossed product G\rtimes S(M). We require that the Schwartz functions S(M) vanish rapidly with repsect to a continuous, proper map \s : M ---> [0, \infty).
