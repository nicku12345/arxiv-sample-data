By means of techniques from the Morita equivalence theory, we get finitely generated and projective modules over the quantum Heisenberg manifolds. This enables us to get some information about the range of the trace of these algebras, at the level of the K_{0}-group, in terms of the Poisson bracket in whose direction the manifolds are deformed.
