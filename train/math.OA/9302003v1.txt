Let A denote the alternation limit algebra, studied by Hopenwasser and Power, and by Poon, which is the closed direct limit of upper triangular matrix algebras determined by refinement embeddings of multiplicity r_k and standard embeddings of multiplicity s_k. It is shown that the quotient of the isometric automorphism group by the approximately inner automorphisms is the abelian group  \ZZ ^d where d is the number of primes that are divisors of infinitely many terms of each of the sequences (r_k) and (s_k). This group is also the group of automorphisms of the fundamental relation of A.
