The q-commutation relations in the title are those that have recently received much attention, and that for -1<q<1 provide an interpolation between Bosonic and Fermionic statistics, passing through free statistics at q=0. We look at the C*-algebra R^q generated by the representation of these relations on the twisted Fock space of Bozejko-Speicher, and we find a canonical unitary U_q from the twisted Fock space to usual full Fock space, such that U_q R^q (U_q)^* contains the Cuntz algebra R^0, and such that we have equality for |q|<0.44.
