For every operator space X the C^\ast-algebra containing it in a universal way is residually finite-dimensional (that is, has a separating family of finite-dimensional representations). In particular, the free C^\ast-algebra on any normed space so is. This is an extension of an earlier result by Goodearl and Menal, and our short proof is based on a criterion due to Exel and Loring.
