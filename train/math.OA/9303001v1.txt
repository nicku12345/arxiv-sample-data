We show the possibility and the uniqueness of polar decomposition of elements of arbitrary AW*-algebras inside them. We prove that spectral decomposition of normal elements of normal AW*-algebras is possible and unique inside them. The possibility of spectral decomposition of normal elements does not depend on the normality of the AW*-algebra under consideration.
