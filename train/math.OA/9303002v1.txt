For the q-deformed canonical commutation relations a(f)a^\dagger(g) = (1-q)\,\langle f,g\rangle{\bf1}+q\,a^\dagger(g)a(f) for f,g in some Hilbert space {\cal H} we consider representations generated from a vector \Omega satisfying a(f)\Omega=\langle f,\phi\rangle\Omega, where \phi\in{\cal H}. We show that such a representation exists if and only if \Vert\phi\Vert\leq1. Moreover, for \Vert\phi\Vert<1 these representations are unitarily equivalent to the Fock representation (obtained for \phi=0). On the other hand representations obtained for different unit vectors \phi are disjoint. We show that the universal C*-algebra for the relations has a largest proper, closed, two-sided ideal. The quotient by this ideal is a natural q-analogue of the Cuntz algebra (obtained for q=0). We discuss the Conjecture that, for d<\infty, this analogue should, in fact, be equal to the Cuntz algebra itself. In the limiting cases q=\pm1 we determine all irreducible representations of the relations, and characterize those which can be obtained via coherent states.
