We give a necessary and sufficient condition on a positive compact operator T for the existence of a singular trace (i.e. a trace vanishing on the finite rank operators) which takes a finite non-zero value on T. This generalizes previous results by Dixmier and Varga. We also give an explicit description of these traces and associated ergodic states on \ell^\infty(\Bbb N) using tools of non standard analysis in an essential way.
