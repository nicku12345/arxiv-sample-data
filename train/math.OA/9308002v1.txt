The theory of non symmetric Dirichlet forms is generalized to the non abelian setting, also establishing the natural correspondences among Dirichlet forms, sub-Markovian semigroups and sub-Markovian resolvents within this context. Examples of non symmetric Dirichlet forms given by derivations on Hilbert algebras are studied.
