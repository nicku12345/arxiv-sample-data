We describe a class of measurable subsets \Omega in \br^d such that L^2(\Omega) has an orthogonal basis of frequencies e_\lambda(x)=e^{i2\pi\lambda\cdot x}(x\in\Omega) indexed by \lambda\in\Lambda\subset\br^d. We show that such spectral pairs (\Omega ,\Lambda) have a self-similarity which may be used to generate associated fractal measures \mu with Cantor set support. The Hilbert space L^2(\mu) does not have a total set of orthogonal frequencies, but a harmonic analysis of \mu may be built instead from a natural representation of the Cuntz C^*- algebra which is constructed from a pair of lattices supporting the given spectral pair (\Omega ,\Lambda). We show conversely that such a pair may be reconstructed from a certain Cuntz-representation given to act on L^2(\mu).
