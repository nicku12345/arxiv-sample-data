It is shown that all the approximately finite dimensional C*-algebras which are not of Type I are isomorphic as Banach spaces. This generalises the matroid case given previously by Arazy. Analogous results are obtained for various families of triangular subalgebras of AF C*-algebras. In addition the classification of various continua of Type I AF C*-algebras is discussed.
