In this article we prove that quasi-multiplicative (with respect to the usual length function) mappings on the permutation group \SSn (or, more generally, on arbitrary amenable Coxeter groups), determined by self-adjoint contractions fulfilling the braid or Yang-Baxter relations, are completely positive. We point out the connection of this result with the construction of a Fock representation of the deformed commutation relations d_id_j^*-\sum_{r,s} t_{js}^{ir} d_r^*d_s=\delta_{ij}\id, where the matrix t_{js}^{ir} is given by a self-adjoint contraction fulfilling the braid relation. Such deformed commutation relations give examples for operator spaces as considered by Effros, Ruan and Pisier. The corresponding von Neumann algebras, generated by G_i=d_i+d_i^*, are typically not injective.
