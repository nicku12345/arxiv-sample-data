To study operator algebras with symmetries in a wide sense we introduce a notion of {\em relative convolution operators} induced by a Lie algebra. Relative convolutions recover many important classes of operators, which have been already studied (operators of multiplication, usual group convolutions, two-sided convolution etc.) and their different combinations. Basic properties of relative convolutions are given and a connection with usual convolutions is established. Presented examples show that relative convolutions provide us with a base for systematical applications of harmonic analysis to PDO theory, complex and hypercomplex analysis, coherent states, wavelet transform and quantum theory.
