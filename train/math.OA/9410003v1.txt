We characterize when the primitive ideal space of a crossed product \acg of a \cs-algebra A by a locally compact abelian group G is a \sigma-trivial \ghat G-space for the dual \ghat G-action. Specifically, we show that \Prim(\acg) is \sigma-trivial if and only if the quasi-orbit space is Hausdorff, the map which assigns to each quasi-orbit \w a certain subgroup \ttg(\alpha^\w) of the Connes spectrum of the system (A_\w,G,\alpha^\w) is continuous, and there is a generalized Green twisting map for (A,G,\alpha). Our proof requires a substantial generalization of a theorem of Olesen and Pedersen in which we show that there is a generalized Green twisting map for (A,G,\alpha) if and only if \acg is isomorphic to a generalized induced algebra.
