Suppose that (G,T) is a second countable locally compact transformation group given by a homomorphism \ell:G\to\Homeo(T), and that A is a separable continuous-trace \cs-algebra with spectrum T. An action \alpha:G\to\Aut(A) is said to cover \ell if the induced action of G on T coincides with the original one. We prove that the set \brgt of Morita equivalence classes of such systems forms a group with multiplication given by the balanced tensor product: [A,\alpha][B,\beta] = [A\Ttensor B,\alpha\tensor\beta], and we refer to \brgt as the Equivariant Brauer Group. We give a detailed analysis of the structure of \brgt in terms of the Moore cohomology of the group G and the integral cohomology of the space T. Using this, we can characterize the stable continuous-trace \cs-algebras with spectrum T which admit actions covering \ell. In particular, we prove that if G=\R, then every stable continuous-trace \cs-algebra admits an (essentially unique) action covering~\ell, thereby substantially improving results of Raeburn and Rosenberg.
