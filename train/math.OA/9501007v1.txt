The main goal of the present paper is to generalize the results of~\cite{TroLNM,TroBoch} in the following way: To be able to define K_0(A)\o\C-valued Lefschetz numbers of the first type of an endomorphism V on a C*-elliptic complex one usually assumes that V=T_g for some representation T_g of a compact group G on the C*-elliptic complex. We try to refuse this restriction in the present paper. The price to pay for this is twofold:   (i)   We have to define Lefschetz numbers valued in some larger group as K_0(A)\o\C.   (ii) We have to deal with W*-algebras instead of general unital C*-algebras.   To obtain these results we have got a number of by-product facts on the theory of Hilbert W*- and C*-modules and on bounded module operators on them which are of independent interest.
