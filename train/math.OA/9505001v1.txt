Let \cal M be a Banach C*-module over a C*-algebra A carrying two A-valued inner products < .,. >_1, <.,. >_2 which induce equivalent to the given one norms on \cal M. Then the appropriate unital C*-algebras of adjointable bounded A-linear operators on the Hilbert A-modules \{ {\cal M}, < .,. >_1 \} and \{ {\cal M}, < .,. >_2 \} are shown to be *-isomorphic if and only if there exists a bounded A-linear isomorphism S of these two Hilbert A-modules satisfying the identity < .,. >_2 \equiv < S(.),S(.) >_1. This result extends other equivalent descriptions due to L.~G.~Brown, H.~Lin and E.~C.~Lance. An example of two non-isomorphic Hilbert C*-modules with *-isomorphic C*-algebras of ''compact''/adjointable bounded module operators is indicated.
