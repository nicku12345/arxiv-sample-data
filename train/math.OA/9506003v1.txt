In this paper we discuss trace properties of d^+-summable K-cycles considered by A.Connes in [\rfr(Conn4)]. More precisely we give a proof of a trace theorem on the algebra \A of a K--cycle stated in [\rfr(Conn4)], namely we show that a natural functional on \A is a trace functional. Then we discuss whether this functional gives a trace on the whole universal graded differential algebra \Q(\A). On the one hand we prove that the regularity conditions on K-cycles considered in [\rfr(Conn4)] imply the trace property on \Q(\A). On the other hand, by constructing an explicit counterexample, we remark that the sole K-cycle assumption is not sufficient for such a property to hold.
