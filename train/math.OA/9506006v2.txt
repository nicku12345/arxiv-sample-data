In this note we explain the relationship of the Wodzicki residue of (certain powers of) an elliptic differential operator P\ acting on sections of a complex vector bundle E\ over a closed compact manifold M\ and the asymptotic expansion of the trace of the corresponding heat operator e^{-tP}. In the special case of a generalized laplacian \triangle\ and {{\rm dim}\;M > 2}, we thereby obtain a simple proof of the fact already shown in [KW], that the Wodzicki residue res(\triangle^{-{n\over 2}+1} )\ is the integral of the second coefficient of the heat kernel expansion of \triangle\ up to a proportional factor.
