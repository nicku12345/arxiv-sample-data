We prove that if two nonzero homomorphisms from the Cuntz algebra O_infinity to a purely infinite simple C*-algebra have the same class in KK-theory, and if either both are unital or both are nonunital, then they are approximately unitarily equivalent. It follows that O_infinity is classifiable in the sense of Rordam. In particular, Rordam's classification theorem for direct limits of matrix algebras over even Cuntz algebras extends to direct limits involving both matrix algebras over even Cuntz algebras and corners of O_infinity for which the K_0 group can be an arbitrary countable abelian group with no even torsion.
