Explicit representations for the Faddeev components of the three-body T-matrix continued analytically into unphysical sheets of the energy Riemann surface are formulated. According to the representations, the T-matrix in unphysical sheets is explicitly expressed in terms of its components taken in the physical sheet only. The representations for the T-matrix are then used to construct similar representations for the analytic continuation of the three-body scattering matrices and the resolvent. Domains on unphysical sheets are described where the representations obtained can be applied. A method for finding three-body resonances based on the Faddeev differential equations is proposed.
