Let \Omega and \Omega_{\fin} be the sets of all interpolating Blaschke products of type G and of finite type G, respectively. Let E and E_{\fin} be the Douglas algebras generated by H^\infty together with the complex conjugates of elements of \Omega and \Omega_{\fin}, respectively. We show that the set of all invertible inner functions in E is the set of all finite products of elements of \Omega , which is also the closure of \Omega among the Blaschke products. Consequently, finite convex combinations of finite products of elements of \Omega are dense in the closed unit ball of the subalgebra of H^\infty generated by \Omega. The same results hold when we replace \Omega by \Omega_{\fin} and E by E_{\fin}.
