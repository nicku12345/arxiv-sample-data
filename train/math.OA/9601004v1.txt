Examples of simple, separable, unital, purely infinite C^*--algebras are constructed, including:   (1) some that are not approximately divisible;   (2) those that arise as crossed products of any of a certain class of C^*--algebras by any of a certain class of non--unital endomorphisms;   (3) those that arise as reduced free products of pairs of C^*--algebras with respect to any from a certain class of states.
