We give a condition on a full coaction (A,G,\delta) of a (possibly) nonamenable group G and a closed normal subgroup N of G which ensures that Mansfield imprimitivity works; i.e. that A\times_{\delta{\vert}} G/N is Morita equivalent to A\times_\delta G\times_{\deltahat,r} N. This condition obtains if N is amenable or \delta is normal. It is preserved under Morita equivalence, inflation of coactions, the stabilization trick of Echterhoff and Raeburn, and on passing to twisted coactions.
