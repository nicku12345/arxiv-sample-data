Consider a coaction \delta of a locally compact group G on a \cstar algebra A, and a closed normal subgroup N of G. We prove, following results of Echterhoff for abelian G, that Mansfield's imprimitivity between A\times_{\delta|}G/N and A\times_\delta G\times_{\deltahat,r}N implements equivalences between Mansfield induction of representations from A\times G/N to A\times G and restriction of representations from A\times G\times_r N to A\times G, and between restriction of representations from A\times G to A\times G/N and Green induction of representations from A\times G to A\times G\times_r N. This allows us to deduce properties of Mansfield induction from the known theory of ordinary crossed products.
