Let M be a factor with separable predual and G a compact group of automorphisms of M whose action is minimal, i.e. M^{G^\prime}\cap M = C, where M^G denotes the G-fixed point subalgebra. Then every intemediate von Neumann algebra M^G\subset N\subset M has the form N=M^H for some closed subgroup H of G. An extension of this result to the case of actions of compact Kac algebras on factors is also presented. No assumptions are made on the existence of a normal conditional expectation onto N.
