It is well known that in the commutative case, i.e. for A=C(X) being a commutative C*-algebra, compact selfadjoint operators acting on the Hilbert C*-module H_A (= continuous families of such operators K(x), x\in X) can be diagonalized if we pass to a bigger W*-algebra L^\infty(X)={\bf A} \supset A which can be obtained from A by completing it with respect to the weak topology. Unlike the "eigenvectors", which have coordinates from \bf A, the "eigenvalues" are continuous, i.e. lie in the C*-algebra A. We discuss here the non-commutative analog of this well-known fact. Here the "eigenvalues" are defined not uniquely but in some cases they can also be taken from the initial C*-algebra instead of the bigger W*-algebra. We prove here that such is the case for some continuous fields of real rank zero C*-algebras over a one-dimensional manifold and give an example of a C*-algebra A for which the "eigenvalues" cannot be chosen from A, i.e. are discontinuous. The main point of the proof is connected with a problem on almost commuting operators. We prove that for some C*-algebras if h\in A is a selfadjoint, u\in A is a unitary and if the norm of their commutant [u,h] is small enough then one can connect u with the unity by a path u(t) so that the norm of [u(t),h] would be also small along this path.
