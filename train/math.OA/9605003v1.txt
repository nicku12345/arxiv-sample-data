The overview contains 450 references of books, chapters of monographs, papers, preprints and Ph.~D.~thesises which are concerned with the theory and/or various applications of Hilbert C*-modules. To show a way through this amount of literature a four pages guide is added clustering sources around major research problems and research fields, and giving information on the historical background. Two smaller separate parts list references treating Hilbert modules over Hilbert*-algebras and Hilbert modules over (non-self-adjoint) operator algebras. Any additions, corrections and forthcoming information are welcome.
