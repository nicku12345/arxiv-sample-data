The two reference lists contain 54/22 references of papers and preprints concerned with the theory and/or various applications of Hilbert modules over Hilbert *-algebras and over (non-self-adjoint) operator algebras. They are far from being complete, but they give additional information about two research fields which are closely related to the theory of Hilbert C*-modules, i.e. they are complements to the reference guide about this circle of problems. Any additions, corrections and forthcoming information are welcome.
