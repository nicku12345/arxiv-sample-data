Let \M be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful normal trace \T, and let H^\infty be a finite, maximal, subdiagonal algebra of \M. Fundamental theorems on conjugate functions for weak^*\!-Dirichlet algebras are shown to be valid for non-commutative H^\infty. In particular the conjugation operator is shown to be a bounded linear map from L^p(\M, \T) into L^p(\M, \T) for 1 < p < \infty, and to be a continuous map from L^1(\M,\T) into L^{1, \infty}(\M,\T). We also obtain that if an operator a is such that |a|\log^+|a| \in L^1(\M,\T) then its conjugate belongs to L^1(\M,\T). Finally, we present some partial extensions of the classical Szeg\"o's theorem to the non-commutative setting.
