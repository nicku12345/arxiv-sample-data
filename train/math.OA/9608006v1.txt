Mansfield showed how to induce representations of crossed products of C*-algebras by coactions from crossed products by quotient groups and proved an imprimitivity theorem characterising these induced representations. We give an alternative construction of his bimodule in the case of dual coactions, based on the symmetric imprimitivity theorem of the third author; this provides a more workable way of inducing representations of crossed products of C*-algebras by dual coactions. The construction works for homogeneous spaces as well as quotient groups, and we prove an imprimitivity theorem for these induced representations.
