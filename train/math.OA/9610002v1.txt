Let N \subset M be an irreducible inclusion of type type II_1 factors with finite Jones index. We shall introduce the notion of normality for intermediate subfactors of the inclusion N \subset M. If the depth of N \subset M is 2, then an intermediate subfactor K for N \subset M is normal in  N \subset M if and only if the depths of N \subset K and K \subset M are both 2. In particular, if M is the crossed product N \rtimes G of a finite group G, then K = N \rtimes H is normal in N \subset M if and only if H is a normal subgroup of G.
