We embed the quantum Heisenberg manifold in a crossed product algebra. This enables us to show that, in the irrational case, all tracial states on \dc induce the same homomorphism on the K_0-group. We conclude that two irrational quantum Heisenberg manifolds \dc and D^c_{\mu ' \nu '} are isomorphic if and only if the parameters (\mu,\nu) and (\mu ',\nu ') belong to the same orbit under the usual action of GL_2(\ZZ) on the torus.
