C*-algebras generalizing Cuntz-Krieger algebras can be associated to hyperbolic homeomorphisms of compact metric spaces. They satisfy a non-commutative form of Spanier-Whitehead duality with respect to K-theory. We prove this for the case of subshifts of finite type. The special feature of the present situation is that the constructions are all done on the full Fock space and are very explicit, while the general theorem requires much more abstract machinery.
