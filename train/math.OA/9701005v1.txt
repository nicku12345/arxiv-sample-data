We study the meet irreducible ideals in certain direct limit algebras, namely the strongly maximal triangular subalgebras of AF C*-algebras. These ideals have a description in terms of the coordinates, or spectrum, that is a natural extension of one description of meet irreducible ideals in the upper triangular matrices. Additional information is available if the limit algebra is an analytic subalgebra of its C*-envelope or if the analytic algebra is trivially analytic with an injective 0-cocycle. Completely meet irreducible ideals are considered, and a distance formula is presented.
