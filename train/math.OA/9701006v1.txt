A brief introduction into bimodules of II_1-factors is presented. Furthermore a version of the following result due to M. Pimsner and S. Popa is derived: Let N=M_{-1}\subset M=M_0 \subset M_1 \subset M_2 \subset \ldots denote the Jones tower of a II_1-factor N\subset M with finite index. Then the factor obtained by the basic construction from the pair N\subset M_{n-1} is equal to M_{2n-1}.
