The article contains a detailed description of the connection between finite depth inclusions of II_1-subfactors and finite C^*-tensor categories (i.e. C^*-tensor categories with dimension function for which the number of equivalence classes of irreducible objects is finite). The (N,N)-bimodules belonging to a II_1-subfactor N\subset M with finite Jones index form a C^*-tensor category with dimension function. Conversely, taking an object of a finite C^*-tensor category C we construct a subfactor A\subset R of the hyperfinite II_1-factor R with finite index and finite depth. For this subfactor we compute the standard invariant and show that the C^*-tensor category of the corresponding (A,A)-bimodules is equivalent to a subcategory of C. We illustrate the results for the C^*-tensor category of the unitary finite dimensional corepresentations of a finite dimensional Hopf-*-algebra.
