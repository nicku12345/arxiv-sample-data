We introduce the notion of a C*-valued weight between two C*-algebras as a generalization of an ordinary weight on a C*-algebra and as a C*-version of operator valued weights on von Neumann algebras. Also, some form of lower semi-continuity will be discussed together with an extension to the multiplier algebra. A strong but useful condition for C*-valued weights, the so-called regularity, is introduced. At the same time, we propose a construction procedure for such regular C*-valued weights. This construction procedure will be used to define the tensor product of regular C*-valued weights.
