It is known that every semigroup of normal completely positive maps P = {P_t: t\geq 0} of B(H), satisfying P_t(1) = 1 for every t\geq 0, has a minimal dilation to an E_0-semigroup acting on B(K) for some Hilbert space K containing H. The minimal dilation of P is unique up to conjugacy. In a previous paper a numerical index was introduced for semigroups of completely positive maps and it was shown that the index of P agrees with the index of its minimal dilation to an E_0-semigroup. However, no examples were discussed, and no computations were made. In this paper we calculate the index of a unital completely positive semigroup whose generator is a bounded operator  L: B(H)\to B(H)  in terms of natrual structures associated with the generator. This includes all unital CP semigroups acting on matrix algebras. We also show that the minimal dilation of the semigroup P={\exp{tL}: t\geq 0} to an \esg\ is is cocycle conjugate to a CAR/CCR flow.
