A d-contraction is a d-tuple (T_1,...,T_d) of mutually commuting operators acting on a common Hilbert space H such that  \|T_1\xi_1+T_2\xi_2+... +T_d\xi_d\|^2\leq \|\xi_1\|^2+\|\xi_2\|^2+...+\|\xi_d\|^2  for all \xi_1,\xi_2,...,\xi_d\in H. These are the higher dimensional counterparts of contractions. We show that many of the operator-theoretic aspects of function theory in the unit disk generalize to the unit ball B_d in complex d-space, including von Neumann's inequality and the model theory of contractions. These results depend on properties of the d-shift, a distinguished d-contraction which acts on a new H^2 space associated with B_d, and which is the higher dimensional counterpart of the unilateral shift. H^2 and the d-shift are highly unique. Indeed, by exploiting the noncommutative Choquet boundary of the d-shift relative to its generated C^*-algebra we find that there is more uniqueness in dimension d\geq 2 than there is in dimension one.
