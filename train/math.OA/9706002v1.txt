We make a detailed study of locally inner actions on C*-algebras whose primitive ideal spaces have locally compact Hausdorff complete regularizations. We suppose that G has a representation group and compactly generated abelianization G_{ab}. Then if the complete regularization of \Prim(A) is X, we show that the collection of exterior equivalence classes of locally inner actions of G on A is parameterized by the group \E_G(X) of exterior equivalence classes of C_0(X)-actions of G on C_0(X,\K). Furthermore, we exhibit a group isomorphism of \E_G(X) with the direct sum H^1(X,\sheaf \hat{G_{ab}}) \oplus C(X,H^2(G,\T)). As a consequence, we can compute the equivariant Brauer group \Br_G(X) for G acting trivially on X.
