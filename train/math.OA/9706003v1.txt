Suppose that G has a representation group H, that G_{ab}:= G/\bar{[G,G]} is compactly generated, and that A is a \cs-algebra for which the complete regularization of \Prim(A) is a locally compact Hausdorff space X. In a previous article, we showed that there is a bijection \alpha \mapsto (Z_\alpha,f_\alpha) between the collection of exterior equivalence classes of locally inner actions \alpha:G\to\Aut(A), and the collection of principal \hgab-bundles Z_\alpha together with continuous functions f_\alpha:X\to H^2(G,\T). In this paper, we compute the crossed products A\rtimes_\alpha G in terms of the data Z_\alpha, f_\alpha, and~\cs(H).
