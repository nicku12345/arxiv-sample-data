We define the Brauer group \Br(G) of a locally compact groupoid G to be the set of Morita equivalence classes of pairs (\A,\alpha) consisting of an elementary C*-bundle \A over G^{(0)} satisfying Fell's condition and an action \alpha of G on \A by *-isomorphisms. When G is the transformation groupoid X\times H, then \Br(G) is the equivariant Brauer group \Br_H(X).   In addition to proving that \Br(G) is a group, we prove three isomorphism results. First we show that if G and H are equivalent groupoids, then \Br(G) and \Br(H) are isomorphic. This generalizes the result that if G and H are groups acting freely and properly on a space X, say G on the left and H on the right then \Br_G(X/H) and \Br_H(G/ X) are isomorphic. Secondly we show that the subgroup \Br_0(G) of \Br(G) consisting of classes [\A,\alpha] with \A having trivial Dixmier-Douady invariant is isomorphic to a quotient \E(G) of the collection \Tw(G) of twists over G. Finally we prove that \Br(G) is isomorphic to the inductive limit \Ext(G,T) of the groups \E(G^X) where X varies over all principal G spaces X and G^X is the imprimitivity groupoid associated to X.
