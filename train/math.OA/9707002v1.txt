We demonstrate that the structure of complex second-order strongly elliptic operators H on {\bf R}^d with coefficients invariant under translation by {\bf Z}^d can be analyzed through decomposition in terms of versions H_z, z\in{\bf T}^d, of H with z-periodic boundary conditions acting on L_2({\bf I}^d) where {\bf I}=[0,1>. If the semigroup S generated by H has a H\"older continuous integral kernel satisfying Gaussian bounds then the semigroups S^z generated by the H_z have kernels with similar properties and z\mapsto S^z extends to a function on {\bf C}^d\setminus\{0\} which is analytic with respect to the trace norm. The sequence of semigroups S^{(m),z} obtained by rescaling the coefficients of H_z by c(x)\to c(mx) converges in trace norm to the semigroup \hat{S}^z generated by the homogenization \hat{H}_z of H_z. These convergence properties allow asymptotic analysis of the spectrum of H.
