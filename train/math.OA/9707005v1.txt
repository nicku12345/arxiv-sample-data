We prove that for matrix algebras M_n there exists a monomorphism (\prod_n M_n/\oplus_n M_n)\otimes C(S^1) \to {\cal Q}  into the Calkin algebra which induces an isomorphism of the K_1-groups. As a consequence we show that every vector bundle over a classifying space B\pi which can be obtained from an asymptotic representation of a discrete group \pi can be obtained also from a representation of the group \pi\times Z into the Calkin algebra. We give also a generalization of the notion of Fredholm representation and show that asymptotic representations can be viewed as asymptotic Fredholm representations.
