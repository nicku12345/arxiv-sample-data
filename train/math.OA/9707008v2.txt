We build a longitudinally smooth differentiable groupoid associated to any manifold with corners. The pseudodifferential calculus on this groupoid coincides with the pseudodifferential calculus of Melrose (also called b-calculus). We also define an algebra of rapidly decreasing functions on this groupoid; it contains the kernels of the smoothing operators of the (small) b-calculus.
