Cirelli, Mani\`{a} and Pizzocchero generalized quantum mechanics by K\"{a}hler geometry. Furthermore they proved that any unital C^{*}-algebra is represented as a function algebra on the set of pure states with a noncommutative *-product as an application. The ordinary quantum mechanics is regarded as a dynamical system of the projective Hilbert space {\cal P}({\cal H}) of a Hilbert space {\cal H}. The space {\cal P}({\cal H}) is an infinite dimensional K\"{a}hler manifold of positive constant holomorphic sectional curvature. In general, such dynamical system is constructed for a general K\"{a}hler manifold of nonzero constant holomorphic sectional curvature c. The Hilbert ball B_{{\cal H}} is defined by the open unit ball in {\cal H} and it is a K\"{a}hler manifold with c<0. We introduce the quantum mechanics on B_{{\cal H}}. As an application, we show the structure of the noncommutative function algebra on B_{{\cal H}}.
