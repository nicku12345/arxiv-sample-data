It is shown that if A is an AF algebra then a crossed product of A by the integers can be embedded into an AF algebra if and only if the crossed product is stably finite. This equivalence follows from a simple K-theoretic characterization of AF embeddability. It is then shown that if a crossed product of an AF algebra by the integers is AF embeddable then the AF embedding can be chosen in such a way as to induce a rationally injective map on K_0 of the crossed product.
