We prove that any separable exact C*-algebra is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the Cuntz algebra {\cal O}_2. We further prove that if A is a simple separable unital nuclear C*-algebra, then {\cal O}_2 \otimes A \cong {\cal O}_2, and if, in addition, A is purely infinite, then {\cal O}_{\infty} \otimes A \cong A.   The embedding of exact C*-algebras in \OA{2} is continuous in the following sense. If A is a continuous field of C*-algebras over a compact manifold or finite CW complex X with fiber A (x) over x \in X, such that the algebra of continuous sections of A is separable and exact, then there is a family of injective homomorphisms \phi_x : A (x) \to {\cal O}_2 such that for every continuous section a of A the function x \mapsto \phi_x (a (x)) is continuous. Moreover, one can say something about the modulus of continuity of the functions x \mapsto \phi_x (a (x)) in terms of the structure of the continuous field. In particular, we show that the continuous field \theta \mapsto A_{\theta} of rotation algebras posesses unital embeddings \phi_{\theta} in {\cal O}_2 such that the standard generators u (\theta) and v (\theta) are mapped to \operatorname{Lip}^{1/2} functions.
