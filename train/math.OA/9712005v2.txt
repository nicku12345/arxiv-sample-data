This paper presents a solution to a problem from superanalysis about the existence of Hilbert-Banach superalgebras. Two main results are derived: 1) There exist Hilbert norms on some graded algebras (infinite-dimensional superalgebras included) with respect to which the multiplication is continuous. 2) Such norms cannot be chosen to be submultiplicative and equal to one on the unit of the algebra.
