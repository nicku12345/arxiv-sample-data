Given a C*-algebra A with a semicontinuous semifinite trace tau acting on the Hilbert space H, we define the family R of bounded Riemann measurable elements w.r.t. tau as a suitable closure, a la Dedekind, of A, in analogy with one of the classical characterizations of Riemann measurable functions, and show that R is a C*-algebra, and tau extends to a semicontinuous semifinite trace on R.   Then, unbounded Riemann measurable operators are defined as the closed operators on H which are affiliated to A'' and can be approximated in measure by operators in R, in analogy with unbounded Riemann integration. Unbounded Riemann measurable operators form a tau-a.e. bimodule on R, denoted by R^, and such bimodule contains the functional calculi of selfadjoint elements of R under unbounded Riemann measurable functions. Besides, tau extends to a bimodule trace on R^.   Type II_1 singular traces for C*-algebras can be defined on the bimodule of unbounded Riemann-measurable operators. Noncommutative Riemann integration, and singular traces for C*-algebras, are then used to define Novikov-Shubin numbers for amenable open manifolds, show their invariance under quasi-isometries, and prove that they are (noncommutative) asymptotic dimensions.
