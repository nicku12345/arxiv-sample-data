First, we construct the Jones tower and tunnel of the central sequence subfactor arising from a hyperfinite type II_1 subfactor with finite index and finite depth, and prove each algebra has the double commutant property in the ultraproduct of the enveloping II_1 factor. Next, we show the equivalence between Popa's strong amenability and the double commutant property of the central sequence factor for subfactors as above without assuming the finite depth condition.
