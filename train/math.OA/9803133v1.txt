In this paper we discuss some physical applications of topological *-algebras of unbounded operators. Our first example is a simple system of free bosons. Then we analyze different models which are related to this one. We also discuss the time evolution of two interacting models of matter and bosons. We show that for all these systems it is possible to build up a common framework where the thermodynamical limit of the algebraic dynamics can be conveniently studied and obtained.
