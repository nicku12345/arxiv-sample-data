For each \alpha \in (0,1), A_\alpha denotes the universal C^*-algebra generated by two unitaries u and v, which satisfy the commutation relation uv=\exp (2\pi i\alpha)vu. We consider the order four automorphism \sigma of A_\alpha defined by \sigma (u)=v, \sigma (v)=u^{-1} and describe a method for constructing projections in the fixed point algebra A_\alpha^\sigma, using Rieffel's imprimitivity bimodules and Jacobi's theta functions. In the case \alpha =q^{-1}, q\in {\mathbf Z}, q\geq 2, we give explicit formulae for such projections and find a lower bound for the norm of the Harper operator u+u^* +v+v^*.
