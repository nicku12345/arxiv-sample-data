We define for discrete finitely presented groups a new property related to their asymptotic representations. Namely we say that a groups has the property AGA if every almost representation generates an asymptotic representation. We give examples of groups with and without this property. For our example of a group G without AGA the group K^0(BG) cannot be covered by asymptotic representations of G.
