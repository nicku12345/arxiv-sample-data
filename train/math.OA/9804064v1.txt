This work introduces operator space analogues of the Separable Extension Property (SEP) for Banach spaces; the Complete Separable Extension Property (CSEP) and the Complete Separable Complemention Property (CSCP). The results use the technique of a new proof of Sobczyk's Theorem, which also yields new results for the SEP in the non-separable situation, e.g., (\oplus_{n=1}^\infty Z_n)_{c_0} has the (2+\ep)-SEP for all \ep>0 if Z_1,Z_2,... have the 1-SEP; in particular, c_0 (\ell^\infty) has the SEP. It is proved that e.g., c_0(\bR\oplus\bC) has the CSEP (where \bR, \bC denote Row, Column space respectively) as a consequence of the general principle: if Z_1,Z_2,... is a uniformly exact sequence of injective operator spaces, then (\oplus_{n=1}^\infty Z_n)_{c_0} has the CSEP. Similarly, e.g., \bK_0 \defeq (\oplus_{n=1}^\infty M_n)_{c_0} has the CSCP, due to the general principle: (\oplus_{n=1}^\infty Z_n)_{c_0} has the CSCP if Z_1,Z_2,... are injective separable operator spaces. Further structural results are obtained for these properties, and several open problems and conjectures are discussed.
