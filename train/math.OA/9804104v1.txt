A pre-subgroup of a multiplicative unitary V on a finite dimensionnal Hilbert space H is a vector line L in H such that V(L\otimes L)=L\otimes L. We show that there are finitely many pre-subgroups, give a Lagrange theorem and generalize the construction of a `bi-crossed product'. Moreover, we establish bijections between pre-subgroups and coideal subalgebras of the Hopf algebra associated with V, and therefore with the intermediate subfactors of the associated (depth two) inclusions. Finally, we show that the pre-subgroups classify the subobjects of (H,V).
