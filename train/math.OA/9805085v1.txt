Let A be a simple unital AT algebra of real rank zero and Inn(A) the group of inner automorphisms of A. In the previous paper we have shown that the natural map of the group of approximately inner automorphisms into Ext(K_1(A),K_0(A)) oplus Ext(K_0(A),K_1(A)) is surjective; the kernel of this map includes the subgroup of automorphisms which are homotopic to Inn(A). In this paper we consider the quotient of the group of approximately inner automorphisms by the smaller normal subgroup AInn(A) which consists of asymptotically inner automorphisms and describe it as OrderExt(K_1(A),K_0(A)) oplus Ext(K_0(A),K_1(A)), where OrderExt(K_1(A),K_0(A)) is a kind of extension group which takes into account the fact that K_0(A) is an ordered group and has the usual Ext as a quotient.
