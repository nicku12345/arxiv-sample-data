We develop a theory of boundary functions for ideals in trivially analytic subalgebras of simple AF C*-algebras with an injective 0-cocycle, a class which includes all full nest algebras. Boundary functions are maps from the spectrum of the diagonal of the analytic subalgebra to itself. The relation between boundary functions and ideal sets is explored and a description is given of meet and join irreducible boundary functions.
