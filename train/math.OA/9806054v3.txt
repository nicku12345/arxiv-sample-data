We construct inclusions of the form (B_0\otimes P)^G\subset (B_1\otimes P)^G, where G is a compact quantum group of Kac type acting on an inclusion of finite dimensional \c^*-algebras B_0\subset B_1 and on a II_1 factor P. Under suitable assumptions on the actions of G, this is a subfactor, whose Jones to er and standard invariant can be computed by using techniques of A. Wassermann. The subfactors associated to subgroups of compact groups, to projective representations of compact groups, to finite quantum groups, to finitely generated discrete groups, to vertex models and to spin models are of this form.
