By introducing a result that guarantees a given bialgebra to be a Hopf algebra under a natural condition, we show that the quantum automorphism group of the algebra k[x] of polynomials over a field k (of any characteristic) is the universal quantum a x + b group, generalizing the fact that the automorphism group of k[x] is the a x + b group. The q-deformation of the a x + b group is then seen as one among a certain family {\mathcal A}_{q, n} of quantum subgroups of this universal quantum group.
