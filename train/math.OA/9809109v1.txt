We obtain a kind of structure theorem for the automorphism group {\rm Aut}{\cal A} of a unital C^{*}-algebra {\cal A}. According to it, {\rm Aut}{\cal A} can be regarded as a subgroup of the semi-direct product of direct product group consisting of some family of projective unitary groups and some permutation group on the spectrum of {\cal A}.
