Various partially ordered Grothendieck group invariants are introduced for general operator algebras and these are used in the classification of direct systems and direct limits of finite-dimensional complex incidence algebras with common reduced digraph H (systems of H-algebras). In particular the dimension distribution group G(A; C), defined for an operator algebra A and a self-adjoint subalgebra C, generalises both the K0 group of a sigma unital C*-algebra B and the spectrum (fundamental relation) R(A) of a regular limit A of triangular digraph algebras. This invariant is more economical and computable than the so called regular Grothendieck group which nevertheless forms the basis for a complete classification of regular systems of H-algebras.
