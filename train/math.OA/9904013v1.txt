We show that every Fell bundle B over a locally compact group G is "proper" in a sense recently introduced by Ng. Combining our results with those of Ng we show that if B satisfies the "approximation property" then it is amenable in the sense that the full and reduced cross-sectional C*-algebras coincide.
