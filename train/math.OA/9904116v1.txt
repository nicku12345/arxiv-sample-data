To each discrete product system E of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces we associate a C*-algebra O_E. When E is the n-dimensional product system over N, O_E is the Cuntz algebra O_n, and the irrational rotation algebras appear as O_E for certain one-dimensional product systems over N^2. We give conditions which ensure that O_E is simple, purely infinite, and nuclear. Our main examples are the lexicographic product systems, for which we obtain slightly stronger results.
