We first study situations where the stable AF-algebras defined by two square primitive nonsingular incidence matrices with nonnegative integer matrix elements are isomorphic even though no powers of the associated automorphisms of the corresponding dimension groups are isomorphic. More generally we consider neccessary and sufficient conditions for two such matrices to determine isomorphic dimension groups. We give several examples.
