Let Z be a fixed separable operator space, X\subset Y general separable operator spaces, and T:X\to Z a completely bounded map. Z is said to have the Complete Separable Extension Property (CSEP) if every such map admits a completely bounded extension to Y; the Mixed Separable Extension Property (MSEP) if every such T admits a bounded extension to Y. Finally, Z is said to have the Complete Separable Complementation Property (CSCP) if Z is locally reflexive and T admits a completely bounded extension to Y provided Y is locally reflexive and T is a complete surjective isomorphism. Let {\bf K} denote the space of compact operators on separable Hilbert space and {\bf K}_0 the c_0 sum of {\Cal M}_n's (the space of ``small compact operators''). It is proved that {\bf K} has the CSCP, using the second author's previous result that {\bf K}_0 has this property. A new proof is given for the result (due to E. Kirchberg) that {\bf K}_0 (and hence {\bf K}) fails the CSEP. It remains an open question if {\bf K} has the MSEP; it is proved this is equivalent to whether {\bf K}_0 has this property. A new Banach space concept, Extendable Local Reflexivity (ELR), is introduced to study this problem. Further complements and open problems are discussed.
