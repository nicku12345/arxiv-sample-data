In this paper, we will define the reduced cross-sectional C^*-algebras of C^*-algebraic bundles over locally compact groups and show that if a C^*-algebraic bundle has the approximation property (defined similarly as in the discrete case), then the full cross-sectional C^*-algebra and the reduced one coincide. Moreover, if a semi-direct product bundle has the approximation property and the underlying C^*-algebra is nuclear, then the cross-sectional C^*-algebra is also nuclear. We will also compare the approximation property with the amenability of Anantharaman-Delaroche in the case of discrete groups.
