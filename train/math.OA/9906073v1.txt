We show that certain dense and spectral invariant subalgebras of a C^*-algebra have the same bilateral Bass stable rank. This is a partial answer for (a version of) an open problem raised by R.G. Swan. Then, for certain Banach algebras, we indicate when the homotopy groups \pi_{i}(GL_{n}(A)) stabilize for large n. This is an improvement of a result due to G. Corach and A. Larotonda. Using some results due to M. Karoubi, we show the isomorphism of the Witt group of a symmetric Banach algebra with the K_0-group of its enveloping C^*-algebra. The question if this is true for all involutive Banach algebras was raised by A. Connes.
