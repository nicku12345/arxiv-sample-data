For any (unital) exchange ring R whose finitely generated projective modules satisfy the separative cancellation property (A\oplus A\cong A\oplus B\cong B\oplus B implies A\cong B), it is shown that all invertible square matrices over R can be diagonalized by elementary row and column operations. Consequently, the natural homomorphism GL_1(R) \to K_1(R) is surjective. In combination with a result of Huaxin Lin, it follows that for any separative, unital C*-algebra A with real rank zero, the topological K_1(A) is naturally isomorphic to the unitary group U(A) modulo the connected component of the identity. This verifies, in the separative case, a conjecture of Shuang Zhang.
