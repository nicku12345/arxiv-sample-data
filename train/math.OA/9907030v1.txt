In this paper we introduce the notion of a Hopf C*-algebra and construct the counit and antipode. A Hopf C*-algebra is a C*-algebra with comultiplication satisfying some extra condition which makes possible the construction of the counit and antipode. The leading example is of course the C*-algebra of continuous, vanishing at infinity functions on a locally compact group. Also locally compact quantum groups will be examples. We include several formulas for the counit and antipode which are familiar from Hopf algebra theory.
