In this paper we describe the form of those continuous multiplicative maps on B(H) (H being a separable complex Hilbert space of dimension not less than 3) which preserve the rank, or the corank. Furthermore, we characterize those continuous *-semigroup endomorphisms of B(H) which are spectrum non-increasing.
