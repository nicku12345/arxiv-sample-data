This paper continues the study of spectral synthesis and the topologies \tau_{\infty} and \tau_r on the ideal space of a Banach algebra, concentrating particularly on the class of Haagerup tensor products of C^*-algebras. For this class, it is shown that spectral synthesis is equivalent to the Hausdorffness of \tau_{\infty}. Under a weak extra condition, spectral synthesis is shown to be equivalent to the Hausdorffness of \tau_r.
