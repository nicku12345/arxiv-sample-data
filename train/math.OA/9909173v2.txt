This paper continues the study of spectral synthesis and the topologies \tau_{\infty} and \tau_r on the ideal space of a Banach algebra, concentrating on the class of Banach ^*-algebras, and in particular on L^1-group algebras. It is shown that if a group G is a finite extension of an abelian group then \tau_r is Hausdorff on the ideal space of L^1(G) if and only if L^1(G) has spectral synthesis, which in turn is equivalent to G being compact. The result is applied to nilpotent groups, [FD]^--groups, and Moore groups. An example is given of a non-compact, non-abelian group G for which L^1(G) has spectral synthesis. It is also shown that if G is a non-discrete group then \tau_r is not Hausdorff on the ideal lattice of the Fourier algebra A(G).
