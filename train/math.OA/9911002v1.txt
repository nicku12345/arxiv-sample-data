Let H be a full Hilbert bimodule over a C*-algebra A. We show that the Cuntz-Pimsner C*-algebra associated to H is exact if and only if A is exact. Using this result, we give alternative proofs for exactness of reduced amalgamated free products of exact C*-algebras. In the case that A is a finite dimensional C*-algebra, we also show that the Brown-Voiculescu topological entropy of Bogljubov automorphisms of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra associated to an A,A Hilbert bimodule is zero.
