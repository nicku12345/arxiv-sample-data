Certain reduced free products of C*-algebras, (A,phi)=(A_1,phi_1)*(A_2,\phi_2), taken with respect to faithful states, at least one of which is not a trace, are shown to be purely infinite and simple. It is assumed that one of the A_i contain a partial isometry in the spectral subspace of phi_i corresponding to a positive number not equal to one. For example, if A_1 and A_2 are copies of the two-by-two complex matrices and if phi_1 and phi_2 are not unitarily conjugate, it is shown that A is simple and purely infinite.
