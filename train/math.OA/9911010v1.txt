Certain classes of automorphisms of recued amalgamated free products of C*-algebras are shown to have Brown-Voiculescu topological entropy zero. Also, for automorphisms of exact C*-algebras, the Connes-Narnhofer-Thirring entropy is shown to be bounded above by the Brown-Voiculescu entropy. These facts are applied to generalize Stormer's result about entropy of automorphisms of the II_1-factor of a free group.
