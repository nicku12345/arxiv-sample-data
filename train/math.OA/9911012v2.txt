Given reduced amalgamated free products of C^*-algebras, (A,phi)=*_i(A_i,phi_i) and (D,psi)=*_i(D_i,psi_i), an embedding A\to D is shown to exist assuming there are conditional expectation preserving embeddings A_i\to D_i. This result is extended to show the existance of the reduced amalgamated free product of certain classes of unital completely positive maps. Analogues of the above mentioned results are proved for von Neumann algebras.
