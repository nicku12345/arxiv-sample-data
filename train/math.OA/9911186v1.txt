In this note we study inclusions of second quantization algebras, namely inclusions of von Neumann algebras on the Fock space of a separable complex Hilbert space H, generated by the Weyl unitaries with test functions in closed, real linear subspaces of H. We show that the class of irreducible inclusions of standard second quantization algebras is non empty, and that they are depth two inclusions, namely the third relative commutant of the Jones' tower is a factor. When the smaller vector space has codimension n into the bigger, we prove that the corresponding inclusion of second quantization algebras is given by a cross product with R^n. This shows in particular that the inlcusions studied in hep-th/9703129, namely the inclusion of the observable algebra corresponding to a bounded interval for the (n+p)-th derivative of the current algebra on the real line into the observable algebra for the same interval and the n-th derivative theory is given by a cross product with R^p. On the contrary, when the codimension is infinite, we show that the inclusion may be non regular (cf. M. Enock, R. Nest, J. Funct. Anal. 137 (1996), 466-543), hence do not correspond to a cross product with a locally compact group.
