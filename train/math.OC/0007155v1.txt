In this paper we present the mathematical description and analysis of a fractional-order regulated system in the state space. A little historical background of our results in the analysis and synthesis of the fractional-order dynamical regulated systems is given. The methods and results of simulations of the fractional-order system described by a state space equation equivalent to three-member fractional-order differential equation with a fractional-order PD^{\delta} regulator are then presented. The possibility of investigating the stability of such systems is also considered.
