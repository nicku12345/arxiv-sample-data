This contribution deals with the creation of numerical models for the simulation of the dynamic characteristics of fractional-order control systems and their comparison with analytical models. We give the results of the comparison of dynamic properties in fractional- and integer-order systems with a controller, designed for an integer-order system as the best approximation to given fractional-order system. Other open questions are pointed out, which should be answered in this area of research.
