This contribution deals with identification of fractional-order dynamical systems. We consider systems whose mathematical description is a three-member differential equation in which the orders of derivatives can be real numbers. We give a discretization method and a numerical solution of differential equations of this type. An experimental method of identification is given which is based on evaluation of transfer characteristics. This is a combination of the method of derivatives of transfer characteristics and of the method of passive search. The verification was performed on systems with known parameters and also on a laboratory object.
