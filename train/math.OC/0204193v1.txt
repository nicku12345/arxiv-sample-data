In this paper we will present some alternative types of mathematical description and methods of solution of the fractional-order dynamical system in the state space. We point out the difference in the true sense of the name "state" space for the integer-order and fractional-order system and the importance of the initialization function for the fractional-order system. Some implications concerning the state feedback control theory are discussed. Presented are the results of simulations.
