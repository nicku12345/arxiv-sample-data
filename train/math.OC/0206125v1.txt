We consider the homogenized linear feasibility problem, to find an x on the unit sphere, satisfying n line ar inequalities a_i^Tx\ge 0. To solve this problem we consider the centers of the insphere of spherical simpl ices, whose facets are determined by a subset of the constraints. As a result we find a new combinatorial algor ithm for the linear feasibility problem. If we allow rescaling this algorithm becomes polynomial. We point out that the algorithm solves as well the more general convex feasibility problem. Moreover numerical experiments s how that the algorithm could be of practical interest.
