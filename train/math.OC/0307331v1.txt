In a previous paper, published in 1992, a primal conical LP algorithm with exact finite coonvergence was presented. The underlying optimality condition requires tangency of two sets (an affine space and a cone). In the algorithm the two sets remain disjoint until the last step. This left open the possibility of developing an internal algorithm in which, by the contrary, the two sets keep intersecting each other. Such an algorithm along with a new optimality condition is presented here. It is stressed that the results given here complete the picture of the conical approach to LP in many other important respect, as illustrated in detail in the introduction.
