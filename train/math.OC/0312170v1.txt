In this paper we propose constellations with suitable structure which allow one to construct codes with excellent diversity using geometrical symmetry and numerical methods. We also demonstrate how these structured constellations out-perform currently existing constellations and explain why the proposed constellation structure admit simple decoding algorithm: sphere decoding. The presented design methods work for any dimensional constellation and for any transmission rate. Moreover codes based on the proposed structure are very flexible and can be optimized for any signal to noise ratio.
