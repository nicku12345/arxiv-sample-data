A general class, introduced in [Ekeland et al. 2003], of continuous time bond markets driven by a standard cylindrical Brownian motion \wienerq{}{} in \ell^{2}, is considered. We prove that there always exist non-hedgeable random variables in the space \derprod{}{0}=\cap_{p \geq 1}L^{p} and that \derprod{}{0} has a dense subset of attainable elements, if the volatility operator is non-degenerated a.e. Such results were proved in [Bj\"ork et al. 1997] in the case of a bond market driven by finite dimensional B.m. and marked point processes. We define certain smaller spaces \derprod{}{s}, s>0 of European contingent claims, by requiring that the integrand in the martingale representation, with respect to \wienerq{}{}, takes values in weighted \ell^{2} spaces \ell^{s,2}, with a power weight of degree s. For all s > 0, the space \derprod{}{s} is dense in \derprod{}{0} and is independent of the particular bond price and volatility operator processes.   A simple condition in terms of \ell^{s,2} norms is given on the volatility operator processes, which implies if satisfied, that every element in \derprod{}{s} is attainable. In this context a related problem of optimal portfolios of zero coupon bonds is solved for general utility functions and volatility operator processes, provided that the \ell^{2}-valued market price of risk process has certain Malliavin differentiability properties.
