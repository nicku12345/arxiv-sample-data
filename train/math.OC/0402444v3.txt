The aim of the present paper is essentially to prove that if \Phi and \Psi are two sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous functionals on a reflexive real Banach space and if \Psi is also continuous and coercive, then then following conclusion holds: if, for some r > \inf_X \Psi, the weak closure of the set \Psi^{-1}(]-\infty, r[) has at least k connected components in the weak topology, then, for each \lambda > 0 small enough, the functional \Psi + \lambda\Phi has at least k local minima lying in \Psi^{-1}(]-\infty, r[).
