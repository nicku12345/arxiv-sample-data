We provide a new sufficient condition for strong invariance for differential inclusions, under very general conditions on the dynamics, in terms of a Hamiltonian inequality. In lieu of the usual Lipschitzness assumption on the multifunction, we assume a feedback realization condition that can in particular be satisfied for measurable dynamics that are neither upper nor lower semicontinuous.
