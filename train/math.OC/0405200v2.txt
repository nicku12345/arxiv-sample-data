We have found an inconsistency in our previous version of the paper "Generalized splines in R^n and optimal control". We give a new-time-dependent definition of spline curves in R^n which results from solving a non-autonomous linear quadratic optimal control problem (P) where the matrix B(t) is assumed to be rectangular with maximum rank. Nevertheless, our results are only valid if B(t) is a square (nonsingular) matrix. This was pointed out to us by Andrey Sarychev. We have proceeded with the necessary corrections.   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   We give a new time-dependent definition of spline curves in R^n, which extends a recent definition of vector-valued splines introduced by Rodrigues and Silva Leite for the time-independent case. Previous results are based on a variational approach, with lengthy arguments, which do not cover the non-autonomous situation. We show that the previous results are a consequence of the Pontryagin maximum principle, and are easily generalized using the methods of optimal control. Main result asserts that vector-valued splines are related to the Pontryagin extremals of a non-autonomous linear-quadratic optimal control problem.
