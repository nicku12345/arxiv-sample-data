In this paper we consider a continuous-time anisotropic swarm model in n-dimensional space with an attraction/repulsion function and study its aggregation properties. It is shown that the swarm members will aggregate and eventually form a cohesive cluster of finite size around the swarm center. Moreover, the numerical simulations show that all agents will eventually enter into and remain in a bounded region around the swarm center. The model is more general than isotropic swarms and our results provide further insight into the effect of the interaction pattern on individual motion in a swarm system.
