We show that any globally asymptotically controllable system on any smooth manifold can be globally stabilized by a state feedback. Since we allow discontinuous feedbacks, we interpret the solutions of our systems in the ``sample and hold'' sense introduced by Clarke-Ledyaev-Sontag-Subbotin (CLSS). Our work generalizes the CLSS Theorem which is the special case of our result for systems on Euclidean space. We apply our result to the input-to-state stabilization of systems on manifolds relative to actuator errors, under small observation noise.
