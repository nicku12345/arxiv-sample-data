We present a computer-assisted approach to locating approximate coarse optimal switching policies between stationary states of chemically reacting systems described by microscopic/stochastic evolution rules. The ``coarse time-stepper" constitutes a bridge between the underlying kinetic Monte Carlo simulation and traditional, continuum numerical optimization techniques formulated in discrete time. The approach is illustrated through two simple catalytic surface reaction models, implemented through kinetic Monte Carlo: NO reduction on Pt, and CO oxidation on Pt. The objective sought in both cases is to switch between two coexisting stable stationary states by minimal manipulation of a macroscopic system parameter.
