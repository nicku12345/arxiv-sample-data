We study the stability properties of a class of time-varying nonlinear systems. We assume that non-strict input-to-state stable (ISS) Lyapunov functions for our systems are given and posit a mild persistency of excitation condition on our given Lyapunov functions which guarantee the existence of strict ISS Lyapunov functions for our systems. Next, we provide simple direct constructions of explicit strict ISS Lyapunov functions for our systems by applying an integral smoothing method. We illustrate our constructions using a tracking problem for a rotating rigid body.
