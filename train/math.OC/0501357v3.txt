Proposed is a new formal approach for solution of extreme multi-criteria problems transforming them into single-criterion mathematical models, without any additional information. Transforming rules are based on comparison standards and intervals between these standards and goal function values, corresponding to problem solution. Pareto-optimality of these solutions is proved by a number of theorems. Examples illustrating efficiency and universality of this approach are presented.
