We consider the time-dependent nonlinear system \dot q(t)=u(t)X(q(t))+(1-u(t))Y(q(t)), where q\in\R^2, X and Y are two %C^\infty smooth vector fields, globally asymptotically stable at the origin and u:[0,\infty)\to\{0,1\} is an arbitrary measurable function. Analysing the topology of the set where X and Y are parallel, we give some sufficient and some necessary conditions for global asymptotic stability, uniform with respect to u(.). Such conditions can be verified without any integration or construction of a Lyapunov function, and they are robust under small perturbations of the vector fields.
