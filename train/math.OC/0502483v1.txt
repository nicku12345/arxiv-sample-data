Consider the control system given by \dot x=x(f+ug), where x\in SO(3), |u|\leq 1 and f,g\in so(3) define two perpendicular left-invariant vector fields normalized so that \|f\|=\cos(\al) and \|g\|=\sin(\al), \al\in ]0,\pi/4[. In this paper, we provide an upper bound and a lower bound for N(\alpha), the maximum number of switchings for time-optimal trajectories. More precisely, we show that N_S(\al)\leq N(\al)\leq N_S(\al)+4, where N_S(\al) is a suitable integer function of \al which for \al\to 0 is of order \pi/(4\alpha). The result is obtained by studying the time optimal synthesis of a projected control problem on R P^2, where the projection is defined by an appropriate Hopf fibration. Finally, we study the projected control problem on the unit sphere S^2. It exhibits interesting features which will be partly rigorously derived and partially described by numerical simulations.
