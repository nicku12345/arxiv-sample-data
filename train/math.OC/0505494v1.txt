This paper considers new approach to control a stationary inhomogeneous planar front solution of a nonlinear parabolic two-dimensional distributed (reaction-diffusion) system, by using a gain point-sensor control with actuators that have the simplest possible spatial dependence. The method is based on multivariable root-locus technique for the finite-dimensional approximation of the original PDE model and use the concepts of finite and infinite zeros of linear multidimensional
