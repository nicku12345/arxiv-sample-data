Entropy-like functionals on operator algebras have been studied since the pioneering work of von Neumann, Umegaki, Lindblad, and Lieb. The most well-known are the von Neumann entropy trace (\rho\log \rho) and a generalization of the Kullback-Leibler distance trace (\rho \log \rho - \rho \log \sigma), refered to as quantum relative entropy and used to quantify distance between states of a quantum system. The purpose of this paper is to explore these as regularizing functionals in seeking solutions to multi-variable and multi-dimensional moment problems. It will be shown that extrema can be effectively constructed via a suitable homotopy. The homotopy approach leads naturally to a further generalization and a description of all the solutions to such moment problems. This is accomplished by a renormalization of a Riemannian metric induced by entropy functionals. As an application we discuss the inverse problem of describing power spectra which are consistent with second-order statistics, which has been the main motivation behind the present work.
