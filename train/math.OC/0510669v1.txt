We establish a divergence free partition for vector-valued Sobolev functions with free divergence in {\bf R}^n, n\geq 1. We prove that for any domain \om of class \cal C in {\bf R}^n,n=2,3, the space D_0^1(\om)\equiv\{{\mathbf{v}} \in H^1_0(\Omega)^n ; {div}{\mathbf{v}}=0\} and the space H_{0,\sigma}^1(\om)\equiv \bar{\{{\mathbf{v}}\in C^{\infty}_0(\Omega)^n;{div}{\mathbf v}=0\}}^{\|\cdot\|_{H^1(\om)^n}}, which is the completion of \{{\mathbf{v}} \in C^{\infty}_0(\Omega)^n; {div}{\mathbf v}=0\} in the H^1(\Omega)^n-norm, are identical. We will also prove that H_{0,\sigma}^1(D\setminus\bar\om)=\{{\mathbf v}\in H_{0,\sigma}^1(D); {\mathbf v}=0 {a.e. in} \om\}, where D is a bounded Lipschitz domain such that \om\subset\subset D. These results, together with properties for domains of class \mathcal C, are used to solve an existence problem in the shape optimization theory of the stationary Navier-Stokes equations.
