We obtain a method to compute effective first integrals by combining Noether's principle with the Kozlov-Kolesnikov integrability theorem. A sufficient condition for the integrability by quadratures of optimal control problems with controls taking values on open sets is obtained. We illustrate our approach on some problems taken from the literature. An alternative proof of the integrability of the sub-Riemannian nilpotent Lie group of type (2,3,5) is also given.
