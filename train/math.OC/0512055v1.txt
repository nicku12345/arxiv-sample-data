In multidisciplinary optimization the designer needs to find solution to optimization problems which include a number of usually contradicting criteria. Such a problem is mathematically related to the field of nonlinear vector optimization where there are many numerical methods capable of providing a solution. However, only a few of those are suitable for real multidisciplinary design in industry because an iteration design circle usually is very time-consuming. This is due to the time scales and computational resources associated with each iterative design cycle. The recently suggested Physical Programming Method appears to match many requirements raised in industrial applications. The method is modified to make its realization easier and more efficient, the main focus being the even generation of the complete Pareto set. The method is used to find the Pareto surface for different test cases.
