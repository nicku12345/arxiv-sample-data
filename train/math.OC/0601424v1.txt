An efficient and accurate computational approach is proposed for optimal attitude control of a rigid body. The problem is formulated directly as a discrete time optimization problem using a Lie group variational integrator. Discrete necessary conditions for optimality are derived, and an efficient computational approach is proposed to solve the resulting two point boundary value problem. The use of geometrically exact computations on SO(3) guarantees that this optimal control approach has excellent convergence properties even for highly nonlinear large angle attitude maneuvers. Numerical results are presented for attitude maneuvers of a 3D pendulum and a spacecraft in a circular orbit.
