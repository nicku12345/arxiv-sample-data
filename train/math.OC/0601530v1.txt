We establish the following result: if the graph of a (nonsmooth) real-extended-valued function f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to \mathbb{R}\cup\{+\infty\} is closed and admits a Whitney stratification, then the norm of the gradient of f at x\in{dom}f relative to the stratum containing x bounds from below all norms of Clarke subgradients of f at x. As a consequence, we obtain some Morse-Sard type theorems as well as a nonsmooth Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz inequality for functions definable in an arbitrary o-minimal structure.
