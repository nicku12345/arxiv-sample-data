We study the low-bias stabilization of active magnetic bearings (AMBs) subject to voltage saturation based on a recently proposed model for the AMB switching mode of operation. Using a forwarding-like approach, we construct a stabilizing controller of arbitrarily small amplitude and a control-Lyapunov function for the AMB dynamics. We illustrate our construction using a numerical example.
