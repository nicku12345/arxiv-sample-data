Optimal control problems are formulated and efficient computational procedures are proposed for combined orbital and rotational maneuvers of a rigid body in three dimensions. The rigid body is assumed to act under the influence of forces and moments that arise from a potential and from control forces and moments. The key features of this paper are its use of computational procedures that are guaranteed to preserve the geometry of the optimal solutions. The theoretical basis for the computational procedures is summarized, and examples of optimal spacecraft maneuvers are presented.
