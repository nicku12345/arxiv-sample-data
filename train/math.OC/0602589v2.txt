A deterministic attitude estimation problem for a rigid body in an attitude dependent potential field with bounded measurement errors is studied. An attitude estimation scheme that does not use generalized coordinate representations of the attitude is presented here. Assuming that the initial attitude, angular velocity and measurement noise lie within given ellipsoidal bounds, an uncertainty ellipsoid that bounds the attitude and the angular velocity of the rigid body is obtained. The center of the uncertainty ellipsoid provides point estimates, and its size gives the accuracy of the estimates. The point estimates and the uncertainty ellipsoids are propagated using a Lie group variational integrator and its linearization, respectively. The estimation scheme is optimal in the sense that the attitude estimation error and the size of the uncertainty ellipsoid is minimized at each measurement instant, and it is global since the attitude is represented by a rotation matrix.
