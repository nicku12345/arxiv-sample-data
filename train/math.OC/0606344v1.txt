In this paper we consider a family of optimal control problems for economic models whose state variables are driven by Delay Differential Equations (DDE's). We consider two main examples: an AK model with vintage capital and an advertising model with delay effect. These problems are very difficult to treat for three main reasons: the presence of the DDE's, that makes them infinite dimensional; the presence of state constraints; the presence of delay in the control. Our main goal is to develop, at a first stage, the Dynamic Programming approach for this family of problems. The Dynamic Programming approach has been already used for similar problems in cases when it is possible to write explicitly the value function V. Here we deal with cases when the explicit form of V cannot be found, as most often occurs. We carefully describe the basic setting and give some first results on the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation as a first step to find optimal strategies in closed loop form.
