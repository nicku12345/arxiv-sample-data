We consider the inverse conductivity problem with one measurement for the equation div((\sigma\_1+(\sigma\_2-\sigma\_1)\chi\_D)\nabla{u})=0 determining the unknown inclusion D included in \Omega. We suppose that \Omega is the unit disk of \mathbb{R}^2. With the tools of the conformal mappings, of elementary Fourier analysis and also the action of some quasi-conformal mapping on the Sobolev space \sH^{1/2}(S^1), we show how to approximate the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map when the original inclusion D is a \epsilon- approximation of a disk. This enables us to give some uniqueness and stability results.
