Let T>0 fixed. We consider the optimal control problem for analytic affine systems: \ds{\dot{x}=f\_0(x)+\sum\_{i=1}^m u\_if\_i(x)}, with a cost of the form: \ds{C(u)=\int\_0^T \sum\_{i=1}^m u\_i^2(t)dt}. For this kind of systems we prove that if there are no minimizing abnormal extremals then the value function S is subanalytic. Secondly we prove that if there exists an abnormal minimizer of corank 1 then the set of end-points of minimizers at cost fixed is tangent to a given hyperplane. We illustrate this situation in sub-Riemannian geometry.
