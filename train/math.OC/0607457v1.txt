In this paper, we investigate the problem of semi-global minimal time robust stabilization of analytic control systems with controls entering linearly, by means of a hybrid state feedback law. It is shown that, in the absence of minimal time singular trajectories, the solutions of the closed-loop system converge to the origin in quasi minimal time (for a given bound on the controller) with a robustness property with respect to small measurement noise, external disturbances and actuator noise.
