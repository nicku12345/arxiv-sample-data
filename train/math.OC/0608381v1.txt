Optimal control problems are usually addressed with the help of the famous Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) which gives a generalization of the classical Euler-Lagrange and Weierstrass necessary optimality conditions of the calculus of variations. Success in applying the PMP permits to obtain candidates for a local minimum. In 1967 a direct method, which permits to obtain global minimizers directly, without using necessary conditions, was introduced by Leitmann. Leitmann's approach is connected, as showed by Carlson in 2002, with "Caratheodory's royal road of the Calculus of variations". Here we propose a related but different direct approach to problems of the calculus of variations and optimal control, which permit to obtain global minima directly, without recourse to needle variations and necessary conditions. Our method is inspired by the classical Noether's theorem and its recent extensions to optimal control. We make use of the variational symmetries of the problem, considering parameter-invariance transformations and substituting the original problem by a parameter-family of optimal control problems. Parameters are then fixed in order to make the problem trivial, in some sense. Finally, by applying the inverse of the chosen invariance-transformation, we get the global minimizer for the original problem. The proposed method is illustrated, by solving concrete problems, and compared with Leitmann's approach.
