In Part I of this paper, we have developed a novel \mathcal{L}_1 adaptive control architecture that enables fast adaptation and leads to uniformly bounded transient and asymptotic tracking for system's both signals, input and output, simultaneously. In this paper, we derive the stability margins of \mathcal{L}_1 adaptive control architecture, including time-delay and gain margins in the presence of time-varying bounded disturbance.   Simulations verify the theoretical findings.
