For \alpha\in(0,\pi/2), let (\Sigma)_\alpha be the control system \dot{x}=(F+uG)x, where x belongs to the two-dimensional unit sphere S^2, u\in [-1,1] and F,G are 3\times3 skew-symmetric matrices generating rotations with perpendicular axes of respective length \cos(\alpha) and \sin(\alpha). In this paper, we study the time optimal synthesis (TOS) from the north pole (0,0,1)^T associated to (\Sigma)_\alpha, as the parameter \alpha tends to zero. We first prove that the TOS is characterized by a ``two-snakes'' configuration on the whole S^2, except for a neighborhood U_\alpha of the south pole (0,0,-1)^T of diameter at most \O(\alpha).   We next show that, inside U_\alpha, the TOS depends on the relationship between r(\alpha):=\pi/2\alpha-[\pi/2\alpha] and\alpha. More precisely, we characterize three main relationships, by considering sequences (\alpha_k)_{k\geq 0} satisfying (a)r(\alpha_k)=\bar{r}; (b) r(\alpha_k)=C\alpha_k and (c) r(\alpha_k)=0, where \bar{r}\in (0,1) and C>0. In each case, we describe the TOS and provide, after a suitable rescaling, the limiting behavior, as \alpha tends to zero, of the corresponding TOS inside U_\alpha.
