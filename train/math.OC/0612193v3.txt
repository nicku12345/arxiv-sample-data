This paper presents three non-linear observers on three examples of engineering interest: a chemical reactor, a non-holonomic car, and an inertial navigation system. For each example, the design is based on physical symmetries. This motivates the theoretical development of invariant observers, i.e, symmetry-preserving observers. We consider an observer to consist in a copy of the system equation and a correction term, and we give a constructive method (based on the Cartan moving-frame method) to find all the symmetry-preserving correction terms. They rely on an invariant frame (a classical notion) and on an invariant output-error, a less standard notion precisely defined here. For each example, the convergence analysis relies also on symmetries consideration with a key use of invariant state-errors. For the non-holonomic car and the inertial navigation system, the invariant state-errors are shown to obey an autonomous differential equation independent of the system trajectory. This allows us to prove convergence, with almost global stability for the non-holonomic car and with semi-global stability for the inertial navigation system. Simulations including noise and bias show the practical interest of such invariant asymptotic observers for the inertial navigation system.
