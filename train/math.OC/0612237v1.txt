In this paper, we study a time optimal internal control problem governed by the heat equation in \Omega\times [0,\infty). In the problem, the target set S is nonempty in L^2(\Omega), the control set U is closed, bounded and nonempty in L^2(\Omega) and control functions are taken from the set \uad=\{u(\cdot, t): [0,\infty)\ra L^2(\Omega) {measurable}; u(\cdot, t)\in U, {a.e. in t} \}. We first establish a certain null controllability for the heat equation in \Omega\times [0,T], with controls restricted to a product set of an open nonempty subset in \Omega and a subset of positive measure in the interval [0,T]. Based on this, we prove that each optimal control u^*(\cdot, t) of the problem satisfies necessarily the bang-bang property: u^*(\cdot, t)\in \p U for almost all t\in [0, T^*], where \p U denotes the boundary of the set U and T^* is the optimal time. We also obtain the uniqueness of the optimal control when the target set S is convex and the control set U is a closed ball.
