We consider stationary consensus protocols for networks of dynamic agents with switching topologies. The measure of the neighbors' state is affected by Unknown But Bounded disturbances. Here the main contribution is the formulation and solution of what we call the \epsilon-consensus problem, where the states are required to converge in a tube of ray \epsilon asymptotically or in finite time.
