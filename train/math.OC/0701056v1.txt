This work considers the open-loop control problem of steering a two level quantum system from an initial to a final condition. The model of this system evolves on the state space SU(2), having two inputs that correspond to the complex amplitude of a resonant laser field. A symmetry preserving flat output is constructed using a fully geometric construction and quaternion computations. Simulation results of this flatness-based open-loop control are provided.
