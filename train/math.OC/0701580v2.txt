We consider a class of dynamic advertising problems under uncertainty in the presence of carryover and distributed forgetting effects, generalizing a classical model of Nerlove and Arrow. In particular, we allow the dynamics of the product goodwill to depend on its past values, as well as previous advertising levels. Building on previous work of two of the authors, the optimal advertising model is formulated as an infinite dimensional stochastic control problem. We obtain (partial) regularity as well as approximation results for the corresponding value function. Under specific structural assumptions we study the effects of delays on the value function and optimal strategy. In the absence of carryover effects, since the value function and the optimal advertising policy can be characterized in terms of the solution of the associated HJB equation, we obtain sharper characterizations of the optimal policy.
