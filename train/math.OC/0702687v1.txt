Consider the controlled system dx/dt = Ax + \alpha(t)Bu where the pair (A,B) is stabilizable and \alpha(t) takes values in [0,1] and is persistently exciting, i.e., there exist two positive constants \mu,T such that, for every t\geq 0, \int_t^{t+T}\alpha(s)ds\geq \mu. In particular, when \alpha(t) becomes zero the system dynamics switches to an uncontrollable system. In this paper, we address the following question: is it possible to find a linear time-invariant state-feedback u=Kx, with K only depending on (A,B) and possibly on \mu,T, which globally asymptotically stabilizes the system? We give a positive answer to this question for two cases: when A is neutrally stable and when the system is the double integrator.
