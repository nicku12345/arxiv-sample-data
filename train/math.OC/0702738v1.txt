We consider a spacecraft formation reconfiguration problem in the case of identical spacecraft. This introduces in the optimal reconfiguration problem a permutational degree of freedom, in addition to the choice of individual spacecraft trajectories. We approach this using a coupled combinatorial and continuous optimization framework, in which the inner loop consists of computing the costs associated with a particular assignment by using a geometrically exact and numerically efficient discrete optimal control method based on Lie group variational integrators. In the outer optimization loop, combinatorial techniques are used to determine the optimal assignments based on the costs computed in the inner loop. The proposed method is demonstrated on the optimal reconfiguration problem for 5 identical spacecraft to go from an inline configuration to one equally spaced on a circle.
