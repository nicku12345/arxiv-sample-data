A class of smoothing methods is proposed for solving mathematical programs with equimibrium constraints. We introduce new and very simple regularizations of the complementarity constraints. Some estimate distance to optimal solution and expansions of the optimal value function are presented. Limited numerical experiments using SNOPT algorithm are presented to verify the efficiency of our approach.
