This paper presents a quasi time optimal receding horizon control algorithm. The proposed algorithm generates near time optimal control when the state of the system is far from the target. When the state attains a certain neighbourhood of the aim, it begins the adaptation of the cost function. The purpose of this adaptation is to move from the time optimal control to the stabilizing control. Sufficient conditions for the stability of the closed loop system and the manner of the adaptation of the cost function have been given. Considerations are illustrated with examples.   Keywords: Receding horizon control ;predictive control; nonlinear stability; optimal control.
