The objective of this paper is to solve the controller synthesis problem for bisimulation equivalence in a wide variety of scenarios including discrete-event systems, nonlinear control systems, behavioral systems, hybrid systems and many others. This will be accomplished by showing that the arguments underlying proofs of existence and methods for the construction of controllers are extraneous to the particular class of systems being considered and thus can be presented in greater generality.
