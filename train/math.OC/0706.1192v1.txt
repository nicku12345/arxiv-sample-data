The question of obtaining well-defined criteria for multiple criteria decision making problems is well-known. One of the approaches dealing with this question is the concept of nonessential objective function. A certain objective function is called nonessential if the set of efficient solutions is the same both with or without that objective function. In this paper we put together two methods for determining nonessential objective functions. A computational implementation is done using a computer algebra system.
