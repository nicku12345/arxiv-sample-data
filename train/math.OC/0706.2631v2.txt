Control systems over networks with a finite data rate can be conveniently modeled as hybrid (impulsive) systems. For the class of nonlinear systems in feedfoward form, we design a hybrid controller which guarantees stability, in spite of the measurement noise due to the quantization, and of an arbitrarily large delay which affects the communication channel. The rate at which feedback packets are transmitted from the sensors to the actuators is shown to be arbitrarily close to the infimal one.
