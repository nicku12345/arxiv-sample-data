Recently wide application in engineering-economic problems was received with problems of vector optimization. Development of methods of the decision of these problems it is executed in works A. Messac and others. Complexity of the offered methods consists in construction of an aggregate objective function. In the given work an algorithm of the solution of a vector optimization problem is suggested carry out by use analytical representation of Pareto cone.
