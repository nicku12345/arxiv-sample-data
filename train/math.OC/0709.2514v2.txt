A time optimal attitude control problem is studied for the dynamics of a rigid body. The objective is to minimize the time to rotate the rigid body to a desired attitude and angular velocity while subject to constraints on the control input. Necessary conditions for optimality are developed directly on the special orthogonal group using rotation matrices. They completely avoid singularities associated with local parameterizations such as Euler angles, and they are expressed as compact vector equations. In addition, a discrete control method based on a geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is proposed to compute the optimal control input. The computational approach is geometrically exact and numerically efficient. The proposed method is demonstrated by a large-angle maneuver for an elliptic cylinder rigid body.
