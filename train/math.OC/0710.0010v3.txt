This note places into perspective the so-called algebraic time-derivative estimation method recently introduced by Fliess and co-authors with standard results from linear state-space theory for control systems. In particular, it is shown that the algebraic method can in a sense be seen as a special case of deadbeat state estimation based on the reconstructibility Gramian of the considered system.
