Concurrent synchronization is a regime where diverse groups of fully synchronized dynamic systems stably coexist. We study global exponential synchronization and concurrent synchronization in the context of Lagrangian systems control. In a network constructed by adding diffusive couplings to robot manipulators or mobile robots, a decentralized tracking control law globally exponentially synchronizes an arbitrary number of robots, and represents a generalization of the average consensus problem. Exact nonlinear stability guarantees and synchronization conditions are derived by contraction analysis. The proposed decentralized strategy is further extended to adaptive synchronization and partial-state coupling.
