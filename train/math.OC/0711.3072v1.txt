This work proposes a notion of robust reachability of one set from another set under constant control. This notion is used to construct a control strategy, involving sequential set-to-set reachability, which guarantees robust global stabilization of nonlinear sampled data systems with positive sampling rate. Sufficient conditions for robust reachability of one set from another under constant control are also provided. Finally, the proposed method is illustrated through two examples.
