We are concerned with input-to-state stability (ISS) of randomly switched systems. We provide preliminary results dealing with sufficient conditions for stochastic versions of ISS for randomly switched systems without control inputs, and with the aid of universal formulae we design controllers for ISS-disturbance attenuation when control inputs are present. Two types of switching signals are considered: the first is characterized by a statistically slow-switching condition, and the second by a class of semi-Markov processes.
