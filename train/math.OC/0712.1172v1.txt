Let X be a real Banach space with a normalized duality mapping uniformly norm-to-weak^\star continuous on bounded sets or a reflexive Banach space which admits a weakly continuous duality mapping J_{\Phi} with gauge \phi. Let f be an {\em \alpha-contraction} and \{T_n\} a sequence of nonexpansive mapping, we study the strong convergence of explicit iterative schemes   x_{n+1} = \alpha_n f(x_n) + (1-\alpha_n) T_n x_n   with a general theorem and then recover and improve some specific cases studied in the literature
