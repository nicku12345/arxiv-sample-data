In this paper, we describe a novel approach for checking safety specifications of a dynamical system with exogenous inputs over infinite time horizon that is guaranteed to terminate in finite time with a conclusive answer. We introduce the notion of resolution completeness for analysis of safety falsification algorithms and propose sampling-based resolution-complete algorithms for safety falsification of linear time-invariant discrete time systems over infinite time horizon. The algorithms are based on deterministic incremental search procedures, exploring the reachable set for feasible counter examples to safety at increasing resolution levels of the input. Given a target resolution of inputs, the algorithms are guaranteed to terminate either with a reachable state that violates the safety specification, or prove that no input exists at the given resolution that violates the specification.
