In this work, a sampled-data nonlinear observer is designed using a continuous-time design coupled with an inter-sample output predictor. The proposed sampled-data observer is a hybrid system. It is shown that under certain conditions, the robustness properties of the continuous-time design are inherited by the sampled-data design, as long as the sampling period is not too large. The approach is applied to linear systems and to triangular globally Lipschitz systems.
