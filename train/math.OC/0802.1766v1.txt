Linear matrix Inequalities (LMIs) have had a major impact on control but formulating a problem as an LMI is an art. Recently there is the beginnings of a theory of which problems are in fact expressible as LMIs. For optimization purposes it can also be useful to have "lifts" which are expressible as LMIs. We show here that this is a much less restrictive condition and give methods for actually constructing lifts and their LMI representation.
