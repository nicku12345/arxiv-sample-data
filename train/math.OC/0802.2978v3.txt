Conventional sliding mode controllers are based on the assumption of switching control but a well-known drawback of this approach is the chattering phenomenon. To overcome the undesirable chattering effects, the discontinuity in the control law can be smoothed out in a thin boundary layer neighboring the switching surface. In this work, rigorous proofs of the boundedness and convergence properties of smooth sliding mode controllers are presented. This result corrects flawed conclusions previously reached in the literature.
