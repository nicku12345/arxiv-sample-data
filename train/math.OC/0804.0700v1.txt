This paper is mainly concerned with the robustly stable adaptive control of single-input single-output impulse-free linear time-invariant singular dynamic systems of known order and unknown parameterizations subject to single external point delays. The control law is of pole-placement type and based on input/output measurements and parametrical estimation only. The parametrical estimation incorporates adaptation dead zones to prevent against potential instability caused by disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. The Weierstrass canonical form is investigated in detail to discuss controllability and observability via testable conditions of the given arbitrary state-space realization of the same order.
