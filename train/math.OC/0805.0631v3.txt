This paper is devoted to a study of linear, differential and topological classifications for linear controlled systems governed by ordinary differential equations. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the linear and topological equivalence are given. It is also shown that the differential equivalence is the same as the linear equivalence for the linear controlled systems.
