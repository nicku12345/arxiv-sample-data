We develop a fast algorithm to construct the robustness degradation function, which describes quantitatively the relationship between the proportion of systems guaranteeing the robustness requirement and the radius of the uncertainty set. This function can be applied to predict whether a controller design based on an inexact mathematical model will perform satisfactorily when implemented on the true system.
