This paper is addressed to a study of the null controllability for the semilinear parabolic equation with a complex principal part. For this purpose, we establish a key weighted identity for partial differential operators (\a+i\b)\pa_t+\sum\limits_{j,k=1}^n\pa_k(a^{jk}\pa_j) (with real functions \a and \b), by which we develop a universal approach, based on global Carleman estimate, to deduce not only the desired explicit observability estimate for the linearized complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, but also all the known controllability/observability results for the parabolic, hyperbolic, Schr\"odinger and plate equations that are derived via Carleman estimates.
