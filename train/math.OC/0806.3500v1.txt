The issue of white-noise-aided control is considered and its availability is proved. And a noise-aiding way is developed to stabilize perturbed systems to be input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to (w.r.t.) perturbations. To illustrate its effectiveness, the white-noise-aided control of a parameter perturbed chaotic Chen system is given as an example. And numerically, it shows that, comparing to the un-noise-aided case, noise-aided control can not only shorten the control's transient process but also save its cost. These are also demonstrated by various aiding noises such as common (symmetric) noise and non-common (independent or asymmetric) noise, where common noise is found to be the most efficient in enhancing the control.
