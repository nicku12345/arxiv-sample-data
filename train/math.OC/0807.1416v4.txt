This article is dedicated to the study of mixed zero-sum two-player stochastic differential games in the situation when the player's cost functionals are modeled by doubly controlled reflected backward stochastic equations with two barriers whose coefficients have quadratic growth in Z. This is a generalization of the risk-sensitive payoffs. We show that the lower and the upper value function associated with this stochastic differential game with reflection are deterministic and they are also the unique viscosity solutions for two Isaacs equations with obstacles.
