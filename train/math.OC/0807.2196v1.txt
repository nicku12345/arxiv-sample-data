We consider the well-known following shape optimization problem: \lambda_1(\Omega^*)=\min_{\stackrel{|\Omega|=a} {\Omega\subset{D}}} \lambda_1(\Omega),  where \lambda_1 denotes the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, and D is an open bounded set (a box). It is well-known that the solution of this problem is the ball of volume a if such a ball exists in the box D (Faber-Krahn's theorem). In this paper, we prove regularity properties of the boundary of the optimal shapes \Omega^* in any case and in any dimension. Full regularity is obtained in dimension 2.
