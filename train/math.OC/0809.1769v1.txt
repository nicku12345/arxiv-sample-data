This paper presents the natural extension of Buckley-Feuring method proposed in \cite{BuckleyFeuring99} for solving fuzzy partial differential equations (FPDE) in a non-polynomial relation, such as the operator \varphi(D_{x_1}, D_{x_2}), which maps to the quotient between both partials. The new assumptions and conditions proceedings from this consideration are given in this document.
