In this paper we present the proximal point method for a special class of nonconvex function on a Hadamard manifold. The well definedness of the sequence generated by the proximal point method is guaranteed. Moreover, it is proved that each accumulation point of this sequence satisfies the necessary optimality conditions and, under additional assumptions, its convergence for a minimizer is obtained.
