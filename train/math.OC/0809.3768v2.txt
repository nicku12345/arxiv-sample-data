This paper is concerned with the stability problem for the planar linear switched system \dot x(t)=u(t)A_1x(t)+(1-u(t))A_2x(t), where the real matrices A_1,A_2\in \R^{2\times 2} are Hurwitz and u(\cdot) [0,\infty[\to\{0,1\} is a measurable function. We give coordinate-invariant necessary and sufficient conditions on A_1 and A_2 under which the system is asymptotically stable for arbitrary switching functions u(\cdot). The new conditions unify those given in previous papers and are simpler to be verified since we are reduced to study 4 cases instead of 20. Most of the cases are analyzed in terms of the function \Gamma(A_1,A_2)={1/2}(\tr(A_1) \tr(A_2)- \tr(A_1A_2)).
