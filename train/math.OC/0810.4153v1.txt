A simple procedure to map two probability measures in \mathbb{R}^d is the so-called \emph{Knothe-Rosenblatt rearrangement}, which consists in rearranging monotonically the marginal distributions of the last coordinate, and then the conditional distributions, iteratively. We show that this mapping is the limit of solutions to a class of Monge-Kantorovich mass transportation problems with quadratic costs, with the weights of the coordinates asymptotically dominating one another. This enables us to design a continuation method for numerically solving the optimal transport problem.
