Lyapunov-Krasowskii functionals are used to design quantized control laws for nonlinear continuous-time systems in the presence of constant delays in the input. The quantized control law is implemented via hysteresis to prevent chattering. Under appropriate conditions, our analysis applies to stabilizable nonlinear systems for any value of the quantization density. The resulting quantized feedback is parametrized with respect to the quantization density. Moreover, the maximal allowable delay tolerated by the system is characterized as a function of the quantization density.
