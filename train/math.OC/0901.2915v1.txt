We extend the notions of conditioned and controlled invariant spaces to linear dynamical systems over the max-plus or tropical semiring. We establish a duality theorem relating both notions, which we use to construct dynamic observers. These are useful in situations in which some of the system coefficients may vary within certain intervals. The results are illustrated by an application to a manufacturing system.
