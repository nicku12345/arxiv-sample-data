A closed subset M of a Banach space E is \ep, i.e., can be represented locally as the epigraph of a Lipschitz function, if and only if it is the level set of some locally Lipschitz function f: E\to \R, wich Clarke's generalized gradient does not contain 0 at points in the boundary of M, i.e., such that: M=\{x \mid f(x)\leq 0\}, 0\not \in \partial f(x) {if} x\in \bd M. This extends the characterization previously known in finite dimension and answers to a standing open question
