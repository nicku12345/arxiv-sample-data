The control of quantum phenomena is a topic that has carried out many challenging problems. Among others, the Hamiltonian identification, i.e, the inverse problem associated with the unknown features of a quantum system is still an open issue. In this work, we present an algorithm that enables to design a set of selective laser fields that can be used, in a second stage, to identify unknown parameters of quantum systems.
