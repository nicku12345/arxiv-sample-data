We design receding horizon control strategies for stochastic discrete-time linear systems with additive (possibly) unbounded disturbances, while obeying hard bounds on the control inputs. We pose the problem of selecting an appropriate optimal controller on vector spaces of functions and show that the resulting optimization problem has a tractable convex solution. Under the assumption that the zero-input and zero-noise system is asymptotically stable, we show that the variance of the state is bounded when enforcing hard bounds on the control inputs, for any receding horizon implementation. Throughout the article we provide several examples that illustrate how quantities needed in the formulation of the resulting optimization problems can be calculated off-line, as well as comparative examples that illustrate the effectiveness of our control strategies.
