We introduce the notion of strong local minimizer for the problems of the calculus of variations on time scales. Simple examples show that on a time scale a weak minimum is not necessarily a strong minimum. A time scale form of the Weierstrass necessary optimality condition is proved, which enables to include and generalize in the same result both continuous-time and discrete-time conditions.
