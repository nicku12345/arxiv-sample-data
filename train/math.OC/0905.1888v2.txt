Applying the Tubular Neighborhood Theorem, we give a short and new proof of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle on a smooth manifold. The idea is as follows. Given a control system on a manifold M, we embed it into an open subset of some \mathbb R^n, and extend the control system to the open set. Then, we apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle on \mathbb R^n to the extended system and project the consequence to M.
