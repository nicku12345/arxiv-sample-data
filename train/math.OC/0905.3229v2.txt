Multiobjective control design is known to be a difficult problem both in theory and practice. Our approach is to search for locally optimal solutions of a nonsmooth optimization problem that is built to incorporate minimization objectives and constraints for multiple plants. We report on the success of this approach using our public-domain Matlab toolbox HIFOO 2.0, comparing our results with benchmarks in the literature.
