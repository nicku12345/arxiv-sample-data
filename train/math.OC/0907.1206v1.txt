The motivation behind mathematically modeling the human operator is to help explain the response characteristics of the complex dynamical system including the human manual controller. In this paper, we present two approaches to human operator modeling: classical linear control approach and modern nonlinear control approach. The latter one is formalized using both fixed and adaptive Lie-Derivative based controllers.   Keywords: Human operator, linear control, nonlinear control, Lie derivative operator
