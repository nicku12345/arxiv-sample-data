To tackle the difficulties faced by both stochastic dynamic programming and scenario tree methods, we present some variational approach for numerical solution of stochastic optimal control problems. We consider two different interpretations of the control problem, an algebraic and a functional one from which we derive optimality conditions. An adaptative mesh discretization method will be used to propose a tractable solution algorithm. An application to a hydro-electric dam production management problem will be presented.
