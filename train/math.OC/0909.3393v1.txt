The aim of this paper is to investigate the links between {\cal T}_C-class algorithms, CQ Algorithm and shrinking projection methods. We show that strong convergence of these algorithms are related to coherent {\cal T}_C-class sequences of mapping. Some examples dealing with nonexpansive finite set of mappings and nonexpansive semigroups are given. They extend some existing theorems.
