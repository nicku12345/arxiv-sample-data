For a general class of dynamical systems (of which the canonical continuous and uniform discrete versions are but special cases), we prove that there is a state feedback gain such that the resulting closed-loop system is uniformly exponentially stable with a prescribed rate. The methods here generalize and extend Gramian-based linear state feedback control to much more general time domains, e.g. nonuniform discrete or a combination of continuous and discrete time. In conclusion, we discuss an experimental implementation of this theory.
