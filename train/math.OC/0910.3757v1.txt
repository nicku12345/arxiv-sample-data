Sufficient conditions for global stabilization of nonlinear systems with delayed input by means of approximate predictors are presented. An approximate predictor is a mapping which approximates the exact values of the stabilizing input for the corresponding system with no delay. A systematic procedure for the construction of approximate predictors is provided for globally Lipschitz systems. The resulting stabilizing feedback can be implemented by means of a dynamic distributed delay feedback law. Illustrating examples show the efficiency of the proposed control strategy.
