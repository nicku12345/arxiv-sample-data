The minimum value function appearing in Tikhonov regularization technique is very useful in determining the regularization parameter, both theoretically and numerically. In this paper, we discuss the properties of the minimum value function. We also propose an efficient method to determine the regularization parameter. A new criterion for the determination of the regularization parameter is also discussed.
