The discrete-time, the quantum, and the continuous calculus of variations have been recently unified and extended. Two approaches are followed in the literature: one dealing with minimization of delta integrals; the other dealing with minimization of nabla integrals. Here we propose a more general approach to the calculus of variations on time scales that allows to obtain both delta and nabla results as particular cases.
