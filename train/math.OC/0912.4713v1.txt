In this paper we consider switched nonlinear systems under average dwell time switching signals, with an otherwise arbitrary compact index set and with additional constraints in the switchings. We present invariance principles for these systems and derive by using observability-like notions some convergence and asymptotic stability criteria. These results enable us to analyze the stability of solutions of switched systems with both state-dependent constrained switching and switching whose logic has memory, i.e., the active subsystem only can switch to a prescribed subset of subsystems.
