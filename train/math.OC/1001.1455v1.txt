The fundamental problem of the calculus of variations on time scales concerns the minimization of a delta-integral over all trajectories satisfying given boundary conditions. This includes the discrete-time, the quantum, and the continuous/classical calculus of variations as particular cases. In this note we follow Leitmann's direct method to give explicit solutions for some concrete optimal control problems on an arbitrary time scale.
