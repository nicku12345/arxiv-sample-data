We come up with a class of distributed quantized averaging algorithms on asynchronous communication networks with fixed, switching and random topologies. The implementation of these algorithms is subject to the realistic constraint that the communication rate, the memory capacities of agents and the computation precision are finite. The focus of this paper is on the study of the convergence time of the proposed quantized averaging algorithms. By appealing to random walks on graphs, we derive polynomial bounds on the expected convergence time of the algorithms presented.
