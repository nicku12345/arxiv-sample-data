Nature-inspired algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Firefly Algorithm are among the most powerful algorithms for optimization. In this paper, we intend to formulate a new metaheuristic algorithm by combining Levy flights with the search strategy via the Firefly Algorithm. Numerical studies and results suggest that the proposed Levy-flight firefly algorithm is superior to existing metaheuristic algorithms. Finally implications for further research and wider applications will be discussed.
