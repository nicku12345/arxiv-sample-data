Combining recent moment and sparse semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation techniques, we propose an approach to find smooth approximations for solutions of problems involving nonlinear differential equations. Given a system of nonlinear differential equations, we apply a technique based on finite differences and sparse SDP relaxations for polynomial optimization problems (POP) to obtain a discrete approximation of its solution. In a second step we apply maximum entropy estimation (using moments of a Borel measure associated with the discrete solution) to obtain a smooth closed-form approximation. The approach is illustrated on a variety of linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE), partial differential equations (PDE) and optimal control problems (OCP), and preliminary numerical results are reported.
