We build upon some new ideas in direct transcription methods developed within the Advanced Concepts Team to introduce two improvements to the Sims-Flanagan transcription for low-thrust trajectories. The obtained new algorithm is able to produce an operational trajectory accounting for the real spacecraft dynamics and adapting the segment duration on-line improving the final trajectory optimality.
