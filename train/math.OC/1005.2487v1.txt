A fruitful idea, when providing subdifferential formulae and dual representations for convex risk measures, is to make use of the conjugate duality theory in convex optimization. In this paper we underline the outstanding role played by the qualification conditions in the context of different problem formulations in this area. We show that not only the meanwhile classical generalized interiority point ones come here to bear, but also a recently introduced one formulated by means of the quasi-relative interior.
