For discrete time nonlinear systems satisfying an exponential or finite time controllability assumption, we present an analytical formula for a suboptimality estimate for model predictive control schemes without stabilizing terminal constraints. Based on our formula, we perform a detailed analysis of the impact of the optimization horizon and the possibly time varying control horizon on stability and performance of the closed loop.
