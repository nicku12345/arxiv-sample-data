The calculus of variations on time scales is considered. We propose a new approach to the subject that consists in applying a differentiation tool called the contingent epiderivative. It is shown that the contingent epiderivative applied to the calculus of variations on time scales is very useful: it allows to unify the delta and nabla approaches previously considered in the literature. Generalized versions of the Euler-Lagrange necessary optimality conditions are obtained, both for the basic problem of the calculus of variations and isoperimetric problems. As particular cases one gets the recent delta and nabla results.
