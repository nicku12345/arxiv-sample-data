We generalize the fractional Caputo derivative to the fractional derivative {^CD^{\alpha,\beta}_{\gamma}}, which is a convex combination of the left Caputo fractional derivative of order \alpha and the right Caputo fractional derivative of order \beta. The fractional variational problems under our consideration are formulated in terms of {^CD^{\alpha,\beta}_{\gamma}}. The Euler-Lagrange equations for the basic and isoperimetric problems, as well as transversality conditions, are proved.
