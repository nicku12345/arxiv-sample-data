The aim of this paper is to implement some new techniques, based on conjugate duality in convex optimization, for proving the existence of global error bounds for convex inequality systems. We deal first of all with systems described via one convex inequality and extend the achieved results, by making use of a celebrated scalarization function, to convex inequality systems expressed by means of a general vector function. We also propose a second approach for guaranteeing the existence of global error bounds of the latter, which meanwhile sharpens the classical result of Robinson.
