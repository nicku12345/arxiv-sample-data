We present a unified treatment to control problems on an arbitrary time scale by introducing the study of forward-backward optimal control problems. Necessary optimality conditions for delta-nabla isoperimetric problems are proved, and previous results in the literature obtained as particular cases. As an application of the results of the paper we give necessary and sufficient Pareto optimality conditions for delta-nabla bi-objective optimal control problems.
