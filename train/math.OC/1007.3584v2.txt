We study a feedback scheme to stabilize an arbitrary photon number state in a microwave cavity. The quantum non-demolition measurement of the cavity state allows a non-deterministic preparation of Fock states. Here, by the mean of a controlled field injection, we desire to make this preparation process deterministic. The system evolves through a discrete-time Markov process and we design the feedback law applying Lyapunov techniques. Also, in our feedback design we take into account an unavoidable pure delay and we compensate it by a stochastic version of a Smith predictor. After illustrating the efficiency of the proposed feedback law through simulations, we provide a rigorous proof of the global stability of the closed-loop system based on tools from stochastic stability analysis. A brief study of the Lyapunov exponents of the linearized system around the target state gives a strong indication of the robustness of the method.
