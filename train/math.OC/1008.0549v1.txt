Test functions are important to validate new optimization algorithms and to compare the performance of various algorithms. There are many test functions in the literature, but there is no standard list or set of test functions one has to follow. New optimization algorithms should be tested using at least a subset of functions with diverse properties so as to make sure whether or not the tested algorithm can solve certain type of optimization efficiently. Here we provide a selected list of test problems for unconstrained optimization.
