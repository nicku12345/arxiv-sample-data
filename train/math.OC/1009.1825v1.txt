It is well-known that duality in the Monge-Kantorovich transport problem holds true provided that the cost function c:X\times Y\to [0,\infty] is lower semi-continuous or finitely valued, but it may fail otherwise. We present a suitable notion of \emph{rectificaton} c_r of the cost c, so that the Monge-Kantorovich duality holds true replacing c by c_r. In particular, passing from c to c_r only changes the value of the primal Monge-Kantorovich problem. Finally, the rectified function c_r  is lower semi-continuous as soon as X and Y are endowed with proper topologies, thus emphasizing the role of lower semi-continuity in the duality-theory of optimal transport.
