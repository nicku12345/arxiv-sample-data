We prove Euler-Lagrange and natural boundary necessary optimality conditions for fractional problems of the calculus of variations which are given by a composition of functionals. Our approach uses the recent notions of Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives and integrals in the sense of Jumarie. As an application, we get optimality conditions for the product and the quotient of fractional variational functionals.
