In this paper a new algorithm for adaptive dynamic channel estimation for frequency selective time varying fading OFDM channels is proposed. The new algorithm adopts a new strategy that successfully increases OFDM symbol rate. Instead of using a fixed training pilot sequence, the proposed algorithm uses a logic controller to choose among several available training patterns. The controller choice is based on the cross-correlation between pilot symbols over two consecutive time instants (which is considered to be a suitable measure of channel stationarity) as well as the deviation from the desired BER. Simulation results of the system performance confirm the effectiveness of this new channel estimation technique over traditional non-adaptive estimation methods in increasing the data rate of OFDM symbols while maintaining the same probability of error.
