HIFOO is a public-domain Matlab package initially designed for Hinfinity fixed-order controller synthesis, using nonsmooth nonconvex optimization techniques. It was later on extended to multi-objective synthesis, including strong and simultaneous stabilization under Hinfinity constraints. In this paper we describe a further extension of HIFOO to H2 performance criteria, making it possible to address mixed H2/Hinfinity synthesis. We give implementation details and report our extensive benchmark results.
