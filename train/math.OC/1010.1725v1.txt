This paper provides new results for a tracking control of the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. Both of the attitude dynamics and the proposed control system are globally expressed on the special orthogonal group, to avoid complexities and ambiguities associated with other attitude representations such as Euler angles or quaternions. By selecting an attitude error function carefully, we show that the proposed control system guarantees a desirable tracking performance uniformly for nontrivial rotational maneuvers involving a large initial attitude error. In a special case where the desired attitude command is fixed, we also show that the attitude dynamics can be stabilized without the knowledge of an inertia matrix. These are illustrated by numerical examples.
