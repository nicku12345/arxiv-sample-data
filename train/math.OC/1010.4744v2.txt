The paper is concerned with optimal control of backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) driven by Teugel's martingales and an independent multi-dimensional Brownian motion, where Teugel's martingales are a family of pairwise strongly orthonormal martingales associated with L\'{e}vy processes (see Nualart and Schoutens \cite{NuSc}). We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the optimal control by means of convex variation methods and duality techniques. As an application, the optimal control problem of linear backward stochastic differential equation with a quadratic cost criteria (called backward linear-quadratic problem, or BLQ problem for short) is discussed and characterized by stochastic Hamilton system.
