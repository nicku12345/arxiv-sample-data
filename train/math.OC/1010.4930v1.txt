We address the issue of minimal time optimal control of fedbatch reactor in presence of complex non monotonic kinetics, that can be typically characterized by the combination of two Haldane models. The optimal synthesis may present several singular arcs. Global optimal trajectory results are provided on the basis of a numerical approach that considers an approximation method with smooth control inputs.
