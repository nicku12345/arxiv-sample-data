The paper presents partial-realization theory and realization algorithms for linear switched systems. Linear switched systems are a particular subclass of hybrid systems. We formulate a notion of a partial realization and we present conditions for existence of a minimal partial realization. We propose two partial-realization algorithms and we show that under certain conditions they yield a complete realization. Our main tool is the theory of rational formal power series.
