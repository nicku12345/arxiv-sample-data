In this paper, we consider the well-known following shape optimization problem: \lambda_2(\Omega^*)=\min_{\stackrel{|\Omega|=V_0} {\Omega\textrm{ convex}}} \lambda_2(\Omega), where \lambda_2(\Om) denotes the second eigenvalue of the Laplace operator with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions in \Om\subset\R^2, and |\Om| is the area of \Om. We prove, under some technical assumptions, that any optimal shape \Omega^* is \mathcal{C}^{1,\frac{1}{2}} and is not \C^{1,\alpha} for any \alpha>\frac{1}{2}. We also derive from our strategy some more general regularity results, in the framework of partially overdetermined boundary value problems, and we apply these results to some other shape optimization problems.
