In this paper we study an optimal control problem associated to a linear degenerate elliptic equation with mixed boundary conditions. The equations of this type can exhibit the Lavrentieff phenomenon and non-uniqueness of weak solutions. We adopt the weight function as a control in L^1(\Omega). Using the direct method in the Calculus of variations, we discuss the solvability of this optimal control problem in the class of weak admissible solutions.
