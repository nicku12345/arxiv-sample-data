To a function with values in the power set of a pre--ordered, separated locally convex space a family of scalarizations is given which completely characterizes the original function. A concept of a Legendre--Fenchel conjugate for set-valued functions is introduced and identified with the conjugates of the scalarizations. The concept of conjugation is connected to the notion of (*,s)--dualities and duality results are provided.
