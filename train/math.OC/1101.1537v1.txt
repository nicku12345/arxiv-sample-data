A geometric approach to kinematics in control theory is illustrated. A non-linear control system is derived for the problem and the Pontryagin maximum principle is used to find the time-optimal trajectories of the Parallel navigation. The time-optimal trajectories of the Parallel navigation are characterized through a geometric formulation. It is notable that the approach has the advantages using feedback.
