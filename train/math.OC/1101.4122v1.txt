We consider the semi-infinite optimization problem: f^*:=\min_{x\in X}\:\{f(x): g(x,y)\,\leq \,0,\:\forally\in Y_x\}, where f,g are polynomials and X\subset R^n as well as Y_\x\subset R^p, x\in X, are compact basic semi-algebraic sets. To approximate f^* we proceed in two steps. First, we use the "joint+marginal" approach of the author to approximate from above the function x\mapsto\Phi(x)=\sup \{g(x,y): y\in Y_x\} by a polynomial \Phi_d\geq\Phi, of degree at most 2d, with the strong property that \Phi_d converges to \Phi for the L_1-norm, as d\to\infty (and in particular, almost uniformly for some subsequence (d_\ell), \ell\in\N). Then we solve the polynomial optimization problem f^*_d=\min_{x\in X} \{f(x): \Phi_d(x)\leq0\} via a (by now standard) hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations. It turns out that the optimal value f^*_d\geq f^* converges to f^* as d\to\infty. In practice we let d be fixed, small, and relax the constraint \Phi_d\leq0 to \Phi_d(x)\leq\epsilon with \epsilon>0, allowing to change \epsilon dynamically.
