In this paper we introduce new notions of local extremality for finite and infinite systems of closed sets and establish the corresponding extremal principles for them called here rated extremal principles. These developments are in the core geometric theory of variational analysis. We present their applications to calculus and optimality conditions for problems with infinitely many constraints.
