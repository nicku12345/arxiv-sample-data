We consider the inverse optimization problem associated with the polynomial program f^*=\min \{f(x): x\in K\} and a given current feasible solution y\in K. We provide a systematic numerical scheme to compute an inverse optimal solution. That is, we compute a polynomial \tilde{f} (which may be of same degree as f if desired) with the following properties: (a) y is a global minimizer of \tilde{f} on K with a Putinar's certificate with an a priori degree bound d fixed, and (b), \tilde{f} minimizes \Vert f-\tilde{f}\Vert (which can be the \ell_1, \ell_2 or \ell_\infty-norm of the coefficients) over all polynomials with such properties. Computing \tilde{f}_d reduces to solving a semidefinite program whose optimal value also provides a bound on how far is f(\y) from the unknown optimal value f^*. The size of the semidefinite program can be adapted to the computational capabilities available. Moreover, if one uses the \ell_1-norm, then \tilde{f} takes a simple and explicit canonical form. Some variations are also discussed.
