For a minimal inequality derived from a maximal lattice-free simplicial polytope in \R^n, we investigate the region where minimal liftings are uniquely defined, and we characterize when this region covers \R^n. We then use this characterization to show that a minimal inequality derived from a maximal lattice-free simplex in \R^n with exactly one lattice point in the relative interior of each facet has a unique minimal lifting if and only if all the vertices of the simplex are lattice points.
