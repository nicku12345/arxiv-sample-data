Verifying the Second-Order Sufficient Condition (SOSC), thus ensuring a stationary point locally minimizes a given objective function (subject to certain constraints), is an essential component of non-convex computational optimization and equilibrium programming. This article proposes three new "Hessian-free" tests of the SOSC that can be implemented efficiently with gradient evaluations alone and reveal feasible directions of negative curvature when the SOSC fails. The Bordered Hessian Test and a Matrix Inertia test, two classical tests of the SOSC, require explicit knowledge of the Hessian of the Lagrangian and do not reveal feasible directions of negative curvature should the SOSC fail. Computational comparisons of the new methods with classical tests demonstrate the relative efficiency of these new algorithms and the need for careful study of false negatives resulting from accumulation of round-off errors.
