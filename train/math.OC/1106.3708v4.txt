We present a canonical way to turn any smooth parametric family of probability distributions on an arbitrary search space X into a continuous-time black-box optimization method on X, the \emph{information-geometric optimization} (IGO) method. Invariance as a design principle minimizes the number of arbitrary choices. The resulting \emph{IGO flow} conducts the natural gradient ascent of an adaptive, time-dependent, quantile-based transformation of the objective function. It makes no assumptions on the objective function to be optimized.   The IGO method produces explicit IGO algorithms through time discretization. It naturally recovers versions of known algorithms and offers a systematic way to derive new ones. The cross-entropy method is recovered in a particular case, and can be extended into a smoothed, parametrization-independent maximum likelihood update (IGO-ML). For Gaussian distributions on \mathbb{R}^d, IGO is related to natural evolution strategies (NES) and recovers a version of the CMA-ES algorithm. For Bernoulli distributions on \{0,1\}^d, we recover the PBIL algorithm. From restricted Boltzmann machines, we obtain a novel algorithm for optimization on \{0,1\}^d. All these algorithms are unified under a single information-geometric optimization framework.   Thanks to its intrinsic formulation, the IGO method achieves invariance under reparametrization of the search space X, under a change of parameters of the probability distributions, and under increasing transformations of the objective function.   Theory strongly suggests that IGO algorithms have minimal loss in diversity during optimization, provided the initial diversity is high. First experiments using restricted Boltzmann machines confirm this insight. Thus IGO seems to provide, from information theory, an elegant way to spontaneously explore several valleys of a fitness landscape in a single run.
