The concepts of infinity and infinitesimal in mathematics date back to anciens Greek and have always attracted great attention. Very recently, a new methodology has been proposed by Sergeyev for performing calculations with infinite and infinitesimal quantities, by introducing an infinite unit of measure expressed by the numeral grossone. An important characteristic of this novel approach is its attention to numerical aspects. In this paper we will present some possible applications and use of grossone in Operations Research and Mathematical Programming. In particular, we will show how the use of grossone can be beneficial in anti--cycling procedure for the well-known simplex method for solving Linear Programming Problems and in defining exact differentiable Penalty Functions in Nonlinear Programming.
