Consider a homogeneous multifold convex conic system  Ax = 0, \; x\in K_1\times...\times K_r  and its alternative system  A\transp y \in K_1^*\times...\times K_r^*,  where K_1,..., K_r are regular closed convex cones. We show that there is canonical partition of the index set {1,...,r} determined by certain complementarity sets associated to the most interior solutions to the two systems. Our results are inspired by and extend the Goldman-Tucker Theorem for linear programming.
