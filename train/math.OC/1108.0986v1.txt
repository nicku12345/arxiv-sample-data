We propose a proximal point algorithm to solve LAROS problem, that is the problem of finding a "large approximately rank-one submatrix". This LAROS problem is used to sequentially extract features in data. We also develop a new stopping criterion for the proximal point algorithm, which is based on the duality conditions of \eps-optimal solutions of the LAROS problem, with a theoretical guarantee. We test our algorithm with two image databases and show that we can use the LAROS problem to extract appropriate common features from these images.
