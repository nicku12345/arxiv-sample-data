We prove existence of an optimal transport map in the Monge-Kantorovich problem associated to a cost c(x,y) which is not finite everywhere, but coincides with |x-y|^2 if the displacement y-x belongs to a given convex set C and it is +\infty otherwise. The result is proven for C satisfying some technical assumptions allowing any convex body in \R^2 and any convex polyhedron in \R^d, d>2. The tools are inspired by the recent Champion-DePascale-Juutinen technique. Their idea, based on density points and avoiding disintegrations and dual formulations, allowed to deal with L^\infty problems and, later on, with the Monge problem for arbitrary norms.
