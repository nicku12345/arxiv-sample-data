This paper presents an equivalence theorem for three different kinds of optimal control problems, which are optimal target control problems, optimal norm control problems and optimal time control problems. Controlled systems in this study are internally controlled heat equations. With the aid of this theorem, we establish an optimal norm feedback law and build up two algorithms for optimal norms (together with optimal norm controls) and optimal time (along with optimal time controls), respectively.
