In this paper we study the error in the approximate simultaneous controllability of the bilinear Schrodinger equation. We provide estimates based on a tracking algorithm for general bilinear quantum systems and on the study of the finite dimensional Galerkin approximations for a particular class of quantum systems, weakly-coupled systems. We then present two physical examples: the perturbed quantum harmonic oscillator and the infinite potential well.
