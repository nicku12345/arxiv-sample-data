This paper analyzes a class of impulse control problems for multi-dimensional jump diffusions in the finite time horizon. Following the basic mathematical setup from Stroock and Varadhan \cite{StroockVaradhan06}, this paper first establishes rigorously an appropriate form of Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP). It then shows that the value function is a viscosity solution for the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Belleman (HJB) equation involving integro-differential operators. Finally, under additional assumptions that the jumps are of infinite activity but are of finite variation and that the diffusion is uniformly elliptic, it proves that the value function is the unique viscosity solution and has W_{loc}^{(2,1),p} regularity for 1< p< \infty
