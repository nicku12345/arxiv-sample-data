Conic linear programs, among them semidefinite programs, often behave pathologically: the optimal values of the primal and dual programs may differ, and may not be attained. We present a novel analysis of these pathological behaviors. We call a conic linear system Ax <= b {\em badly behaved} if the value of \sup { < c, x > | A x <= b } is finite but the dual program has no solution with the same value for {\em some} c. We describe simple and intuitive geometric characterizations of badly behaved conic linear systems. Our main motivation is the striking similarity of badly behaved semidefinite systems in the literature; we characterize such systems by certain {\em excluded matrices}, which are easy to spot in all published examples.   We show how to transform semidefinite systems into a canonical form, which allows us to easily verify whether they are badly behaved. We prove several other structural results about badly behaved semidefinite systems; for example, we show that they are in NP \cap co-NP in the real number model of computing. As a byproduct, we prove that all linear maps that act on symmetric matrices can be brought into a canonical form; this canonical form allows us to easily check whether the image of the semidefinite cone under the given linear map is closed.
