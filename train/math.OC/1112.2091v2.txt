Being Omega an open and bounded Lipschitz domain of R^n, we consider the generalized Willmore functional on Omega defined, for smooth functions, as the p-Willmore energy of each isolevel set integrated over all levels. We propose a new framework, that combines varifolds and Young measures, to study the relaxation of this functional in BV(Omega) with respect to the strong topology of L^1.
