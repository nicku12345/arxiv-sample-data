In this paper we derive strong linear inequalities for sets of the form {(x, q) \in Rd \times R : q \geq Q(x), x \in Rd - int(P)}, where Q(x) : Rd \rightarrow R is a quadratic function, P \subset Rd and "int" denotes interior. Of particular but not exclusive interest is the case where P denotes a closed convex set. In this paper, we present several cases where it is possible to characterize the convex hull by efficiently separable linear inequalities.
