A local convergence analysis of the Gauss-Newton method for solving injective-overdetermined systems of nonlinear equations under a majorant condition is provided. The convergence as well as results on its rate are established without a convexity hypothesis on the derivative of the majorant function. The optimal convergence radius, the biggest range for uniqueness of the solution along with some other special cases are also obtained.range for uniqueness of the solution along with some other special cases.
