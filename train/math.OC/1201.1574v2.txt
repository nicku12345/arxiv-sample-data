In this paper, we point out a very flexible scheme within which a strict minimax inequality occurs. We then show the fruitfulness of this approach presenting a series of various consequences. Here is one of them: Let Y be a finite-dimensional real Hilbert space, J:Y\to {\bf R} a C^1 function with locally Lipschitzian derivative, and \varphi:Y\to [0,+\infty[ a C^1 convex function with locally Lipschitzian derivative at 0 and \varphi^{-1}(0)=\{0\}. Then, for each x_0\in Y for wich J'(x_0)\neq 0, there exists \delta>0 such that, for each r\in ]0,\delta[, the restriction of J to B(x_0,r) has a unique global minimum u_r which satisfies J(u_r)\leq J(x)-\varphi(x-u_r) for all x\in B(x_0,r), where B(x_0,r)=\{x\in Y: \|x-x_0\|\leq r\}\ .
