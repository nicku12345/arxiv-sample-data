In this paper, we study time optimal control problems for heat equations on \Omega\times \mathbb{R}^+. Two properties under consideration are the existence and the bang-bang properties of time optimal controls. It is proved that those two properties hold when controls are imposed on some proper subsets of \Omega; while they do not stand when controls are active on the whole \Omega. Besides, a new property for eigenfunctions of -\Delta with Dirichlet boundary condition is revealed.
