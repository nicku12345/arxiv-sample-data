The Faber-Krahn deficit \delta\lambda of an open bounded set \Omega is the normalized gap between the values that the first Dirichlet Laplacian eigenvalue achieves on \Omega and on the ball having same measure as \Omega. For any given family of open bounded sets of \R^N (N\ge 2) smoothly converging to a ball, it is well known that both \delta\lambda and the isoperimetric deficit \delta P are vanishing quantities. It is known as well that, at least for convex sets, the ratio \frac{\delta P}{\delta \lambda} is bounded by below by some positive constant (see \cite{BNT,PW}), and in this note, using the technique of the shape derivative, we provide the explicit optimal lower bound of such a ratio as \delta P goes to zero.
