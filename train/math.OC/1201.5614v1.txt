In the last few years there has been a growing interest in the use of symbolic models for the formal verification and control design of purely continuous or hybrid systems. Symbolic models are abstract descriptions of continuous systems where one symbol corresponds to an "aggregate" of continuous states. In this paper we face the problem of deriving symbolic models for nonlinear control systems affected by disturbances. The main contribution of this paper is in proposing symbolic models that can be effectively constructed and that approximate nonlinear control systems affected by disturbances in the sense of alternating approximate bisimulation.
