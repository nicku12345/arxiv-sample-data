Observer design is considered for a class of non-linear systems whose non-linear part is energy preserving. A strategy to construct convergent observers for this class of non-linear system is presented. The approach has the advantage that it is possible, via convex programming, to prove whether the constructed observer converges, in contrast to several existing approaches to observer design for non-linear systems. Finally, the developed methods are applied to the Lorenz attractor and to a low order model for shear fluid flow.
