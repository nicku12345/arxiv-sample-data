Networked Control Systems (NCSs) are often associated with problems like random data losses which might lead to system instability. This paper proposes a method based on the use of variable controller gains to achieve maximum parametric robustness of the plant controlled over a network. Stability using variable controller gains under data loss conditions is analyzed using a suitable Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) formulation. Also, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based technique is used to maximize parametric robustness of the plant.
