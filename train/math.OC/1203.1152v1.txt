The aim of this note is to emphasize the fact that in many papers on invexity published in prestigious journals there are not clear definitions, trivial or not clear statements and wrong proofs. We also point out the unprofessional way of answering readers' questions by some authors. We think that this is caused mainly by the lack of criticism of the invexity community
