The aim of this paper is to develop an efficient algorithm for solving a class of unconstrained nondifferentiable convex optimization problems in finite dimensional spaces. To this end we formulate first its Fenchel dual problem and regularize it in two steps into a differentiable strongly convex one with Lipschitz continuous gradient. The doubly regularized dual problem is then solved via a fast gradient method with the aim of accelerating the resulting convergence scheme. The theoretical results are finally applied to an l1 regularization problem arising in image processing.
