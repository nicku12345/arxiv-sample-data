We consider the problem of operator identification in quantum control. The free Hamiltonian and the dipole moment are searched such that a given target state is reached at a given time. A local existence result is obtained. As a by-product, our works reveals necessary conditions on the laser field to make the identification feasible. In the last part of this work, some algorithms are proposed to compute effectively these operators.
