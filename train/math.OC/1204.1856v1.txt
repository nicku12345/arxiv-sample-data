A time-inconsistent optimal control problem is formulated and studied for a controlled linear ordinary differential equation with quadratic cost functional. A notion of equilibrium control is introduced, which can be regarded as a time-consistent solution to the original time-inconsistent problem. Under certain conditions, we constructively prove the existence of such an equilibrium control which is represented via a forward ordinary differential equation coupled with a backward Riccati--Volterra integral equation. Our constructive approach is based on the introduction of a family of N-person non-cooperative differential games.
