Positive linear systems on arbitrary time scales are studied. The theory developed in the paper unifies and extends concepts and results known for continuous-time and discrete-time systems. A necessary and sufficient condition for a linear system on a time scale to be positive is presented. Properties of positive reachable sets are investigated and characterizations of various controllability properties are presented. A modified Gram matrix of the system is used to state necessary and sufficient condition of positive reachability of a positive system on an arbitrary time scale.
