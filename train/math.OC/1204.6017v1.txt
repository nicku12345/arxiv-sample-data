We show the approximate rotational controllability of a polar linear molecule by means of three nonresonant linear polarized laser fields. The result is based on a general approximate controllability result for the bilinear Schr\"odinger equation, with wavefunction varying in the unit sphere of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and with several control potentials, under the assumption that the internal Hamiltonian has discrete spectrum.
