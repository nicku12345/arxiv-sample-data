This paper proposes a general framework for compressed sensing of constrained joint sparsity (CJS) which includes total variation minimization (TV-min) as an example. TV- and 2-norm error bounds, independent of the ambient dimension, are derived for the CJS version of Basis Pursuit and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. As an application the results extend Cand`es, Romberg and Tao's proof of exact recovery of piecewise constant objects with noiseless incomplete Fourier data to the case of noisy data.
