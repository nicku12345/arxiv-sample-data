This paper describes an approximate method for global optimization of polynomial programming problems with bounded variables. The method uses a reformulation and linearization technique to transform the original polynomial optimization problem into a pair of mixed binary-linear programs. The solutions to these two integer-linear reformulations provide upper and lower bounds on the global solution to the original polynomial program. The tightness of these bounds, the error in approximating each polynomial expression, and the number of constraints that must be added in the process of reformulation all depend on the error tolerance specified by the user for each variable in the original polynomial program. As these error tolerances approach zero the size of the reformulated programs increases and the calculated interval bounds converge to the true global solution.
