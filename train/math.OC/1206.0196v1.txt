We compare two established and a new method for the calculation of spectral bounds for Hessian matrices on hyperrectangles by applying them to a large collection of 1522 objective and constraint functions extracted from benchmark global optimization problems. Both the tightness of the spectral bounds and the computational effort are assessed. Specifically, we compare eigenvalue bounds obtained with the interval variant of Gershgorin's circle criterion [2,6], Hertz and Rohn's [7,16] method for tight bounds of interval matrices, and a recently proposed Hessian matrix eigenvalue arithmetic [12], which deliberately avoids the computation of interval Hessians.
