Symmetries of nonlinear control systems in state representation are considered. To this end, a geometric approach to ordinary differential equations is advocated. Invariant feedback laws for systems with Lie symmetries, i.e. feedback laws that preserve the symmetry group of a considered plant, can be constructed based on invariants of the considered group action. Under minor technical assumptions suitable invariant tracking errors can be determined by following a normalization procedure. The underlying local geometric meaning of this procedure is discussed and it is shown how it can also be applied in order to derive a local, reduced-order system representation. Further, the idea of controlled symmetries, i.e. imposing desired symmetry properties on a given control system by state feedback, is discussed by outlining an exemplary control design for a predator-prey bioreactor.
