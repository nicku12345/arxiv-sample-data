In this paper, we present an iterative steering algorithm for nonholonomic systems (also called driftless control-affine systems) and we prove its global convergence under the sole assumption that the Lie Algebraic Rank Condition (LARC) holds true everywhere. That algorithm is an extension of the one introduced in [21] for regular systems. The first novelty here consists in the explicit algebraic construction, starting from the original control system, of a lifted control system which is regular. The second contribution of the paper is an exact motion planning method for nilpotent systems, which makes use of sinusoidal control laws and which is a generalization of the algorithm described in [29] for chained-form systems.
