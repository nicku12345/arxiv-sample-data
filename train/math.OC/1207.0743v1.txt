This paper presents an application of Genetic Algorithm (GA) metaheuristics to optimise the design of two-spool turbofan engines based on exergy and energy theories. The GA is used to seek the optimal values of eight parameters that define the turbofan engine. These parameters are encoded as chromosomes (a metaphor) in GA. A computer program called TurboJet-Engine Optimizer v1.0 (TJEO-1.0) was developed by the authors to perform calculations of thermodynamic properties of the engine and implement the optimisations. The caloric properties of the working fluids are obtained by using an 8th-order polynomial fluid model taken from an existing literature. The turbo-mechanical components in the turbofan engine are as well assumed to exhibit polytropic efficiencies of today's technology level. The TJEO-1.0 is integrated with Pyevolve, an open source GA optimisation framework built for used with Python programming language. The optimal design created by TJEO-1.0 was evaluated with the following criteria: (1.) energy efficiency, (2.) exergy efficiency, and (3.) combination of both of them. The results suggest that the design of turbofan engine optimised based on the third criterion is able to produce higher specific thrust (by more than 30 %), compared with the ones optimised based on the first and the second criteria.
