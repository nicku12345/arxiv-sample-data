Sufficient conditions are established for sampled-data feedback global asymptotic stabilization for nonlinear autonomous systems. One of our main results is an extension of the well known Artstein-Sontag theorem on feedback stabilization concerning affine in the control systems. A second aim of the present work is to provide sufficient conditions for sampled-data feedback asymptotic stabilization for two interconnected nonlinear systems. Lie algebraic sufficient conditions are derived for the case of affine in the control interconnected systems without drift terms.
