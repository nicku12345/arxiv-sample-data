Given a convex bounded domain \Omega  in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{d} and an integer N\geq 2, we associate to any jointly N-monotone (N-1)-tuplet (u_1, u_2,..., u_{N-1}) of vector fields from % \Omega into \mathbb{R}^{d}, a Hamiltonian H on {\mathbb{R}}^{d} \times {\mathbb{R}}^{d} ... \times {\mathbb{R}}^{d}, that is concave in the first variable, jointly convex in the last (N-1) variables such that for almost all % x\in \Omega, \hbox{(u_1(x), u_2(x),..., u_{N-1}(x))= \nabla_{2,...,N} H(x,x,...,x). Moreover, H is N-sub-antisymmetric, meaning that \sum% \limits_{i=0}^{N-1}H(\sigma ^{i}(\mathbf{x}))\leq 0 for all \mathbf{x}% =(x_{1},...,x_{N})\in \Omega ^{N}, \sigma  being the cyclic permutation on {\mathbb{R}}^{d} defined by \sigma (x_{1},x_2,...,x_{N})=(x_{2},x_{3},...,x_{N},x_{1}). Furthermore, H is N% -antisymmetric in a sense to be defined below. This can be seen as an extension of a theorem of E. Krauss, which associates to any monotone operator, a concave-convex antisymmetric saddle function. We also give various variational characterizations of vector fields that are almost everywhere N-monotone, showing that they are dual to the class of measure preserving N-involutions on \Omega.
