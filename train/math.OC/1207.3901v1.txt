This paper considers the grey linear programming and introduces a new satisfaction degree of optimal value for the positioned linear programming of the grey problem. The {\lambda}-satisfaction degree seems to reflect the real meaning of the positioned optimal values. By selecting {\lambda} according to the attitude of decision maker towards the satisfaction degree, an appropriate optimal solution can be obtained for the grey linear programming problem. An example is given to show the meaning of the new satisfaction degree.
