This paper investigates the necessary optimality conditions for uniformly overtaking optimal control on infinite horizon in the free end case. %with free right endpoint. In the papers of S.M.Aseev, A.V.Kryazhimskii, V.M.Veliov, K.O.Besov there was suggested the boundary condition for equations of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. Each optimal process corresponds to a unique solution satisfying the boundary condition. Following A.Seierstad's idea, in this paper we prove a more general geometric variety of that boundary condition. We show that this condition is necessary for uniformly overtaking optimal control on infinite horizon in the free end case. A number of assumptions under which this condition selects a unique Lagrange multiplier is obtained. The results are applicable to general non-stationary systems and the optimal objective value is not necessarily finite. Some examples are discussed.
