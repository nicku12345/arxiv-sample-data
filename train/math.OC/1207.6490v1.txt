The goal of this paper is to solve a class of high-order polynomial benchmark optimization problems, including the Goldstein-Price problem and the Three Hump Camel Back problem. By using a generalized canonical duality theory, we are able to transform the nonconvex primal problems to concave dual problems over convex domain(without duality gap), which can be solved easily to obtain global solutions.
