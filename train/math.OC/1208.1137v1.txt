Let X a probability measure space and \psi_1....\psi_N measurable, real valued functions on X. Consider all possible partitions of X into N disjoint subdomains X_i on which \int_{X_i}\psi_i are prescribed. We address the question of characterizing the set (m_1,,,m_N) \in \R^N for which there exists a partition X_1, ... X_N of X satisfying \int_{X_i}\psi_i= m_i and discuss some optimization problems on this set of partitions. The relation of this problem to semi-discrete version of optimal mass transportation is discussed as well.
