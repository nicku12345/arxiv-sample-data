Binary Integer Programming (BIP) problems are of interest due in part to the difficulty they pose and because of their various applications, including those in graph theory, combinatorial optimization and network optimization. In this note, we explicitly state the Lovasz-Schrijver Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxation (in primal-standard form) for a BIP problem, a relaxation that yields a tighter upper-bound than the canonical Linear Programming relaxation.
