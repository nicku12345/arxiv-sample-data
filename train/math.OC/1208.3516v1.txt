This paper considers the physical realizability condition for multi-level quantum systems having polynomial Hamiltonian and multiplicative coupling with respect to several interacting boson fields. Specifically, it generalizes a recent result the authors developed for two-level quantum systems. For this purpose, the algebra of SU(n) was incorporated. As a consequence, the obtained condition is given in terms of the structure constants of SU(n).
