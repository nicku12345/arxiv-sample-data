The focus of this paper is on the co-design of control and communication protocol for the control of multiple applications with unknown parameters using a distributed embedded system. The co-design consists of an adaptive switching controller and a hybrid communication architecture that switches between a time-triggered and event-triggered protocol. It is shown that the overall co-design leads to an overall switching adaptive system that has bounded solutions and ensures tracking in the presence of a class of disturbances. In order to achieve the goal of tracking persistent excitation techniques are used.
