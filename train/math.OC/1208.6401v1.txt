Let K:={x: g(x)\leq 1} be the compact sub-level set of some homogeneous polynomial g. Assume that the only knowledge about K is the degree of g as well as the moments of the Lebesgue measure on K up to order 2d. Then the vector of coefficients of g is solution of a simple linear system whose associated matrix is nonsingular. In other words, the moments up to order 2d of the Lebesgue measure on K encode all information on the homogeneous polynomial g that defines K (in fact, only moments of order d and 2d are needed).
