The paper deals with the determination of integral functional quality for control system of generalized linear dynamic object with exponential activation function by solving the inverse problem of dynamic programming. The obtained functionals contain two components that define the power consumption of the control object and stability of the trajectories of control object. In some cases these components can not be represented by elementary functions but their using can improve accuracy and reduce the energy consumption of control object.
