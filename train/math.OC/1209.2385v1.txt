The block coordinate descent (BCD) method is widely used for minimizing a continuous function f of several block variables. At each iteration of this method, a single block of variables is optimized, while the remaining variables are held fixed. To ensure the convergence of the BCD method, the subproblem to be optimized in each iteration needs to be solved exactly to its unique optimal solution. Unfortunately, these requirements are often too restrictive for many practical scenarios. In this paper, we study an alternative inexact BCD approach which updates the variable blocks by successively minimizing a sequence of approximations of f which are either locally tight upper bounds of f or strictly convex local approximations of f. We focus on characterizing the convergence properties for a fairly wide class of such methods, especially for the cases where the objective functions are either non-differentiable or nonconvex. Our results unify and extend the existing convergence results for many classical algorithms such as the BCD method, the difference of convex functions (DC) method, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, as well as the alternating proximal minimization algorithm.
