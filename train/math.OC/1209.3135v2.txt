This paper considers linear quadratic team decision problems where the players in the team affect each other's information structure through their decisions. Whereas the stochastic version of the problem is well known to be complex with nonlinear optimal solutions that are hard to find, the deterministic counterpart is shown to be tractable. We show that under some assumptions on the weight matrix and the signaling channels, linear decisions are optimal and can be found efficiently by solving a semi-definite program.
