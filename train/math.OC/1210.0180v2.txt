General nonconvex optimization problems are studied by using the canonical duality-triality theory. The triality theory is proved for sums of exponentials and quartic polynomials, which solved an open problem left in 2003. This theory can be used to find the global minimum and local extrema, which bridges a gap between global optimization and nonconvex mechanics. Detailed applications are illustrated by several examples.
