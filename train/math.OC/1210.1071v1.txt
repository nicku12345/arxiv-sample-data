Swimming, i.e., being able to advance in the absence of external forces by performing cyclic shape changes, is particularly demanding at low Reynolds numbers which is the regime of interest for micro-organisms and micro-robots. We focus on self-propelled stokesian robots composed of assemblies of balls and we prove that the presence of a wall has an effect on their motility. More precisely, we demonstrate that a controllable swimmer remains controllable in a half space whereas the reachable set of a non fully controllable one is affected by the presence of a wall.
