We propose a novel optimization-based approach to embedding heterogeneous high-dimensional data characterized by a graph. The goal is to create a two-dimensional visualization of the graph structure such that edge-crossings are minimized while preserving proximity relations between nodes. This paper provides a fundamentally new approach for addressing the crossing minimization criteria that exploits Farkas' Lemma to re-express the condition for no edge-crossings as a system of nonlinear inequality constraints. The approach has an intuitive geometric interpretation closely related to support vector machine classification. While the crossing minimization formulation can be utilized in conjunction with any optimization-based embedding objective, here we demonstrate the approach on multidimensional scaling by modifying the stress majorization algorithm to include penalties for edge crossings. The proposed method is used to (1) solve a visualization problem in tuberculosis molecular epidemiology and (2) generate embeddings for a suite of randomly generated graphs designed to challenge the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach. The proposed edge-crossing constraints and penalty algorithm can be readily adapted to other supervised and unsupervised optimization-based embedding or dimensionality reduction methods. The constraints can be generalized to remove overlaps between any graph components represented as convex polyhedrons including node-edge and node-node intersections.
