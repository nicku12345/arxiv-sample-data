We consider a control problem where the state must reach asymptotically a target while paying an integral payoff with a non-negative Lagrangian. The dynamics is just continuous, and no assumptions are made on the zero level set of the Lagrangian. Through an inequality involving a positive number \bar p_0 and a Minimum Restraint Function U=U(x) --a special type of Control Lyapunov Function-- we provide a condition implying that (i) the control system is asymptotically controllable, and (ii) the value function is bounded above by U/\bar p_0.
