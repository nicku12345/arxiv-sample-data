In this paper, we establish hardness and approximation results for various L_p-ball constrained homogeneous polynomial optimization problems, where p \in [2,\infty]. Specifically, we prove that for any given d \ge 3 and p \in [2,\infty], both the problem of optimizing a degree-d homogeneous polynomial over the L_p-ball and the problem of optimizing a degree-d multilinear form (regardless of its super-symmetry) over L_p-balls are NP-hard. On the other hand, we show that these problems can be approximated to within a factor of \Omega((\log n)^{(d-2)/p} \big/ n^{d/2-1}) in deterministic polynomial time, where n is the number of variables. We further show that with the help of randomization, the approximation guarantee can be improved to \Omega((\log n/n)^{d/2-1}), which is independent of p and is currently the best for the aforementioned problems. Our results unify and generalize those in the literature, which focus either on the quadratic case or the case where p \in {2,\infty}. We believe that the wide array of tools used in this paper will have further applications in the study of polynomial optimization problems.
