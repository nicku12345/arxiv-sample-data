We develop the calculus of variations on time scales for a functional that is the composition of a certain scalar function with the delta and nabla integrals of a vector valued field. Euler-Lagrange equations, transversality conditions, and necessary optimality conditions for isoperimetric problems, on an arbitrary time scale, are proved. Interesting corollaries and examples are presented.
