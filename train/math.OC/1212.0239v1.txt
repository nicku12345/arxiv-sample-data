We propose a joint optimal power allocation and sensing threshold selection for capacity maximization at the secondary user (SU) in spectrum sharing (SS) cognitive radio networks (CRNs). Hence, both optimal power allocation (OPA) and spectrum sensing (SpSe) is considered in the SS CRNs model. The obtained results show that such a joint optimal selection improves the performance of the SU by maximizing its capacity.
