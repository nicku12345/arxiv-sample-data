Steepest descent is central in variational mathematics. We present a new transparent existence proof for curves of near-maximal slope --- an influential notion of steepest descent in a nonsmooth setting. We moreover show that for semi-algebraic functions --- prototypical nonpathological functions in nonsmooth optimization --- such curves are precisely the solutions of subgradient dynamical systems.
