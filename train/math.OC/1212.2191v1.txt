We prove the dynamic programming principle for a class of diffusion processes controlled up to the time of exit from a cylindrical region [0,T)\times G. It is assumed that the functional to be maximized is in the Lagrange form with nonnegative integrand. Besides this we only adopt the standard assumptions, ensuring the existence of a unique strong solution of a stochastic differential equation for the state process.
