In this paper, we propose two algorithms for solving convex optimization problems with linear ascending constraints. When the objective function is separable, we propose a dual method which terminates in a finite number of iterations. In particular, the worst case complexity of our dual method improves over the best-known result for this problem in Padakandla and Sundaresan [SIAM J. Optimization, 20 (2009), pp. 1185-1204]. We then propose a gradient projection method to solve a more general class of problems in which the objective function is not necessarily separable. Numerical experiments show that both our algorithms work well in test problems.
