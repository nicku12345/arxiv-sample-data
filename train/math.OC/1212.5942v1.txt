We provide two weakly convergent algorithms for finding a zero of the sum of a maximally monotone operator, a cocoercive operator, and the normal cone to a closed vector subspace of a real Hilbert space. The methods exploit the intrinsic structure of the problem by activating explicitly the cocoercive operator in the first step, and taking advantage of a vector space decomposition in the second step. The second step of the first method is a Douglas-Rachford iteration involving the maximally monotone operator and the normal cone. In the second method it is a proximal step involving the partial inverse of the maximally monotone operator with respect to the vector subspace. Connections between the proposed methods and other methods in the literature are provided. Applications to monotone inclusions with finitely many maximally monotone operators and optimization problems are examined.
