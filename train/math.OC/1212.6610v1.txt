The formal analysis and design of control systems is one of recent trends in control theory. In this area, in order to reduce the complexity and scale of control systems, finite abstractions of control systems are introduced and explored. In non-disturbance case, the controller of control systems is often generated from the controller of finite abstractions. Recently, Pola and Tabuada provide approximate finite abstractions for linear control systems with disturbance inputs. However, these finite abstractions and original linear systems do not always share the identical specifications, which obstructs designing controller (of linear systems) based on their finite abstractions. This paper tries to bridge such gap between linear systems and their finite abstractions.
