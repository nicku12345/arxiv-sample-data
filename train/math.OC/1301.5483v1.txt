In this work, we propose the design and analysis of a novel continuous robust controller for a class of multi--input multi--output (MIMO) nonlinear uncertain systems. The systems under consideration contains unstructured uncertainties in their drift and input matrices. The proposed controller compensates the overall system uncertainties and achieves asymptotic tracking where only the sign of the leading minors of the input gain matrix is assumed to be known. A Lyapunov based argument backed up with an integral inequality is applied to prove stability of the proposed controller and asymptotic convergence of the error signals. Simulation results are presented in order to illustrate the viability of the proposed method.
