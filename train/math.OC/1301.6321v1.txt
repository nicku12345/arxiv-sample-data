This paper builds up two equivalence theorems for different kinds of optimal control problems of internally controlled Schr\"{o}dinger equations. The first one concerns with the equivalence of the minimal norm and the minimal time control problems. (The minimal time control problems are also called the first type of optimal time control problems.) The targets of the aforementioned two kinds of problems are the origin of the state space. The second one deals with the equivalence of three optimal control problems which are optimal target control problems, optimal norm control problems and the second type of optimal time control problems. These two theorems were estabilished for heat equations in [18] and [17] respectively.
