In this paper, we investigate the optimal control problems for stochastic differential equations (SDEs in short) of mean-field type with jump processes. The control variable is allowed to enter into both diffusion and jump terms. This stochastic maximum principle differs from the classical one in the sense that here the first-order adjoint equation turns out to be a linear mean-field backward SDE with jumps, while the second-order adjoint equation remains the same as in Tang and Li's stochastic maximum principle [32]. Finally, for the reader's convenience we give some analysis results used in this paper in the Appendix.
