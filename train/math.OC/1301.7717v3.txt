The facial reduction algorithm of Borwein and Wolkowicz and the extended dual of Ramana provide a strong dual for the conic linear program  (P) \sup {<c, x> | Ax \leq_K b}  in the absence of any constraint qualification. The facial reduction algorithm solves a sequence of auxiliary optimization problems to obtain such a dual. Ramana's dual is applicable when (P) is a semidefinite program (SDP) and is an explicit SDP itself. Ramana, Tuncel, and Wolkowicz showed that these approaches are closely related; in particular, they proved the correctness of Ramana's dual using certificates from a facial reduction algorithm.   Here we give a clear and self-contained exposition of facial reduction, of extended duals, and generalize Ramana's dual:   -- we state a simple facial reduction algorithm and prove its correctness; and   -- building on this algorithm we construct a family of extended duals when K is a {\em nice} cone. This class of cones includes the semidefinite cone and other important cones.
