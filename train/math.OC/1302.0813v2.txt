This paper presents an energy estimate in terms of the total variation of the control for bilinear infinite dimensional quantum systems with unbounded potentials. These estimates allow a rigorous construction of propagators associated with controls of bounded variation. Moreover, upper bounds of the error made when replacing the infinite dimensional system by its finite dimensional Galerkin approximations is presented.
