We address the following generalization P of the Lowner-John ellipsoid problem. Given a (non necessarily convex) compact set K\subset R^n and an even integer d, find an homogeneous polynomial g of degree d such that K\subset G:=\{x:g(x)\leq1\} and G has minimum volume among all such sets. We show that P is a convex optimization problem even if neither K nor G are convex! We next show that P has a unique optimal solution and a characterization with at most {n+d-1\choose d} contacts points in K\cap G is also provided. This is the analogue for d\textgreater{}2 of the Lowner-John's theorem in the quadratic case d=2, but importantly, we neither require the set K nor the sublevel set G to be convex. More generally, there is also an homogeneous polynomial g of even degree d and a point a\in R^n such that K\subset G\_a:=\{x:g(x-a)\leq1\} and G\_a has minimum volume among all such sets (but uniqueness is not guaranteed). Finally, we also outline a numerical scheme to approximate as closely as desired the optimal value and an optimal solution. It consists of solving a hierarchy of convex optimization problems with strictly convex objective function and Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints.
