We consider fractional order optimal control problems in which the dynamic control system involves integer and fractional order derivatives and the terminal time is free. Necessary conditions for a state/control/terminal-time triplet to be optimal are obtained. Situations with constraints present at the end time are also considered. Under appropriate assumptions, it is shown that the obtained necessary optimality conditions become sufficient. Numerical methods to solve the problems are presented, and some computational simulations are discussed in detail.
