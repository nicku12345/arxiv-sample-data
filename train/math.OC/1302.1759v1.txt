Time scale separation is a natural property of many control systems that can be ex- ploited, theoretically and numerically. We present a numerical scheme to solve optimal control problems with considerable time scale separation that is based on a model reduction approach that does not need the system to be explicitly stated in singularly perturbed form. We present examples that highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the method.
