We consider the chemostat model with the substrate concentration as the single measurement. We propose a control strategy that drives the system at a steady state maximizing the gas production without the knowledge of the specific growth rate. Our approach separates the extremum seeking problem from the feedback control problem such that each of the two subproblems can be solved with relatively simple algorithms. We are then free to choose any numerical optimization algorithm. We give a demonstration for two choices: one is based on slow-fast dynamics and numerical continuation, the other is a combination of golden-section and Newton iteration. The method copes with non-monotonic growth functions.
