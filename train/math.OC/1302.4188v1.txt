In this work, we develop a framework based on piecewize B\'ezier curves to plane shapes deformation and we apply it to shape optimization problems. We describe a general setting and some general result to reduce the study of a shape optimization problem to a finite dimensional problem of integration of a special type of vector field. We show a practical problem where this approach leads to efficient algorithms.
