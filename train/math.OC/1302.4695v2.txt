The famous Afriat's theorem from the theory of revealed preferences establishes necessary and suffient conditions for existence of utility function for a given set of choices and prices. The result on existence of a {\it homogeneous} utility function can be considered as a particular fact of the Monge-Kantorovich mass transportation theory. In this paper we explain this viewpoint and discuss some related questions.
