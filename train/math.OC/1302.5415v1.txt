The gauge Brezis-Browder Principle in Turinici [Bull. Acad. Pol. Sci. (Math.), 30 (1982), 161-166] is obtainable from the Principle of Dependent Choices (DC) and implies Ekeland's Variational Principle (EVP); hence, it is equivalent with both (DC) and (EVP). This is also true for the gauge variational principle deductible from it, including the one in Bae, Cho, and Kim [Bull. Korean Math. Soc. 48 (2011), 1023-1032].
