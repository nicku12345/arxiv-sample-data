Standard model predictive control strategies imply the online computation of control inputs at each sampling instance, which traditionally limits this type of control scheme to systems with slow dynamics. This paper focuses on distributed model predictive control for large-scale systems comprised of interacting linear subsystems, where the online computations required for the control input can be distributed amongst them. A model predictive controller based on a distributed interior point method is derived, for which every subsystem in the network can compute stabilizing control inputs using distributed computations. We introduce local terminal sets and cost functions, which together satisfy distributed invariance conditions for the whole system, that guarantees stability of the closed-loop interconnected system. We show that the synthesis of both terminal sets and terminal cost functions can be done in a distributed framework.
