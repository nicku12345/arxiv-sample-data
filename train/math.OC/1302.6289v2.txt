We consider discrete-time plants that interact with their controllers via fixed discrete alphabets. For this class of systems, and in the absence of exogenous inputs, we propose a general, conceptual procedure for constructing a sequence of finite state approximate models starting from finite length sequences of input and output signal pairs. We explicitly derive conditions under which the proposed construct, used in conjunction with a particular generalized structure, satisfies desirable properties of \rho/\mu approximations thereby leading to nominal deterministic finite state machine models that can be used in certified-by- design controller synthesis. We also show that the cardinality of the minimal disturbance alphabet that can be used in this setting equals that of the sensor output alphabet. Finally, we show that the proposed construct satisfies a relevant semi-completeness property.
