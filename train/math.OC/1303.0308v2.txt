We study the stability of switched systems where the dynamic modes are described by systems of higher-order linear differential equations not necessarily sharing the same state space. Concatenability of trajectories at the switching instants is specified by gluing conditions, i.e. algebraic conditions on the trajectories and their derivatives at the switching instant. We provide sufficient conditions for stability based on LMIs for systems with general gluing conditions. We also analyse the role of positive-realness in providing sufficient polynomial-algebraic conditions for stability of two-modes switched systems with special gluing conditions.
