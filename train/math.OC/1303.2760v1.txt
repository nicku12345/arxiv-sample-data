In this paper we study state-space realizations of Linear and Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. Motivated by biochemical reaction networks, Gon\c{c}alves and Warnick have recently introduced the notion of a {\em Dynamical Structure Functions} (DSF), a particular factorization of the system's transfer function matrix that elucidates the interconnection structure in dependencies between manifest variables. We build onto this work by showing an intrinsic connection between a DSF and certain sparse left coprime factorizations. By establishing this link, we provide an interesting systems theoretic interpretation of sparsity patterns of coprime factors. In particular we show how the sparsity of these coprime factors allows for a given LTI system to be implemented as a network of LTI sub-systems. We examine possible applications in distributed control such as the design of a LTI controller that can be implemented over a network with a pre-specified topology.
