This paper studies the controllability problem of a parabolic system of chemotaxis. The local exact controllability to trajectories of the system imposed one control force only is obtained by applying Kakutani's fixed point theorem combined with the null controllability of the associated linearized parabolic system. The control function is shown to be in L^\infty(Q), which is estimated by using the methods of maximal regularity and L^p-L^q estimates of parabolic equations.
