In this paper, we present a Lyapunov-based homogeneous controller for the stabilization of a perturbed chain of integrators of arbitrary order r\geq 1. The proposed controller is based on homogeneous controller for stabilization of pure integrator chains. The advantages to control the homogeneity degree of the controller are also discussed. A bounded-controller with minimum amplitude of discontinuous control and a controller with fixed-time convergence are synthesized, using control of homogeneity degree, and their performances are shown in simulations. It is demonstrated that the homogeneous arbitrary HOSM controller \cite{Levant2001} is a particular case of our controller.
