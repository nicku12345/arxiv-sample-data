This paper presents optimal scaling of the alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for a class of distributed quadratic programming problems. The scaling corresponds to the ADMM step-size and relaxation parameter, as well as the edge-weights of the underlying communication graph. We optimize these parameters to yield the smallest convergence factor of the algorithm. Explicit expressions are derived for the step-size and relaxation parameter, as well as for the corresponding convergence factor. Numerical simulations justify our results and highlight the benefits of optimally scaling the ADMM algorithm.
