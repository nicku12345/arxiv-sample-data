We introduce the notions of w-lower semicontinuous and almost w-lower semicontinuous correspondence with respect to a given set and prove a new fixed-point theorem. We also introduce the notion of correspondence with e-LSCS-property. As applications we obtain some new equilibrium theorems for abstract economies and for generalized multiobjective games.
