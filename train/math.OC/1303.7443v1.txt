According to a result due to B.T. Polyak, a mapping between Hilbert spaces, which is C^{1,1} around a regular point, carries a ball centered at that point to a convex set, provided that the radius of the ball is small enough. The present paper considers the extension of such result to mappings defined on a certain subclass of uniformly convex Banach spaces. This enables one to extend to such setting a variational principle for constrained optimization problems, already observed in finite dimension, that establishes a convex behaviour for proper localizations of them. Further variational consequences are explored.
