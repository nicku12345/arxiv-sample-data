We study the existence and approximate controllability of a class of fractional nonlocal delay semilinear differential systems in a Hilbert space. The results are obtained by using semigroup theory, fractional calculus, and Schauder's fixed point theorem. Multi-delay controls and a fractional nonlocal condition are introduced. Furthermore, we present an appropriate set of sufficient conditions for the considered fractional nonlocal multi-delay control system to be approximately controllable. An example to illustrate the abstract results is given.
