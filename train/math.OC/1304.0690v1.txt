This paper is concerned with the variational inequality problem (VIP) over the fixed point set of a quasi-nonexpansive operator. We propose, in particular, an algorithm which entails, at each step, projecting onto a suitably chosen half-space, and prove that the sequences it generates converge to the unique solution of the VIP. We also present an application of our result to a hierarchical optimization problem.
