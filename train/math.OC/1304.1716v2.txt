Let K\subset R^n be a compact basic semi-algebraic set. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition (with no a priori bounding parameter) for a real sequence y=(y_\alpha), \alpha\in N^n, to have a finite representing Borel measure absolutely continuous w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure on K, and with a density in \cap_{p=1}^\infty L_p(K). With an additional condition involving a bounding parameter, the condition is necessary and sufficient for existence of a density in L_\infty(K). Moreover, nonexistence of such a density can be detected by solving finitely many of a hierarchy of semidefinite programs. In particular, if the semidefinite program at step d of the hierarchy has no solution then the sequence cannot have a representing measure on K with a density in L_p(K) for any p\geq 2d.
