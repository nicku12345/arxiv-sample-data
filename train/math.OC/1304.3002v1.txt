In this paper we study a linear inverse problem with a biological interpretation, which is modeled by a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. When the kernel in the Fredholm equation is represented by step func- tions, we obtain identifiability, stability and reconstruction results. Further- more, we provide a numerical reconstruction algorithm for the kernel, whose main feature is that a non-regular mesh has to be used to ensure the invert- ibility of the matrix representing the numerical discretization of the system. Finally, a second identifiability result for a polynomial approximation of degree less than nine of the kernel is also established.
