We present some new problems in spectral optimization. The first one consists in determining the best domain for the Dirichlet energy (or for the first eigenvalue) of the {\it metric Laplacian}, and we consider in particular Riemannian or Finsler manifolds, Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces, Gaussian spaces. The second one deals with the optimal shape of a graph when the minimization cost is of spectral type. The third one is the optimization problem for a Schr\"odinger potential in suitable classes.
