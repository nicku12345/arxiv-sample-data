We derive in a direct and rather straightforward way the null controllability of a 2-D heat equation with boundary control. We use the so-called flatness approach, which consists in parameterizing the solution and the control by the derivatives of a "flat output". This provides an explicit control law achieving the exact steering to zero. Numerical experiments demonstrate the relevance of the approach.
