In this paper, we are concerned with the controllability of a chemotaxis system of parabolic-elliptic type. By linearizing the nonlinear system into two separated linear equations to bypass the obstacle caused by the nonlinear drift term, we establish the local null controllability of the original nonlinear system. The approach is different from the usual way of treating the coupled parabolic systems.
