In this paper, we introduce an abstract fuzzy economy model with a measure space of agents which generalizes Patriche's model (2009), we obtain a theorem of fuzzy equilibrium existence and we prove the existence of the solutions for two types of random quasi-variational inequalities with random fuzzy mappings. As a consequence, we obtain random fixed point theorems.
