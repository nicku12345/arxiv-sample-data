This paper presents a method which is identical to simplex method phase 1, but do not need any artificial variable (or artificial constraints). So, the new method works in original variable space but visits the same sequence of pivots as simplex method does. Recently, (Inayatullah, Khan, Imtiaz & Khan, New artificial-free Phase 1 Simplex Method, 2009) claimed a similar method, here in this paper we have presented a counter example which shows in some special conditions of degeneracy their method may deviate from the simplex path.   Because of its simplicity, the method presented in this paper is highly classroom oriented. So, indeed there is no need to work with artificial variables (or artificial constraints) in simplex method any more.
