The aim of this paper is to provide a short introduction to modern issues in the control of infinite dimensional closed quantum systems, driven by the bilinear Schr\"odinger equation. The first part is a quick presentation of some of the numerous recent developments in the fields. This short summary is intended to demonstrate the variety of tools and approaches used by various teams in the last decade. In a second part, we present four examples of bilinear closed quantum systems. These examples were extensively studied and may be used as a convenient and efficient test bench for new conjectures. Finally, we list some open questions, both of theoretical and practical interest.
