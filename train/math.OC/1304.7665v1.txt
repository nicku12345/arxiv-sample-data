This text presents the proofs of the technical facts underlying theoretical justification of the convergence and performance of the novel algorithm for reactive navigation of differential drive wheeled robots in dynamic uncertain environments. The algorithm restricts neither the natures nor the motions of the obstacles, they need not be rigid but conversely may deform. It does not consume data about the velocities, shapes, sizes, or orientations of the obstacles, and does not need a map of the environment or recognition of individual obstacles. The only information about the scene is the current distance to the nearest obstacle.
