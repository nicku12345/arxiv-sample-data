In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian abstract fuzzy economy model and we prove the Bayesian fuzzy equilibrium existence. As applications, we prove the existence of the solutions for two types of random quasi-variational inequalities with random fuzzy mappings and we also obtain random fixed point theorems.
