We present a mathematical model for solvated crystallization of alpha -lactose monohydrate in semi-batch mode. The process dynamics are governed by conservation laws including population, molar and energy balance equations. We present and discuss the model and then control the process with the goal to privilege the production of small particles in specific the range. We compare several specific and unspecific cost functions leading to optimal strategies with significantly different effects on product quality. Control inputs are temperature, feed rate, and the choice of an appropriate crystal seed.
