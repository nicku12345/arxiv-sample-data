We consider the classic problem of pole placement by state feedback. We adapt the Moore eigenstructure assignment algorithm to obtain a novel parametric form for the pole-placing gain matrix, and introduce an unconstrained nonlinear optimization algorithm to obtain a gain matrix that will deliver robust pole placement. Numerical experiments indicate the algorithm's performance compares favorably against several other notable robust pole placement methods from the literature.
