This paper studies the periodic feedback stabilization for a class of linear T-periodic evolution equations.Several equivalent conditions on the linear periodic feedback stabilization are obtained. These conditions are related with the following subjects: the attainable subspace of the controlled evolution equation under consideration; the unstable subspace (of the evolution equation with the null control) provided by the Kato projection; the Poincar\acute{e} map associated with the evolution equation with the null control; and two unique continuation properties for the dual equations on different time horizons [0,T] and [0,n_0T] (where n_0 is the sum of algebraic multiplicities of distinct unstable eigenvalues of the Poincar\acute{e} map). It is also proved that a T-periodic controlled evolution equation is linear T-periodic feedback sabilizable if and only if it is linear T-periodic feedback sabilizable with respect to a finite dimensional subspace. Some applications to heat equations with time-periodic potentials are presented.
