Given a quadratic function h that satisfies a Slater condition, Yakubovich's S-Procedure (or S-Lemma) gives a characterization of all other quadratic functions that are copositive with h in a form that is amenable to numerical computations. In this paper we present a deep-rooted connection between the S-Procedure and the dual cone calculus formula (K_1\cap K_2)^*= K_1^*+K_2^*, which holds for closed convex cones in \R^2. To establish the link with the S-Procedure, we generalize the dual cone calculus formula to a situation where K_1 is nonclosed, nonconvex and nonconic but exhibits sufficient mathematical resemblance to a closed convex cone. As a result, we obtain a new proof of the S-Lemma and an extension to Hilbert space kernels.
