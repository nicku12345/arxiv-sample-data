In this paper two properties of recognized interest in variational analysis, known as Lipschitz lower semicontinuity and calmness, are studied with reference to a general class of variational systems, i.e. to solution mappings to parameterized generalized equations. In consideration of the metric nature of such properties, some related sufficient conditions are established, which are expressed via nondegeneracy conditions on derivative-like objects appropriate for a metric space analysis. For certain classes of generalized equations in Asplund spaces, it is shown how such conditions can be formulated by using the Fr\'echet coderivative of the field and the derivative of the base. Applications to the stability analysis of parametric constrained optimization problems are proposed.
