The general theory of Lyapunov's stability of first-order differential inclusions in Hilbert spaces has been studied by the authors in a previous work. This new contribution focuses on the natural case when the maximally monotone operator governing the given inclusion has a domain with nonempty interior. This setting permits to have nonincreasing Lyapunov functions on the whole trajectory of the solution to the given differential inclusion. It also allows some more explicit criteria for Lyapunov's pairs. Some consequences to the viability of closed sets are given, as well as some useful cases relying on the continuity or/and convexity of the involved functions. Our analysis makes use of standard tools from convex and variational analysis.
