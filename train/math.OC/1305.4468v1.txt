In this paper, we derive team and person-by-person optimality conditions for distributed differential decision systems with different or decentralized information structures. The necessary conditions of optimality are given in terms of Hamiltonian system of equations consisting of a coupled backward and forward differential equations and a Hamiltonian projected onto the subspace generated by the decentralized information structures. Under certain global convexity conditions it is shown that the optimality conitions are also sufficient.
