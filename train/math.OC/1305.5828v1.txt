We present a new primal-dual splitting algorithm for structured monotone inclusions in Hilbert spaces and analyze its asymptotic behavior. A novelty of our framework, which is motivated by image recovery applications, is to consider inclusions that combine a variety of monotonicity-preserving operations such as sums, linear compositions, parallel sums, and a new notion of parallel composition. The special case of minimization problems is studied in detail, and applications to signal recovery are discussed. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the implementation of the algorithm.
