We construct structured H-Infinity optimal model matching problems with rational coefficients, in which the optimal solution is not rational, in the sense that the cost does not achieve its maximal lower bound on the set of rational matching models, but the same maximal lower bound can be reached by using a continuous non-rational matching model.
