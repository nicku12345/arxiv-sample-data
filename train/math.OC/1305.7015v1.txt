Existence and uniqueness of a weak solution for first order mean field game systems with local coupling are obtained by variational methods. This solution can be used to devise \epsilon-Nash equilibria for deterministic differential games with a finite (but large) number of players. For smooth data, the first component of the weak solution of the MFG system is proved to satisfy (in a viscosity sense) a time-space degenerate elliptic differential equation.
