We pose the deterministic, nonparametric, approximation problem for scalar nonnegative input/output systems via finite impulse response convolutions, based on repeated observations of input/output signal pairs. The problem is converted into a nonnegative matrix factorization with special structure for which we use Csisz\'ar's I-divergence as the criterion of optimality. Conditions are given, on the input/output data, that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the minimum. We propose a standard algorithm of the alternating minimization type for I-divergence minimization, and study its asymptotic behavior. We also provide a statistical version of the minimization problem and give its large sample properties.
