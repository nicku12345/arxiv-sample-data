In this paper semirings with an idempotent addition are considered. These algebraic structures are endowed with a partial order. This allows to consider residuated maps to solve systems of inequalities A \otimes X \preceq B. The purpose of this paper is to consider a dual product, denoted \odot, and the dual residuation of matrices, in order to solve the following inequality  A \otimes X \preceq X \preceq B \odot X. Sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of a non-linear projector in the solution set are proposed. The results are extended to semirings of intervals.
