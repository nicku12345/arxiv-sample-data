This paper deals with solution of inequality \textbf{A}\otimes \textbf{x}\preceq \textbf{b}, where \textbf{A}, \textbf{x} and \textbf{b} are interval matrices with entries defined over idempotent semiring. It deals also with the computation of a pair of intervals, (\textbf{x},\textbf{y}) which satisfies the equation \textbf{A} \otimes \textbf{x}=\textbf{B}\otimes \textbf{y}. It will be shown that this equation may be solved by considering the interval version of the iterative scheme proposed by Cuninighame-Green and Butkovic in 2003.
