This paper deals with the state estimation for max-plus linear systems. This estimation is carried out following the ideas of the observer method for classical linear systems. The system matrices are assumed to be known, and the observation of the input and of the output is used to compute the estimated state. The observer design is based on the residuation theory which is suitable to deal with linear mapping inversion in idempotent semiring.
