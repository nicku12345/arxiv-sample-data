We study an initial-boundary-value problem of a nonlinear Korteweg-de Vries equation posed on a finite interval (0,2pi). The whole system has Dirichlet boundary condition at the left end-point, and both of Dirichlet and Neumann homogeneous boundary conditions at the right end-point. It is known that the origin is not asymptotically stable for the linearized system around the origin. We prove that the origin is (locally) asymptotically stable for the nonlinear system.
