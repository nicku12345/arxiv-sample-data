In this paper we study time semi-discrete approximations of a class of exponentially stable infinite dimensional systems with unbounded feedbacks. It has recently been proved that for time semi-discrete systems, due to high frequency spurious components, the exponential decay property may be lost as the time step tends to zero. We prove that adding a suitable numerical viscosity term in the numerical scheme, one obtains approximations that are uniformly exponentially stable with respect to the discretization parameter
