In the present paper, the Polyak's principle, concerning convexity of the images of small balls through C1,1 mappings, is employed in the study of vector optimization problems. This leads to extend to such a context achievements of local programming, an approach to nonlinear optimization, due to B.T. Polyak, which consists in exploiting the benefits of the convex local behaviour of certain nonconvex problems. In doing so, solution existence and optimality conditions are established for localizations of vector optimization problems, whose data satisfy proper assumptions. Such results are subsequently applied in the analysis of welfare economics, in the case of an exchange economy model with infinite-dimensional commodity space. In such a setting, the localization of an economy yields existence of Pareto optimal allocations, which, under certain additional assumptions, lead to competitive equilibria.
