In this paper, we introduce an abstract fuzzy economy (generalized fuzzy game) model with a countable space of actions and we study the existence of the fuzzy equilibrium. As applications, two types of results are obtained. The first ones concern the existence of the solutions for systems of generalized quasi-variational inequalities with random fuzzy mappings which we define. The last ones are new random fixed point theorems for correspondences with values in complete countable metric spaces.
