In the paper a model problem for the location of a given number N of points in a given region \Omega and with a given resources density \rho(x) is considered. The main difference between the usual location problems and the present one is that in addition to the location cost an extra {\it routing cost} is considered, that takes into account the fact that the resources have to travel between the locations on a point-to-point basis. The limit problem as N\to\infty is characterized and some applications to airfreight systems are shown.
