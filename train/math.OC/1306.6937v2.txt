In this paper, inexact Gauss-Newton like methods for solving injective-overdetermined systems of equations are studied. We use a majorant condition, defined by a function whose derivative is not necessarily convex, to extend and improve several existing results on the local convergence of the Gauss-Newton methods.In particular, this analysis guarantees the convergence of the methods for two important new cases.
