We show that a point is solution of the Minty variational inequality of subdifferential type for a given function if and only if the function is increasing along rays starting from that point. This provides a characterization of the monotone polar of subdifferentials of lower semicontinuous functions, which happens to be a common subset of their graphs depending only on the function.
