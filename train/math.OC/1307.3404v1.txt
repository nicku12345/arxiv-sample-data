A mesh improvement methodology is pre- sented which aims to improve the quality of the worst elements in 3D meshes with non-planar surfaces which cannot be improved using traditional methods. A nu- merical optimisation algorithm, which specifically tar- gets the worst elements in the mesh, but is a smooth function of nodal positions is introduced. A method of moving nodes on curved surfaces whilst maintaining the domain geometry and preserving mesh volume is proposed. This is shown to be very effective at improv- ing meshes for which traditional mesh improvers do not perform well.
