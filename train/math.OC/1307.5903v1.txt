We present a suboptimal control design algorithm for a family of continuous-time parameter-dependent linear systems that are composed of interconnected subsystems. We are interested in designing the controller for each subsystem such that it only utilizes partial state measurements (characterized by a directed graph called the control graph) and limited model parameter information (characterized by the design graph). The algorithm is based on successive local minimizations and maximizations (using the subgradients) of the H_\infty--norm of the closed-loop transfer function with respect to the controller gains and the system parameters. We use a vehicle platooning example to illustrate the applicability of the results.
