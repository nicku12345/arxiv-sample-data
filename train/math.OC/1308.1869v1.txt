In this paper, a space-time discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for distributed optimal control problems governed by unsteady diffusion-convection-reaction equations with control constraints is studied. Time discretization is performed by discontinuous Galerkin method with piecewise constant and linear polynomials, while symmetric interior penalty Galerkin with upwinding is used for space discretization. The numerical results presented confirm the theoretically observed convergence rates.
