We consider Kalman filtering problems when the observations are intermittently erased or lost. It was known that the estimates are mean-square unstable when the erasure probability is larger than a certain critical value, and stable otherwise. But the characterization of the critical erasure probability has been open for years. We introduce a new concept of \textit{eigenvalue cycles} which captures periodicity of systems, and characterize the critical erasure probability based on this. It is also proved that eigenvalue cycles can be easily broken if the original physical system is considered to be continuous-time --- randomly-dithered nonuniform sampling of the observations makes the critical erasure probability almost surely \frac{1}{|\lambda_{max}|^2}.
