This paper presents a new generalized Armijo's line-search method, and combines it with a phi-regulation defined to obtain a new algorithm solving the very general non-linear non-smooth convex programming. For the algorithm designed, the global convergence is proved and the algorithm has super-linear convergent rate under very weak conditions. This paper generalized the results of reference "Fukushima M and Qi LQ (1996) SIAM Journal of Optimization 6: 1106-20".
