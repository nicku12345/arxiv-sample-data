In this paper we construct an infinite horizon minimax state observer for a linear stationary differential-algebraic equation (DAE) with uncertain but bounded input and noisy output. We do not assume regularity or existence of a (unique) solution for any initial state of the DAE. Our approach is based on a generalization of Kalman's duality principle. The latter allows us to transform minimax state estimation problem into a dual control problem for the adjoint DAE: the state estimate in the original problem becomes the control input for the dual problem and the cost function of the latter is, in fact, the worst-case estimation error. Using geometric control theory, we construct an optimal control in the feed-back form and represent it as an output of a stable LTI system. The latter gives the minimax state estimator. In addition, we obtain a solution of infinite-horizon linear quadratic optimal control problem for DAEs.
