There are several concepts and definitions that characterize and give optimality conditions for solutions of a vector optimization problem. One of the most important is the first-order necessary optimality condition that generalizes the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition. This condition ensures the existence of an arbitrary neighborhood that contains an local optimal solution. The present work we introduce an alternative concept to identify the local optimal solution neighborhood in vector optimization problems. The main aspect of this contribution is the development of necessary and sufficient Pareto optimality conditions for the solutions of a particular vector optimization problem, where each objective function consists of a ratio quadratic functions and the feasible set is defined by linear inequalities. We show how to calculate the largest radius of the spherical region centered on a local Pareto solution in which this solution is optimal. In this process we may conclude that the solution is also globally optimal. These conditions might be useful to determine termination criteria in the development of algorithms, including more general problems in which quadratic approximations are used locally.
