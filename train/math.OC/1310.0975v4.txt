In this paper, incremental adaptive mechanisms are presented and characterized, to provide design hints for the development of continuous-time adaptive systems. The comparison with the conventional integral adaptive systems indicates that the suggested design methodology will be a supplement to the existing ones. With the aid of a Barbalat-like lemma, convergence results of the incremental adaptive systems are established. It is shown that the proposed adaptive mechanisms are able to work well in handling parametric uncertainties in systems undertaken.
