Spingarn's method of partial inverses has found many applications in nonlinear analysis and in optimization. We show that it can be employed to solve composite monotone inclusions in duality, thus opening a new range of applications for the partial inverse formalism. The versatility of the resulting primal-dual splitting algorithm is illustrated through applications to structured monotone inclusions and optimization.
