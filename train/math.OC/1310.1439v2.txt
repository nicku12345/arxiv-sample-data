This paper presents a method to square up a generic MIMO system that already possesses transmission zeros. The proposed method is developed based on and therefore can be incorporated into the existing method that has been proven effective on a system without transmission zeros. It has been shown that for the generic system considering here, the squaring-up problem can be transformed into a state-feedback problem with uncontrollable modes.
