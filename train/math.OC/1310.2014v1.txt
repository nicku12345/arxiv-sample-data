This paper presents a canonical duality theory for solving a general nonconvex constrained optimization problem within a unified framework to cover Lagrange multiplier method and KKT theory. It is proved that if both target function and constraints possess certain patterns necessary for modeling real systems, a perfect dual problem (without duality gap)can be obtained in a unified form with global optimality conditions provided. While the popular augmented Lagrangian method may produce more difficult nonconvex problems due to the nonlinearity of constraints.
