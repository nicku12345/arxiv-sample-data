In this paper, we first study nonsmooth steepest descent method for nonsmooth functions defined on Hilbert space and establish the corresponding algorithm by proximal subgradients. Then, we use this algorithm to find stationary points for those functions satisfying prox-regularity and Lipschitzian continuity. As one application, the established algorithm is used to search the minimizer of lower semicontinuous and convex functions on finite-dimensional space. The convergent theorem, as one extension and improvement of the existing converging result for twice continuously differentiable convex functions, is also presented therein.
