Recently, significant connections between compressed sensing problems and optimization of a particular class of functions relating to solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equation was discovered. In this paper we introduce a fast approximate algorithm to optimize this particular class of functions and subsequently find the solution to the compressed sensing problem. Although we emphasize that the methodology of our algorithm finds an approximate solution, numerical experiments show that our algorithm perfectly recovers the solution when the solution is relatively sparse with respect to the number of measurements. In these scenarios, the recovery is extremely fast compare to other methods available. Numerical experiments also demonstrate that the algorithm exhibits a sharp phase transition in success rate of recovery of the solution to compressed sensing problems as sparsity of solution varies. The algorithm proposed here is parameter free (except a tolerance parameter due to numerical machine precision), and very easy to implement.
