We establish a Poincar\`E-Bendixson type result for a weighted averaged infinite horizon problem in the plane, with and without averaged constraints. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the existence of a periodic optimal solution, and for constrained problem, we establish the existence of an optimal solution that alternates cyclicly between a finite number of periodic curves, depending on the number of constraints. Applications of these results are presented to the shape optimization problems of the Cheeger set and the generalized Cheeger set, and also to a singular limit of the one-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation
