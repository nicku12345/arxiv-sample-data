\mathbb B-convexity was defined in [7] as a suitable Kuratowski-Painlev\'e upper limit of linear convexities over a finite dimensional Euclidean vector space. Excepted in the special case where convex sets are subsets of \mathbb R^n_ +, \mathbb B-convexity was not defined with respect to a given explicit algebraic structure. This is done in that paper, which proposes an extension of \mathbb B-convexity to the whole Euclidean vector space. An unital idempotent and non-associative magma is defined over the real set and an extended n-ary operation is introduced. Along this line, the existence of the Kuratowski-Painlev\'e limit of the convex hull of two points over \mathbb R^n is shown and an explicit extension of \mathbb B-convexity is proposed.
