This work considers the problem of estimating the unscaled relative positions of a multi-robot team in a common reference frame from bearing-only measurements. Each robot has access to a relative bearing measurement taken from the local body frame of the robot, and the robots have no knowledge of a common or inertial reference frame. A corresponding extension of rigidity theory is made for frameworks embedded in the \emph{special Euclidean group} SE(2) = \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathcal{S}^1. We introduce definitions describing rigidity for SE(2) frameworks and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when such a framework is \emph{infinitesimally rigid} in SE(2). Analogous to the rigidity matrix for point formations, we introduce the \emph{directed bearing rigidity matrix} and show that an SE(2) framework is infinitesimally rigid if and only if the rank of this matrix is equal to 2|\mathcal{V}|-4, where |\mathcal{V}| is the number of agents in the ensemble. The directed bearing rigidity matrix and its properties are then used in the implementation and convergence proof of a distributed estimator to determine the {unscaled}{} relative positions in a common frame. Some simulation results are also given to support the analysis.
