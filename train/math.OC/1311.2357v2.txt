This paper presents an averaging method for nonlinear systems defined on Riemannian manifolds. We extend closeness of solutions results for ordinary differential equations on R^{n} to dynamical systems defined on Riemannian manifolds by employing differential geometry. A generalization of closeness of solutions for periodic dynamical systems on compact time intervals is derived for dynamical systems evolving on compact Riemannian manifolds. Under local asymptotic (exponential) stability of the average vector field, we further relax the compactness of the ambient Riemannian manifold and obtain the closeness of solutions on the infinite time interval by employing the notion of uniform normal neighborhoods of an equilibrium point of a vector field. These results are also presented for time-varying dynamical systems where their averaged systems are almost globally asymptotically or exponentially stable on compact manifolds. The main results of the paper are illustrated by several examples.
