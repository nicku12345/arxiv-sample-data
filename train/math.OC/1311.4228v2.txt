This paper studies the hierarchy of local minimums of a polynomial in the space. For this purpose, we first compute H-minimums, for which the first and second order optimality conditions are satisfied. To compute each H-minimum, we construct a sequence of semidefinite relaxations, based on optimality conditions. We prove that each constructed sequence has finite convergence, under some generic conditions. A procedure for computing all local minimums is given. When there are equality constraints, we have similar results for computing the hierarchy of critical values and the hierarchy of local minimums. Several extensions are discussed.
