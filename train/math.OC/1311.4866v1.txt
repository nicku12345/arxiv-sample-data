We present a set of results concerning the existence of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals for classes of nonlinear switched systems with time-delay. In particular, we first present a result for positive systems that relaxes conditions recently described in \cite{SunWang} for the existence of L-K functionals. We also provide related conditions for positive coupled differential-difference positive systems and for systems of neutral type that are not necessarily positive. Finally, corresponding results for discrete-time systems are described.
