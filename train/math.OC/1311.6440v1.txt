This paper considers weighted sum rate maximization constrained with a per base station (BS) antenna power problem for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. For this problem, we propose new downlink-uplink duality based solution. We solve the problem as follows. First, by introducing additional optimization variables, we reformulate our problem into an equivalent problem that incorporates a weighted sum mean-square-error (MSE) term. Second, we establish novel weighted sum MSE duality. The duality is established by modifying the input covariance matrix of the dual uplink problem, and formulating the noise covariance matrix of the uplink channel as a fixed point function. Third, we optimize the introduced variables and powers in the downlink channel by a Geometric Program (GP) method. Fourth, using the duality result and the solution of GP, we apply alternating optimization technique to solve the original downlink problem. In our simulation results, we have observed that the proposed duality based solution utilizes less power than that of existing algorithms.
