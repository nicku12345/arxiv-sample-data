This paper considers the joint precoder design problem for multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with coordinated base stations (BSs). We consider maximization of the total sum rate with per BS antenna power constraint problem. For this problem, we propose a novel linear iterative algorithm. The problem is solved as follows. First, by introducing additional optimization variables and applying matrix fractional minimization, we reformulate the original problem as a new problem. Second, for the given precoder vectors of all users, we optimize the introduced variables of the latter problem using Geometric Programming (GP) method. Third, keeping the introduced variables constant, the precoder vectors of all users are optimized by using phase rotation technique. The second and third steps are repeated until convergence. We have shown that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge. Moreover, for the total sum power constraint case, simulation results show that the proposed iterative algorithm achieves almost the same average performance as that of the algorithm which utilizes mean-square-error (MSE) uplink-downlink duality approach. We also show that our iterative algorithm can be used to solve sum rate maximization and weighted sum MSE minimization problems for an arbitrary power constraint.
