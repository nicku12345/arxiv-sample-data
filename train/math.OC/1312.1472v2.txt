We study optimal stochastic control problems of general coupled systems of forward-backward stochastic differential equations with jumps. By means of the It\^o-Ventzell formula the system is transformed to a controlled backward stochastic partial differential equation (BSPDE) with jumps. Using a comparison principle for such BSPDEs we obtain a general stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman (HJB) equation for such control problems. In the classical Markovian case with optimal control of jump diffusions, the equation reduces to the classical HJB equation.   The results are applied to study risk minimization in financial markets.
