The counting function on binary values is extended to the signed case in order to count the number of transitions between contiguous locations. A generalized subdifferential for the sign change counting function is given where classical subdifferentials remain intractable. An attempt to prove global optimality at some point, for the 4-dimensional first non trivial example, is made by using a sufficient condition specially tailored among all the cases for this subdifferential.
