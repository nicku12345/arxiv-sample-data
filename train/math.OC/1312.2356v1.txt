Multi-material structural topology and shape optimization problems are formulated within a phase field approach. First-order conditions are stated and the relation of the necessary conditions to classical shape derivatives are discussed. An efficient numerical method based on an H^1-gradient projection method is introduced and finally several numerical results demonstrate the applicability of the approach.
