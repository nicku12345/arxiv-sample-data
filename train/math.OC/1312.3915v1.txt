We consider shape optimization problems of the form \min\big\{J(\Omega)\ :\ \Omega\subset X,\ m(\Omega)\le c\big\}, where X is a metric measure space and J is a suitable shape functional. We adapt the notions of \gamma-convergence and weak \gamma-convergence to this new general abstract setting to prove the existence of an optimal domain. Several examples are pointed out and discussed.
