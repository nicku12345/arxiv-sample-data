If (M,g) and (\hM,\hg) are two smooth connected complete oriented Riemannian manifolds of dimensions n and \hn respectively, we model the rolling of (M,g) onto (\hM,\hg) as a driftless control affine systems describing two possible constraints of motion: the first rolling motion \Sigma_{NS} captures the no-spinning condition only and the second rolling motion \Sigma_{R} corresponds to rolling without spinning nor slipping. Two distributions of dimensions (n + \hn) and n, respectively, are then associated to the rolling motions \Sigma_{NS} and \Sigma_{R} respectively. This generalizes the rolling problems considered in \cite{ChitourKokkonen1} where both manifolds had the same dimension. The controllability issue is then addressed for both \Sigma_{NS} and \Sigma_{R} and completely solved for \Sigma_{NS}. As regards to \Sigma_{R}, basic properties for the reachable sets are provided as well as the complete study of the case (n,\hn)=(3,2) and some sufficient conditions for non-controllability.
