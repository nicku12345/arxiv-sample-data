We extend the theory of Barles Jakobsen to develop numerical schemes for Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equations. We show that the monotonicity of the schemes can be relaxed still leading to the convergence to the viscosity solution of the equation. We give some examples of such numerical schemes and show that the bounds obtained by the framework developed are not tight. At last we test some numerical schemes.
