We consider the problem of optimally locating a given number k of points in {\mathbb R}^n for an integral cost function which takes into account two measures \varphi^+ and \varphi^-. The points represent for example new industrial facilities that have to be located, the measure \varphi^+ representing in this case already existing industries that want to be close to the new ones, and \varphi^- representing private citizens who want to stay far away. The asymptotic analysis as k\to\infty is performed, providing the asymptotic density of optimal locations.
