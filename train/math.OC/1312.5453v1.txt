We study the Kantorovich-Rubinstein transhipment problem when the difference between the source and the target is not anymore a balanced measure but belongs to a suitable subspace X(\Omega) of first order distribution. A particular subclass X_0^\sharp(\Omega) of such distributions will be considered which includes the infinite sums of dipoles \sum_k(\delta_{p_k}-\delta_{n_k}) studied in \cite{P1, P2}. In spite of this weakened regularity, it is shown that an optimal transport density still exists among nonnegative finite measures. Some geometric properties of the Banach spaces X(\Omega) and X_0^\sharp(\Omega) can be then deduced.
