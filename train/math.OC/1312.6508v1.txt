We propose a model to describe the optimal distributions of residents and services in a prescribed urban area. The cost functional takes into account the transportation costs (according to a Monge--Kantorovich-type criterion) and two additional terms which penalize concentration of residents and dispersion of services. The tools we use are the Monge--Kantorovich mass transportation theory and the theory of nonconvex functionals defined on measures.
