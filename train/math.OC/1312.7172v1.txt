This paper develops a robust optimization based method to design orbits on which the sensory perception of the desired physical quantities are maximized. It also demonstrates how to incorporate various constraints imposed by many spacecraft missions such as collision avoidance, co-orbital configuration, altitude and frozen orbit constraints along with Sun-Synchronous orbit. The paper specifically investigates designing orbits for constrained visual sensor planning applications as the case study. For this purpose, the key elements to form an image in such vision systems are considered and effective factors are taken into account to define a metric for perception quality. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for several scenarios on low and medium Earth orbits as well as a challenging Space-Based Space Surveillance program application.
