This paper considers the distributed consensus problem of linear multi-agent systems subject to different matching uncertainties for both the cases without and with a leader of bounded unknown control input. Due to the existence of nonidentical uncertainties, the multi-agent systems discussed in this paper are essentially heterogeneous. For the case where the communication graph is undirected and connected, a distributed continuous static consensus protocol based on the relative state information is first designed, under which the consensus error is uniformly ultimately bounded and exponentially converges to a small adjustable residual set. A fully distributed adaptive consensus protocol is then designed, which, contrary to the static protocol, relies on neither the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix nor the upper bounds of the uncertainties. For the case where there exists a leader whose control input is unknown and bounded, distributed static and adaptive consensus protocols are proposed to ensure the boundedness of the consensus error. It is also shown that the proposed protocols can be redesigned so as to ensure the boundedness of the consensus error in the presence of bounded external disturbances which do not satisfy the matching condition. A sufficient condition for the existence of the proposed protocols is that each agent is stabilizable.
