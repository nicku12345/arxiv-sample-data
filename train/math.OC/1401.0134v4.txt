Let A be an element of the copositive cone {\cal C}_n. A zero u of A is a nonzero nonnegative vector such that u^TAu = 0. The support of u is the index set \mbox{supp}u \subset \{1,\dots,n\} corresponding to the positive entries of u. A zero u of A is called minimal if there does not exist another zero v of A such that its support \mbox{supp}v is a strict subset of \mbox{supp}u. We investigate the properties of minimal zeros of copositive matrices and their supports. Special attention is devoted to copositive matrices which are irreducible with respect to the cone S_+(n) of positive semi-definite matrices, i.e., matrices which cannot be written as a sum of a copositive and a nonzero positive semi-definite matrix. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for irreducibility of a matrix A with respect to S_+(n) in terms of its minimal zeros. A similar condition is given for the irreducibility with respect to the cone {\cal N}_n of entry-wise nonnegative matrices. For n = 5 matrices which are irreducible with respect to both S_+(5) and {\cal N}_5 are extremal. For n = 6 a list of candidate combinations of supports of minimal zeros which an exceptional extremal matrix can have is provided.
