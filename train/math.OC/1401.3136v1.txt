We explore further controllability problems through a standard least square approach. By setting up a suitable error functional E, and putting m(\ge0) for the infimum, we interpret approximate controllability by asking m=0, while exact controllability corresponds, in addition, to demanding that m is attained. We also provide a condition, formulated entirely in terms of the error E, which turns out to be equivalent to the unique continuation property, and to approximate controllability. Though we restrict attention here to the 1D, homogeneous heat equation to explain the main ideas, they can be extended in a similar way to many other scenarios some of which have already been explored numerically, due to the flexibility of the procedure for the numerical approximation.
