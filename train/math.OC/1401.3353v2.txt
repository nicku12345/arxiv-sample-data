In this paper, a new ranking method for generalized trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy number (GTRIFN) is introduced to overcome the limitations of existing methods. Also we consider transportation problem in intuitionistic fuzzy environment. In this transportation problem, costs are represented by GTRIFNs. An algorithm is proposed to evaluate the initial basic feasible and optimal solution of intuitionistic fuzzy transportation problem. An illustrative numerical example is solved to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.
