In this work we consider a half car model which is subject to unknown but measurable disturbances. To control this system, we impose a combination of model predictive control without stabilizing terminal constraints or cost to generate a nominal solution and sensitivity updates to handle the disturbances. For this approach, stability of the resulting closed loop can be guaranteed using a relaxed Lyapunov argument on the nominal system and Lipschitz conditions on the open loop change of the optimal value function and the stage costs. For the considered example, the proposed approach is realtime applicable and corresponding results show significant performance improvements of the updated solution with respect to comfort and handling properties.
