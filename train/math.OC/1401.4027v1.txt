In this contribution we present an accelerated optimization-based approach for combined state and parameter reduction of a parametrized linear control system which is then used as a surrogate model in a Bayesian inverse setting. Following the basic ideas presented in [Lieberman, Willcox, Ghattas. Parameter and state model reduction for large-scale statistical inverse settings, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 32(5):2523-2542, 2010], our approach is based on a generalized data-driven optimization functional in the construction process of the surrogate model and the usage of a trust-region-type solution strategy that results in an additional speed-up of the overall method. In principal, the model reduction procedure is based on the offline construction of appropriate low-dimensional state and parameter spaces and an online inversion step based on the resulting surrogate model that is obtained through projection of the underlying control system onto the reduced spaces. The generalization and enhancements presented in this work are shown to decrease overall computational time and increase accuracy of the reduced order model and thus allow an application to extreme-scale problems. Numerical experiments for a generic model and a fMRI connectivity model are presented in order to compare the computational efficiency of our improved method with the original approach.
