The production function is one of the key concepts of mainstream neoclassical theories in economics. The study of the shape and properties of the production possibility frontier is a subject of great interest in economic analysis. In this respect, Cobb-Douglas and CES production functions with flat graph hypersurfaces in Euclidean spaces are first studied in [19,20]. Later, more general studies of production models were given in [4-10, 12, 21]. On the other hand, from visual-physical experiences, the second and third authors proposed in [14] to study production models via isotropic geometry. The purpose of this paper is thus to investigate important production models via isotropic geometry.
