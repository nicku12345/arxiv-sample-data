The aim of the paper is to study an optimal control problem on infinite horizon for an infinite dimensional integro-differential equation with completely monotone kernelskernels, where we assume that the noise enters the system when we introduce a control. We start by reformulating the state equation into a semilinear evolution equation which can be treated by semigroup methods. The application to optimal control provide other interesting result and require a precise descriprion of the properties of the generated semigroup. The main tools consist in studying the differentiability of the forward-backward system with infinite horizon corresponding with the reformulated problem and the proof of existence and uniqueness of of mild solutions to the corresponding HJB equation.
