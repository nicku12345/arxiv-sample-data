This thesis designs linear transceivers for the down link multiple user multiple input multiple output single-cell and multiple-cell systems. The transceivers are designed by assuming perfect and imperfect channel state information at the BS and mobile stations (MS). Different signal to interference plus noise ratio, mean square error and rate-based design criteria are considered. These design criteria are formulated by considering total BS, per BS antenna, per user, per symbol or a combination of per BS antenna and per user (symbol) power constraints. To solve these problems generalized down link up link and down link interference duality approaches are proposed.   We have also shown that the weighted sum rate maximization problem can be equivalently formulated as weighted sum mean square error minimization problem with additional optimization variables and constraints. We also develop distributed transceiver design algorithms to solve weighted sum rate and mean square error optimization problems for coordinated BS systems. The distributed transceiver design algorithms employ modify matrix fractional minimization and Lagrangian dual decomposition methods.
