Let G be a bounded open subset of Euclidean space with real algebraic boundary \Gamma. Under the assumption that the degree d of \Gamma is given, and the power moments of the Lebesgue measure on G are known up to order 3d, we describe an algorithmic procedure for obtaining a polynomial vanishing on \Gamma. The particular case of semi-algebraic sets defined by a single polynomial inequality raises an intriguing question related to the finite determinateness of the full moment sequence. The more general case of a measure with density equal to the exponential of a polynomial is treated in parallel. Our approach relies on Stokes theorem and simple Hankel-type matrix identities.
