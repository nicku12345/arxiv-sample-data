We review the recent generalized fractional calculus of variations. We consider variational problems containing generalized fractional integrals and derivatives and study them using indirect methods. In particular, we provide necessary optimality conditions of Euler-Lagrange type for the fundamental and isoperimetric problems, natural boundary conditions, and Noether type theorems.
