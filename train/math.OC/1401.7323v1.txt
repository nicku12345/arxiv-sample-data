We study the exact controllability, by a reduced number of controls, of coupled cascade systems of PDE's and the existence of exact insensitizing controls for the scalar wave equation. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the observability of abstract coupled cascade hyperbolic systems by a single observation, the observation operator being either bounded or unbounded. Our proof extends the two-level energy method introduced in \cite{sicon03, alaleau11} for symmetric coupled systems, to cascade systems which are examples of non symmetric coupled systems. In particular, we prove the observability of two coupled wave equations in cascade if the observation and coupling regions both satisfy the Geometric Control Condition (GCC) of Bardos Lebeau and Rauch \cite{blr92}. By duality, this solves the exact controllability, by a single control, of 2-coupled abstract cascade hyperbolic systems. Using transmutation, we give null-controllability results for the multidimensional heat and Schr\"odinger 2-coupled cascade systems under (GCC) and for any positive time. By our method, we can treat cases where the control and coupling coefficients have disjoint supports, partially solving an open question raised by de Teresa \cite{DeT00}. Moreover we answer the question of the existence of exact insensitizing locally distributed as well as boundary controls of scalar multidimensional wave equations, raised by J.-L. Lions \cite{lions89} and later on by D\'ager \cite{Dager06} and Tebou \cite{tebou08}.
