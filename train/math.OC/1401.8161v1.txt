For several years, students visit us on different occasions at the university. But how to bridge from the school curriculum to the contents of the university mathematics? And how to find a focal point at which an active contribute, despite the lack of knowledge, in view of limited time is possible? Our approach: Translate,under guidance, everyday life optimization problems into the language of mathematics, i.e. using variables, target functions, equations and inequalities. These so-called integer linear programming models are then solved by standard software. In this report we wnat to tell about the lessons we have learned.
