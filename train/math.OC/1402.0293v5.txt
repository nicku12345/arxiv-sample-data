In this article we consider a convex feasible set described by inequality constraints that are continuous and not necessarily Lipschitz or convex. We show that if the Slater constraint qualification and a non-degeneracy condition are satisfied, then the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker type optimality condition is both necessary and sufficient. In this way we extend previous results which are proved for Lipschitz and differentiable inequalities.
