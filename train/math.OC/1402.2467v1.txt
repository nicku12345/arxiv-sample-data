In [14], Gueant, Lasry and Lions considered the model problem ``What time does meeting start?'' as a prototype for a general class of optimization problems with a continuum of players, called Mean Field Games problems. In this paper we consider a similar model, but with the dynamics of the agents defined on a network. We discuss appropriate transition conditions at the vertices which give a well posed problem and we present some numerical results.
