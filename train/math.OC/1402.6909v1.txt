This paper presents an application of Canonical duality theory to the solution of contact problems with Coulomb friction. The contact problem is formulated as a quasi-variational inequality which solution is found by solving its Karush-Kunt-Tucker system of equations. The complementarity conditions are reformulated by using the Fischer-Burmeister complementarity function, obtaining a non-convex global optimization problem. Then canonical duality theory is applied to reformulate the non-convex global optimization problem and define its optimality conditions, finding a solution of the original quasi-variational inequality. We also propose a methodology for finding the solutions of the new formulation, and report the results on well known instances from literature.
