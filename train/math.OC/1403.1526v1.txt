We consider the optimal control problem governed by diffusion convection reaction equation without control constraints. The proper orthogonal decomposition(POD) method is used to reduce the dimension of the problem. The POD method may be lack of accuracy if the POD basis depending on a set of parameters is used to approximate the problem depending on a different set of parameters. We are interested in the perturbation of diffusion term. To increase the accuracy and robustness of the basis, we compute three bases additional to the baseline POD. The first two of them use the sensitivity information to extrapolate and expand the POD basis. The other one is based on the subspace angle interpolation method. We compare these different bases in terms of accuracy and complexity and investigate the advantages and main drawbacks of them.
