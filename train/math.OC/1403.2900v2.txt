In this paper, we present an optimal control problem for stochastic differential games under Markov regime-switching forward-backward stochastic differential equations with jumps and partial information. First, we prove a sufficient maximum principle for non zero-sum stochastic differential game problems and obtain equilibrium point for such games. Second, we prove an equivalent maximum principle for non zero-sum stochastic differential games. The zero-sum stochastic differential games equivalent maximum principle is then obtained as a corollary. We apply the obtained results to study a problem of robust utility maximization under penalty entropy. We also apply the result to find optimal investment of an insurance firm under model uncertainty.
