This paper presents three versions of maximum principle for a stochastic optimal control problem of Markov regime-switching forward-backward stochastic differential equations with jumps (FBSDEJs). A general sufficient maximum principle for optimal control for a system driven by a Markov regime-switching forward and backward jump-diffusion model is developed. After, an equivalent maximum principle is proved. Malliavin calculus is also employed to derive a general stochastic maximum principle. The latter does not require concavity of Hamiltonian. Applications of the stochastic maximum principle to non-concave Hamiltonian and recursive utility maximization is also discussed.
