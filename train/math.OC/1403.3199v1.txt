In this paper we study the best decay rate of the solutions of a damped plate equation in a square and with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. We show that the fastest decay rate is given by the supremum of the real part of the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the underlying semigroup, if the damping coefficient is in L^\infty(\Omega). Moreover, we give some numerical illustrations by spectral computation of the spectrum associated to the damped plate equation. The numerical results obtained for various cases of damping are in a good agreement with theoretical ones. Computation of the spectrum and energy of discrete solution of damped plate show that the best decay rate is given by spectral abscissa of numerical solution.
