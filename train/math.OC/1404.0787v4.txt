This paper is devoted to the study of generalized differentiation properties of the infimal convolution. This class of functions covers a large spectrum of nonsmooth functions well known in the literature. The subdifferential formulas obtained unify several known results and allow us to characterize the differentiability of the infimal convolution which plays an important role in variational analysis and optimization.
