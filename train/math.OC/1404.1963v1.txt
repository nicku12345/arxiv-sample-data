In contrast to taking the dual approach for finding a global minimum solution of a double well potential function, in Part II of the paper, we characterize a local minimizer, local maximizer, and global minimizer directly from the primal side. It is proven that, for a ``nonsingular" double well function, there exists at most one local, but non-global, minimizer and at most one local maximizer. Moreover, when it exists, the local maximizer is ``surrounded" by local minimizers in the sense that the norm of the local maximizer is strictly less than that of any local minimizer. We also establish some necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the global minimizer, local non-global minimizer and local maximizer by studying a convex secular function over specific intervals. These conditions lead to three algorithms for identifying different types of critical points of a given double well function.
