MATSuMoTo is the MATLAB Surrogate Model Toolbox for computationally expensive, black-box, global optimization problems that may have continuous, mixed-integer, or pure integer variables. Due to the black-box nature of the objective function, derivatives are not available. Hence, surrogate models are used as computationally cheap approximations of the expensive objective function in order to guide the search for improved solutions. Due to the computational expense of doing a single function evaluation, the goal is to find optimal solutions within very few expensive evaluations. The multimodality of the expensive black-box function requires an algorithm that is able to search locally as well as globally. MATSuMoTo is able to address these challenges. MATSuMoTo offers various choices for surrogate models and surrogate model mixtures, initial experimental design strategies, and sampling strategies. MATSuMoTo is able to do several function evaluations in parallel by exploiting MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox.
