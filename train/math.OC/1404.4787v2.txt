We investigate optimality conditions for optimization problems constrained by a class of variational inequalities of the second kind. Based on a nonsmooth primal-dual reformulation of the governing inequality, the differentiability of the solution map is studied. Directional differentiability is proved both for finite-dimensional and function space problems, under suitable assumptions on the active set. A characterization of B- and strong stationary optimal solutions is obtained thereafter. Finally, based on the obtained first-order information, a trust-region algorithm is proposed for the solution of the optimization problems.
