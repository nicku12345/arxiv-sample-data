Given a nonnegative matrix M with rational entries, we consider two quantities: the usual positive semidefinite (psd) rank, where the matrix is factored through the cone of real symmetric psd matrices, and the rational-restricted psd rank, where the matrix factors are required to be rational symmetric psd matrices. It is clear that the rational-restricted psd rank is always an upper bound to the usual psd rank. We show that this inequality may be strict by exhibiting a matrix with psd rank four whose rational-restricted psd rank is strictly greater than four.
