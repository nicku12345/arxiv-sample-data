The present work is motivated by the asymptotic control theory for a system of linear oscillators: the problem is to design a common bounded scalar control for damping all oscillators in asymptotically minimal time. The motion of the system is described in terms of a canonical system similar to that of the Pontryagin maximum principle. We consider the evolution equation for adjoint variables as a perturbed observable linear system. Due to the perturbation, the unobservable part of the state trajectory cannot be recovered exactly. We estimate the recovering error via the L_1-norm of perturbation. This allows us to prove that the control makes the system approach the equilibrium state with a strictly positive speed.
