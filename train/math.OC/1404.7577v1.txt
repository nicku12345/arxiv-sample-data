Optimal control problems of forward-backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (FBSVIEs in short) are formulated and studied. A general duality principle is established for linear backward stochastic integral equation and linear stochastic Fredholm-Volterra integral equation with mean-field. With the help of such a duality principle, together with some other new delicate and subtle skills, Pontryagin type maximum principles are proved for two optimal control problems of FBSVIEs.
