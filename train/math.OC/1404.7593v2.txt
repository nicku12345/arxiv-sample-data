Recently, a max-plus dual space fundamental solution semigroup for a class of difference Riccati equation (DRE) has been developed. This fundamental solution semigroup is represented in terms of the kernel of a specific max-plus linear operator that plays the role of the dynamic programming evolution operator in a max-plus dual space. In order to fully understand connections between this dual space fundamental solution semigroup and evolution of the value function of the underlying optimal control problem, a new max-plus primal space fundamental solution semigroup for the same class of difference Riccati equations is presented. Connections and commutation results between this new primal space fundamental solution semigroup and the recently developed dual space fundamental solution semigroup are established.
