The paper proposes an identification procedure for autoregressive gaussian stationary stochastic processes wherein the manifest (or observed) variables are mostly related through a limited number of latent (or hidden) variables. The method exploits the sparse plus low-rank decomposition of the inverse of the manifest spectral density and the efficient convex relaxations recently proposed for such decomposition.
