Input-to-state stability (ISS) and \mathcal{L}_2-gain are well-known robust stability properties that continue to find wide application in the analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical systems and their interconnections. We investigate the relationship between ISS-type and \mathcal{L}_2-gain properties, demonstrating several qualitative equivalences between these two approaches. We subsequently present several new sufficient conditions for the stability of interconnected systems derived by exploiting these qualitative equivalences.
