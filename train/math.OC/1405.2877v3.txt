The subgradient projection iteration is a classical method for solving a convex inequality. Motivated by works of Polyak and of Crombez, we present and analyze a more general method for finding a fixed point of a cutter, provided that the fixed point set has nonempty interior. Our assumptions on the parameters are more general than existing ones. Various limiting examples and comparisons are provided.
