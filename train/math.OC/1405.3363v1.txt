"Weakly coupled dynamic program" describes a broad class of stochastic optimization problems in which multiple controlled stochastic processes evolve independently but subject to a set of linking constraints imposed on the controls. One feature of the weakly coupled dynamic program is that it decouples into lower-dimensional dynamic programs by dualizing the linking constraint via the Lagrangian relaxation, which also yields a bound on the optimal value of the original dynamic program. Together with the Lagrangian bound, we utilize the information relaxation approach that relaxes the non-anticipative constraint on the controls to obtain a tighter dual bound. We also investigate other combinations of the relaxations and place the resulting bounds in order. To tackle large-scale problems, we further propose a computationally tractable method based on information relaxation, and provide insightful interpretation and performance guarantee. We implement our method and demonstrate its use through two numerical examples.
