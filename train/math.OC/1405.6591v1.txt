We introduce a nonlocal control condition and the notion of approximate controllability for fractional order quasilinear control inclusions. Approximate controllability of a fractional control nonlocal delay quasilinear functional differential inclusion in a Hilbert space is studied. The results are obtained by using the fractional power of operators, multi-valued analysis, and Sadovskii's fixed point theorem. Main result gives an appropriate set of sufficient conditions for the considered system to be approximately controllable. As an example, a fractional partial nonlocal control functional differential inclusion is considered.
