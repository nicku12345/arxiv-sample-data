The problem on how to determine the observability of Boolean control networks (BCNs) has been open for five years already. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to determine all the four types of observability of BCNs in the literature. We define the concept of weighted pair graphs for BCNs. In the sense of each observability, we use the so-called weighted pair graph to transform a BCN to a finite automaton, and then we use the automaton to determine observability. In particular, the two types of observability that rely on initial states and inputs in the literature are determined. Finally, we show that no pairs of the four types of observability are equivalent, which reveals the essence of nonlinearity of BCNs.
