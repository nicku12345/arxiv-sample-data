An attempt to merge into a single model, which reduces to the solution of non-smooth convex optimization problem: calculation model of OD-matrix (entropy model), the mode split model and the model of the equilibrium distribution of flows (Stable dynamic model, Nesterov - de Palma, 2003). To best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine this three models. Previously such attempts were done for other types of equlibrium models, mainly with the BMW-model (1955), the calibration of which is significantly more difficult. We also remark, that our model much better then traditional from computational point of view.
