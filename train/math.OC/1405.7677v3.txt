Memristors, initially introduced in the 1970s, have received increased attention upon successful synthesis in 2008. Considerable work has been done on modeling and applications in specific areas, however, very little is known on the potential of memristors for control applications. Being nanoscopic variable resistors, it is intuitive to think of using them as a variable gain. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a memristive analog gain control framework and theoretic foundation of a control strategy which can be implemented using this framework. Analog memristive controllers may find applications in control of large array of miniaturized devices where robust and adaptive control is needed due to parameter uncertainty and ageing issues.
