We prove a generalization of Noether's theorem for optimal control problems defined on time scales. Particularly, our results can be used for discrete-time, quantum, and continuous-time optimal control problems. The generalization involves a one-parameter family of maps which depend also on the control and a Lagrangian which is invariant up to an addition of an exact delta differential. We apply our results to some concrete optimal control problems on an arbitrary time scale.
