A recent series of papers has examined the extension of disjunctive-programming techniques to mixed-integer second-order-cone programming. For example, it has been shown---by several authors using different techniques---that the convex hull of the intersection of an ellipsoid, E, and a split disjunction, (l - x_j)(x_j - u) \le 0 with l < u, equals the intersection of E with an additional second-order-cone representable (SOCr) set. In this paper, we study more general intersections of the form K \cap Q and K \cap Q \cap H, where K is a SOCr cone, Q is a nonconvex cone defined by a single homogeneous quadratic, and H is an affine hyperplane. Under several easy-to-verify conditions, we derive simple, computable convex relaxations K \cap S and K \cap S \cap H, where S is a SOCr cone. Under further conditions, we prove that these two sets capture precisely the corresponding conic/convex hulls. Our approach unifies and extends previous results, and we illustrate its applicability and generality with many examples.
