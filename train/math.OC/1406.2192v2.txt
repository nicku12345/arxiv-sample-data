In this paper we propose an efficient distributed algorithm for solving loosely coupled convex optimization problems. The algorithm is based on a primal-dual interior-point method in which we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to compute the primal-dual directions at each iteration of the method. This enables us to join the exceptional convergence properties of primal-dual interior-point methods with the remarkable parallelizability of ADMM. The resulting algorithm has superior computational properties with respect to ADMM directly applied to our problem. The amount of computations that needs to be conducted by each computing agent is far less. In particular, the updates for all variables can be expressed in closed form, irrespective of the type of optimization problem. The most expensive computational burden of the algorithm occur in the updates of the primal variables and can be precomputed in each iteration of the interior-point method. We verify and compare our method to ADMM in numerical experiments.
