The Sequential Multiple Knapsack Problem is a special case of Multiple knapsack problem in which the items sizes are divisible. A characterization of the optimal solutions of the problem and a description of the convex hull of all the integer solutions are presented. More precisely, it is shown that a new formulation of the problem allows to generate a decomposition approach for enumerating all optimal solutions of the problem. Such a decomposition approach is used for finding the inequalities (defined by an inductive scheme) describing the Sequential Multiple Knapsack polytope.
