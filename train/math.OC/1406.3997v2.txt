The material presented in this document is intended as a comprehensive, implementation-oriented supplement to the experimental optimization framework presented in a companion document. The issues of physical degradation, unknown Lipschitz constants, measurement/estimation noise, gradient estimation, sufficient excitation, and the handling of soft constraints and/or a numerical cost function are all addressed, and a robust, implementable version of the sufficient conditions for feasible-side global convergence is proposed.
