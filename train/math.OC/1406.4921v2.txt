A sufficient condition for the existence of a solution for generalized vector equilibrium problem (GVEP) on Hadamard manifold, by using a version of KKM lemma on this context, is presented in this paper. It is worth to point out that, in particular, existence result of solution for optimization problems, vector optimization problems, Nash equilibria problems, complementarity problems and variational inequality problems can be obtained as a special case of the existence result for GVEP in this new context.
