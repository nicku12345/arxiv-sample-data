Let A be a real M \times N measurement matrix and b\in \mathbb{R}^M be an observations vector. The affine feasibility problem with sparsity and nonnegativity (AFP_{SN} for short) is to find a sparse and nonnegative vector x\in \mathbb{R}^N with Ax=b if such x exists. In this paper, we focus on establishment of optimization approach to solving the AFP_{SN}. By discussing tangent cone and normal cone of sparse constraint, we give the first necessary optimality conditions, \alpha-Stability, T-Stability and N-Stability, and the second necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the related minimization problems with the AFP_{SN}. By adopting Armijo-type stepsize rule, we present a framework of gradient support projection algorithm for the AFP_{SN} and prove its full convergence when matrix A is s-regular. By doing some numerical experiments, we show the excellent performance of the new algorithm for the AFP_{SN} without and with noise.
