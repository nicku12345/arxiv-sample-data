In smooth and convex multiobjective optimization problems the set of Pareto optima is diffeomorphic to an m-1 dimensional simplex, where m is the number of objective functions. The vertices of the simplex are the optima of the individual functions and the (k-1)-dimensional facets are the Pareto optimal set of k functions subproblems. Such a hierarchy of submanifolds is a geometrical object called stratification and the union of such manifolds, in this case the set of Pareto optima, is called a stratified set. We discuss how these geometrical structures generalize in the non convex cases, we survey the known results and deduce possible suggestions for the design of dedicated optimization strategies.
