A novel splitting scheme to solve parametric multiconvex programs is presented. It consists of a fixed number of proximal alternating minimisations and a dual update per time step, which makes it attractive in a real-time Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework and for distributed computing environments. Assuming that the parametric program is semi-algebraic and that its KKT points are strongly regular, a contraction estimate is derived and it is proven that the sub-optimality error remains stable if two key parameters are tuned properly. Efficacy of the method is demonstrated by solving a bilinear NMPC problem to control a DC motor.
