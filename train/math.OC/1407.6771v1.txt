This paper presents case studies of the algorithms called "energy generation and distribution via distributed coordination", which was proposed in [1-4]. For a convenience, we call "energy generation and distribution via distributed coordination" as "DisCoord Algorithms". After concisely summarizing the "DisCoord Algorithms" in compact forms, we will list several scenarios for numerical tests. Then, while analyzing the simulation results, we will discuss the capability of the algorithms in handling the various cases.
