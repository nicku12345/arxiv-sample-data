This paper analyzes impacts and interactions of harmonics from multiple sources, especially distributed energy resources, on distribution networks. We propose a new index, the Phasor Harmonic Index (PHI), that considers both harmonic source magnitude and phase angle, while other commonly used harmonic indices are based solely on magnitude of waveforms. The use of such an index becomes feasible and practical through emerging monitoring technologies like micro-Synchrophasors in distribution networks that help measure and visualize voltage and current phase angles along with their magnitudes. A very detailed model of a distribution network is also needed for the harmonic interaction assessment in this paper.
