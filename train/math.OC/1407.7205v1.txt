The composite L_q~(0<q<1) minimization problem over a general polyhedron has received various applications in machine learning, wireless communications, image restoration, signal reconstruction, etc. This paper aims to provide a theoretical study on this problem. Firstly, we show that for any fixed 0<q<1, finding the global minimizer of the problem, even its unconstrained counterpart, is strongly NP-hard. Secondly, we derive Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions for local minimizers of the problem. Thirdly, we propose a smoothing sequential quadratic programming framework for solving this problem. The framework requires a (approximate) solution of a convex quadratic program at each iteration. Finally, we analyze the worst-case iteration complexity of the framework for returning an \epsilon-KKT point; i.e., a feasible point that satisfies a perturbed version of the derived KKT optimality conditions. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first one with a worst-case iteration complexity guarantee for solving composite L_q minimization over a general polyhedron.
