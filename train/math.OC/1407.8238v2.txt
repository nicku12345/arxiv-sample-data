In this paper, we first propose a general inertial proximal point method for the mixed variational inequality (VI) problem. Based on our knowledge, without stronger assumptions, convergence rate result is not known in the literature for inertial type proximal point methods. Under certain conditions, we are able to establish the global convergence and a o(1/k) convergence rate result (under certain measure) of the proposed general inertial proximal point method. We then show that the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for separable convex optimization with linear constraints is an application of a general proximal point method, provided that the algorithmic parameters are properly chosen. As byproducts of this finding, we establish global convergence and O(1/k) convergence rate results of the linearized ADMM in both ergodic and nonergodic sense. In particular, by applying the proposed inertial proximal point method for mixed VI to linearly constrained separable convex optimization, we obtain an inertial version of the linearized ADMM for which the global convergence is guaranteed. We also demonstrate the effect of the inertial extrapolation step via experimental results on the compressive principal component pursuit problem.
