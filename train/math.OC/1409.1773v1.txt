In this paper the theory of robust output regulation of distributed parameter systems with infinite-dimensional exosystems is extended for plants with unbounded control and observation. As the main result, we present the internal model principle for linear infinite-dimensional systems with unbounded input and output operators. We do this for two different definitions of an internal model found in the literature, namely, the p-copy internal model and the \mathcal{G}-conditions. We also introduce a new way of defining an internal model for infinite-dimensional systems. The theoretic results are illustrated with an example where we consider robust output tracking for a one-dimensional heat equation with boundary control and pointwise measurements.
