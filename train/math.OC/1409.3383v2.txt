In the literature, necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of variational inequalities are introduced to characterize minimizers of convex set valued functions with values in a conlinear space. Similar results are proved for a weaker concept of minimizers and weaker variational inequalities. The implications are proved using scalarization techniques that eventually provide original problems, not fully equivalent to the set-valued counterparts. Therefore, we try, in the course of this note, to close the network among the various notions proposed. More specifically, we prove that a minimizer is always a weak minimizer, and a solution to the stronger variational inequality always also a solution to the weak variational inequality of the same type. As a special case we obtain a complete characterization of efficiency and weak efficiency in vector optimization by set-valued variational inequalities and their scalarizations. Indeed this might eventually prove the usefulness of the set-optimization approach to renew the study of vector optimization.
