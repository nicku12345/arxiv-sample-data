Problem of time-optimal control of linear systems with fractional dynamics is treated in the paper from the convex-analytic standpoint. A linear system of fractional differential equations involving Riemann--Liouville derivatives is considered. A method to construct a control function that brings trajectory of the system to the terminal state in the shortest time is proposed in terms of attainability sets and their support functions.
