Many research has been conducted about quadratic programming and inverse optimization. In this paper we present the combination aspect of these subjects, applying on transportation problem. First, we obtain the inverse form of quadratic tranportation problem under L_1 norm by using duality as well as introducing the optimal value. Then, we do the same process for inverse quadratic transportation problem (IQTP) under L_\infty norm.
