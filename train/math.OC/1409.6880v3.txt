There are variety of methods to solve the localization problem and among them semi-definite programming based methods have shown great performance in both complexity and accuracy aspects. In this paper, we introduce a class of less noise-sensitive relaxation to reduce the complexity of SDP-based methods. We apply our relaxation to Edge-based Semi-Definite Programming (ESDP) method and the resulted model is called PESDP. Simulation results confirm that our proposed PESDP method is less noise-sensitive and faster compared to the original ESDP.
