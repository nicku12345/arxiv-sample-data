The aim of this paper is to present a novel approach for ranking of all DMUs using the interval Cross-Efficiency (ICE) and interval Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP) methods. The approach includes two basic stages. In the first stage using DEA models the interval cross-efficiency values of each DMU are specified. In the second stage, the interval pairwise comparison matrix generated in the first stage is utilized to rank the units (DMUs) via the one step process of interval AHP (i.e. the AHP model with interval decision maker judgements). The numerical example is presented in this paper and we compare our approach with some other approaches.
