The basic optimization problem of road design is quite challenging due to a objective function that is the sum of nonsmooth functions and the presence of set constraints. In this paper, we model and solve this problem by employing the Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm. This requires a careful study of new proximity operators related to minimizing area and to the stadium norm. We compare our algorithm to a state-of-the-art projection algorithm. Our numerical results illustrate the potential of this algorithm to significantly reduce cost in road design.
