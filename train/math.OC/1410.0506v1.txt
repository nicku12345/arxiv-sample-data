Control strategy for suppression of spiral-wave in a 2-D model of an excitable media is developed with application to the cardiac system. The controller which incorporates a finite number of actuators (electrodes) assures the establishment of traveling plane behavior using the following strategy in the context of cardiac system: a small current that is proportional to a discrepancy between actual and assigned voltages at some sensor position is imposed via the actuators. We present a systematic methodology for controller design and for stability analysis based on an approximate 1-D model of the wave front. The validity of control is checked by numerical simulations. Control is successful provided a sufficient number of actuators is incorporated. The proposed control method is similar in spirit to that the previously developed by the authors for a 1-D model of cardiac tissue.
