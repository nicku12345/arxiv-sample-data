We contribute to the theory for minimal liftings of cut-generating functions. In particular, we give three operations that preserve the so-called covering property of certain structured cut-generating functions. This has the consequence of vastly expanding the set of undominated cut generating functions which can be used computationally, compared to known examples from the literature. The results of this paper are significant generalizations of previous results from the literature on such operations, and also use completely different proof techniques which we feel are more suitable for attacking future research questions in this area.
