We present a novel representation of rank constraints for non-square real matrices. We establish relationships with some existing results, which are particular cases of our representation. One of these particular cases, is a representation of the \ell_0 pseudo-norm, which is used in sparse representation problems. Finally, we describe how our representation can be included in rank-constrained optimization and in rank-minimization problems.
