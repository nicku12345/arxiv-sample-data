In practice, network applications have to deal with failing nodes, malicious attacks, or, somehow, nodes facing highly corrupted data --- generally classified as outliers. This calls for robust, uncomplicated, and efficient methods. We propose a dissimilarity model for network localization which is robust to high-power noise, but also discriminative in the presence of regular gaussian noise. We capitalize on the known properties of the M-estimator Huber penalty function to obtain a robust, but nonconvex, problem, and devise a convex underestimator, tight in the function terms, that can be minimized in polynomial time. Simulations show the performance advantage of using this dissimilarity model in the presence of outliers and under regular gaussian noise.
