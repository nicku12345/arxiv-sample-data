Recently, a \textbf{SCHUR} method was proposed in \cite{Chu2} to solve the robust pole assignment problem in state feedback control. It takes the departure from normality of the closed-loop system matrix A_c as the measure of robustness, and intends to minimize it via the real Schur form of A_c. The \textbf{SCHUR} method works well for real poles, but when complex conjugate poles are involved, it does not produce the real Schur form of A_c and can be problematic. In this paper, we put forward a modified Schur method, which improves the efficiency of \textbf{SCHUR} when complex conjugate poles are to be assigned. Besides producing the real Schur form of A_c, our approach also leads to a relatively small departure from normality of A_c. Numerical examples show that our modified method produces better or at least comparable results than both \textbf{place} and \textbf{robpole} algorithms, with much less computational costs.
