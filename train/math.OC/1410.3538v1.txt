In this paper, we study a stochastic recursive optimal control problem in which the cost functional is described by the solution of a backward stochastic differential equation driven by G-Brownian motion. Under standard assumptions, we establish the dynamic programming principle and the related fully nonlinear HJB equation in the framework of G-expectation. Finally, we show that the value function is the viscosity solution of the obtained HJB equation.
