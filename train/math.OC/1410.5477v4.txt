In this paper we present a variant of the proximal forward-backward splitting iteration for solving nonsmooth optimization problems in Hilbert spaces, when the objective function is the sum of two nondifferentiable convex functions. The proposed iteration, which will be called Proximal Subgradient Splitting Method, extends the classical subgradient iteration for important classes of problems, exploiting the additive structure of the objective function. The weak convergence of the generated sequence was established using different stepsizes and under suitable assumptions. Moreover, we analyze the complexity of the iterates.
