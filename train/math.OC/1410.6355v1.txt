In a crowd model based on leader-follower interactions, where positions of the leaders are viewed as the control input, up-to-date solutions rely on knowledge of the agents' coordinates. In practice, it is more realistic to exploit knowledge of statistical properties of the group of agents, rather than their exact positions. In order to shape the crowd, we study thus the problem of controlling the moments instead, since it is well known that shape can be determined by moments. An optimal control for the moments tracking problem is obtained by solving a modified Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which only uses the moments and leaders' states as feedback. The optimal solution can be solved fast enough for on-line implementations.
