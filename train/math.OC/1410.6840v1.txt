Within the realm of dynamic of \emph{smart buildings} and \emph{smart cities}, dynamic response management is playing an ever-increasing role thus attracting the attention of scientists from different disciplines. Dynamic demand response management involves a set of operations aiming at decentralizing the control of loads in large and complex power networks. Each single appliance if fully responsive and readjusts its energy demand to the overall network load. A main issue is related to mains frequency oscillations resulting from an unbalance between supply and demand. In a nutshell, this paper contributes to the topic by equipping each signal consumer with strategic insight. In particular, we highlight three main contributions and a few other minor contributions. First, we design a mean-field game for the TCLs application, study the mean-field equilibrium for the deterministic mean-field game and investigate on asymptotic stability for the microscopic dynamics. Second, we extend the analysis and design to imperfect models which involve both stochastic or deterministic disturbances. This leads to robust mean-field equilibrium strategies guaranteeing stochastic and worst-case stability, respectively. Minor contributions involve the use of stochastic control strategies rather than deterministic, and some numerical studies illustrating the efficacy of the proposed strategies.
