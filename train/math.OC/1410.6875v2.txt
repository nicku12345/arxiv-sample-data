The split common fixed-point problem is an inverse problem that consists in finding an element in a fixed-point set such that its image under a bounded linear operator belongs to another fixed-point set. Recently Censor and Segal proposed an efficient algorithm for solving such a problem. However, to employ their algorithm, one needs to know a prior information on the norm of the bounded linear operator. In this paper we propose a new algorithm that does not need any prior information of the operator norm, and we establish the weak convergence of the proposed algorithm under some mild assumptions.
