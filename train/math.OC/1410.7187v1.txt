Given a compact basic semi-algebraic set K\subset R^n\times R^m, a simple set B (box or ellipsoid), and some semi-algebraic function f, we consider sets defined with quantifiers, of the form R_f:=\{x\in B: \mbox{f(x,y)\leq 0 for all y such that (x,y)\in K}\} and D_f:=\{x\in B: \mbox{f(x,y)\geq 0 for some y such that (x,y)\in K}\}. The former set R_f is particularly useful to qualify "robust" decisions x versus noise parameter y (e.g. in robust optimization on some set \mathbf{\Omega}\subset B) whereas the latter set D_f is useful (e.g. in optimization) when one does not want to work with its lifted representation \{(x,y)\in K: f(x,y)\geq 0\}. Assuming that K_x:=\{y:(x,y)\in K\}\neq\emptyset for every x\in B, we provide a systematic procedure to obtain a sequence of explicit inner (resp. outer) approximations that converge to R_f (resp. D_f) in a strong sense. Another (and remarkable) feature is that each approximation is the sublevel set of a single polynomial whose vector of coefficients is an optimal solution of a semidefinite program. Several extensions are also proposed, and in particular, approximations for sets of the form R_F:=\{x\in B:\mbox{(x,y)\in F for all y such that (x,y)\in K}\}, where F is some other basic-semi algebraic set, and also sets defined with two quantifiers.
