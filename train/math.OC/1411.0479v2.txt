The paper develops a Model Predictive Controller for constrained control of spacecraft attitude with reaction wheel actuators. The controller exploits a special formulation of the cost with the reference governor like term, a low complexity addition of integral action to guarantee offset-free tracking of attitude set points, and an online optimization algorithm for the solution of the Quadratic Programming problem which is tailored to run in fixed-point arithmetic. Simulations on a nonlinear spacecraft model demonstrate that the MPC controller achieves good tracking performance while satisfying reaction wheel torque constraints. The controller also has low computational complexity and is suitable for implementation in spacecrafts with fixed-point processors.
