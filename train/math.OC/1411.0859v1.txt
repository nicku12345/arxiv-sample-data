Let F := (f_1, \ldots, f_p) \colon {\Bbb R}^n \to {\Bbb R}^p be a polynomial map, and suppose that S := \{x \in {\Bbb R}^n \ : \ f_i(x) \le 0, i = 1, \ldots, p\} \ne \emptyset. Let d := \max_{i = 1, \ldots, p} \deg f_i and \mathcal{H}(d, n, p) := d(6d - 3)^{n + p - 1}. Under the assumption that the map F \colon {\Bbb R}^n \rightarrow {\Bbb R}^p is convenient and non-degenerate at infinity, we show that there exists a constant c > 0 such that the following so-called {\em H\"older-type global error bound result} holds c d(x,S) \le [f(x)]_+^{\frac{2}{\mathcal{H}(2d, n, p)}} + [f(x)]_+ \quad \textrm{ for all } \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^n, where d(x, S) denotes the Euclidean distance between x and S, f(x) := \max_{i = 1, \ldots, p} f_i(x), and [f(x)]_+ := \max \{f(x), 0 \}. The class of polynomial maps (with fixed Newton polyhedra), which are non-degenerate at infinity, is generic in the sense that it is an open and dense semi-algebraic set. Therefore, H\"older-type global error bounds hold for a large class of polynomial maps, which can be recognized relatively easily from their combinatoric data.
