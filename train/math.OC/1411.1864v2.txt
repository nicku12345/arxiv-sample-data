High-voltage direct current (HVDC) is an increasingly commonly used technology for long-distance electric power transmission, mainly due to its low resistive losses. In this paper the voltage-droop method (VDM) is reviewed, and three novel distributed controllers for multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) transmission systems are proposed. Sufficient conditions for when the proposed controllers render the equilibrium of the closed-loop system asymptotically stable are provided. These conditions give insight into suitable controller architecture, e.g., that the communication graph should be identical with the graph of the MTDC system, including edge weights. Provided that the equilibria of the closed-loop systems are asymptotically stable, it is shown that the voltages asymptotically converge to within predefined bounds. Furthermore, a quadratic cost of the injected currents is asymptotically minimized. The proposed controllers are evaluated on a four-bus MTDC system.
