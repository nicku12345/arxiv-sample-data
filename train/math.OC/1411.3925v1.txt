Fatigue is a critical factor in structures as wind turbines exposed to harsh operating conditions, both in the design stage and control during their operation. In the present paper the most recognized approaches to estimate the damage caused by fatigue are discussed and compared, with special focus on their applicability for wind turbine control. The aim of this paper is to serve as a guide among the vast literature on fatigue and shed some light on the underlying relationships between these methods.
