Two nonlinear observers for velocity-aided attitude estimation, relying on gyrometers, accelerometers, magnetometers, and velocity measured in the body-fixed frame, are proposed. As opposed to state-of-the-art body-fixed velocity-aided attitude observers endowed with local properties, both observers are (almost) globally asymptotically stable, with very simple and flexible tuning. Moreover, the roll and pitch estimates are globally decoupled from magnetometer measurements.
