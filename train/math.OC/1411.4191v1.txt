We derive a-priori error estimates for the finite-element approximation of a distributed optimal control problem governed by the steady one-dimensional Burgers equation with pointwise box constraints on the control. Here the approximation of the state and the control is done by using piecewise linear functions. With this choice, an L^2 superlinear order of convergence for the control is obtained; moreover, under a further assumption on the regularity structure of the optimal control this error estimate can be improved to h^{3/2}. The theoretical findings are tested experimentally by means of numerical examples.
