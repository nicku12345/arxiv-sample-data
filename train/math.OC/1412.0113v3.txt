This paper deals with the class of Q-tensors, that is, a Q-tensor is a real tensor \mathcal{A} such that the tensor complementarity problem (\q, \mathcal{A}):   \mbox{ finding } \x \in \mathbb{R}^n\mbox{ such that }\x \geq \0, \q + \mathcal{A}\x^{m-1} \geq \0, \mbox{ and }\x^\top (\q + \mathcal{A}\x^{m-1}) = 0,  has a solution for each vector \q \in \mathbb{R}^n. Several subclasses of Q-tensors are given: P-tensors, R-tensors, strictly semi-positive tensors and semi-positive R_0-tensors. We prove that a nonnegative tensor is a Q-tensor if and only if all of its principal diagonal entries are positive, and so the equivalence of Q-tensor, R-tensors, strictly semi-positive tensors is showed if they are nonnegative tensors. We also show that a tensor is a R_0-tensor if and only if the tensor complementarity problem (\0, \mathcal{A}) has no non-zero vector solution, and a tensor is a R-tensor if and only if it is a R_0-tensor and the tensor complementarity problem (\e, \mathcal{A}) has no non-zero vector solution, where \e=(1,1\cdots,1)^\top.
