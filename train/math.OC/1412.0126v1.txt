For a Hilbert space setting Chambolle and Pock introduced an attractive first-order algorithm which solves a convex optimization problem and its Fenchel dual simultaneously. We present a generalization of this algorithm to Banach spaces. Moreover, under certain conditions we prove strong convergence as well as convergence rates. Due to the generalization the method becomes efficiently applicable for a wider class of problems. This fact makes it particularly interesting for solving ill-posed inverse problems on Banach spaces by Tikhonov regularization or the iteratively regularized Newton-type method, respectively.
