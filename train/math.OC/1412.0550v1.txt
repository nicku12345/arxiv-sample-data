The paper concerns parameterized equilibria governed by generalized equations whose multivalued parts are modeled via regular normals to nonconvex conic constraints. Our main goal is to derive a precise pointwise second-order formula for calculating the graphical derivative of the solution maps to such generalized equations that involves Lagrange multipliers of the corresponding KKT systems and critical cone directions. Then we apply the obtained formula to characterizing a Lipschitzian stability notion for the solution maps that is known as isolated calmness.
