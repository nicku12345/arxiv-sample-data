In this paper, we study a nonzero-sum stochastic differential game in Markovian framework. We show the existence of the Nash equilibrium point which is discontinuous and of bang-bang type under natural conditions. The main tool is the notion of backward stochastic differential equations which, in our case, are multidimensional with discontinuous generators with respect to z component.
