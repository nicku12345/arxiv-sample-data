This paper presents a majorized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with indefinite proximal terms for solving linearly constrained 2-block convex composite optimization problems with each block in the objective being the sum of a non-smooth convex function and a smooth convex function, i.e., \min_{x \in {\cal X}, \; y \in {\cal Y}}\{p(x)+f(x) + q(y)+g(y)\mid A^* x+B^* y = c\}.   By choosing the indefinite proximal terms properly, we establish the global convergence and O(1/k) ergodic iteration-complexity of the proposed method for the step-length \tau \in (0, (1+\sqrt{5})/2). The computational benefit of using indefinite proximal terms within the ADMM framework instead of the current requirement of positive semidefinite ones is also demonstrated numerically. This opens up a new way to improve the practical performance of the ADMM and related methods.
