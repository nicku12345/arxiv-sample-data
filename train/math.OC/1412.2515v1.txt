We extend in two ways the standard Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions to problems with a convex objective, convex functional constraints, and the extra requirement that some of the variables must be integral. While the standard Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions involve separating hyperplanes, our extension is based on lattice-free polyhedra. Our optimality conditions allow us to define an exact dual of our original mixed-integer convex problem.
