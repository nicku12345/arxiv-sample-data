We study the complexity of computing the mixed-integer hull \operatorname{conv}(P\cap\mathbb{Z}^n\times\mathbb{R}^d) of a polyhedron P. Given an inequality description, with one integer variable, the mixed-integer hull can have exponentially many vertices and facets in d. For n,d fixed, we give an algorithm to find the mixed integer hull in polynomial time. Given P=\operatorname{conv}(V) and n fixed, we compute a vertex description of the mixed-integer hull in polynomial time and give bounds on the number of vertices of the mixed integer hull.
