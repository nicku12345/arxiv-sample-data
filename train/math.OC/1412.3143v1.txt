It is anticipated that penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in power systems will increase further in the next decades mainly due to environmental issues. In the long term of several decades, which we refer to in terms of the future grid (FG), balancing between supply and demand will become dependent on demand actions including demand response (DR) and energy storage. So far, FG feasibility studies have not considered these new demand-side developments for modelling future demand. In Australia, installed rooftop photovoltaic (PV) generation has been increasing significantly in recent years, and this is increasingly influence the nett load profile for FG feasibility studies. This paper proposes an aggregate nett load or demand model to be used at higher voltage levels considering the effect of rooftop PV, energy storage and DR for FG scenarios, which is inspired by the smart home concept. The proposed model is formulated as an optimization problem aiming at minimizing the electricity cost. As a case study, the effect of the load model is studied on the load profile, balancing and loadability of the Australian National Electricity Market in 2020 with the increased penetration of wind and solar generation.
