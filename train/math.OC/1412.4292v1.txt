The seasonal production of fruit and seeds resembles opening a feeding station, such as a restaurant agents/ customers will arrive at a certain rate and pick fruit (get served) at a certain rate following some appropriate processes. Therefore, dispersion follows the resource process. Modelling this process results in a search/optimisation algorithm that used dispersion as an exploration tool that, if well captured, will find the optimum of a function over a given search space. This paper presents such an algorithm and tests it on non-trivial problems.
