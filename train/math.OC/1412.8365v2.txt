This paper proposes a framework to design an event-triggered based robust control law for linear uncertain system. The robust control law is realized through both static and dynamic event-triggering approach to reduce the computation and communication usages. Proposed control strategies ensure stability in the presence of bounded matched and unmatched system uncertainties. Derivation of event-triggering rule with a non-zero positive inter-event time and corresponding stability criteria for uncertain event-triggered system are the key contributions of this paper. The efficacy of proposed algorithm is carried out through a comparative study of simulation results.
