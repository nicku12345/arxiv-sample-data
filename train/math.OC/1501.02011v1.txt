This paper addresses some trust-region methods equipped with nonmonotone strategies for solving nonlinear unconstrained optimization problems. More specifically, the importance of using nonmonotone techniques in nonlinear optimization is motivated, then two new nonmonotone terms are proposed, and their combinations into the traditional trust-region framework are studied. The global convergence to first- and second-order stationary points and local superlinear and quadratic convergence rates for both algorithms are established. Numerical experiments on the \textsf{CUTEst} test collection of unconstrained problems and some highly nonlinear test functions are reported, where a comparison among state-of-the-art nonmonotone trust-region methods show the efficiency of the proposed nonmonotne schemes.
