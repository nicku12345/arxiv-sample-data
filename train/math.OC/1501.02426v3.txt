In 1994 Drew, Johnson and Loewy conjectured that for n \ge 4, the cp-rank of any n\times n completely positive matrices is at most \lfloor{n^2}/{4}\rfloor. Recently this conjecture has been proved for n=5 and disproved for n\ge 7, leaving the case n=6 open. We make a step toward proving the conjecture for n=6. We show that if A is a 6\times 6 completely positive matrix that is orthogonal to an exceptional extremal copositive matrix, then the cp-rank of A is at most 9.
