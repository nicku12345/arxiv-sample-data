We consider the problem of approximately solving a standard bi-quadratic programming (StBQP), which is NP-hard. After reformulating the original problem as an equivalent copositive tensor programming, we show how to approximate the optimal solution by approximating the cone of copositive tensors via a serial polyhedral cones. The established quality of approximation shows that, a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for solving StBQP exists and can be extended to solving standard multi-quadratic programming. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate our approach.
