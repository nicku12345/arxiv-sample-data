In this paper we propose a new engine management system for hybrid vehicles to enable energy providers and car manufacturers to provide new services. Energy forecasts are used to collaboratively orchestrate the behaviour of engine management systems of a fleet of PHEV's to absorb oncoming energy in an smart manner. Cooperative algorithms are suggested to manage the energy absorption in an optimal manner for a fleet of vehicles, and the mobility simulator SUMO is used to show simple simulations to support the efficacy of the proposed idea.
