Power systems are undergoing unprecedented transformations with the incorporation of larger amounts of renewable energy sources, distributed generation and demand response. All these changes, while potentially making power grids more responsive, efficient and resilient, also pose significant implementation challenges. In particular, operating the new power grid will require new tools and algorithms capable of predicting if the current state of the system is operationally safe. In this paper we study and generalize the so-called energy function as a tool to design algorithms to test if a high-voltage power transmission system is within the allowed operational limits. In the past the energy function technique was utilized primarily to access the power system transient stability. In this manuscript, we take a new look at energy functions and focus on an aspect that has previously received little attention: Convexity. We characterize the domain of voltage magnitudes and phases within which the energy function is convex. We show that the domain of the energy function convexity is sufficiently large to include most operationally relevant and practically interesting cases. We show how the energy function convexity can be used to analyze power flow equations, e.g. to certify solution uniqueness or non-existence within the domain of convexity. This and other useful features of the generalized energy function are described and illustrated on IEEE 14 and 118 bus models.
