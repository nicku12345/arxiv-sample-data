This paper investigates a new method for consensus in a group of nonlinear complex multi-agent systems using fixed-order non-fragile dynamic output feedback controller, via an LMI approach. The proposed scheme is decentralized in the sense that each agent relies on the relative output information among the adjacent agents. The consensus based controllers are designed to minimize the effects of nonlinear terms of the agents as well as external disturbances. Converting consensus problem to stabilization of an equivalent augmented system using proper transformations, Lyapunov stability theorem is applied to obtain unknown controller parameters in order to guarantee consensus and simultaneously acquire considered control objectives. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and compare with similar earlier researches, a numerical example on a multi-agent system consisting of single link flexible manipulators is carried out.
