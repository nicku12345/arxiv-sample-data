This paper is focused on the dynamics and control of arbitrary number of quadrotor UAVs transporting a rigid body payload. The rigid body payload is connected to quadrotors via flexible cables where each flexible cable is modeled as a system of serially-connected links. It is shown that a coordinate-free form of equations of motion can be derived for arbitrary numbers of quadrotors and links according to Lagrangian mechanics on a manifold. A geometric nonlinear controller is presented to transport the rigid body to a fixed desired position while aligning all of the links along the vertical direction. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the desirable features of the proposed control system.
