This comparison aims to present different functionalities provided by two software tools among the most used for production availability analyses: MAROS (developed by DNV) and GRIF/BStok (developed by Total). The different functionalities are presented and compared through tables. Then, a case study allows comparing the results obtained by the two tools. MAROS and GRIF/BStok both provide production availability analyses that meet industrial needs. While the use of MAROS brings to the user more "conviviality", a drawback is the "black box" aspect that results from it. BStok, thanks to the underlying exploitation of Petri nets, supplies more modeling flexibility in exchange of higher expertise.
