In this paper, we study optimal actuator location of the minimum norm controls for a multi-dimensional heat equation with control defined in the space L^p(0,T;L^2(\Omega)). The actuator domain \omega is quite general in the sense that it is required only to have a prescribed Lebesgue measure. A relaxation problem is formulated and is transformed into a two-person zero-sum game problem. By the game theory, we develop a necessary and sufficient condition and the existence of relaxed optimal actuator location for p\in[2,+\infty], which is characterized by the Nash equilibrium of the associated game problem. An interesting case is for the case of p=2, for which it is shown that the classical optimal actuator location can be obtained from the relaxed optimal actuator location without additional condition. Finally for p=2, a sufficient and necessary condition for classical optimal actuator location is presented.
