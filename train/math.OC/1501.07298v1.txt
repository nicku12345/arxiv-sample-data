In this paper, we introduce a new method for solving variational inequality problems with monotone and Lipschitz-continuous mapping in Hilbert space. The iterative process is based on two well-known projection method and the hybrid (or outer approximation) method. However we do not use an extrapolation step in the projection method. The absence of one projection in our method is explained by slightly different choice of sets in hybrid method. We prove a strong convergence of the sequences generated by our method.
