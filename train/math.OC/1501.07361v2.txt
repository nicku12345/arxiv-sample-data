In this paper, we derive a version of the Pontryagin maximum principle for general finite-dimensional nonlinear optimal sampled-data control problems. Our framework is actually much more general, and we treat optimal control problems for which the state variable evolves on a given time scale (arbitrary non-empty closed subset of R), and the control variable evolves on a smaller time scale. Sampled-data systems are then a particular case. Our proof is based on the construction of appropriate needle-like variations and on the Ekeland variational principle.
