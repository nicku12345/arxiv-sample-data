This paper presents a control architecture in which a direct adaptive control technique is used within the model predictive control framework, using the concurrent learning based approach, to compensate for model uncertainties. At each time step, the control sequences and the parameter estimates are both used as the optimization arguments, thereby undermining the need for switching between the learning phase and the control phase, as is the case with hybrid-direct-indirect control architectures. The state derivatives are approximated using pseudospectral methods, which are vastly used for numerical optimal control problems. Theoretical results and numerical simulation examples are used to establish the effectiveness of the architecture.
