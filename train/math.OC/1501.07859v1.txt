In this paper, we simplify the coordination control approach by removing the supervisor for the coordinator from the closed-loop system and relax the restrictions placed on a coordinator. This relaxation results in the simplification of the whole coordination control framework, including the notions of conditional controllability, conditional observability, and conditional normality. Compared to our previous work, the role of the supervisor on a coordinator alphabet is postponed until the final stage of the coordination control synthesis. This completes and clarifies our previous results, while all the fundamental theorems remain valid in the relaxed framework. Unlike previous approaches we can always compute a conditionally controllable sublanguage without any restricting conditions we have used before.
