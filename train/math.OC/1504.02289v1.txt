Motivated by research on contraction analysis and incremental stability/stabilizability the study of 'differential properties' has attracted increasing attention lately. Previously lifts of functions and vector fields to the tangent bundle of the state space manifold have been employed for a geometric approach to differential passivity and dissipativity. In the same vein, the present paper aims at a geometric underpinning and elucidation of recent work on 'control contraction metrics' and 'generalized differential Riccati equations'.
