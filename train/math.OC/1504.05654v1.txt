This paper joins some concepts from Mechanics, Partial Differential Equations and Control Theory in order to solve bi-time optimization problems related to stress tensor in plastic deformations. The main goal is to analyze some optimal control problems constrained by the equilibrium equations of the stress tensor in perfect plastic plane medium. As consequence of this approach, a natural split of the constraints arises, leading to integrability conditions and changes a classical variational problem into an optimal control one. The final outcomes confirm all the expectations related to the physical features of plastic deformations phenomenon.
