As penetration of wind power generation increases, system operators must account for its stochastic nature in a reliable and cost-efficient manner. These conflicting objectives can be traded-off by accounting for the variability and uncertainty of wind power generation. This letter presents a new methodology to estimate uncertainty sets for parameters of probability distributions that capture wind generation uncertainty and variability.
