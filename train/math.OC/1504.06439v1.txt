This work is concerned with existence of weak solutions to discon- tinuous stochastic differential equations driven by multiplicative Gaus- sian noise and sliding mode control dynamics generated by stochastic differential equations with variable structure, that is with jump nonlin- earity. The treatment covers the finite dimensional stochastic systems and the stochastic diffusion equation with multiplicative noise.
