A linear map between real symmetric matrix spaces is positive if all positive semidefinite matrices are mapped to positive semidefinite ones. A real symmetric matrix is separable if it can be written as a summation of Kronecker products of positive semidefinite matrices. This paper studies how to check if a linear map is positive or not and how to check if a matrix is separable or not. We propose numerical algorithms, based on Lasserre type semidefinite relaxations, for solving such questions. To check the positivity of a linear map, we construct a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations for minimizing the associated bi-quadratic forms over the unit spheres. We show that the positivity can be detected by solving a finite number of such semidefinite relaxations. To check the separability of a matrix, we construct a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations. If it is not separable, we can get a mathematical certificate for that; if it is, we can get a decomposition for the separability.
