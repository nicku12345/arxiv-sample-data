Let \Phi:\mathcal{H}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R\cup}\left\{ +\infty\right\}  be a closed convex proper function on a real Hilbert space \mathcal{H}, and \partial\Phi:\mathcal{H}\rightrightarrows\mathcal{H} its subdifferential. For any control function \epsilon:\mathbb{R}_{+}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}_{+} which tends to zero as t goes to +\infty, and \lambda a positive parameter, we study the asymptotic behavior of the trajectories of the regularized Newton dynamical system \begin{eqnarray*}   & & \upsilon\left(t\right)\in\partial\Phi\left(x\left(t\right)\right)   & & \lambda\dot{x}\left(t\right)+\dot{\upsilon}\left(t\right)+\upsilon\left(t\right)+\varepsilon\left(t\right)x\left(t\right)=0. \end{eqnarray*} Assuming that \varepsilon\left(t\right) tends to zero moderately as t goes to +\infty, we show that the term \varepsilon\left(\cdot\right)x\left(\cdot\right) asymptotically acts as a Tikhonov regularization, which forces the trajectories to converge to a particular equilibrium. Precisely, when C=\textrm{argmin}\Phi\neq\emptyset, and \varepsilon (\cdot) is a ``slow'' control, i.e., \int_{0}^{+\infty}\varepsilon\left(t\right)dt=+\infty, then each trajectory of the system converges weakly, as t goes to +\infty, to the element of minimal norm of the closed convex set C. When \Phi is a convex differentiable function whose gradient is Lipschitz continuous,   we show that the strong convergence property is satisfied. Then we examine the effect of other types of regularizing methods.
