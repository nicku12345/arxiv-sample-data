This paper presents a method developed for finding sinusoidal components within a nonlinear non-stationary time-series data using Genetic Algorithm (GA) (a global optimization technique). It is called Search-Enhanced Instantaneous Frequency Detection (SEIFD) algorithm. The GA adaptively define the configuration of the components by simulating the solution finding process as a series of genetic evolutions. The start-time, end-time, frequency, and phase of each of these components are identified once convergence in the implementation is achieved.
