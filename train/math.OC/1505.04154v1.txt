We consider a steady-state heat conduction problem P for the Poisson equation with mixed boundary conditions in a bounded multidimensional domain \Omega. We also consider a family of problems P_{\alpha} for the same Poisson equation with mixed boundary conditions being \alpha>0 the heat transfer coefficient defined on a portion \Gamma_{1} of the boundary. We formulate simultaneous \emph{distributed and Neumann boundary} optimal control problems on the internal energy g within \Omega and the heat flux q, defined on the complementary portion \Gamma_{2} of the boundary of \Omega for quadratic cost functional. Here the control variable is the vector (g,q). We prove existence and uniqueness of the optimal control (\overline{\overline{g}},\overline{\overline{q}}) for the system state of P, and (\overline{\overline{g}}_{\alpha},\overline{\overline{q}}_{\alpha}) for the system state of P_{\alpha}, for each \alpha>0, and we give the corresponding optimality conditions. We prove strong convergence, in suitable Sobolev spaces, of the vectorial optimal controls, system and adjoint states governed by the problems P_{\alpha} to the corresponding vectorial optimal control, system and adjoint states governed by the problem P, when the parameter \alpha goes to infinity. We also obtain estimations between the solutions of these vectorial optimal control problems and the solution of two scalar optimal control problems characterized by fixed g (with boundary optimal control \overline{q}) and fixed q (with distributed optimal control \overline{g}), respectively, for both cases \alpha>0 and \alpha=\infty.
