This note presents an extension to the adaptive control strategy presented in [1] able to counter eventual instability due to disturbances at the input of an otherwise \mathcal{L}_2 stable closed-loop system. These disturbances are due to the presence of affine terms in the plant and reference model. The existence of a common Lyapunov function is used to prove global convergence of the error system, even in the presence of sliding solutions, as well as boundedness of all the adaptive gains.
