We present a powerful and easy-to-implement algorithm for solving constrained optimization problems that involve L_1/total-variation regularization terms, and both equality and inequality constraints. We discuss the relationship of our method to earlier works of Goldstein and Osher (2009) and Chartrand and Wohlberg (2010), and demonstrate that our approach is a combination of the augmented Lagrangian method with splitting and model projection. We test the method on a geomechanical problem and invert highly compartmentalized pressure change from noisy surface uplift observations. We conclude the paper with a discussion of possible extension to a wide class of regularized optimization problems with bound and equality constraints.
