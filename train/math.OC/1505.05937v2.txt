The problem of state-feedback stabilizability of discrete-time nonlinear systems has been considered in this note. Two assertions have been proved. First, if the system is N-step controllable to the origin, then there is a state feedback control law for which the trajectory of the closed-loop system converges to the origin in N steps. Second, if the system is asymptotically controllable to the origin and satisfies the controllability rank condition at the origin, then there is a state feedback control law for which the trajectory of the closed-loop system converges to the origin in finite steps.
