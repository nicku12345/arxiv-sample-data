In this paper, adaptive set-point regulation controllers for discrete-time nonlinear systems are constructed. The system to be controlled is assumed to have a parametric uncertainty, and an excitation signal is used in order to obtain the parameter estimate. The proposed controller belongs to the category of indirect adaptive controllers, and its construction is based on the policy of calculating the control input rather than that of obtaining a control law. The proposed method solves the adaptive set-point regulation problem under the (possibly minimal) assumption that the target state is reachable provided that the parameter is known. Additional feature of the proposed method is that Lyapunov-like functions have not been used in the construction of the controllers.
