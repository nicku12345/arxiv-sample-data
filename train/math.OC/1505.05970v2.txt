In this paper, the relationship between notions of observability for continuous-time nonlinear system related to distinguishability, observability rank condition and K-function has been investigated. It is proved that an autonomous nonlinear system that is observable in both distinguishability and rank condition sense permits an observation window of finite width, and it is possible to construct a K-function related to observability for such system.
