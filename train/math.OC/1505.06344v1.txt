This paper provides new summation inequalities in both single and double forms to be used in stability analysis of discrete-time systems with time-varying delays. The potential capability of the newly derived inequalities is demonstrated by establishing less conservative stability conditions for a class of linear discrete-time systems with an interval time-varying delay in the framework of linear matrix inequalities. The effectiveness and least conservativeness of the derived stability conditions are shown by academic and practical examples.
