We propose composite approache to the special sum-type convex optimization problem with affine restriction and special entropy type regularization. Since the fuctional has a penalty type form, we reformulate initial conditional optimization problem in a special unconstrained form that allows us to put the penalty type functional into the composite term. We also describe the characteristic functions on graphs technique (Yu. Nesterov, 2007) in application to the dual problem.
