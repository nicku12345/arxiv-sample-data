A free boundary problem arising from the optimal reinforcement of a membrane or from the reduction of traffic congestion is considered; it is of the form \sup_{\int_D\theta\,dx=m}\ \inf_{u\in H^1_0(D)}\int_D\Big(\frac{1+\theta}{2}|\nabla u|^2-fu\Big)\,dx. We prove the existence of an optimal reinforcement \theta and that it has some higher integrability properties. We also provide some numerical computations for \theta and u.
