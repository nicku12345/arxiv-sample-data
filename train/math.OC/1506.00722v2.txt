This letter presents a fast distributed algorithm for aggregating a large number of households with mixed-integer variables and intricate couplings between devices. The proposed fast distributed gradient algorithm is applied to the double smoothed dual function of the adopted DR model. The results also show that, with minimal parameter adjustments, the convergence of the dual objective exhibits the same behavior irrespective of the system size.
