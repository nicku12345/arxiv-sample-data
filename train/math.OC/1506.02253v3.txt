This paper is divided to two parts. In the first part, we provide elementary proofs for some important results in multi-objective optimization. The given proofs are so simple and short in compared to the existing ones. Also, a Pareto reducibility result is extended from efficiency to proper efficiency. The second part is devoted to the connections between nonemptiness, R^p_{\geqq}-(semi)compactness, external stability and connectedness of the set of nondominated solutions in multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, it is shown that some assumption in an important result, concerning connectedness, is redundant and should be removed.
