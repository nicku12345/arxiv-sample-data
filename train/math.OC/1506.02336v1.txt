A framework is introduced to integrate renewable energy sources (RES) and dynamic pricing capabilities of the smart grid into beamforming designs for coordinated multi-point (CoMP) downlink communication systems. To this end, novel models are put forth to account for harvesting, storage of nondispatchable RES, time-varying energy pricing, as well as stochastic wireless channels. Building on these models, robust energy management and transmit-beamforming designs are developed to minimize the worst-case energy cost subject to the worst-case user QoS guarantees for the CoMP downlink. Leveraging pertinent tools, this task is formulated as a convex problem. A Lagrange dual based subgradient iteration is then employed to find the desired optimal energy-management strategy and transmit-beamforming vectors. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the merits of the proposed robust designs.
