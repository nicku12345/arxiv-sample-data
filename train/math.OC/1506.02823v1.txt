We present some first results concerning a gradient-based dynamic approach to multi-objective optimization problems, involving inertial effects. We prove the existence of global solution trajectories for this second-order differential equation, and their convergence to weak Pareto points in the convex case. It is a first step towards the design of fast numerical methods for multi-objective optimization.
