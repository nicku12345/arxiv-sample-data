We consider the submodular function minimization (SFM) and the quadratic minimization problemsregularized by the Lov'asz extension of the submodular function. These optimization problemsare intimately related; for example,min-cut problems and total variation denoising problems, wherethe cut function is submodular and its Lov'asz extension is given by the associated total variation.When a quadratic loss is regularized by the total variation of a cut function, it thus becomes atotal variation denoising problem and we use the same terminology in this paper for "general" submodularfunctions. We propose a new active-set algorithm for total variation denoising with theassumption of an oracle that solves the corresponding SFM problem. This can be seen as localdescent algorithm over ordered partitions with explicit convergence guarantees. It is more flexiblethan the existing algorithms with the ability for warm-restarts using the solution of a closely relatedproblem. Further, we also consider the case when a submodular function can be decomposed intothe sum of two submodular functions F1 and F2 and assume SFM oracles for these two functions.We propose a new active-set algorithm for total variation denoising (and hence SFM by thresholdingthe solution at zero). This algorithm also performs local descent over ordered partitions and itsability to warm start considerably improves the performance of the algorithm. In the experiments,we compare the performance of the proposed algorithms with state-of-the-art algorithms, showingthat it reduces the calls to SFM oracles.
