The problem of three-dimensional (3-D) wind profile prediction is addressed based a trinion wind model, which inherently reckons the coupling of the three perpendicular components of a wind field. The augmented trinion statistics are developed and employed to enhance the prediction performance due to its full exploitation of the second-order statistics. The proposed trinion domain processing can be regarded as a more compact version of the existing quaternion-valued approach, with a lower computational complexity. Simulations based on recorded wind data are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
