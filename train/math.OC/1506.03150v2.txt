This paper presents an algorithm for the synchronization of blind agents (agents are unable to observe other agents, i.e. no communication) evolving on a connected Lie group G. We employ the method of extremum seeking control for nonlinear dynamical systems defined on connected Riemannian manifolds to achieve a synchronization among the agents. This approach is independent of the underlying graph of the system and each agent updates its position on G by only receiving the synchronization cost function. The results are obtained by employing the notion of geodesic dithers for extremum seeking on Riemannian manifolds and their equivalent version on Lie groups and applying Taylor expansion of smooth functions on Riemannian manifolds. We apply the obtained results to synchronization problems defined on Lie groups SO(3) and SE(3) to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.
