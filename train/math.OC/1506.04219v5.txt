This document presents a, (mostly) chronologically ordered, bibliography of scientific publications on the superiorization methodology and perturbation resilience of algorithms which is compiled and continuously updated by us at: http://math.haifa.ac.il/yair/bib-superiorization-censor.html. Since the beginings of this topic we try to trace the work that has been published about it since its inception. To the best of our knowledge this bibliography represents all available publications on this topic to date, and while the URL is continuously updated we will revise this document and bring it up to date on arXiv approximately once a year. Abstracts of the cited works, and some links and downloadable files of preprints or reprints are available on the above mentioned Internet page. If you know of a related scientific work in any form that should be included here kindly write to me on: yair@math.haifa.ac.il with full bibliographic details, a DOI if available, and a PDF copy of the work if possible. The Internet page was initiated on March 7, 2015, and has been last updated on March 12, 2020.
