The recently introduced collaborative nonnegative matrix factorization (CoNMF) algorithm was conceived to simultaneously estimate the number of endmembers, the mixing matrix, and the fractional abundances from hyperspectral linear mixtures. This paper introduces R-CoNMF, which is a robust version of CoNMF. The robustness has been added by a) including a volume regularizer which penalizes the distance to a mixing matrix inferred by a pure pixel algorithm; and by b) introducing a new proximal alternating optimization (PAO) algorithm for which convergence to a critical point is guaranteed. Our experimental results indicate that R-CoNMF provides effective estimates both when the number of endmembers are unknown and when they are known.
