In this work, partial answers to Reich, Mizoguchi and Takahashi, and Amini-Harandi's conjectures are presented via a light version of Caristi's fixed point theorem. Moreover, we introduce that many of known fixed point theorem can easily derived from the Caristi's theorem. Finally, existence of bounded solutions of a functional equation is studied.
