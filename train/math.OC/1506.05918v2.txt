A recent promising technique for robotic micro-swimmers is to endow them with a magnetization and apply an external magnetic field to provoke their deformation. In this note we consider a simple planar micro-swimmer model made of two magnetized segments connected by an elastic joint, controlled via a magnetic field. After recalling the analytical model, we establish a local controllability result around the straight position of the swimmer.
