This paper extends the SQP-approach of the well-known bundle-Newton method for nonsmooth unconstrained minimization to the nonlinearly constrained case. Instead of using a penalty function or a filter or an improvement function to deal with the presence of constraints, the search direction is determined by solving a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program to obtain good iteration points. Issues arising with this procedure concerning the bundling process as well as in the line search are discussed. Furthermore, global convergence of the method is shown under certain mild assumptions.
