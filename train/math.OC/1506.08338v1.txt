An important aspect in the solution process of constraint satisfaction problems is to identify exclusion boxes which are boxes that do not contain feasible points. This paper presents a certificate of infeasibility for finding such boxes by solving a linearly constrained nonsmooth optimization problem. Furthermore, the constructed certificate can be used to enlarge an exclusion box by solving a nonlinearly constrained nonsmooth optimization problem.
