The alternating-current optimal power flow (ACOPF) is one of the best known non-convex non-linear optimisation problems. We present a novel re-formulation of ACOPF, which is based on lifting the rectangular power-voltage rank-constrained formulation, and makes it possible to derive alternative SDP relaxations. For those, we develop a first-order method based on the parallel coordinate descent with a novel closed-form step based on roots of cubic polynomials.
