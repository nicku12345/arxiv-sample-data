We analysis some singular partial differential equations systems(PDAEs) with boundary conditions in high dimension bounded domain with sufficiently smooth boundary. With the eigenvalue theory of PDE the systems initially is formulated as an infinite-dimensional singular systems. The state space description of the system is built according to the spectrum structure and convergence analysis of the PDAEs. Some global stability results are provided. The applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated in numerical simulations on some wetland conservation system with social behaviour.
