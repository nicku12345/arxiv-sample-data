In this paper, a parametric simplex algorithm for solving linear vector optimization problems (LVOPs) is presented. This algorithm can be seen as a variant of the multi-objective simplex (Evans-Steuer) algorithm [12]. Different from it, the proposed algorithm works in the parameter space and does not aim to find the set of all efficient solutions. Instead, it finds a solution in the sense of Loehne [16], that is, it finds a subset of efficient solutions that allows to generate the whole frontier. In that sense, it can also be seen as a generalization of the parametric self-dual simplex algorithm, which originally is designed for solving single objective linear optimization problems, and is modified to solve two objective bounded LVOPs with the positive orthant as the ordering cone in Ruszczynski and Vanderbei [21]. The algorithm proposed here works for any dimension, any solid pointed polyhedral ordering cone C and for bounded as well as unbounded problems. Numerical results are provided to compare the proposed algorithm with an objective space based LVOP algorithm (Benson algorithm in [13]), that also provides a solution in the sense of [16], and with Evans-Steuer algorithm [12]. The results show that for non-degenerate problems the proposed algorithm outperforms Benson algorithm and is on par with Evan-Steuer algorithm. For highly degenerate problems Benson's algorithm [13] excels the simplex-type algorithms; however, the parametric simplex algorithm is for these problems computationally much more efficient than Evans-Steuer algorithm.
