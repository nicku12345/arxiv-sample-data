In this paper we propose distributed dynamic controllers for sharing both frequency containment and restoration reserves of asynchronous AC systems connected through a multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) grid. The communication structure of the controller is distributed in the sense that only local and neighboring state information is needed, rather than the complete state. We derive sufficient stability conditions, which guarantee that the AC frequencies converge to the nominal frequency. Simultaneously, a global quadratic power generation cost function is minimized. The proposed controller also regulates the voltages of the MTDC grid, asymptotically minimizing a quadratic cost function of the deviations from the nominal DC voltages. The results are valid for distributed cable models of the HVDC grid (e.g. \pi-links), as well as AC systems of arbitrary number of synchronous machines, each modeled by the swing equation. We also propose a decentralized, communication-free version of the controller. The proposed controllers are tested on a high-order dynamic model of a power system consisting of asynchronous AC grids, modelled as IEEE 14 bus networks, connected through a six-terminal HVDC grid. The performance of the controller is successfully evaluated through simulation.
