In this paper, we propose observers for the dynamics of anthracnose disease described in [12]. Spatial and non spatial versions of the observers are given following an approach similar to [12]. The models given in [12] are improved in order to be more realistic. The conditions on parameters are more general. There are also changes in the equations modelling the dynamics of the berry volume (v) and the rot volume (v_r). We study theoretically the proposed observers in terms of well-posedness and convergence. We make several simulations to assess the effectiveness of observers which definitely display fairly good behaviour.
