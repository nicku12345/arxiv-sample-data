In this paper, we present a numerical scheme to solve the initial-boundary value problem for backward stochastic partial differential equations of parabolic type. Based on the Galerkin method, we approximate the original equation by a family of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs, for short), and then solve these BSDEs by the time discretization. Combining the truncation with respect to the spatial variable and the backward Euler method on time variable, we obtain the global L^2 error estimate.
