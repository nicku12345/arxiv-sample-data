We provide a monotone non increasing sequence of upper bounds f^H_k (k\ge 1) converging to the global minimum of a polynomial f on simple sets like the unit hypercube. The novelty with respect to the converging sequence of upper bounds in [J.B. Lasserre, A new look at nonnegativity on closed sets and polynomial optimization, SIAM J. Optim. 21, pp. 864--885, 2010] is that only elementary computations are required. For optimization over the hypercube, we show that the new bounds f^H_k have a rate of convergence in O(1/\sqrt {k}). Moreover we show a stronger convergence rate in O(1/k) for quadratic polynomials and more generally for polynomials having a rational minimizer in the hypercube. In comparison, evaluation of all rational grid points with denominator k produces bounds with a rate of convergence in O(1/k^2), but at the cost of O(k^n) function evaluations, while the new bound f^H_k needs only O(n^k) elementary calculations.
