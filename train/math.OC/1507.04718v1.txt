The global optimization have the very extensive applications in econometrics, science and engineering. However, the global optimization for non-convex objective functions is particularly difficult since most of the existing global optimization methods depend on the local linear search algorithms that easily traps into a local point, or the random search strategies that may frequently not produce good off-springs. According to human behavior, a one-dimensional global search method in the global optimization should adopt alternating descent and ascent (up-hill and down hill) strategies. This paper proposes the human behavior algorithms (HBA) based on alternating descent and ascent approaches along a direction or multiple different directions. Very fortunately, the proposed HBA make a global optimization method have high possibility for finding a global minimum point. Several benchmark experiments test that our HBA are highly effective for solving some benchmark optimization problems.
