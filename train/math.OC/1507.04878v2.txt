In this paper, a time-varying distributed convex optimization problem is studied for continuous-time multi-agent systems. Control algorithms are designed for the cases of single-integrator and double-integrator dynamics. Two discontinuous algorithms based on the signum function are proposed to solve the problem in each case. Then in the case of double-integrator dynamics, two continuous algorithms based on, respectively, a time-varying and a fixed boundary layer are proposed as continuous approximations of the signum function. Also, to account for inter-agent collision for physical agents, a distributed convex optimization problem with swarm tracking behavior is introduced for both single-integrator and double-integrator dynamics.
