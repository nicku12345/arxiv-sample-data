This paper studies convergence properties of optimal values and actions for discounted and average-cost Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with weakly continuous transition probabilities and applies these properties to the stochastic periodic-review inventory control problem with backorders, positive setup costs, and convex holding/backordering costs. The following results are established for MDPs with possibly noncompact action sets and unbounded cost functions: (i) convergence of value iterations to optimal values for discounted problems with possibly non-zero terminal costs, (ii) convergence of optimal finite-horizon actions to optimal infinite-horizon actions for total discounted costs, as the time horizon tends to infinity, and (iii) convergence of optimal discount-cost actions to optimal average-cost actions for infinite-horizon problems, as the discount factor tends to 1.   Being applied to the setup-cost inventory control problem, the general results on MDPs imply the optimality of (s,S) policies and convergence properties of optimal thresholds. In particular this paper analyzes the setup-cost inventory control problem without two assumptions often used in the literature: (a) the demand is either discrete or continuous or (b) the backordering cost is higher than the cost of backordered inventory if the amount of backordered inventory is large.
