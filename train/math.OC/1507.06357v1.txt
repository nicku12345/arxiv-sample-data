This paper considers the problem of temperature regulation in multicore processors by dynamic voltage-frequency scaling. We propose a feedback law that is based on an integral controller with adjustable gain, designed for fast tracking convergence in the face of model uncertainties, time-varying plants, and tight computing-timing constraints. Moreover, unlike prior works we consider a nonlinear, time-varying plant model that trades off precision for simple and efficient on-line computations. Cycle-level, full system simulator implementation and evaluation illustrates fast and accurate tracking of given temperature reference values, and compares favorably with fixed-gain controllers.
