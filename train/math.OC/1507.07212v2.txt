A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. For other OPF problems where the SDP relaxation only provides a lower bound on the objective value rather than the globally optimal decision variables, recent literature has proposed a penalization approach to find feasible points that are often nearly globally optimal. A disadvantage of this penalization approach is the need to specify penalty parameters. This paper presents an alternative approach that algorithmically determines a penalization appropriate for many OPF problems. The proposed approach constrains the generation cost to be close to the lower bound from the SDP relaxation. The objective function is specified using iteratively determined weights for a Laplacian matrix. This approach yields feasible points to the OPF problem that are guaranteed to have objective values near the global optimum due to the constraint on generation cost. The proposed approach is demonstrated on both small OPF problems and a variety of large test cases representing portions of European power systems.
