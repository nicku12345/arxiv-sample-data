In this paper, we present a generalization of the super-twisting algorithm for perturbed chains of integrators of arbitrary order. This Higher Order Super-Twisting (HOST) controller, which extends the approach of Moreno and als., is homegeneous with respect to a family of dilations and can be continuous. Its design is derived from a first result obtained for pure chains of integrators, the latter relying on a geometric condition introduced by the authors. The complete result is established using a homogeneous strict Lyapunov function which is explicitely constructed. The effectiveness of the controller is finally illustrated with simulations for a chain of integrator of order four, first pure then perturbed, where we compare the performances of two HOST controllers.
