In this paper, we study state-feedback control of Markov jump linear systems with partial information. In particular, we assume that the controller can only access the mode signals according to a hidden-Markov observation process. Our formulation generalizes various relevant cases previously studied in the literature on Markov jump linear systems, such as the cases with perfect information, no information, and cluster observations of the mode signals. In this context, we propose a Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) formulation to design feedback control laws for (stochastic) stabilization, H_2, and H_\infty control of discrete-time Markov jump linear systems under hidden-Markovian observations of the mode signals. We conclude by illustrating our results with some numerical examples.
