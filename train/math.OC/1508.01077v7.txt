In the work two ways of evolutionary interpretation of entropy model for correspondence matrix calculation are proposed. Both approaches based on the stochastic chemical kinetic evolution under the detailed balance condition. The first approach is based on the binary reactions, and the second one is based on the population games theory. Both approaches allow one to understand better possible physical interpretations of the classic model and to obtain the answers for some open questions in neighborhoods branches. For example, one can propose a selection rule to the unique equilibrium among the set of equilibriums.
