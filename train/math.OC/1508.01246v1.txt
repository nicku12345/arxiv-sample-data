Simple RLC circuit models of guitar pickups do not account for audible features that characterize the pickup. Psycho-acoustic experiments reveal that any acoustically accurate model has to reproduce the first 30 milli-seconds of the transient response with extreme precision. The proposed model is impractical for simple-minded model reduction or brute force numerical simulations yet, by focusing on modeling electromagnetic details and exposing a connection to spectral graph theory, a framework for finding the transient response to sufficient accuracy is exposed.
