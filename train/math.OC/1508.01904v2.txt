This paper deals with the robust estimation problem of a signal given noisy observations. We assume that the actual statistics of the signal and observations belong to a ball about the nominal statistics. This ball is formed by placing a bound on the Tau-divergence family between the actual and the nominal statistics. Then, the robust estimator is obtained by minimizing the mean square error according to the least favorable statistics in that ball. Therefore, we obtain a divergence family-based minimax approach to robust estimation. We show in the case that the signal and observations have no dynamics, the Bayes estimator is the optimal solution. Moreover, in the dynamic case, the optimal offline estimator is the noncausal Wiener filter.
