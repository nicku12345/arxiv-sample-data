This paper studies consensus problems for multi-agent systems defined on directed graphs where the consensus dynamics involves nonlinear and discontinuous functions. Sufficient conditions, involving the nonlinear functions and the topology of the underlying graph, for the agents to converge to consensus are provided. For a special case, namely the multi-agent system defined on a strongly connected graph with continuous functions, we show the convergence by using a port-Hamiltonian formulation.
