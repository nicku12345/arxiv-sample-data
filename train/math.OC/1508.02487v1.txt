The vertical stabilizer is the key aerodynamic surface that provides an aircraft with its directional stability characteristic while ailerons and rudder are the primary control surfaces that give pilots control authority of the yawing and banking maneuvers. Losing the vertical stabilizer will, therefore, result in the consequential loss of lateral/directional stability and control, which is likely to cause a fatal crash. In this paper, we construct a scenario of a damaged aircraft model which has no physical rudder control surface, and then a strategy based on differential thrust is proposed to be utilized as a control input to act as a "virtual" rudder to help maintain stability and control of the damaged aircraft. The H_{\infty} loop-shaping approach based robust control system design is implemented to achieve a stable and robust flight envelope, which is aimed to provide a safe landing. Investigation results demonstrate successful application of such robust differential thrust methodology as the damaged aircraft can achieve stability within feasible control limits. Finally, the robustness analysis results conclude that the stability and performance of the damaged aircraft in the presence of uncertainty remain within desirable limits, and demonstrate not only a robust, but a safe flight mission through the proposed H_{\infty} loop-shaping robust differential thrust control methodology.
