This paper provides a duality gap convergence analysis for the standard ADMM as well as a linearized version of ADMM. It is shown that under appropriate conditions, both methods achieve linear convergence. However, the standard ADMM achieves a faster accelerated convergence rate than that of the linearized ADMM. A simple numerical example is used to illustrate the difference in convergence behavior.
