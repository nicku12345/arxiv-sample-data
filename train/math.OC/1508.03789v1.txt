This dissertation presents nonlinear tracking control systems for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) under the influence of uncertainties. Assuming that there exist unstructured disturbances in the translational dynamics and the attitude dynamics, a geometric nonlinear adaptive controller is developed directly on the special Euclidean group. In particular, a new form of an adaptive control term is proposed to guarantee stability while compensating the effects of uncertainties in quadrotor dynamics. Next, we derived a coordinate-free form of equations of motion for a complete model of a quadrotor UAV with a payload which is connected via a flexible cable according to Lagrangian mechanics on a manifold. The flexible cable is modeled as a system of serially-connected links and has been considered in the full dynamic model. A geometric nonlinear control system is presented to asymptotically stabilize the position of the quadrotor while aligning the links to the vertical direction below the quadrotor. Finally, we focused on the dynamics and control of arbitrary number of quadrotor UAVs transporting a rigid body payload. The rigid body payload is connected to quadrotors via flexible cables. It is shown that a coordinate-free form of equations of motion can be derived for arbitrary numbers of quadrotors and links according to Lagrangian mechanics on a manifold. A geometric nonlinear controller is presented to transport the rigid body to a fixed desired position while aligning all of the links along the vertical direction. Numerical simulation and experimental results are presented and rigorous mathematical stability analysis are provided. These results will be particularly useful for aggressive load transportation that involves large deformation of the cable.
