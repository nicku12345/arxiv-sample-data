On a filtered probability space (\Omega ,\mathcal{F}, (\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\in[0,\infty]}, \mathbb{P}), we consider the two-player non-zero-sum stopping game u^i := \mathbb{E}[U^i(\rho,\tau)],\ i=1,2, where the first player choose a stopping strategy \rho to maximize u^1 and the second player chose a stopping strategy \tau to maximize u^2. Unlike the Dynkin game, here we assume that U(s,t) is \mathcal{F}_{s\vee t}-measurable. Assuming the continuity of U^i in (s,t), we show that there exists an \epsilon-Nash equilibrium for any \epsilon>0.
