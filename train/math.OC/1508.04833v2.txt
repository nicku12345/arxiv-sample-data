We introduce a synthetic aperture imaging framework that takes into consideration directional dependence of the reflectivity that is to be imaged, as well as its frequency dependence. We use an \ell_1 minimization approach that is coordinated with data segmentation so as to fuse information from multiple sub-apertures and frequency sub-bands. We analyze this approach from first principles and assess its performance with numerical simulations in an X-band radar regime.
