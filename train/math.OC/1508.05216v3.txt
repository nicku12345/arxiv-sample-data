This article presents a new class of distances between arbitrary nonnegative Radon measures inspired by optimal transport. These distances are defined by two equivalent alternative formulations: (i) a dynamic formulation defining the distance as a geodesic distance over the space of measures (ii) a static "Kantorovich" formulation where the distance is the minimum of an optimization problem over pairs of couplings describing the transfer (transport, creation and destruction) of mass between two measures. Both formulations are convex optimization problems, and the ability to switch from one to the other depending on the targeted application is a crucial property of our models. Of particular interest is the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric recently introduced independently by Chizat et al. and Kondratyev et al. Defined initially through a dynamic formulation, it belongs to this class of metrics and hence automatically benefits from a static Kantorovich formulation.
