Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as mathematical models evaluates the technical efficiency of Decision Making Units (DMU) having multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Researchers are interested in applying DEA models in Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) environment, but evaluation by these models is different in nature than MADM. This is why the results are not satisfactory. In this paper first, a challenging discussion is provided to indicate ranking using traditional DEA models is not reliable, and then a hybrid model using DEA and fuzzy concepts is proposed to present a self-assessment for each DMU.
