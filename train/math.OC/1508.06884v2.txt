Some important problems (e.g., in optimal transport and optimal control) have a relaxed (or weak) formulation in a space of appropriate measures whichis much easier to solve. However, an optimal solution \mu of the latter solves the former if and only if the measure \mu is supported on a "trajectory" \{(t,x(t))\colon t\in [0,T]\} for some measurable function x(t). We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on moments (\gamma\_{ij}) of a measure d\mu(x,t) on [0,1]^2 to ensure that \mu is supported on a trajectory \{(t,x(t))\colon t\in [0,1]\}. Those conditions are stated in terms of Legendre-Fourier coefficients {\mathbf f}\_j=({\mathbf f}\_j(i)) associated with some functions f\_j\colon [0,1]\to {\mathbb R}, j=1,\ldots, where each {\mathbf f}\_j is obtained from the moments \gamma\_{ji}, i=0,1,\ldots, of \mu.
