The Global Asymptotic Stability (GAS), Voltage Regulation (VR), and Power Regulation (PR) of the excitation and governor control system are of critical importance for power system security. However, simultaneously fulfilling GAS, VR, and PR has not yet been achieved. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a Lyapunov-based decentralized Control (LBC) for the excitation and governor system of multi-machine power system. A completely controllable linear system is actively constructed to design the time-derivative of the Lyapunov function and GAS is guaranteed by satisfying the condition of GAS in Lyapunov theorem. At the same time, VR and PR are performed by introducing both voltage and power to the feedback. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested and validated on a six-machine power system.
