In this paper, we prove that all H^+(Z^+)-eigenvalues of each principal sub-tensor of a strictly semi-positive tensor are positive. We define two new constants associated with H^+(Z^+)eigenvalues of a strictly semi-positive tensor. With the help of these two constants, we establish upper bounds of an important quantity whose positivity is a necessary and sufficient condition for a general tensor to be a strictly semi-positive tensor. The monotonicity and boundedness of such a quantity are established too. Furthermore, we present global error bound analysis for a class of the nonlinear complementarity problem defined by a strictly semi-positive tensor.
