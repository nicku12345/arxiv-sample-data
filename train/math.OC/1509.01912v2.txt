In this paper, we develop an extremum seeking control method integrated with iterative learning control to track a time-varying optimizer within finite time. The behavior of the extremum seeking system is analyzed via an approximating system - the modified Lie bracket system. The modified Lie bracket system is essentially an online integral-type iterative learning control law. The paper contributes to two fields, namely, iterative learning control and extremum seeking. First, an online integral type iterative learning control with a forgetting factor is proposed. Its convergence is analyzed via k-dependent (iteration- dependent) contraction mapping in a Banach space equipped with \lambda-norm. Second, the iterative learning extremum seeking system can be regarded as an iterative learning control with "control input disturbance." The tracking error of its modified Lie bracket system can be shown uniformly bounded in terms of iterations by selecting a sufficiently large frequency. Furthermore, it is shown that the tracking error will finally converge to a set, which is a \lambda-norm ball. Its center is the same with the limit solution of its corresponding "disturbance-free" system (the iterative learning control law); and its radius can be controlled by the frequency.
