This paper studies the iteration-complexity of new regularized hybrid proximal extragradient (HPE)-type methods for solving monotone inclusion problems (MIPs). The new (regularized HPE-type) methods essentially consist of instances of the standard HPE method applied to regularizations of the original MIP. It is shown that its pointwise iteration-complexity considerably improves the one of the HPE method while approaches (up to a logarithmic factor) the ergodic iteration-complexity of the latter method.
