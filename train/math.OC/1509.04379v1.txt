The objective of this paper is to study detectability, observability and related Lyapunov-type theorems of linear discrete-time time-varying stochastic systems with multiplicative noise. Some new concepts such as uniform detectability, {\cal K}^{\infty}-exact detectability (resp. {\cal K}^{WFT}-exact detectability, {\cal K}^{FT}-exact detectability, {\cal K}^{N}-exact detectability) and {\cal K}^{\infty}-exact observability (resp. {\cal K}^{WFT}-exact observability, {\cal K}^{FT}-exact observability, {\cal K}^{N}-exact observability) are introduced, respectively, and nice properties associated with uniform detectability, exact detectability and exact observability are also obtained. Moreover, some Lyapunov-type theorems associated with generalized Lyapunov equations and exponential stability in mean square sense are presented under uniform detectability, {\cal K}^{N}-exact observability and {\cal K}^{N}-exact detectability, respectively.
