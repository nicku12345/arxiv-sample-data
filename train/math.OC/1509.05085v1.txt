In the past three years, many researchers have proven and/or employed some Wirtinger-type integral inequalities to establish less conservative stability criteria for delayed continu\-ous-time systems. In this present paper, we will investigate weighted orthogonal polynomials-based integral inequalities which is a generalization of the existing Jensen's inequalities and Wirtinger-type integral inequalities.
