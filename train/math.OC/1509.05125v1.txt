We consider a family of parallel methods for constrained optimization based on projected gradient descents along individual coordinate directions. In the case of polyhedral feasible sets, local convergence towards a regular solution occurs unconstrained in a reduced space, allowing for the computation of tight asymptotic convergence rates by sensitivity analysis, this even when global convergence rates are unavailable or too conservative. We derive linear asymptotic rates of convergence in polyhedra for variants of the coordinate descent approach, including cyclic, synchronous, and random modes of implementation. Our results find application in stochastic optimization, and with recently proposed optimization algorithms based on Taylor approximations of the Newton step.
