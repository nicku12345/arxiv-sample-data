The admissible positional control problem for the canonical system with geometrical restrictions on the control is considered. The investigation is performed with the help of the controllability function method. We obtain controllability functions which are the time of motion from an arbitrary initial condition to the origin. We also reveal a set of controls which solves this problem.
