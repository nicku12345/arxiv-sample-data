Many Ore Reserves are harvested by a combination of open pit and underground mining methods. In these cases there is often material that could be mined by either method, and a choice has to be made. The area containing this material is referred to as the transition zone. Deciding where to finish the open pit and start the underground is referred to as the transition problem and it has received some attention in the literature since the 1980s.   In this paper we provide a review of existing approaches to the transition problem encompassing: graph-theory based optimisation employing an opportunity cost approach; heuristics and integer programming. We also present a novel opportunity cost approach, allowing it to take into account a crown pillar, and show how the new approach can be best applied through the unconventional application of an existing mine optimisation tool.
