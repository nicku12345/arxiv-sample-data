In this short note, we recover by a different method the new result due to Attouch, Peyrouqet and Redont concerning the weak convergence as t\rightarrow+\infty of solutions x(t) to the second order differential equation \[ x^{\prime\prime}(t)+\frac{K}{t}x^{\prime}(t)+\nabla\Phi(x(t))=0, \] where K>3 and \Phi is a smooth convex function defined on an Hilbert Space \mathcal{H}. Moreover, we improve slightly their result on the rate of convergence of \Phi(x(t))-\min\Phi.
