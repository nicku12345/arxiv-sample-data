We consider the stability of Robust Optimization problems with respect to perturbations in their uncertainty sets. We focus on Linear Optimization problems, including those with a possibly infinite number of constraints, also known as Linear Semi-Infinite Optimization (LSIO) problems, and consider uncertainty in both the cost function and constraints. We prove Lipschitz continuity of the optimal value and {\epsilon}-approximate optimal solution set with respect to the Hausdorff distance between uncertainty sets and with an explicit Lipschitz constant that can be calculated. In addition, we prove closedness and upper semi-continuity for the optimal solution set mapping with respect to the uncertainty set.
