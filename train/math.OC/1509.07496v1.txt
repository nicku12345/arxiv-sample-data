Positive bases, which play a key role in understanding derivative free optimization methods that use a direct search framework, are positive spanning sets that are positively linearly independent. The cardinality of a positive basis in \R^n has been established to be between n+1 and 2n (with both extremes existing). The lower bound is immediate from being a positive spanning set, while the upper bound uses {\em both} positive spanning and positively linearly independent. In this note, we provide details proving that a positively linearly independent set in \R^n for n \in \{1, 2\} has at most 2n elements, but a positively linearly independent set in \R^n for n\geq 3 can have an arbitrary number of elements.
