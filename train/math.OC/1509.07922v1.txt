This paper presents a novel method to synthesize stochastic control Lyapunov functions for a class of nonlinear, stochastic control systems. In this work, the classical nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation is transformed into a linear partial differential equation for a class of systems with a particular constraint on the stochastic disturbance. It is shown that this linear partial differential equation can be relaxed to a linear differential inclusion, allowing for approximating polynomial solutions to be generated using sum of squares programming. It is shown that the resulting solutions are stochastic control Lyapunov functions with a number of compelling properties. In particular, a-priori bounds on trajectory suboptimality are shown for these approximate value functions. The result is a technique whereby approximate solutions may be computed with non-increasing error via a hierarchy of semidefinite optimization problems.
