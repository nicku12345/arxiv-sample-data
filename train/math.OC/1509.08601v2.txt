We compare surface metrics for shape optimization problems with constraints, consisting mainly of partial differential equations (PDE), from a computational point of view. In particular, classical Laplace-Beltrami type based metrics are compared with Steklov-Poincar\'e type metrics. The test problem is the minimization of energy dissipation of a body in a Stokes flow. We therefore set up a quasi-Newton method on appropriate shape manifolds together with an augmented Lagrangian framework, in order to enable a straightforward integration of geometric constraints for the shape. The comparison is focussed towards convergence behavior as well as effects on the mesh quality during shape optimization.
