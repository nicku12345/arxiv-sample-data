In a classic model analysed by Weitzman an agent is presented with boxes containing prizes. She may open boxes in any order, discover prizes within, and optimally stop. She wishes to maximize the expected value of the greatest prize found, minus costs of opening boxes. The problem is solved by a so-called Pandora's rule, and has applications to searching for a house or job. However, this does not model the problem of a student who searches for the subject to choose as her major and benefits from all courses she takes while searching.   So motivated, we ask whether there are any problems for which a generalized Pandora's rule is optimal when the objective is a more general function of all the discovered prizes. We show that if a generalized Pandora's rule is optimal for all specifications of costs and prize distributions, then the objective function must take a special form. We also explain how the Gittins index theorem can be applied to an equivalent multi-armed bandit problem to prove optimality of Pandora's rule for the student's problem. However, we also show that there do exist some problems which are not of multi-armed bandit type for which Pandora's rule is optimal.
