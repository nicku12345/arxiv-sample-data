This paper proposes a new methodology to maximize the feasible set of power injections and cross-border power transfers in meshed multi-area power systems. The approach used polyhedral computation schemes and is an extension to the classic procedure for cross-border transfer capacity assessment in the European power network, including the computation of bilateral cross-border transfer capacities as well as multilateral flow-based approaches. The focus is the characterization of inter-area exchange limits required for secure power system operation in the presence of physical transmission constraints, while maximizing the utilization factors of the transmission lines. The numerical examples include a case study of the ENTSO-E transmission system.
