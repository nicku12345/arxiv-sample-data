This paper is addressed to establishing an internal observability estimate for some linear stochastic hyperbolic equations. The key is to establish a new global Carleman estimate for forward stochastic hyperbolic equations in the L^2-space. Different from the deterministic case, a delicate analysis of the adaptedness for some stochastic processes is required in the stochastic setting.
