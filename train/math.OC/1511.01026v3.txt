We study the properties of sets \Sigma having the minimal length (one-dimensional Hausdorff measure) over the class of closed connected sets \Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^2 satisfying the inequality \mbox{max}_{y \in M} \mbox{dist}(y,\Sigma) \leq r for a given compact set M \subset \mathbb{R}^2 and some given r > 0. Such sets can be considered shortest possible pipelines arriving at a distance at most r to every point of M which in this case is considered as the set of customers of the pipeline.   We prove the conjecture of Miranda, Paolini and Stepanov about the set of minimizers for M a circumference of radius R>0 for the case when r < R/4.98. Moreover we show that when M is a boundary of a smooth convex set with minimal radius of curvature R, then every minimizer \Sigma has similar structure for r < R/5. Additionaly we prove a similar statement for local minimizers.
