This paper presents the full dynamics and control of arbitrary number of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) transporting a rigid body. The rigid body is connected to the quadrotors via flexible cables where each flexible cable is modeled as a system of arbitrary number of serially connected links. It is shown that a coordinate-free form of equations of motion can be derived for the complete model without any simplicity assumptions that commonly appear in other literature, according to Lagrangian mechanics on a manifold. A geometric nonlinear controller is presented to transport the rigid body to a fixed desired position while aligning all of the links along the vertical direction. A rigorous mathematical stability proof is given and the desirable features of the proposed controller are illustrated by numerical examples and experimental results.
