In this paper, we introduce two parallel extragradient-proximal methods for solving split equilibrium problems. The algorithms combine the extragradient method, the proximal method and the hybrid (outer approximation) method. The weak and strong convergence theorems for iterative sequences generated by the algorithms are established under widely used assumptions for equilibrium bifunctions.
