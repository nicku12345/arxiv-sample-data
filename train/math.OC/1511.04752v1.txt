This paper reviews stability analysis techniques by using the Nyquist and Nichols charts. The relationship between the Nyquist and Nichols stability criteria is fully described by using the crossing concept. The results are demonstrated through several numerical examples. This tutorial provides useful insights into the loop-shaping based control systems design such as Quantitative Feedback Theory.
