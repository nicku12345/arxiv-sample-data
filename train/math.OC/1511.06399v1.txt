The increasing integration of wind generation has brought great challenges to small-signal stability analysis of bulk power systems, since the volatility and uncertainty nature of wind generation may considerably affect equilibriums of the systems. In this regard, this paper develops a conceptual framework to depict the influence of uncertain wind power injections (WPIs) on small-signal stability of bulk power systems. To do this, a new concept, the admissible region of uncertain wind generation considering small-signal stability (SSAR) is introduced to geometrically measure how much uncertain wind generation can be accommodated by a bulk power system without breaking its small-signal stability. As a generalization of the traditional concept of the small-signal stability region (SSSR), SSAR is derived by extending the SSSR to a higher-dimensional injection space that incorporates both the conventional nodal generation injections and the WPIs, and then mapping it onto the lower-dimensional WPI space. Case studies on the modified New England 39-bus system with multiple wind farms illustrate the SSAR concept and its potential applications.
