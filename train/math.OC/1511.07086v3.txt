This paper presents a novel neighboring extremal approach to establish the neighboring optimal guidance (NOG) strategy for fixed-time low-thrust multi-burn orbital transfer problems. Unlike the classical variational methods which define and solve an accessory minimum problem (AMP) to design the NOG, the core of the proposed method is to construct a parameterized family of neighboring extremals around a nominal one. A geometric analysis on the projection behavior of the parameterized neighboring extremals shows that it is impossible to establish the NOG unless not only the typical Jacobi condition (JC) between switching times but also a transversal condition (TC) at each switching time is satisfied. According to the theory of field of extremals, the JC and the TC, once satisfied, are also sufficient to ensure a multi-burn extremal trajectory to be locally optimal. Then, through deriving the first-order Taylor expansion of the parameterized neighboring extremals, the neighboring optimal feedbacks on thrust direction and switching times are obtained. Finally, to verify the development of this paper, a fixed-time low-thrust fuel-optimal orbital transfer problem is calculated.
