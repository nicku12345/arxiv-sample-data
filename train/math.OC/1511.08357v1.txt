In this paper we give a new approach to introduce switching strategies in a special class of optimal multiprocesses. Defined as the set of partitions of the time interval, switching strategies become the character of a classical control. With this approach we overcome the restrictive comparison of multiprocesses with the same switching strategy. The necessary conditions for strong local optimizer in form of the Pontryagin maximum principle are demonstrated in illustrative examples.
