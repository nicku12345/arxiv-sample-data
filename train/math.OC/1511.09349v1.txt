We analyze why low-speed sensorless control of the IM is intrinsically difficult, and what is gained by signal injection. The explanation relies on the control-theoretic concept of observability applied to a general model of the saturated IM. We show that the IM is not observable when the stator speed is zero in the absence of signal injection, but that observability is restored thanks to signal injection and magnetic saturation. The analysis also reveals that existing sensorless algorithms based on signal injection may perform poorly for some IMs under particular operating conditions. The approach is illustrated by simulations and experimental data.
