The methods are proposed for evaluation of complex dynamical systems, choice of their optimal operating modes, determination of optimal operating system from given class of equivalent systems, system's timeline behaviour analysis on the basis of versatile multicriteria and multilevel analysis of behaviour of system's elements.
