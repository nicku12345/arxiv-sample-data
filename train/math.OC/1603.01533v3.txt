In this paper, we publish nine new test cases in MATPOWER format. Four test cases are French very high-voltage grid generated by the offline plateform of iTesla: part of the data was sampled. Four test cases are RTE snapshots of the full French very high-voltage and high-voltage grid that come from French SCADAs via the Convergence software. The ninth and largest test case is a pan-European ficticious data set that stems from the PEGASE project. It complements the four PEGASE test cases that we previously published in MATPOWER version 5.1 in March 2015. We also provide a MATLAB code to transform the data into standard mathematical optimization format. Computational results confirming the validity of the data are presented in this paper.
