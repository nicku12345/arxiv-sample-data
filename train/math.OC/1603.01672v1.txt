This paper considers the problem of optimally balancing motion energy and communication transmission energy of a mobile robot tasked with transmitting a given number of data bits to a remote station, while navigating to a prespecified destination in a given amount of time. The problem is cast in the setting of optimal control, where the robot has to choose its path, acceleration, and transmission rate along the path so as to minimize its energy required for transmission and motion, while satisfying various power and communication constraints. We use realistic models for the robot's channel estimation, motion dynamics, and power and energy costs. The main contribution of the paper is to show how to co-optimize robot's path along with other communication and motion variables. Two versions of the problem are solved: the first is defined offline by assuming that all the channel measurements are taken before the robots starts moving, while in the second the channel estimation is updated while the robot is in motion, and hence it is solved online. In both cases we utilize an in-house algorithm that computes near-optimal solutions in little time, which enables its use in the online setting. The optimization strategy is described in detail and validated by simulation of realistic scenarios.
