In this paper, we propose two parallel extragradient - viscosity methods for finding a particular element in the common solution set of a system of equilibrium problems and finitely many fixed point problems. This particular point is the unique solution of a variational inequality problem on the common solution set. The main idea of the paper is to combine three methods including the extragradient method, the Mann iteration method, the hybrid steepest-descent method with the parallel splitting-up technique to design the algorithms which improve the performance over some existing methods. The strongly convergent theorems are established under the widely used assumptions for equilibrium bifunctions.
