We study infinite horizon discounted-cost and ergodic-cost risk-sensitive zero-sum stochastic games for controlled continuous time Markov chains on a countable state space. For the discounted-cost game we prove the existence of value and saddle-point equilibrium in the class of Markov strategies under nominal conditions. For the ergodic-cost game we prove the existence of values and saddle point equilibrium by studying the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation under a certain Lyapunov condition.
