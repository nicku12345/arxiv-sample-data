This paper answers the question if a qualitatively heterogeneous passive networked system containing damped and undamped nodes shows consensus in the output of the nodes in the long run. While a standard Lyapunov analysis shows that the damped nodes will always converge to a steady-state value, the convergence of the undamped nodes is much more delicate and depends on the parameter values of the network as well as on the topology of the graph. A complete stability analysis is presented based on an eigenvector analysis involving the mass values and the topology of both the original graph and the reduced graph obtained by a Kron reduction that eliminates the damped nodes.
