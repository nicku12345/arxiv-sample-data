In this paper, we propose a self-triggered formulation of Model Predictive Control for continuous-time nonlinear input-affine networked control systems. Our control method specifies not only when to execute control tasks but also provides a way to discretize the optimal control trajectory into several control samples, so that the reduction of communication load will be obtained. Stability analysis under the sample-and-hold implementation is also given, which guarantees that the state converges to a terminal region where the system can be stabilized by a local state feedback controller. Some simulation examples validate our proposed framework.
