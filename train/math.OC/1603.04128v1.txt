We consider the problem of controlling the movement of multiple cooperating agents so as to minimize an uncertainty metric associated with a finite number of targets. In a one-dimensional mission space, we adopt an optimal control framework and show that the solution is reduced to a simpler parametric optimization problem: determining a sequence of locations where each agent may dwell for a finite amount of time and then switch direction. This amounts to a hybrid system which we analyze using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) to obtain a complete on-line solution through an event-driven gradient-based algorithm which is also robust with respect to the uncertainty model used. The resulting controller depends on observing the events required to excite the gradient-based algorithm, which cannot be guaranteed. We solve this problem by proposing a new metric for the objective function which creates a potential field guaranteeing that gradient values are non-zero. This approach is compared to an alternative graph-based task scheduling algorithm for determining an optimal sequence of target visits. Simulation examples are included to demonstrate the proposed methods.
