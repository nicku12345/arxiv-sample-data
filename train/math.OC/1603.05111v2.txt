Let n \geq 5 and let u^1,\dots,u^n be nonnegative real n-vectors such that the indices of their positive elements form the sets \{1,2,\dots,n-2\},\{2,3,\dots,n-1\},\dots,\{n,1,\dots,n-3\}, respectively. Here each index set is obtained from the previous one by a circular shift. The set of copositive forms which vanish on the vectors u^1,\dots,u^n is a face of the copositive cone {\cal C}^n. We give an explicit semi-definite description of this face and of its subface consisting of positive semi-definite forms, and study their properties. If the vectors u^1,\dots,u^n and their positive multiples exhaust the zero set of an exceptional copositive form belonging to this face, then we say it has minimal circulant zero support set, and otherwise non-minimal circulant zero support set. We show that forms with non-minimal circulant zero support set are always extremal, and forms with minimal circulant zero support sets can be extremal only if n is odd. We construct explicit examples of extremal forms with non-minimal circulant zero support set for any order n \geq 5, and examples of extremal forms with minimal circulant zero support set for any odd order n \geq 5. The set of all forms with non-minimal circulant zero support set, i.e., defined by different collections u^1,\dots,u^n of zeros, is a submanifold of codimension 2n, the set of all forms with minimal circulant zero support set a submanifold of codimension n.
