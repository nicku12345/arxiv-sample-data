This paper deals with the problem of string stability of interconnected systems with double-integrator open loop dynamics (e.g.~acceleration-controlled vehicles). We analyze an asymmetric bidirectional linear controller, where each vehicle is coupled solely to its immediate predecessor and to its immediate follower with different gains in these two directions. We show that in this setting, unlike with unidirectional or symmetric bidirectional controllers, string stability can be recovered when disturbances act only on a small (N-independent) set of leading vehicles. This improves existing results from the literature with this assumption. We also indicate that string stability with respect to arbitrarily distributed disturbances cannot be achieved with this controller.
