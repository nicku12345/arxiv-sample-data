In this paper, we consider the second-order cone tensor eigenvalue complementarity problem (SOCTEiCP) and present three different reformulations to the model under consideration. Specifically, for the general SOCTEiCP, we first show its equivalence to a particular variational inequality under reasonable conditions. A notable benefit is that such a reformulation possibly provides an efficient way for the study of properties of the problem. Then, for the symmetric and sub-symmetric SOCTEiCPs, we reformulate them as appropriate nonlinear programming problems, which are extremely beneficial for designing reliable solvers to find solutions of the considered problem. Finally, we report some preliminary numerical results to verify our theoretical results.
