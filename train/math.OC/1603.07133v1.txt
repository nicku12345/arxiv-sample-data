We study possibilities to control an ensemble (a parameterized family) of nonlinear control systems by a single parameter-independent control. Proceeding by Lie algebraic methods we establish genericity of exact controllability property for finite ensembles, prove sufficient approximate controllability condition for a model problem in \mathbb{R}^3, and provide a variant of Rashevsky-Chow theorem for approximate controllability of control-linear ensembles.
