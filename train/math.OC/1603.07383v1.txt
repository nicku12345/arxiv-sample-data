This paper addresses distributed average tracking of physical second-order agents with nonlinear dynamics, where the interaction among the agents is described by an undirected graph. In both agents' and reference inputs' dynamics, there is a nonlinear term that satisfying the Lipschitz-type condition. To achieve the distributed average tracking problem in the presence of nonlinear term, a non-smooth filter and a control input are designed for each agent. The idea is that each filter outputs converge to the average of the reference inputs and the reference velocities asymptotically and in parallel each agent's position and velocity are driven to track its filter outputs. To overcome the nonlinear term unboundedness effect, novel state-dependent time varying gains are employed in each agent's filter and control input. In the proposed algorithm, each agent needs its neighbors' filters outputs besides its own filter outputs, absolute position and absolute velocity and its neighbors' reference inputs and reference velocities. Finally, the algorithm is simplified to achieve the distributed average tracking of physical second-order agents in the presence of an unknown bounded term in both agents' and reference inputs' dynamics.
