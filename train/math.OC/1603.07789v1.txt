A notion of L^p-exact controllability is introduced for linear controlled (forward) stochastic differential equations, for which several sufficient conditions are established. Further, it is proved that the L^p-exact controllability, the validity of an observability inequality for the adjoint equation, the solvability of an optimization problem, and the solvability of an L^p-type norm optimal control problem are all equivalent.
