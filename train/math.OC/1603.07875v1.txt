To avoid simultaneous charging and discharging of storages, complementarity constraints are introduced to storage-concerned economic dispatch (ED), which makes the problem non-convex. This letter concerns the conditions under which the convex relaxation of storage-concerned ED with complementarity constraints is exact. Two new sufficient conditions are proposed, proved and verified to significantly reduce the conservatism of recent results [3], [4].
