We address a specific but recurring problem related to sampled linear systems. In particular, we provide a numerical method for the rigorous verification of constraint satisfaction for linear continuous-time systems between sampling instances. The proposed algorithm combines elements of classical branch and bound schemes from global optimization with a recently published procedure to bound the exponential of interval matrices.
