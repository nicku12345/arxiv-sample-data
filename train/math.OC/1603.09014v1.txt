We consider the assortment optimization problem with disjoint-cardinality constraints under two-level nested logit model. To solve this problem, we first identify a candidate set with O(mn^2) assortments and show that at least one optimal assortment is included in this set. Based on this observation, a fast algorithm, which runs in O(m n^2 \log mn) time, is proposed to find an optimal assortment.
