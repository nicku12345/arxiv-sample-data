This paper presents a hybrid attitude and gyro-bias observer designed directly on the Special Orthogonal group SO(3). The proposed hybrid observer, relying on a hysteresis-based switching between two configurations, guarantees global exponential stability using biased angular velocity and inertial vector measurements. Simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed observer.
