The intention of this note is two-fold. First, we study integer optimization problems in standard form defined by A \in\mathbb{Z}^{m\times{}n} and present an algorithm to solve such problems in polynomial-time provided that both the largest absolute value of an entry in A and m are constant. Then, this is applied to solve integer programs in inequality form in polynomial-time, where the absolute values of all maximal sub-determinants of A lie between 1 and a constant.
