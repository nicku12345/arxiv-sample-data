We consider a type of optimal switching problems with non-uniform execution delays and ramping. Such problems frequently occur in the operation of economical and engineering systems. We first provide a solution to the problem by applying a probabilistic method. The main contribution is, however, a scheme for approximating the optimal control by limiting the information in the state-feedback. In a numerical example the approximation routine gives a considerable computational performance enhancement, when compared to a conventional algorithm.
