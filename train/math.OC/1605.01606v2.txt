In this paper, we consider the event-triggered cooperative robust practical output regulation problem for a class of linear minimum-phase multi-agent systems. We first convert our problem into the cooperative robust practical stabilization problem of a well defined augmented system Based on the distributed internal model approach. Then, we design a distributed event-triggered output feedback control law together with a distributed output-based event-triggered mechanism to stabilize the augmented system, which leads to the solvability of the cooperative robust practical output regulation problem of the original plant. Our distributed control law can be directly implemented in a digital platform provided that the distributed triggering mechanism can monitor the continuous-time output information from neighboring agents. Finally, we illustrate our design by an example.
