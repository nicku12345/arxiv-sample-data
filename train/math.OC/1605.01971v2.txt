We suggest an adaptive version of a partial linearization method for composite optimization problems. The goal function is the sum of a smooth function and a non necessary smooth convex separable function, whereas the feasible set is the corresponding Cartesian product. The method consists in selective component-wise steps together with a special control of a tolerance sequence. This technique is destined to reduce the computational expenses per iteration and maintain the basic convergence properties. We also establish its convergence rates and describe some examples of applications. Preliminary results of computations illustrate usefulness of the new method.
