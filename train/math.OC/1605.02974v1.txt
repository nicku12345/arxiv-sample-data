Determining a stability domain, i.e. a set of equilibria for which a dynamical system remains stable, is a core problem in control. When dealing with controlled systems, the problem is generally transformed into a robustness analysis problem: considering a set of uncertain parameters (generally chosen as polytopic), one seeks for guaranties that the system remains stable for this given set or some dilatation or contraction of this set. Thanks to the development of formal methods based on continuation, another approach is proposed in this paper to determine the border of the stability domain. The proposed developments were made with MatCont, a package to be used with Matlab, and the considered system is a 3-cable robot with linear PD and PID controllers.
