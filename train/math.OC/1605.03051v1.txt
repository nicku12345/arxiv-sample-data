In this paper, we study the existence of solutions for generalized vector quasi-equilibrium problems. Firstly, we prove that in the case of Banach spaces, the assumptions of continuity over correspondences can be weakened. The theoretical analysis is based on fixed-point theorems. Secondly, we establish new equilibrium theorems as applications of the KKM principle.
