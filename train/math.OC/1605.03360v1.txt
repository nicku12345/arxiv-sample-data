This paper reviews several uses of harmonic information in the synthesis of mechanisms and shows that such information can be put to even greater use in this field. Results are presented for both single and multi-degree of freedom systems which support this claim. In both cases, the inclusion of harmonic information into the objective function aids the search to locate high quality solutions.
