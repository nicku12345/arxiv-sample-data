This paper presents a brief description of the Tabu Search method and shows how it can be applied to two different power transmission systems. Examples are presented from two transmission systems. In the first example a mechanical transmission system is considered. A four bar mechanism is synthesised in order to produce a desired output motion. The second example is a hydrostatic transmission operating under closed loop control in order to maintain a constant operating speed as the loading conditions change.
