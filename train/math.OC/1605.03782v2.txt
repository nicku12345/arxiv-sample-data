Bilevel optimization has been widely used in decision-making process. However, there still lacks an efficient algorithm to determine an optimal solution of a bilevel optimization problem, especially for a large-size problem. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes an efficient decomposition algorithm for a general bilevel linear programming(GBLP). The simulation results on large-size testing system demonstrate its correctness and efficiency.
