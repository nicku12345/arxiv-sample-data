The paper develops a method for model reduction of bilinear control systems. It leans upon the observation that the input-output map of a bilinear system has a particularly simple Fliess series expansion. Subsequently, a model reduction algorithm is formulated such that the coefficients of Fliess series expansion for the original and reduced systems match up to certain predefined sets - nice selections. Algorithms for computing matrix representations of unobservability and reachability spaces complying with a nice selection are provided. Subsequently, they are used for calculating a partial realization of a given input-output map.
