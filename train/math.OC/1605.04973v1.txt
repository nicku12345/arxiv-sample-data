In this work, we consider the output tracking and disturbance rejection problems of a mono-tubular heat exchanger process and a novel finite-dimensional output feedback regulator is developed. In the proposed output feedback regulator design, measurements available for the regulator do not belong to the set of controlled outputs. In other words, design emphasizes that other than controlled output is used as input signal to the regulator. The proposed output feedback regulator with only plant measurement ym(t) can realize the exosystem state estimation, disturbance rejection and reference signal tracking, simultaneously. Finally, the results are demonstrated by a mono-tubular heat exchanger process with specific parameters via the computer simulation.
