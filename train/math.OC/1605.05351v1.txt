This paper is aimed at presenting a systematic survey of the existing now different formulations for the problem of projection of the origin of the Euclidean space onto the convex polyhedron (PPOCP). In the present paper, there are investigated the reduction of the projection program to the problems of quadratic programming, maximin, linear complementarity, and nonnegative least squares. Such reduction justifies the opportunity of utilizing a much more broad spectrum of powerful tools of mathematical programming for solving PPOCP.   The paper's goal is to draw the attention of a wide range of research at the different formulations of the projection problem, which remain largely unknown due to the fact that the papers (addressing the subject of concern) are published even though on the adjacent, but other topics, or only in the conference proceedings.
