This paper is the first part of a two-part series in which we present results from an experimental demonstration of frequency regulation in a commercial building test facility.   In Part I, we introduce the test facility and develop relevant building models. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical controller that consists of three levels: a reserve scheduler, a building climate controller, and a fan speed controller for frequency regulation. We formulate the reserve scheduler as a robust optimization problem and introduce several approximations to reduce its complexity. The building climate controller is comprised of a robust model predictive controller and a Kalman filter. The frequency regulation controller consists of a feedback and a feedforward loop, provides fast responses, and is stable.   Part I presents building model identification and controller tuning results, whereas Part II reports results from the operation of the hierarchical controller under frequency regulation.
