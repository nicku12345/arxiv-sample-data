This paper presents a solution to the rendezvous control problem for a network of kinematic unicycles in the plane, each equipped with an onboard camera measuring its relative displacement with respect to its neighbors in body frame coordinates. A smooth, time-independent control law is presented that drives the unicycles to a common position from arbitrary initial conditions, under the assumption that the sensing digraph contains a reverse-directed spanning tree. The proposed feedback is very simple, and relies only on the onboard measurements. No global positioning system is required, nor any information about the unicycles' orientations.
