We propose a new image restoration model based on the minimized surface regularization. The proposed model closely relates to the classical smoothing ROF model \cite{4}. We can reformulate the proposed model as a min-max problem and solve it using the primal dual method. Relying on the convex conjugate, the convergence of the algorithm is provided as well. Numerical implementations mainly emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it to other well-known methods in terms of the CPU time and restored quality
