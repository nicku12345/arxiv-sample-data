We propose a novel frequency control approach in between centralized and distributed architectures, that is a continuous-time feedback control version of the dual decomposition optimization method. Specifically, a convex combination of the frequency measurements is centrally aggregated, followed by an integral control and a broadcast signal, which is then optimally allocated at local generation units. We show that our gather-and-broadcast control architecture comprises many previously proposed strategies as special cases. We prove local asymptotic stability of the closed-loop equilibria of the considered power system model, which is a nonlinear differential-algebraic system that includes traditional generators, frequency-responsive devices, as well as passive loads, where the sources are already equipped with primary droop control. Our feedback control is designed such that the closed-loop equilibria of the power system solve the optimal economic dispatch problem.
