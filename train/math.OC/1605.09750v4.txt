This paper is concerned with optimal control problems for parabolic partial differential equations with pointwise in time switching constraints on the control. A standard approach to treat constraints in nonlinear optimization is penalization, in particular using L^1-type norms. Applying this approach to the switching constraint leads to a nonsmooth and nonconvex infinite-dimensional minimization problem which is challenging both analytically and numerically. Adding H^1 regularization or restricting to a finite-dimensional control space allows showing existence of optimal controls. First-order necessary optimality conditions are then derived using tools of nonsmooth analysis. Their solution can be computed using a combination of Moreau-Yosida regularization and a semismooth Newton method. Numerical examples illustrate the properties of this approach.
