This paper reveals that a common and central role, played in many error bound (EB) conditions and a variety of gradient-type methods, is a residual measure operator. On one hand, by linking this operator with other optimality measures, we define a group of abstract EB conditions, and then analyze the interplay between them; on the other hand, by using this operator as an ascent direction, we propose an abstract gradient-type method, and then derive EB conditions that are necessary and sufficient for its linear convergence. The former provides a unified framework that not only allows us to find new connections between many existing EB conditions, but also paves a way to construct new EB conditions. The latter allows us to claim the weakest conditions guaranteeing linear convergence for a number of fundamental algorithms, including the gradient method, the proximal point algorithm, and the forward-backward splitting algorithm. In addition, we show linear convergence for the proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm under a group of equivalent EB conditions, which are strictly weaker than the traditional strongly convex condition. Moreover, by defining a new EB condition, we show Q-linear convergence of Nesterov's accelerated forward-backward algorithm without strong convexity. Finally, we verify EB conditions for a class of dual objective functions.
