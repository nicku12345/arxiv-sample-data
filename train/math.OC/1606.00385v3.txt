In this paper, we study cut generating functions for conic sets. Our first main result shows that if the conic set is bounded, then cut generating functions for integer linear programs can easily be adapted to give the integer hull of the conic integer program. Then we introduce a new class of cut generating functions which are non-decreasing with respect to second-order cone. We show that, under some minor technical conditions, these functions together with integer linear programming-based functions are sufficient to yield the integer hull of intersections of conic sections in \mathbb{R}^2.
