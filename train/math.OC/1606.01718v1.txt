In the present work, we present numerical results for an iterative method for solving an optimal control problem with inequality contraints. The method is based on generalized Bregman distances. Under a combination of a source condition and a regularity condition on the active sets convergence results are presented. Furthermore we show by numerical examples that the provided a-priori estimate is sharp in the bang-bang case.
