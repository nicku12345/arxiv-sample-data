Control of chaotic systems to given targets is a subject of substantial and well-developed research issue in nonlinear science, which can be formulated as a class of multi-modal constrained numerical optimization problem with multi-dimensional decision variables. This investigation elucidates the feasibility of applying a novel population-based metaheuristics labelled here as Teaching-learning-based optimization to direct the orbits of discrete chaotic dynamical systems towards the desired target region. Several consecutive control steps of small bounded perturbations are made in the Teaching-learning-based optimization strategy to direct the chaotic series towards the optimal neighborhood of the desired target rapidly, where a conventional controller is effective for chaos control. Working with the dynamics of the well-known Henon as well as Ushio discrete chaotic systems, we assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the Teaching-learning-based optimization based optimal control technique, meanwhile the impacts of the core parameters on performances are also discussed. Furthermore, possible engineering applications of directing chaotic orbits are discussed.
