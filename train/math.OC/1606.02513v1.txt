We consider the multiphase shape optimization problem \min\Big\{\sum_{i=1}^h\lambda_1(\Omega_i)+\alpha|\Omega_i|:\ \Omega_i\ \hbox{open},\ \Omega_i\subset D,\ \Omega_i\cap\Omega_j=\emptyset\Big\}, where \alpha>0 is a given constant and  D\subset\Bbb{R}^2 is a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary. We give some new results concerning the qualitative properties of the optimal sets and the regularity of the corresponding eigenfunctions. We also provide numerical results for the optimal partitions.
