We study partitions on three dimensional manifolds which minimize the total geodesic perimeter. We propose a relaxed framework based on a \Gamma-convergence result and we show some numerical results. We compare our results to those already present in the literature in the case of the sphere. For general surfaces we provide an optimization algorithm on meshes which can give a good approximation of the optimal cost, starting from the results obtained using the relaxed formulation.
