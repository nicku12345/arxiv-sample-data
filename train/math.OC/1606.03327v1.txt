The notion of zero dynamics is a cornerstone of many solutions to important control problems such as feedback linearisation and disturbance decoupling. For a SISO affine control system with relative degree strictly less than the order of the system, it is known that there exists a state transformation and a feedback transformation such that the system can be transformed to a linear system. Making use of the fibre bundle structure induced by the state transformation we show that it is possible to define a connection on the state manifold such that the zero dynamics can be defined as a vertical vector field. In this formalism the zero dynamics can be understood as motions along the fibres of a fibre bundle.
