The paradigm of Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) is becoming rather popular in the control systems research community because of its expressive power able to properly handle many engineered complex systems of interest. Decentralized control techniques offer a promising approach in taming the inherent complexity of CPSoS, also connected with the design of needed communication infrastructures and computing units. In this paper, we propose decentralized control of networks of discrete-time nonlinear control systems, enforcing complex specifications expressed in terms of regular languages, within any desired accuracy. As discussed in the paper, regular languages, while being traditionally studied in the research community of discrete-event systems, also provide a useful mean to model a rather wide variety of complex specifications for control systems. The design of decentralized controllers is based on formal methods and in particular, on the use of discrete abstractions. Efficient synthesis of such controllers is derived by resorting to on-the-fly algorithmic techniques that also allow the use of parallel computing architectures. Advantages and disadvantages of the decentralized approach over a centralized one, also in terms of computational complexity, are discussed. An illustrative example is presented, which shows the applicability and effectiveness of the results proposed.
