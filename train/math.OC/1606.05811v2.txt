Split rank of a rational polyhedron is finite. The well known proof of this is based on the fact that split closure is stronger than the Chv\'{a}tal closure, and the Chv\'{a}tal rank of a rational polyhedron is finite due to the result of Chv\'{a}tal and Schrijver. In this note we provide an independent proof for the fact that every rational polyhedron has finite split rank. In principal, we construct a nonnegative potential function which decreases by at least one with "every" second split closure unless the integer hull of the polyhedron is reached.
