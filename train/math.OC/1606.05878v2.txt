We study the problem of optimizing the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplace operator under perimeter constraint. We prove that optimal sets are analytic outside a closed singular set of dimension at most d-8 by writing a general optimality condition in the case the optimal eigenvalue is multiple. As a consequence we find that the optimal k-th eigenvalue is strictly smaller than the optimal (k+1)-th eigenvalue. We also provide an elliptic regularity result for sets with positive and bounded weak curvature.
