We revisit the nonlinear complimentary filter on SO(3), previously proposed in the literature, and provide the (time-explicit) solution to the matrix ODE governing the attitude estimation error in the absence of measurement errors. The stability and performance properties of this filter can be easily deduced from the obtained closed-from solution. Thereafter, we consider two nonlinear complimentary filters (with state-dependent gains) which are shown to exhibit improved stability and performance proprieties compared to the traditional filter. We perform robustness analysis for the three discussed attitude filters on SO(3) with respect to attitude and angular velocity measurement errors. Specifically, we show that the state-dependent-gain filters may exhibit improved robustness to gyro measurement disturbances and a better disturbance attenuation levels. Simulation results are performed to confirm the obtained theoretical results.
