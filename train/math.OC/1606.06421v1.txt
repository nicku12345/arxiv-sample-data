Consider the problem of finding a point in a unit n-dimensional \ell_p-ball (p\ge 2) such that the minimum of the weighted Euclidean distance from given m points is maximized. We show in this paper that the recent SDP-relaxation-based approximation algorithm [SIAM J. Optim. 23(4), 2264-2294, 2013] will not only provide the first theoretical approximation bound of \frac{1-O\left(\sqrt{ \ln(m)/n}\right)}{2}, but also perform much better in practice, if the SDP relaxation is removed and the optimal solution of the SDP relaxation is replaced by a simple scalar matrix.
