Parameters of a virtual synchronous machine in a small microgrid are optimised. The dynamical behaviour of the system is simulated after a perturbation, where the system needs to return to its steady state. The cost functional evaluates the system behaviour for different parameters. This functional is minimised by Parallel Tempering. Two perturbation scenarios are investigated and the resulting optimal parameters agree with analytical predictions. Dependent on the focus of the optimisation different optima are obtained for each perturbation scenario. During the transient the system leaves the allowed voltage and frequency bands only for a short time if the perturbation is within a certain range.
