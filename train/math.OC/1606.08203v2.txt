We study formation control problems. Our approach is to let a group of systems maximize their pairwise distances whilst bringing them all to a given submanifold, determining the shape of the formation. The algorithm we propose allows to initialize the positions of the individual systems in the ambient space of the given submanifold but brings them to the desired formation asymptotically in a stable fashion. Our control inherently consists of a distributed component, maximizing the pairwise distances, and a decentralized component, asymptotically stabilizing the submanifold. We establish a graph-theoretical interpretation of the equilibria that our control enforces and extend our approach to systems living on the special Euclidean group. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our approach on different examples.
