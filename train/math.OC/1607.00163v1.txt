The Holomorphic Embedding Load Flow Method (HELM) has been suggested as an alternative approach to solve load flow problems. However, the current literature does not provide any HELM models that can accurately handle general power networks containing PV and PQ buses of realistic sizes. The original HELM paper dealt only with PQ buses, while a second paper showed how to include PV buses but suffered from serious accuracy problems. This paper fills this gap by providing several models capable of solving general networks, with computational results for the standard IEEE test cases provided for comparison. In addition this paper also presents a new derivation of the theory behind the method and investigates some of the claims made in the original HELM paper.
