Input feed-forward output feedback passive (IF-OFP) systems define a great number of dynamical systems. In this report, we show that dissipativity and passivity-based control combined with event-triggered networked control systems (NCS) provide a powerful platform for the design of cyber-physical systems (CPS). We propose QSR-dissipativity, passivity and L2 stability conditions for an event-triggered networked control system in three cases where: (i) an input-output event-triggering sampler condition is located on the plant's output side, (ii) an input-output event-triggering sampler condition is located on controller's output side, (iii) input-output event-triggering sampler conditions are located on the outputs of both the plant and controller. We will show that this leads to a large decrease in communicational load amongst sub-units in networked control structures. We show that passivity and stability conditions depend on passivity levels for the plant and controller. Our results also illustrate the trade-off among passivity levels, stability, and system's dependence on the rate of communication between the plant and controller.
