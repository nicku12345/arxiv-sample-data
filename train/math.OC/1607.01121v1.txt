In this paper, we study the generalized phase retrieval problem: to recover a signal \bm{x}\in\mathbb{C}^n from the measurements y_r=\lvert \langle\bm{a}_r,\bm{x}\rangle\rvert^2, r=1,2,\ldots,m. The problem can be reformulated as a least-squares minimization problem. Although the cost function is nonconvex, the global convergence of gradient descent algorithm from a random initialization is studied, when m is large enough. We improve the known result of the local convergence from a spectral initialization. When the signal \bm{x} is real-valued, we prove that the cost function is local convex near the solution \{\pm\bm{x}\}. To accelerate the gradient descent, we review and apply several efficient line search methods. We also perform a comparative numerical study of the line search methods and the alternative projection method. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superior ability of LBFGS algorithm than other algorithms.
