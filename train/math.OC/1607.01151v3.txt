We provide a sparse version of the bounded degree SOS hierarchy BSOS [7] for polynomial optimization problems. It permits to treat large scale problems which satisfy a structured sparsity pattern. When the sparsity pattern satisfies the running intersection property this Sparse-BSOS hierarchy of semidefinite programs (with semidefinite constraints of fixed size) converges to the global optimum of the original problem. Moreover, for the class of SOS-convex problems, finite convergence takes place at the first step of the hierarchy, just as in the dense version.
