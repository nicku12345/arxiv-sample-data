We consider a graph theoretic approach to the performance and robustness of a platoon of vehicles, where each vehicle communicates with its k-nearest neighbors. In particular, we quantify the platoon's stability margin, robustness to disturbances (in terms of system \mathcal{H}_{\infty} norm), and maximum delay tolerance via graph-theoretic notions such as nodal degrees and (grounded) Laplacian matrix eigenvalues. Our results show that there is a trade-off between robustness to time delay and robustness to disturbances. Both first-order dynamics (reference velocity tracking) and second-order dynamics (controlling inter-vehicular distance) are analyzed in this direction. Theoretical contributions are confirmed via simulation results.
