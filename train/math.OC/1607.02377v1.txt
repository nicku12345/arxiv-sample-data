This work considers the problem of optimize the routes of the vehicles used by a real agricultural cooperative that distributes animal feed among the partners. Because solving the exact model is computationally burdensome, we propose to implement heuristic algorithms. Thus, firstly an initial solution is obtained through an insertion heuristic algorithm. Secondly, we design a simulated annealing algorithm for possible improvements on the initial solution. Finally, we built a graphical interface to quickly and easily interact with the system.
