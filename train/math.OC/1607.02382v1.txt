In this paper, the problem of building a consistent European network state based on the data provided by different Transmission System Operators (TSOs) is addressed. A hierarchical merging procedure is introduced and consists in the resolution of several Optimal Power Flow problems (OPFs). Results on the European network demonstrate the interest of this procedure on real-life cases and highlight the benefits of using a hierarchical multi-objective approach.
