In this paper we generalize the estimation-control duality that exists in the linear-quadratic-Gaussian setting. We extend this duality to maximum a posteriori estimation of the system's state, where the measurement and dynamical system noise are independent log-concave random variables. More generally, we show that a problem which induces a convex penalty on noise terms will have a dual control problem. We provide conditions for strong duality to hold, and then prove relaxed conditions for the piecewise linear-quadratic case. The results have applications in estimation problems with nonsmooth densities, such as log-concave maximum likelihood densities. We conclude with an example reconstructing optimal estimates from solutions to the dual control problem, which has implications for sharing solution methods between the two types of problems.
