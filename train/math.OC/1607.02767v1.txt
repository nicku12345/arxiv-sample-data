In this paper, we present Lyapunov-based adaptive controllers for the practical (or real) stabilization of a perturbed chain of integrators with bounded uncertainties. We refer to such controllers as Adaptive Higher Order Sliding Mode (AHOSM) controllers since they are designed for nonlinear SISO systems with bounded uncertainties such that the uncertainty bounds are unknown. Our main result states that, given any neighborhood N of the origin, we determine a controller insuring, for every uncertainty bounds, that every trajectory of the corresponding closed loop system enters N and eventually remains there. The effectiveness of these controllers is illustrated through simulations.
