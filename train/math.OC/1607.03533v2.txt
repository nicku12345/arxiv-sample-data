We present a MATLAB implementation of the shape-changing symmetric rank-one (SC-SR1) method that solves trust-region subproblems when a limited-memory symmetric rank-one (L-SR1) matrix is used in place of the true Hessian matrix. The method takes advantage of two shape-changing norms [4, 3] to decompose the trust-region subproblem into two separate problems. Using one of the proposed shape-changing norms, the resulting subproblems then have closed-form solutions. In the other proposed norm, one of the resulting subproblems has a closed-form solution while the other is easily solvable using techniques that exploit the structure of L-SR1 matrices. Numerical results suggest that the SC-SR1 method is able to solve trust-region subproblems to high accuracy even in the so-called "hard case".
