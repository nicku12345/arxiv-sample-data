The wide adoption of gas fired units and power-to-gas technology brings remarkable interdependency between natural gas and electricity infrastructures. This paper studies the equilibria of coupled gas and electricity energy markets driven by the strategic bidding behavior: each producer endeavours to maximizes its own profit subjecting to the market clearing outcome. The market equilibria is formulated as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). A special diagonalization algorithm (DA) is devised, in which the unilateral equilibria of the gas or electricity market is found in the inner loop given the rival's strategy; the interaction of the two markets are tackled in the outer loop. Case studies on two test systems validates the proposed methodology.
