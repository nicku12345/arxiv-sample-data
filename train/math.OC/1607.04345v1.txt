In this paper, a backstepping control of the one-phase Stefan Problem, which is a 1-D diffusion Partial Differential Equation (PDE) defined on a time varying spatial domain described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE), is studied. A new nonlinear backstepping transformation for moving boundary problem is utilized to transform the original coupled PDE-ODE system into a target system whose exponential stability is proved. The full-state boundary feedback controller ensures the exponential stability of the moving interface to a reference setpoint and the {\cal H}_1-norm of the distributed temperature by a choice of the setpint satisfying given explicit inequality between initial states that guarantees the physical constraints imposed by the melting process.
