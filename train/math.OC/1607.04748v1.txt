We study a canonical duality method to solve a mixed-integer nonconvex fourth-order polynomial minimization problem with fixed cost terms. This constrained nonconvex problem can be transformed into a continuous concave maximization dual problem without duality gap. The global optimality conditions are proposed and the existence and uniqueness criteria are discussed. Application to a decoupled mixed-integer problem is illustrated and analytic solution for a global minimum is obtained under some suitable conditions. Several examples are given to show the method is effective.
