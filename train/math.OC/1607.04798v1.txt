Many of the distributed localization algorithms are based on relaxed optimization formulations of the localization problem. These algorithms commonly rely on first-order optimization methods, and hence may require many iterations or communications among computational agents. Furthermore, some of these distributed algorithms put a considerable computational demand on the agents. In this paper, we show that for tree-structured scattered sensor networks, which are networks that their inter-sensor range measurement graphs have few edges (few range measurements among sensors) and can be represented using a tree, it is possible to devise an efficient distributed localization algorithm that solely relies on second-order methods. Particularly, we apply a state-of-the-art primal-dual interior-point method to a semidefinite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood formulation of the localization problem. We then show how it is possible to exploit the tree-structure in the network and use message-passing or dynamic programming over trees, to distribute computations among different computational agents. The resulting algorithm requires far fewer iterations and communications among agents to converge to an accurate estimate. Moreover, the number of required communications among agents, seems to be less sensitive and more robust to the number of sensors in the network, the number of available measurements and the quality of the measurements. This is in stark contrast to distributed algorithms that rely on first-order methods. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm using experiments based on simulated and real data.
