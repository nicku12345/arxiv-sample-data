This paper proposes coordination laws for optimal energy generation and distribution in energy network, which is composed of physical flow layer and cyber communication layer. The physical energy flows through the physical layer; but all the energies are coordinated to generate and flow by distributed coordination algorithms on the basis of communication information. First, distributed energy generation and energy distribution laws are proposed in a decoupled way without considering the interactive characteristics between the energy generation and energy distribution. Then, a joint coordination law is designed in a coupled way taking account of the interactive characteristics. The coordination laws proposed in this paper are fully distributed in the sense that they are decided optimally only using relative information among neighboring nodes. Through numerical simulations, the validity of the proposed distributed coordination laws is illustrated.
