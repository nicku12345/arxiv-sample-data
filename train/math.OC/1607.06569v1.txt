In this paper, in terms of three types of generalized second-order derivatives of a nonsmooth function, we mainly study the corresponding second-order optimality conditions in a Hilbert space and prove the equivalence among these optimality conditions for paraconcave functions. As applications, we use these second-order optimality conditions to study strict local minimizers of order two and provide sufficient and/or necessary conditions for ensuring the local minimizer. This work extends and generalizes the study on second-order optimality conditions from the finite-dimensional space to the Hilbert space.
