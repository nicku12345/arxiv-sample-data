This paper investigates the effect of FACTS Devices on voltage stability constrained Optimal Power Flow (OPF) formulation where the objective function is to minimize power system load curtailment. Incorporating FACTS Devices affects the topology and hence the power flow distribution. Some numerical cases are presented to discuss the effects of FACTS Devices that is expected when it is incorporated into the load curtailment formulation. The test result reflects the impacts FACTS Devices has in reducing load curtailment during a line congestion situation. The paper also discusses the applicability of approach in security based reliability studies for systems having control components like FACTS Devices.
