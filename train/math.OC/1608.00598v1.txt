The solution to an optimal power flow (OPF) problem provides a minimum cost operating point for an electric power system. The performance of OPF solution techniques strongly depends on the problem's feasible space. This paper presents an algorithm for provably computing the entire feasible spaces of small OPF problems to within a specified discretization tolerance. Specifically, the feasible space is computed by discretizing certain of the OPF problem's inequality constraints to obtain a set of power flow equations. All solutions to the power flow equations at each discretization point are obtained using the Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Continuation (NPHC) algorithm. To improve computational tractability, "bound tightening" and "grid pruning" algorithms use convex relaxations to eliminate the consideration of discretization points for which the power flow equations are provably infeasible. The proposed algorithm is used to generate the feasible spaces of two small test cases.
