New connection constraints for the power network (Grid Codes) require more flexible and reliable systems, with robust solutions to cope with uncertainties and intermittence from renewable energy sources (renewables), such as photovoltaic arrays. The interconnection of such renewables with storage systems through a Direct Current (DC) MicroGrid can fulfill these requirements. A "Plug and Play" approach based on the "System of Systems" philosophy using distributed control methodologies is developed in the present work. This approach allows to interconnect a number of elements to a DC MicroGrid as power sources like photovoltaic arrays, storage systems in different time scales like batteries and supercapacitors, and loads like electric vehicles and the main AC grid. The proposed scheme can easily be scalable to a much larger number of elements.
