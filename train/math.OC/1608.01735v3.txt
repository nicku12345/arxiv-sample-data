Properties of solutions of the tensor complementarity problem (TCP) for structured tensors have been investigated in recent literature. In this paper, we make further contributions on this problem. Specifically, we first derive solution existence theorems for TCPs on general cones from the results studied in the nonlinear complementarity problem literature. An interesting byproduct is that conditions (e.g., strict copositivity) of solution existence results for TCPs on the nonnegative cone can be reduced to copositivity, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the weakest requirement in the current TCP literature. Moreover, we study the topological properties of the solution set and stability of the TCP at a given solution, which are not discussed before and further enrich the theory of TCPs.
