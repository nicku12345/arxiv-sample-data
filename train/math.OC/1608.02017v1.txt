In this paper we give sufficient conditions for a Pontryagin extremal trajectory, consisting of two bang arcs followed by a singular one, to be a strong local minimizer for a Mayer problem. The problem is defined on a manifold M and the end-points constraints are of fixed-free type. We use a Hamiltonian approach and its connection with the second order conditions in the form of an accessory problem on the tangent space to M at the final point of the trajectory. Two examples are proposed.
