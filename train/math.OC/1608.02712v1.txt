For a given closed target we embed the dissipative relation that defines a control Lyapunov function in a more general differential inequality involving Hamiltonians built from iterated Lie brackets. The solutions of the resulting extended relation, here called degree-k control Lyapunov functions (k>=1), turn out to be still sufficient for the system to be globally asymptotically controllable to the target. Furthermore, we work out some examples where no standard (i.e., degree-1) smooth control Lyapunov functions exist while a smooth degree-k control Lyapunov function does exist, for some k>1. The extension is performed under very weak regularity assumptions on the system, to the point that, for instance, (set valued) Lie brackets of locally Lipschitz vector fields are considered as well.
