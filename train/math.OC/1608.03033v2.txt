In this paper, we consider an infinite horizon, continuous-review, stochastic inventory system in which cumulative customers' demand is price-dependent and is modeled as a Brownian motion. Excess demand is backlogged. The revenue is earned by selling products and the costs are incurred by holding/shortage and ordering, the latter consists of a fixed cost and a proportional cost. Our objective is to simultaneously determine a pricing strategy and an inventory control strategy to maximize the expected long-run average profit. Specifically, the pricing strategy provides the price p_t for any time t\geq0 and the inventory control strategy characterizes when and how much we need to order. We show that an (s^*,S^*,p^*) policy is optimal and obtain the equations of optimal policy parameters, where p^*=\{p_t^*:t\geq 0\}. Furthermore, we find that at each time t, the optimal price p_t^* depends on the current inventory level z, and it is increasing in [s^*,z^*] and is decreasing in [z^*,\infty), where z^* is a negative level.
