This paper mainly investigates the analytic solutions for the approximation of p-Laplacian problem. Through an approximation mechanism, we convert the nonlinear partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary into a sequence of minimization problems. And a sequence of analytic minimizers can be obtained by applying the canonical duality theory. Moreover, the nonlinear canonical transformation gives a sequence of perfect dual maximization(minimization) problems, and further discussion shows the global extrema for both primal and dual problems.
