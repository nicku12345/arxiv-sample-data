In this paper we study local error bound moduli for a locally Lipschitz and regular function via its outer limiting subdifferential set. We show that the distance of 0 from the outer limiting subdifferential of the support function of the subdifferential set, which is essentially the distance of 0 from the end set of the subdifferential set, is an upper estimate of the local error bound modulus. This upper estimate becomes tight for a convex function under some regularity conditions. We show that the distance of 0 from the outer limiting subdifferential set of a lower \mathcal{C}^1 function is equal to the local error bound modulus.
