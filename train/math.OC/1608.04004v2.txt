Electric Vehicles (EVs) are promising to provide frequency regulation services due to their fast regulating characteristics. However, when EVs participate in Supplementary Frequency Regulation (SFR), it is challenging to simultaneously achieve the dispatch of the control center and the expected State of Charge (SOC) levels of EV batteries. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) control strategy, in which an uncertain dispatch is implemented in the control center without detailed EV charging/discharging information. The regulation from the control center is achieved by allocating the regulation task within the frequency regulation capacity (FRC) of EVs. The expected SOC levels of EV batteries are guaranteed by a real-time correction of their scheduled V2G power in EV charging stations. Simulations on an interconnected two-area power system validate the effectiveness of the proposed V2G control in achieving both the frequency regulation and the expected SOC levels of EVs.
