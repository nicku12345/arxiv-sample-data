Earlier work has established a decentralized optimal control framework for coordinating online a continuous flow of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) entering a control zone and crossing two adjacent intersections in an urban area. A solution, when it exists, allows the vehicles to cross the intersections without the use of traffic lights, without creating congestion on the connecting road, and under the hard safety constraint of collision avoidance. We establish the conditions under which such solutions exist and show that they can be enforced through an appropriately designed feasibility enforcement zone that precedes the control zone. The proposed solution and overall control architecture are illustrated through simulation.
