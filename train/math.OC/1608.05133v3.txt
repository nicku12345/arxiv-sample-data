This paper presents an algorithm to solve non-convex optimal control problems, where non-convexity can arise from nonlinear dynamics, and non-convex state and control constraints. This paper assumes that the state and control constraints are already convex or convexified, the proposed algorithm convexifies the nonlinear dynamics, via a linearization, in a successive manner. Thus at each succession, a convex optimal control subproblem is solved. Since the dynamics are linearized and other constraints are convex, after a discretization, the subproblem can be expressed as a finite dimensional convex programming subproblem. Since convex optimization problems can be solved very efficiently, especially with custom solvers, this subproblem can be solved in time-critical applications, such as real-time path planning for autonomous vehicles. Several safe-guarding techniques are incorporated into the algorithm, namely virtual control and trust regions, which add another layer of algorithmic robustness. A convergence analysis is presented in continuous- time setting. By doing so, our convergence results will be independent from any numerical schemes used for discretization. Numerical simulations are performed for an illustrative trajectory optimization example.
