This paper aims to provide various applications for second-order variational analysis of extended-real-valued piecewise liner functions recently obtained in [1]. We mainly focus here on establishing relationships between full stability of local minimizers in composite optimization and Robinson's strong regularity of associated (linearized and nonlinearized) KKT systems. Finally, we address Lipschitzian stability of parametric variational systems with convex piecewise linear potentials.
