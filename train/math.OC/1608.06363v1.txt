Different from most of the previous works, this paper provides a thorough solution to the fundamental problems of linear-quadratic (LQ) control and stabilization for discrete-time mean-field systems under basic assumptions. Firstly, the sufficient and necessary condition for the solvability of mean-field LQ control problem is firstly presented in analytic expression based on the maximum principle developed in this paper, which is compared with the results obtained in literatures where only operator type solvability conditions were given. The optimal controller is given in terms of a coupled Riccati equation which is derived from the solution to forward and backward stochastic difference equation (FBSDE). Secondly, the sufficient and necessary stabilization conditions are explored. It is shown that, under exactly observability assumption, the mean-field system is stabilizable in mean square sense if and only if a coupled algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) has a unique solution P and \bar{P} satisfying P>0 and P+\bar{P}>0. Furthermore, under the exactly detectability assumption, which is a weaker assumption than exactly observability, we show that the mean-field system is stabilizable in mean square sense if and only if the coupled ARE has a unique solution P and \bar{P} satisfying P\geq 0 and P+\bar{P}\geq 0. The key techniques adopted in this paper are the maximum principle and the solution to the FBSDE obtained in this paper. The derived results in this paper forms the basis to solve the mean-field control problem for continuous-time systems and other related problems.
