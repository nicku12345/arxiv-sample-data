The pole assignment problem for descriptor systems is a classical inverse algebraic eigenvalue problem, which has attracted attention for decades. In this paper, we propose a direct method to solve the problem with the application of the proportional plus derivative state feedback, intending to obtain a robust closed-loop system. Theorems on the feasibility of our method will be presented. Numerical examples show that our method yields poles of high relative accuracy.
