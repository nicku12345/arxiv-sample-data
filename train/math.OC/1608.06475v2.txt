This paper investigates the stabilization and control problems for linear continuous-time mean-field systems (MFS). Under standard assumptions, necessary and sufficient conditions to stabilize the mean-field systems in the mean square sense are explored for the first time. It is shown that, under the assumption of exact detectability (exact observability), the mean-field system is stabilizable if and only if a coupled algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) admits a unique positive semi-definite solution (positive definite solution), which coincides with the classical stabilization results for standard deterministic systems and stochastic systems.   One of the key techniques in the paper is the obtained solution to the forward and backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) associated with the maximum principle for an optimal control problem. Actually, with the analytical FBSDE solution, a necessary and sufficient solvability condition of the optimal control, under mild conditions, is derived. Accordingly, the stabilization condition is presented by defining an Lyaponuv functional via the solution to the FBSDE and the optimal cost function.   It is worth of pointing out that the presented results are different from the previous works for stabilization and also different from the works on optimal control.
