In this article we continue our investigation of the iterative regularization method for optimization problems based on Bregman distances. The optimization problems are subject to pointwise inequality constraints in L^2(\Omega). We provide an estimate for the noise error for perturbed data, which can be used to construct an a priori stopping rule. Furthermore we show how to implement our method with a semi-smooth Newton method using finite elements and present numerical results for the stopping rule.
