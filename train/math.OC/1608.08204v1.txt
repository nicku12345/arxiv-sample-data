We present new results concerning the approximation of the total variation, \int_{\Omega} |\nabla u|, of a function u by non-local, non-convex functionals of the form  \Lambda_\delta u = \int_{\Omega} \int_{\Omega} \frac{\delta \varphi \big( |u(x) - u(y)|/ \delta\big)}{|x - y|^{d+1}} \, dx \, dy,  as \delta \to 0, where \Omega is a domain in \mathrm{R}^d and \varphi: [0, + \infty) \to [0, + \infty) is a non-decreasing function satisfying some appropriate conditions. The mode of convergence is extremely delicate and numerous problems remain open. De Giorgi's concept of Gamma-convergence illuminates the situation, but also introduces mysterious novelties. The original motivation of our work comes from Image Processing.
