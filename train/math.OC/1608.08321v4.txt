In this study we introduce a new method to solve the Dynamics Facility Layout Problems (DFLPs). To represent each layout, we use the slicing tree method integrated with our proposed heuristic to obtain promising initial solutions. Then, we consider the case of adding new departments into the current layout with stochastic flows. We use simulation to model the complexity of stochastic nature of the problem. To improve the quality of the initial solution a genetic algorithm is joined with the simulation module. Finally, to demonstrate the performance of our method, we solve several cases existing in the literature to show the efficiency of our algorithm.
