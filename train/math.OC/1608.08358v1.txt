We consider a multi-agent system where each agent has its own estimate of a given quantity and the goal is to reach consensus on the average. To this purpose, we propose a distributed consensus algorithm that guarantees convergence to the average in a finite number of iterations. The algorithm is tailored to ring networks with bidirectional pairwise communications. If the number of agents m is even, say m=2n, then, the number of iterations needed is equal to n, which in this case is the diameter of the network, whereas the number of iterations grows to 3n if the number of agents is odd and equal to m=2n+1.
