We investigate the long time behavior of solutions to semilinear hyperbolic equation (E_{\alpha}):  u^{\prime\prime}(t)+\gamma(t)u^{\prime}(t)+Au(t)+f(u(t))=g(t),~t\geq0,  where A is a self-adjoint nonnegative operator, f a function which derives from a convex function, and \gamma a nonnegative function which behaviors, for t large enough, as \frac{K}{t^{\alpha}} with K>0 and \alpha \in\lbrack0,1[. We obtain sufficient conditions on the source term g(t), ensuring the weak or the strong convergence of any solution u(t) of (E_{\alpha}) as t\rightarrow+\infty to a solution of the stationary equation Av+f(v)=0 if one exists.
