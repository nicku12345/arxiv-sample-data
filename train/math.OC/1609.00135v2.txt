We investigate the long time behavior of solutions to the differential equation \ddot{x}(t)+\frac{c}{\left( t+1\right) ^{\alpha}}\dot{x}(t)+\nabla \Phi\left( x(t)\right) =g(t),~t\geq0,  where c is nonnegative constant, \alpha\in\lbrack0,1[, \Phi is a C^{1} convex function on a Hilbert space \mathcal{H} and g\in L^{1} (0,+\infty;\mathcal{H}). We obtain sufficient conditions on the source term g(t) ensuring the weak or the strong convergence of any trajectory x(t) as t\rightarrow+\infty to a minimizer of the function \Phi if one exists.
