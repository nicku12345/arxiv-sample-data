Projection algorithms are well known for their simplicity and flexibility in solving feasibility problems. They are particularly important in practice due to minimal requirements for software implementation and maintenance. In this work, we study linear convergence of several projection algorithms for systems of finitely many closed sets. The results complement contemporary research on the same topic.
