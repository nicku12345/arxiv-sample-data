This paper describes the design process for developing a nonlinear model predictive controller for fault tolerant flight control. After examining and implementing a number of numerical techniques, this paper identifies pseudospectral discretisation as the most suitable for this design. Applying the controller to a 2D robot model shows that the nonlinear controller performs much better than the linear controller, especially in the closed loop scenario. Assuming fault detection information, applying the technique to the longitudinal motion of a generic aircraft model shows the design to be eminently suitable for flight control.
