In this letter, we present a unified result for the stable recovery bound of Lq(0 < q < 1) optimization model in compressed sensing, which is a constrained Lq minimization problem aware of the noise in a linear system. Specifically, without using the restricted isometry constant (RIC), we show that the error between any global solution of the noise-aware Lq optimization model and the ideal sparse solution of the noiseless model is upper bounded by a constant times the noise level,given that the sparsity of the ideal solution is smaller than a certain number. An interesting parameter {gamma} is introduced, which indicates the sparsity level of the error vector and plays an important role in our analysis. In addition, we show that when {\gamma} > 2, the recovery bound of the Lq (0 < q < 1) model is smaller than that of the L1 model, and the sparsity requirement of the ideal solution in the Lq(0 < q < 1) model is weaker than that of the L1 model.
