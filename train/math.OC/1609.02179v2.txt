We study, possibly distributed, robust weight control policies for DC power networks that change link susceptances, or weights in response to balanced disturbances to the supply-demand vector. The margin of robustness for a given control policy is defined as the radius of the largest l_1 ball in the space of balanced disturbances under which the link flows can be asymptotically contained within their specified limits. For centralized control policies, the control design as well as margin of robustness are obtained from solution to an non-convex weight control problem. We establish relationship between feasible sets for DC power flow and associated network flow, which is used to establish an upper bound on the margin of robustness in terms of the min cut capacity. This bound is proven to be tight if the network is tree-like, or if the lower bound of the operation range of weight control is zero. An explicit expression for the flow-weight Jacobian is derived and is used to devise a projected sub-gradient algorithm to solve the relaxed weight control problem. An exact multi-level programming approach to solve the weight control problem for reducible networks, based on recursive application of equivalent bilevel formulation for relevant class of non-convex network optimization problems, is also proposed. The lower level problem in each recursion corresponds to replacing a sub-network by a (virtual) link with equivalent weight and capacities. The equivalent capacity function for tree-reducible networks is shown to possess a strong quasi-concavity property, facilitating easy solution to the weight control problem. Robustness analysis for natural decentralized control policies that decrease weights on overloaded links, and increase weights on underloaded links with increasing flows is provided for parallel networks. Illustrative simulation results for a benchmark IEEE network are included.
