This paper investigates a well-posedness property of parametric constraint systems named here Robinson stability. Based on advanced tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation, we derive first-order and second-order conditions for this property under minimal constraint qualifications and establish relationships of Robinson stability with other well-posedness properties in variational analysis and optimization. The results obtained are applied to robust Lipschitzian stability of parametric variational systems.
