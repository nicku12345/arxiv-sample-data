This manuscript discusses the approximation of a global maximizer of the Kantorovich mass transfer problem through the approach of p-Laplacian equation. Using an approximation mechanism, the primal maximization problem can be transformed into a sequence of minimization problems. By applying the canonical duality theory, one is able to derive a sequence of analytic solutions for the minimization problems. In the final analysis, the convergence of the sequence to a global maximizer of the primal Kantorovich problem will be demonstrated.
