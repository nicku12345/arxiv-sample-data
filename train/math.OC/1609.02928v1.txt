The subdifferential of a function is a generalization for nonsmooth functions of the concept of gradient. It is frequently used in variational analysis, particularly in the context of nonsmooth optimization. The present work proposes algorithms to reconstruct a polyhedral subdifferential of a function from the computation of finitely many directional derivatives. We provide upper bounds on the required number of directional derivatives when the space is \R^1 and \R^2, as well as in \R^n where subdifferential is known to possess at most three vertices.
