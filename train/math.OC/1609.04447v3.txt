In many nonlinear control problems, the plant can be accurately described by a linear model whose operating point depends on some measurable variables, called scheduling signals. When such a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model of the open-loop plant needs to be derived from a set of data, several issues arise in terms of parameterization, estimation, and validation of the model before designing the controller. Moreover, the way modeling errors affect the closed-loop performance is still largely unknown in the LPV context. In this paper, a direct data-driven control method is proposed to design LPV controllers directly from data without deriving a model of the plant. The main idea of the approach is to use a hierarchical control architecture, where the inner controller is designed to match a simple and a-priori specified closed-loop behavior. Then, an outer model predictive controller is synthesized to handle input/output constraints and to enhance the performance of the inner loop. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by means of a simulation and an experimental example. Practical implementation issues are also discussed.
