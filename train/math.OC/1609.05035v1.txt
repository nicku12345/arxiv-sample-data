In this paper, we present a fast and effective method for solving the Poisson-modified total variation model proposed in [9]. The existence and uniqueness of the model are again proved using different method. A semi-implicit difference scheme is designed to discretize the derived gradient descent flow with a large time step and can guarantee the restored image to be strictly positive in the image domain. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.
