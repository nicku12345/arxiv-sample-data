We consider new polynomially solvable cases of the well-known Quadratic Assignment Problem involving coefficient matrices with a special diagonal structure. By combining the new special cases with polynomially solvable special cases known in the literature we obtain a new and larger class of polynomially solvable special cases of the QAP where one of the two coefficient matrices involved is a Robinson matrix with an additional structural property: this matrix can be represented as a conic combination of cut matrices in a certain normal form. The other matrix is a conic combination of a monotone anti-Monge matrix and a down-benevolent Toeplitz matrix. We consider the recognition problem for the special class of Robinson matrices mentioned above and show that it can be solved in polynomial time.
