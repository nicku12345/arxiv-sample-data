In this paper, we compare the transient performance of a multi-terminal high-voltage DC (MTDC) grid equipped with a slack bus for voltage control to that of two distributed control schemes: a standard droop controller and a distributed averaging proportional-integral (DAPI) controller. We evaluate performance in terms of an H2 metric that quantifies expected deviations from nominal voltages, and show that the transient performance of a droop or DAPI controlled MTDC grid is always superior to that of an MTDC grid with a slack bus. In particular, by studying systems built up over lattice networks, we show that the H2 norm of a slack bus controlled system may scale unboundedly with network size, while the norm remains uniformly bounded with droop or DAPI control. We simulate the control strategies on radial MTDC networks to demonstrate that the transient performance for the slack bus controlled system deteriorates significantly as the network grows, which is not the case with the distributed control strategies.
