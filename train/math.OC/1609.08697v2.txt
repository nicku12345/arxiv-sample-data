This paper considers the problem of Volt-VAR Optimization (VVO) in active smart grids. Active smart grids are equipped with distributed generators, distributed storage systems, and tie-line switches that allow for topological reconfiguration. In this paper, the joint operation of the remotely controllable switches, storage units, under load tap changers, and shunt capacitors is formulated for a day-ahead operation scheme. The proposed VVO problem aims at minimizing the expected active power loss in the system and is formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic program. The stochasticity of the wind power generation is addressed through a first-order Markov chain model. Numerical results on a 33-node, 12.66 kV active smart grid using real data from smart meters and wind turbines are presented and compared for various test cases.
