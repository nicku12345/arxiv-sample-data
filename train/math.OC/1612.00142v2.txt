In the present paper, we focus on the vector optimization problems with inequality constraints, where objective functions and constrained functions are Fr\'echet differentiable, and whose gradient mapping is locally Lipschitz on an open set. By using the second-order symmetric subdifferential and the second-order tangent set, we propose two types of second-order regularity conditions in the sense of Abadie. Then we establish some strong second-order Karush--Kuhn--Tucker necessary optimality conditions for Geoffrion properly efficient solutions of the considered problem. Examples are given to illustrate the obtained results.
