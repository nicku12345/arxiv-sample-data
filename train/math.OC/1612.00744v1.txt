In this paper, we consider the discounted continuous-time Markov decision process (CTMDP) with a lower bounding function. In this model, the negative part of each cost rate is bounded by the drift function, say w, whereas the positive part is allowed to be arbitrarily unbounded. Our focus is on the existence of a stationary optimal policy for the discounted CTMDP problems out of the more general class. Both constrained and unconstrained problems are considered. Our investigations are based on a useful transformation for nonhomogeneous Markov pure jump processes that has not yet been widely applied to the study of CTMDPs. This technique was not employed in previous literature, but it clarifies the roles of the imposed conditions in a rather transparent way. As a consequence, we withdraw and weaken several conditions commonly imposed in the literature.
