Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the key electric power system optimization problems. "Moment" relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization globally solve many OPF problems. Previous work illustrates the ability of higher-order moment relaxations to approach the convex hulls of OPF problems' non-convex feasible spaces. Using a small test case, this paper focuses on the ability of the moment relaxations to globally solve problems with objective functions that have unconstrained minima at infeasible points inside the convex hull of the non-convex constraints.
