We study the problem of recovering the underlining sparse signals from clean or noisy phaseless measurements. Due to the sparse prior of signals, we adopt an L0regularized variational model to ensure only a small number of nonzero elements being recovered in the signal and two different formulations are established in the modeling based on the choices of data fidelity, i.e., L2and L1norms. We also propose efficient algorithms based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with convergence guarantee and nearly optimal computational complexity. Thanks to the existence of closed-form solutions to all subproblems, the proposed algorithm is very efficient with low computational cost in each iteration. Numerous experiments show that our proposed methods can recover sparse signals from phaseless measurements with higher successful recovery rates and lower computation cost compared with the state-of-art methods.
