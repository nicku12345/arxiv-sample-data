We present two zero-sum games modeling situations where one player attacks (or hides in) a finite dimensional nonempty compact set, and the other tries to prevent the attack (or find him). The first game, called patrolling game, corresponds to a dynamic formulation of this situation in the sense that the attacker chooses a time and a point to attack and the patroller chooses a continuous trajectory to maximize the probability of finding the attack point in a given time. Whereas the second game, called hiding game, corresponds to a static formulation in which both the searcher and the hider choose simultaneously a point and the searcher maximizes the probability of being at distance less than a given threshold of the hider.
