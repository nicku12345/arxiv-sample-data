The aim of this paper is to discuss the main result in the paper by D.Y. Gao and X. Lu [On the extrema of a nonconvex functional with double-well potential in 1D, Z. Angew. Math. Phys. (2016) 67:62]. More precisely we provide a detailed study of the problem considered in that paper, pointing out the importance of the norm on the space C^{1}[a,b]; because no norm (topology) is mentioned on C^{1}[a,b] we look at it as being a subspace of W^{1,p}(a,b) for p\in [1,\infty] endowed with its usual norm. We show that the objective function has not local extrema with the mentioned constraints for p\in [1,4), and has (up to an additive constant) only a local maximizer for p=\infty, unlike the conclusion of the main result of the discussed paper where it is mentioned that there are (up to additive constants) two local minimizers and a local maximizer. We also show that the same conclusions are valid for the similar problem treated in the preprint by X. Lu and D.Y. Gao [On the extrema of a nonconvex functional with double-well potential in higher dimensions, arXiv:1607.03995].
