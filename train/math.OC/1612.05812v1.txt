This paper develops a novel framework for power system stability analysis, that allows for the decentralized design of inverter based controllers. The method requires that each individual inverter satisfies a standard H^\infty design requirement. Critically each requirement depends only on the dynamics of the components and inverters at each individual bus and the aggregate susceptance of the transmission lines connected to it. The method is both robust to network and delay uncertainties, as well as heterogeneous network components, and when no network information is available it reduces to the standard decentralized passivity sufficient condition for stability. We illustrate the novelty and strength of our approach by studying the design of inverter-based control laws in the presence of delays.
