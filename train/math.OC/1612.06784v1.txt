This paper discusses spacecraft control using variable-speed CMGs. A new operational concept for VSCMGs is proposed. This new concept makes it possible to approximate the complex nonlinear system by a linear time-varying system (LTV). As a result, an effective control system design method, Model Predictive Control (MPC) using robust pole assignment, can be used to design the spacecraft control system using VSCMGs. A nice feature of this design is that the control system does not have any singular point. A design example is provided. The simulation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.
