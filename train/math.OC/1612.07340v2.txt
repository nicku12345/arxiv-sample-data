Hyperbolic programming is the problem of computing the infimum of a linear function when restricted to the hyperbolicity cone of a hyperbolic polynomial, a generalization of semidefinite programming. We propose an approach based on symbolic computation, relying on the multiplicity structure of the algebraic boundary of the cone, without the assumption of determinantal representability. This allows us to design exact algorithms able to certify the multiplicity of the solution and the optimal value of the linear function.
