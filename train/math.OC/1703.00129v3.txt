This paper proposes the matrix-weighted consensus algorithm, which is a generalization of the consensus algorithm in the literature. Given a networked dynamical system where the interconnections between agents are weighted by nonnegative definite matrices instead of nonnegative scalars, consensus and clustering phenomena naturally exist. We examine algebraic and algebraic graph conditions for achieving a consensus, and provide an algorithm for finding all clusters of a given system. Finally, we illustrate two applications of the proposed consensus algorithm in clustered consensus and in bearing-based formation control.
