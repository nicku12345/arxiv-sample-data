In this paper, optimal time control problems and optimal target control problems are studied for the approximately null-controllable heat equations. Compared with the existed results on these problems, the boundary of control variables are not constants but time varying functions. The time-varying bang-bang property for optimal time control problem, and an equivalence theorem for optimal control problem and optimal target problem are obtained.
