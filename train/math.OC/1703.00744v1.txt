Comparison of Lasserre's measure--based bounds for polynomial optimization to bounds obtained by simulated annealing. We consider the problem of minimizing a continuous function f over a compact set \mathbf{K}. We compare the hierarchy of upper bounds proposed by Lasserre in [{\em SIAM J. Optim.} 21(3) (2011), pp. 864-885] to bounds that may be obtained from simulated annealing.   We show that, when f is a polynomial and \mathbf{K} a convex body, this comparison yields a faster rate of convergence of the Lasserre hierarchy than what was previously known in the literature.
