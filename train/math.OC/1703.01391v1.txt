We consider an occupation market in which preferences of members are treated as non linear general increasing functions. The arrangement of members is separated into two non over-lapping sets, set of workers and set of firms. We consider that firms have vacant posts. Every worker needs a job and firms have opportunity to contract more than one workers. A worker can work for just in at most one firm. We demonstrate the existence of pairwise stability for such a business sector. Our model is the augmentation of the Ali and Farooq [3] model by considering non linear valuations and bounded side payments.
