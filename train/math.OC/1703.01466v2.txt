We investigate variational problems with recursive integral functionals governed by infinite-dimensional differential inclusions with an infinite horizon and present an existence result in the setting of nonreflexive Banach spaces. We find an optimal solution in a Sobolev space taking values in a Banach space under the Cesari type condition. We also investigate sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to the initial value problem for the differential inclusion.
