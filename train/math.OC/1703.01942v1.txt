In this paper, we investigate a class of time-inconsistent discrete-time stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problems, whose time-consistent solutions consist of an open-loop equilibrium control and a linear feedback equilibrium strategy. The open-loop equilibrium control is defined for a given initial pair, while the linear feedback equilibrium strategy is defined for all the initial pairs. Maximum-principle-type necessary and sufficient conditions containing stationary and convexity are derived for the existence of these two time-consistent solutions, respectively. Furthermore, for the case where the system matrices are independent of the initial time, we show that the existence of the open-loop equilibrium control for a given initial pair is equivalent to the solvability of a set of nonsymmetric generalized difference Riccati equations and a set of linear difference equations. Moreover, the existence of linear feedback equilibrium strategy is equivalent to the solvability of another set of symmetric generalized difference Riccati equations.
