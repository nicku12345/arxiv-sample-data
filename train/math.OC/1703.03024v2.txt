In this work, we use a multiobjective approach to address the lot sizing problem integrated with the cutting stock problem in a paper industry. We analyze the trade-offs and correlations which exist among the costs and their decision variables. Considering some of our computational results, if we decrease the production costs, then we increase the waste of material of the cutting process and vice versa. Thereby we show the importance of the multiobjective approach in allowing multiple answers to the decision maker, using Pareto optimal solutions set. Several tests were performed to check the quality of our approach.
