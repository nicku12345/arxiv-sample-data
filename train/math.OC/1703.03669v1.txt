This study presents special cases of inconsistent pairwise comparisons PC matrices and analysis of their eigenvalue-based inconsistency index using mathematical methods. All studied special cases of PC matrices are Toeplitz matrices with only three different entries 1, x, and 1/x. A new type of circulant pairwise comparisons matrix has been introduced. Although this class of PC matrices may be perceived as restricted, it is general enough to cover numerous levels of eigenvalue-based inconsistency index from the lowest to the highest. Both exact mathematical expressions and estimations, where the exact expression was impossible to find, are provided
