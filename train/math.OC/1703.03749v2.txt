Given \epsilon \in (0,1), a probability measure \mu on \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^p and a semi-algebraic set K\subset X\times\Omega, we consider the feasible set X^*_\epsilon=\{x\in X:{\rm Prob}[(x,\omega)\in K]\geq 1-\epsilon\} associated with a chance-constraint. We provide a sequence of outer approximations X^d_\epsilon=\{x\in X: h_d(x)\geq0\}, d\in\mathbb{N}, where h_d is a polynomial of degree d whose vector of coefficients is an optimal solution of a semidefinite program. The size of the latter increases with the degree d. We also obtain the strong and highly desirable asymptotic guarantee that \lambda(X^d_\epsilon\setminus X^*_\epsilon)\to0 as d increases, where \lambda is the Lebesgue measure on X. Inner approximations with same guarantees are also obtained.
