In this paper, we study constraint qualifications for the nonconvex inequality defined by a proper lower semicontinuous function. These constraint qualifications involve the generalized construction of normal cones and subdifferentials. Several conditions for these constraint qualifications are also provided therein. When restricted to the convex inequality, these constraint qualifications reduce to basic constraint qualification (BCQ) and strong BCQ studied in [SIAM J. Optim., 14(2004), 757-772] and [Math. Oper. Res., 30 (2005), 956-965].
