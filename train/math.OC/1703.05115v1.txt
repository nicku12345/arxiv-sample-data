- In this paper we introduce a new method to solve fixed-delay optimal control problems which exploits numerical homotopy procedures. It is known that solving this kind of problems via indirect methods is complex and computationally demanding because their implementation is faced with two difficulties: the extremal equations are of mixed type, and besides, the shooting method has to be carefully initialized. Here, starting from the solution of the non-delayed version of the optimal control problem, the delay is introduced by numerical homotopy methods. Convergence results, which ensure the effectiveness of the whole procedure, are provided. The numerical efficiency is illustrated on an example.
