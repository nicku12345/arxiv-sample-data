We propose an attitude and gyro-bias estimation scheme for accelerated rigid body systems using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a global positioning system (GPS). The proposed scheme allows to obtain attitude estimates directly on the Special Orthogonal group SO(3) while estimating the gyro bias and the unknown apparent acceleration of the vehicle. We prove semi-global exponential stability of the estimation errors. Furthermore, a new switching technique for the attitude state is introduced which results in a velocity-aided hybrid attitude observer with proven global exponential stability.
