In prior work, we addressed the problem of optimally controlling on line connected and automated vehicles crossing two adjacent intersections in an urban area to minimize fuel consumption while achieving maximal throughput without any explicit traffic signaling and without considering left and right turns. In this paper, we extend the solution of this problem to account for left and right turns under hard safety constraints. Furthermore, we formulate and solve another optimization problem to minimize a measure of passenger discomfort while the vehicle turns at the intersection and we investigate the associated tradeoff between minimizing fuel consumption and passenger discomfort.
