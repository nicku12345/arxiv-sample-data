Motivated by the recent interest in formal methods-based control for dynamic robots, we discuss the applicability of prescribed performance control to nonlinear systems subject to signal temporal logic specifications. Prescribed performance control imposes a desired transient behavior on the system trajectories that is leveraged to satisfy atomic signal temporal logic specifications. A hybrid control strategy is then used to satisfy a finite set of these atomic specifications. Simulations of a multi-agent system, using consensus dynamics, show that a wide range of specifications, i.e., formation, sequencing, and dispersion, can be robustly satisfied.
