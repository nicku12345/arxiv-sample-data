We introduce the Suggest-and-Improve framework for general nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs). Using this framework, we generalize a number of known methods and provide heuristics to get approximate solutions to QCQPs for which no specialized methods are available. We also introduce an open-source Python package QCQP, which implements the heuristics discussed in the paper.
