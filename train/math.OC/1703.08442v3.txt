We propose a new dynamics for equilibrium selection of finite player discrete strategy games. The dynamics is motivated by optimal transportation, and models individual players' myopicity, greedy and uncertainty when making decisions. The stationary measure of the dynamics provides each pure Nash equilibrium a probability by which it is ranked. For potential games, its dynamical properties are characterized by entropy and Fisher information.
