An optimal control problem for a semilinear elliptic equation of divergence form is considered. Both the leading term and the semilinear term of the state equation contain the control. The well-known Pontryagin type maximum principle for the optimal controls is the first-order necessary condition. When such a first-order necessary condition is singular in some sense, certain type of the second-order necessary condition will come in naturally. The aim of this paper is to explore such kind of conditions for our optimal control problem.
