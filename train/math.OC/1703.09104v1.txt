We study fractional variational problems of Herglotz type of variable order. Necessary optimality conditions, described by fractional differential equations depending on a combined Caputo fractional derivative of variable order, are proved. Two different cases are considered: the fundamental problem, with one independent variable, and the general case, with several independent variables. We end with some illustrative examples of the results of the paper.
