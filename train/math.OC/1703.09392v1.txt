We discuss the problem of optimal impulse control representing the preventive maintenance of a simple reparable system. The system model is governed by coupled transport and integro-differential equations in a nonreflexive Banach space. The objective of this paper is to construct nonnegative impulse control inputs at given system running times that minimize the probability of the system in failure mode. To guarantee the nonnegativity of the controlled system, we consider the control inputs to depend on the system state. This essentially leads to a bilinear control problem. We first present a rigorous proof of existence of an optimal controller and then apply the variational inequality to derive the first-order necessary conditions of optimality.
