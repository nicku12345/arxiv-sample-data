We prove the existence of an optimal feedback controller for a stochastic optimization problem constituted by a variation of the Heston model, where a stochastic input process is added in order to minimize a given performance criterion. The stochastic feedback controller is searched by solving a nonlinear backward parabolic equation for which one proves the existence of a martingale solution.
