We consider the problem of finding an event-based sampling scheme that optimizes the trade-off between average sampling rate and control performance in a linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem setting with output feedback. Our analysis is based on a recently presented sampled-data controller structure, which remains LQG-optimal for any choice of sampling scheme. We show that optimization of the sampling scheme is related to an elliptic convection-diffusion type partial differential equation over a domain with free boundary, a so called Stefan problem. A numerical method is presented to solve this problem for second order systems, and thus obtain an optimal sampling scheme. The method also directly generalizes to higher order systems, although with a higher computational cost. For the special case of multidimensional integrator systems, we present the optimal sampling scheme on closed form, and prove that it will always outperform its periodic counterpart. Tight bounds on the improvement are presented. The improved performance is also demonstrated in numerical examples, both for an integrator system and a more general case.
