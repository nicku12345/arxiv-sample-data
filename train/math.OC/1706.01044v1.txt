The problem of finding the optimal thrust profile of a launcher upper stage is analyzed. The engine is assumed to be continuously thrusting, following either a linear or a bilevel parametric profile, until reaching the targeted coplanar orbit. The minimum-fuel problem is analytically solved using the maximum principle. A closed-loop solution for the thrust direction is derived and the final point is found to be necessarily at an apside, reached downwards in the case of a perigee injection. The optimal control problem reduces to a nonlinear problem with only the thrust profile parameters as unknowns. An application case targeting a geostationary transfer orbit illustrates the solution method.
