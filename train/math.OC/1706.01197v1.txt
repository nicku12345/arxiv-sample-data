This paper examines stability properties of distance-based formation control when the underlying topology consists of a rigid graph and a flex node addition. It is shown that the desired equilibrium set is locally asymptotically stable but there exist undesired equilibria. Specifically, we further consider two cases where the rigid graph is a triangle in 2-D and a tetrahedral in 3-D, and prove that any undesired equilibrium point in these cases is unstable. Thus in these cases, the desired formations are almost globally asymptotically stable.
