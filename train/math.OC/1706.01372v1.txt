Typical formulations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem rely on what is termed the "bus-branch" model, with network electrical behavior summarized in the Ybus admittance matrix. From a circuit perspective, this admittance representation restricts network elements to be voltage controlled and limitations of the Ybus have long been recognized. A fixed Ybus is unable to represent an ideal circuit breaker, and more subtle limitations appear in transformer modeling. In power systems parlance, more detailed approaches to overcome these limitations are termed "node-breaker" representations, but these are often cumbersome, and are not widely utilized in OPF. This paper develops a general network representation adapted to the needs of OPF, based on the Sparse Tableau Formulation (STF) with following advantages for OPF: (i) conceptual clarity in formulating constraints, allowing a comprehensive set of network electrical variables; (ii) improved fidelity in capturing physical behavior and engineering limits; (iii) added flexibility in optimization solution, in that elimination of intermediate variables is left to the optimization algorithm. The STF is then applied to OPF numerical case studies which demonstrate that the STF shows little or no penalty in computational speed compared to classic OPF representations, and sometimes provides considerable advantage in computational speed.
