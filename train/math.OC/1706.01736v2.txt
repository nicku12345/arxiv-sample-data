This paper is concerned with model reference adaptive controller design for a class of nonlinear fractional order systems. Recent works on this topic rarely include direct methods and they are mostly based on indirect methods where the frequency distributed model is used to prove the stability of the closed loop system. Since the chain rule cannot be applied in fractional derivations, in order to prove the lyapunov stability here fractional inequalities are used. Finally, by means of a numerical example, the controller performance is demonstrated.
