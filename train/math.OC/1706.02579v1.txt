Vectorization is a technique that replaces a set-valued optimization problem with a vector optimization problem. In this work, by using an extension of Gerstewitz function [1], a vectorizing function is defined to replace a given set-valued optimization problem with respect to set less order relation. Some properties of this function are studied. Also, relationships between a set-valued optimization problem and a vector optimization problem, derived via vectorization of this set-valued optimization problem, are examined. Furthermore, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are presented without any convexity assumption.
