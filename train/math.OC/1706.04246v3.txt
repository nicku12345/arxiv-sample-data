S. Hansen and E. Zuazua [SIAM J. Cont. Optim., 1995] studied the problem of exact controllability of two strings connected by a point mass with constant physical coefficients. In this paper we study the same problem with variable physical coefficients. This system is generated by the following equations \rho(x) u_{tt}=(\sigma(x) u_{x})_{x}-q(x)u,~~~~x\in (-1,0)\cup (0,1),~t>0, Mu_{tt}(0,t)+\sigma_{1}(0)u_{x}(0^{-},t)-\sigma_{2}(0)u_{x}(0^{+},t)=0,~~~t>0, with Dirichlet boundary condition on the left end and a control acts on the right end. We prove that this system is exactly controllable in an asymmetric space for the control time T> 2\int_{-1}^{1}(\frac{\rho(x)}{\sigma(x)})^{\frac{1}{2}}dx. We establish the equivalence between a suitable asymmetric norm of the initial data and the L^{2}(0,T)-norm of u_{x}(1,t). Our approach is mainly based on a detailed spectral analysis and the theory of divided differences. More precisely, we prove that the spectral gap tends to zero with a precise asymptotic estimate.
