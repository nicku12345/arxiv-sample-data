This paper is concerned with a discrete-time mean-field stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problem arose from financial application. Through matrix dynamical optimization method, a group of linear feedback controls is investigated. The problem is then reformulated as an operator stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problem by a sequence of bounded linear operators over Hilbert space, the optimal control with six algebraic Riccati difference equations is obtained by backward induction. The two above approaches are proved to be coincided by the classical method of completing the square. Finally, after discussing the solution of the problem under multidimensional noises, a financial application example is given.
