In this paper, we prove the stabilizability of abstract Parabolic Integro-Differential Equations (PIDE) in a Hilbert space with decay rate e^{-\gamma t}  for certain \gamma > 0, by means of a finite dimensional controller in the feedback form. We determine a linear feedback law which is obtained by solving an algebraic Riccati equation. To prove the existence of the Riccati operator, we consider a linear quadratic optimal control problem with unbounded observation operator.   The abstract theory of stabilization developed here is applied to specific problems related to viscoelastic fluids, e.g. Oldroyd B model and Jeffreys model.
