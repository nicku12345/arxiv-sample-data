Continuum Approximation (CA) is an efficient and parsimonious technique for modeling complex logistics problems. In this paper,we review recent studies that develop CA models for transportation, distribution and logistics problems with the aim of synthesizing recent advancements and identifying current research gaps. This survey focuses on important principles and key results from CA models. In particular, we consider how these studies fill the gaps identified by the most recent literature reviews in this field. We observe that CA models are used in a wider range of applications, especially in the areas of facility location and integrated supply chain management. Most studies use CA as an alternative to exact solution approaches; however, CA can also be used in combination with exact approaches. We also conclude with promising areas of future work.
