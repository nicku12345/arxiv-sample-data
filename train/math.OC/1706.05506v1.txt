In a fixed domain of \Bbb{R}^N we study the asymptotic behaviour of optimal clusters associated to \alpha-Cheeger constants and natural energies like the sum or maximum: we prove that, as the parameter \alpha converges to the "critical" value \Big (\frac{N-1}{N}\Big ) _+, optimal Cheeger clusters converge to solutions of different packing problems for balls, depending on the energy under consideration. As well, we propose an efficient phase field approach based on a multiphase Gamma convergence result of Modica-Mortola type, in order to compute \alpha-Cheeger constants, optimal clusters and, as a consequence of the asymptotic result, optimal packings. Numerical experiments are carried over in two and three space dimensions.
