In a Hilbert space setting \mathcal H, given \Phi: \mathcal H \to \mathbb R a convex continuously differentiable function, and \alpha a positive parameter, we consider the inertial system with Asymptotic Vanishing Damping \begin{equation*}   \mbox{(AVD)}_{\alpha} \quad \quad \ddot{x}(t) + \frac{\alpha}{t} \dot{x}(t) + \nabla \Phi (x(t)) =0. \end{equation*}   Depending on the value of  \alpha  with respect to 3, we give a complete picture of the convergence properties as t \to + \infty of the trajectories generated by \mbox{(AVD)}_{\alpha}, as well as iterations of the corresponding algorithms. Our main result concerns the subcritical case \alpha \leq 3, where we show that \Phi (x(t))-\min \Phi = \mathcal O (t^{-\frac{2}{3}\alpha}).   Then we examine the convergence of trajectories to optimal solutions. As a new result, in the one-dimensional framework, for the critical value \alpha = 3 , we prove the convergence of the trajectories without any restrictive hypothesis on the convex function \Phi . In the second part of this paper, we study the convergence properties of the associated forward-backward inertial algorithms. They aim to solve structured convex minimization problems of the form \min \left\lbrace \Theta:= \Phi + \Psi \right\rbrace, with \Phi smooth and \Psi nonsmooth. The continuous dynamics serves as a guideline for this study. We obtain a similar rate of convergence for the sequence of iterates (x_k): for \alpha \leq 3 we have \Theta (x_k)-\min \Theta = \mathcal O (k^{-p}) for all p <\frac{2\alpha}{3} , and for \alpha > 3 \ \Theta (x_k)-\min \Theta = o (k^{-2}) . We conclude this study by showing that the results are robust with respect to external perturbations.
