Macroscopic models of crowd flow incorporating individual pedestrian choices present many analytic and computational challenges. Anisotropic interactions are particularly subtle, both in terms of describing the correct "optimal" direction field for the pedestrians and ensuring that this field is uniquely defined. We develop sufficient conditions, which establish a range of "safe" densities and parameter values for each model. We illustrate our approach by analyzing several established intra-crowd and inter-crowd models. For the two-crowd case, we also develop sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of Nash Equilibria in the resulting non-zero-sum game.
