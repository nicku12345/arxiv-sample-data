This paper addresses optimal feedback selection for generic arbitrary pole placement of structured systems when each feedback edge is associated with a cost. Given a structured system and a feedback cost matrix, our aim is to find a feasible feedback matrix of minimum cost that guarantees arbitrary pole placement of the closed-loop structured system. We first give a polynomial time reduction of the weighted set cover problem to an instance of the feedback selection problem and thereby show that the problem is NP-hard. Then we prove the inapproximability of the problem by showing that constant factor approximation for the problem does not exist unless the set cover problem can be approximated within a constant factor. Since the problem is hard, we study a subclass of systems whose directed acyclic graph constructed using the strongly connected components of the state digraph is a line graph and the state bipartite graph has a perfect matching. We propose a polynomial time optimal algorithm based on dynamic programming for solving the problem on this class of systems. Further, over the same class of systems we relax the perfect matching assumption, and provide a polynomial time 2-optimal solution based on dynamic programming and a minimum cost perfect matching algorithm.
