We characterise optimality of bolus insulin inputs, to the Bergman minimal model, by the predicted behaviour of the plasma glucose concentration for a given disturbance. The result is derived subject to the constraints that the plasma glucose concentration must attain but not go below a specified minimum value and the bolus input is rectangular. We give numerical examples of the results for the Hovorka model.
