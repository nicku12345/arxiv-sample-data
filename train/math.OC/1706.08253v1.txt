Given a finite Borel measure \mu on R n and basic semi-algebraic sets \Omega\_i \subset R n , i = 1,. .. , p, we provide a systematic numerical scheme to approximate as closely as desired \mu(\cup\_i \Omega\_i), when all moments of \mu are available (and finite). More precisely , we provide a hierarchy of semidefinite programs whose associated sequence of optimal values is monotone and converges to the desired value from above. The same methodology applied to the complement R n \ (\cup\_i \Omega\_i) provides a monotone sequence that converges to the desired value from below. When \mu is the Lebesgue measure we assume that \Omega := \cup\_i \Omega\_i is compact and contained in a known box B and in this case the complement is taken to be B \ \Omega. In fact, not only \mu(\Omega) but also every finite vector of moments of \mu\_\Omega (the restriction of \mu on \Omega) can be approximated as closely as desired, and so permits to approximate the integral on \Omega of any given polynomial.
