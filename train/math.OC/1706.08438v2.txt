In Speakman and Lee (2017), we analytically developed the idea of using volume as a measure for comparing relaxations in the context of spatial branch-and-bound. Specifically, for trilinear monomials, we analytically compared the three possible "double-McCormick relaxations" with the tight convex-hull relaxation. Here, again using volume as a measure, for the convex-hull relaxation of trilinear monomials, we establish simple rules for determining the optimal branching variable and optimal branching point. Additionally, we compare our results with current software practice.
