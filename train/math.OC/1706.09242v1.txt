Hyperspectral analysis has gained popularity over recent years as a way to infer what materials are displayed on a picture whose pixels consist of a mixture of spectral signatures. Computing both signatures and mixture coefficients is known as unsupervised unmixing, a set of techniques usually based on non-negative matrix factorization. Unmixing is a difficult non-convex problem, and algorithms may converge to one out of many local minima, which may be far removed from the true global minimum. Computing this true minimum is NP-hard and seems therefore out of reach. Aiming for interesting local minima, we investigate the addition of total variation regularization terms. Advantages of these regularizers are two-fold. Their computation is typically rather light, and they are deemed to preserve sharp edges in pictures. This paper describes an algorithm for regularized hyperspectral unmixing based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers.
