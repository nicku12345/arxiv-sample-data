Reliable estimation (or measurement) of vehicle states has always been an active topic of research in the automotive industry and academia. Among the vehicle states, vehicle speed has a priority due to its critical importance in traction and stability control. Moreover, the emergence of new generation of communication technologies has brought a new avenue to traditional studies on vehicle estimation and control. To this end, this paper introduces a set of distributed function calculation algorithms for vehicle networks, robust to communication failures. The introduced algorithms enable each vehicle to gather information from other vehicles in the network in a distributed manner. A procedure to use such a bank of information for a single vehicle to diagnose and correct a possible fault in its own speed estimation/measurement is discussed. The functionality and performance of the proposed algorithms are verified via illustrative examples and simulation results.
