Dearing and Zeck presented a dual algorithm for the problem of the minimum covering ball in \mathbb{R}^n. Each iteration of their algorithm has a computational complexity of at least \mathcal O(n^3). In this paper we propose a modification to their algorithm that, together with an implementation that uses updates to the QR factorization of a suitable matrix, achieves a \mathcal O(n^2) iteration.
