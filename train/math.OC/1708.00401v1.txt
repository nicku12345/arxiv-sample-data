Factor analysis aims to describe high dimensional random vectors by means of a small number of unknown common factors. In mathematical terms, it is required to decompose the covariance matrix \Sigma of the random vector as the sum of a diagonal matrix D | accounting for the idiosyncratic noise in the data | and a low rank matrix R | accounting for the variance of the common factors | in such a way that the rank of R is as small as possible so that the number of common factors is minimal. In practice, however, the matrix \Sigma is unknown and must be replaced by its estimate, i.e. the sample covariance, which comes from a finite amount of data. This paper provides a strategy to account for the uncertainty in the estimation of \Sigma in the factor analysis problem.
