This paper presents a novel modified Viterbi algorithm to identify the optimal distribution system restoration plan for improving the grid resiliency. In the proposed algorithm, the switching operations performed for system restoration are the states with the minimum bus voltage being seen as the cost metric for each state and the extent of load recovery as the observed event. When full load recovery is spotted, the dynamic programming algorithm stops, thereby giving the least number of switching pairs necessary for system restoration. Moreover, an improved flexible switching pair operation is employed to maintain the radial nature of distribution system. Several case studies are presented for verifying the performance of the proposed strategy. Multi-fault conditions are considered in testing the system restoration scheme on 33-bus and 69-bus distribution systems. Furthermore, the effects of integrating distributed energy resources and microgrid systems are analyzed.
