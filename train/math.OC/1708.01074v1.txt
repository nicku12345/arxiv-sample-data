In this paper we present some new results on the existence of solutions of generalized variational inequalities in real reflexive Banach spaces with Fr\'echet differentiable norms. Moreover, we also give some theorems about the structure of solution sets. The results obtained in this paper improve and extend the ones announced by Fang and Peterson [1] to infinite dimensional spaces.
