An optimal control based methodology is proposed for minimising the combustible fuel consumption of a hybrid vehicle equipped with an internal combustion engine, a high-speed flywheel and a battery. The three-dimensionality of the road is recognised by the optimal control calculations. Fuel efficiency is achieved by optimally exploiting the primary and secondary energy sources and controlling the vehicle so that the fuel consumption is minimised for a given, but arbitrary three-dimensional route. A time-of-arrival constraint rather than a driving cycle is used. The benefits of using multiple auxiliary storage systems are demonstrated and a lower-bound estimate of the fuel consumption is presented.
