This paper deals with the exponential stabilization of a time-delay system with an average of the state as the output. A general stability theorem with a guaranteed exponential decay-rate based on a Wirtinger-based inequality is provided. Variations of this theorem for synthesis of a controller or for an observer-based control is derived. Some numerical comparisons are proposed with existing theorems of the literature and comparable results are obtained but with an extension to stabilization.
