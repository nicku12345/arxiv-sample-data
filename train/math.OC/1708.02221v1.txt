In this paper we consider the distributed estimation problem for continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. A single linear plant is observed by a network of local observers. Each local observer in the network has access to only part of the output of the observed system, but can also receive information on the state estimates of its neigbours. Each local observer should in this way generate an estimate of the plant state. In this paper we study the problem of existence of a reduced order distributed observer. We show that if the observed system is observable and the network graph is a strongly connected directed graph, then a distributed observer exists with state space dimension equal to Nn - \sum_{i =1}^N p_i, where N is the number of network nodes, n is the state space dimension of the observed plant, and p_i is the rank of the output matrix of the observed output received by the ith local observer. In the case of a single observer, this result specializes to the well-known minimal order observer in classical observer design.
