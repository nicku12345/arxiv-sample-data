Bilinear systems emerge in a wide variety of fields as natural models for dynamical systems ranging from robotics to quantum dots. Analyzing controllability of such systems is of fundamental and practical importance, for example, for the design of optimal control laws, stabilization of unstable systems, and minimal realization of input-output relations. Tools from Lie theory have been adopted to establish controllability conditions for bilinear systems, and the most notable development was the Lie algebra rank condition (LARC). However, the application of the LARC may be computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems. In this paper, we present an alternative and effective algebraic approach to investigate controllability of bilinear systems. The central idea is to map Lie bracket operations of the vector fields governing the system dynamics to permutation multiplications on a symmetric group, so that controllability and controllable submanifolds can be characterized by permutation cycles. The method is further applicable to characterize controllability of systems defined on undirected graphs, such as multi-agent systems with controlled couplings between agents and Markov chains with tunable transition rates between states, which in turn reveals a graph representation of controllability through the graph connectivity.
