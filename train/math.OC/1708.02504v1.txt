In this paper we study the exact boundary controllability for the following Boussinesq equation with variable physical parameters:   \begin{array}{lll} \rho(x)y_{tt}=-(\sigma(x)y_{xx})_{xx}+(q(x)y_x)_x-(y^2)_{xx},&&t>0,~x\in(0,l),\\ y(t,0)=\sigma(l)y_{xx}(t,0)=y(t,l)=0,~~\sigma(l)y_{xx}(t,l)=u(t)&&t>0,   \end{array} where l>0, the coefficients \rho(x)>0,\sigma(x)>0 , q(x)\geq0 in [0,l] and u is the control acting at the end x=l. We prove that the linearized problem is exactly controllable in any time T>0. Our approach is essentially based on a detailed spectral analysis together with the moment method. Furthermore, we establish the local exact controllability for the nonlinear problem by fixed point argument.
