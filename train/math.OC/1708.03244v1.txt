With the emerging of smart grid techniques, cyber attackers may be able to gain access to critical energy infrastructure data and strategic market participants may be able to identify offer prices of their rivals. This paper discusses a privacy-preserving economic dispatch approach in competitive electricity market, in which individual generation companies (GENCOs) and load serving entities (LSEs) can mask their actual bidding information and physical data by multiplying with random numbers before submitting to Independent System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Owners (RTOs). This would avoid potential information leakage of critical energy infrastructure and financial data of market participants. The optimal solution to the original ED problem, including optimal dispatches of generators and loads and locational marginal prices (LMPs), can be retrieved from the optimal solution of the proposed privacy-preserving ED approach. Numerical case studies show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for protecting private information of individual market participants while guaranteeing the same optimal ED solution. Computation and communication costs of the proposed privacy-preserving ED approach and the original ED are also compared in case studies.
