Study the general single-source shortest path problem. Firstly, define a path function on a set of some path with same source on a graph, and develop a kind of general single-source shortest path problem (GSSSP) on the defined path function. Secondly, following respectively the approaches of the well known Dijkstra's algorithm and Moore-Bellman-Ford algorithm, design an extended Dijkstra's algorithm (EDA) and an extended Moore-Bellman-Ford algorithm (EMBFA) to solve the problem GSSSP under certain given conditions. Thirdly, introduce a few concepts, such as order-preserving in last road (OPLR) of path function, and so on. And under the assumption that the value of related path function for any path can be obtained in M(n) time, prove respectively the algorithm EDA solving the problem GSSSP in O(n^2)M(n) time and the algorithm EMBFA solving the problem GSSSP in O(mn)M(n) time. Finally, some applications of the designed algorithms are shown with a few examples. What we done can improve both the researchers and the applications of the shortest path theory.
