In this paper we deal with a robust Stackelberg strategy for the Navier--Stokes system. The scheme is based in considering a robust control problem for the "follower control" and its associated disturbance function. Afterwards, we consider the notion of Stackelberg optimization (which is associated to the "leader control") in order to deduce a local null controllability result for the Navier--Stokes system.
