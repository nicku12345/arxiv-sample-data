Recently, penalties promoting signals that are sparse within and across groups have been proposed. In this letter, we propose a generalization that allows to encode more intricate dependencies within groups. However, this complicates the realization of the threshold function associated with the penalty, which hinders the use of the penalty in energy minimization. We discuss how to sidestep this problem, and demonstrate the use of the modified penalty in an energy minimization formulation for an inverse problem.
