We introduce a new model for the chromatic number \chi(G) based on what we call combinatorial projection matrices, which is a special class of doubly stochastic symmetric projection matrices. Relaxing this models yields an SDP whose optimal value is the projection theta number \hat{\vartheta}(G), which is closely related to the Szegedy number \vartheta^+(G), a variant of the Lov\'{a}sz theta number. We characterize that in general, \hat{\vartheta}(G)\leq \vartheta^+(G), with equality if G is vertex-transitive. While this seems to imply that working with binary matrices is a better paradigm than working with binary eigenvalues in this context, our approach is slightly faster than computing the Szegedy number on vertex-transitive graphs.
