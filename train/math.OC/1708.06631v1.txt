The paper introduces and studies the notions of Lipschitzian and H\"olderian full stability of solutions to three-parametric variational systems described in the generalized equation formalism involving nonsmooth base mappings and partial subgradients of prox-regular functions acting in Hilbert spaces. Employing advanced tools and techniques of second-order variational analysis allows us to establish complete characterizations of, as well as directly verifiable sufficient conditions for, such full stability notions under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we derive exact formulas and effective quantitative estimates for the corresponding moduli. The obtained results are specified for important classes of variational inequalities and variational conditions in both finite and infinite dimensions.
