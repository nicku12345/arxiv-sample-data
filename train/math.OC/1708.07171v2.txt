Subject to reasonable conditions, in large population stochastic dynamics games, where the agents are coupled by the system's mean field (i.e. the state distribution of the generic agent) through their nonlinear dynamics and their nonlinear cost functions, it can be shown that a best response control action for each agent exists which (i) depends only upon the individual agent's state observations and the mean field, and (ii) achieves a \epsilon-Nash equilibrium for the system. In this work we formulate a class of problems where each agent has only partial observations on its individual state. We employ nonlinear filtering theory and the Separation Principle in order to analyze the game in the asymptotically infinite population limit. The main result is that the \epsilon-Nash equilibrium property holds where the best response control action of each agent depends upon the conditional density of its own state generated by a nonlinear filter, together with the system's mean field. Finally, comparing this MFG problem with state estimation to that found in the literature with a major agent whose partially observed state process is independent of the control action of any individual agent, it is seen that, in contrast, the partially observed state process of any agent in this work depends upon that agent's control action.
