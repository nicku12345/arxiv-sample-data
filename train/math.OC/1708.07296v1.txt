This paper deals with transient stability in interconnected micro-grids. The main contribution involves i) robust classification of transient dynamics for different intervals of the micro-grid parameters (synchronization, inertia, and damping); ii) exploration of the analogies with consensus dynamics and bounds on the damping coefficient separating underdamped and overdamped dynamics iii) the extension to the case of disturbed measurements due to hackering or parameter uncertainties.
