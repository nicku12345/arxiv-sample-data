This paper presents global tracking strategies for the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. It is well known that global attractivity is prohibited for continuous attitude control systems on the special orthogonal group. Such topological restriction has been dealt with either by constructing smooth attitude control systems that exclude a set of measure zero in the region of attraction, or by introducing hybrid control systems to obtain global asymptotic stability. This paper proposes alternative attitude control systems that are continuous in time to achieve exponential stability, where the region of attraction covers the entire special orthogonal group. The main contribution of this paper is providing a new framework to overcome the topological restriction in attitude controls without relying on discontinuities through the controlled maneuvers. The efficacy of the proposed methods is illustrated by numerical simulations and experiments.
