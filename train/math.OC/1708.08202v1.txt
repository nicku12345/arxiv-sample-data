We consider two optimization problems in thermal insulation: in both cases the goal is to find a thin layer around the boundary of the thermal body which gives the best insulation. The total mass of the insulating material is prescribed.. The first problem deals with the case in which a given heat source is present, while in the second one there are no heat sources and the goal is to have the slowest decay of the temperature. In both cases an optimal distribution of the insulator around the thermal body exists; when the body has a circular symmetry, in the first case a constant heat source gives a constant thickness as the optimal solution, while surprisingly this is not the case in the second problem, where the circular symmetry of the optimal insulating layer depends on the total quantity of insulator at our disposal. A symmetry breaking occurs when this total quantity is below a certain threshold. Some numerical computations are also provided, together with a list of open questions.
