This paper is concerned with fault estimation in a class of nonlinear fractional order systems using a new super twisting algorithm based second order step by step sliding mode observer. Since the existing sliding mode observers are troubled with the chattering phenomenon, here a new observer structure is proposed and finite time convergence of error dynamics is proved using fractional order super twisting algorithm (FSTA). Two numerical examples of chaotic fractional order systems and a comparison with respect to a similar observer justify the effectiveness of the proposed observer
