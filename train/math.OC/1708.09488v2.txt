Photolithography is typically the bottleneck process in semiconductor manufacturing. In this paper, we present a model for optimizing the scheduling of the photolithography process in the presence of both individual and cluster tools. The combination of these individual and cluster tools that process various layers (stages) of the semiconductor manufacturing process flow is a special type of flexible flowshop. We seek separately to minimize total weighted completion time and maximize on-time delivery performance. Experimental results suggest that our solution algorithms show promise for real world implementation as they can help to improve resource utilization, reduce job completion times, and decrease unnecessary delays in a wafer fab.
