The quadratic assignment problem is a well-known optimization problem with numerous applications. A common strategy to solve it is to use one of its linearizations and then apply the toolbox of mixed integer linear programming methods. One measure of quality of a mixed integer formulation is the quality of its linear relaxation. In this paper, we compare two linearizations of the quadratic assignment problem and prove that the linear relaxation of the linearization of Adams and Johnson is contained in the linear relaxation of the linearization of Xia and Yuan. We furthermore develop a Branch and Cut approach using the insights obtained in the proof that enhances the linearization of Xia and Yuan via a new family of cuts called ab-cuts.
