In this paper, we establish a weight identity for stochastic beam equation by means of the multiplier method. Based on this identity, we first establish the global Carleman estimate for the special system with zero initial value and end value, then a revised Carleman estimate for stochastic beam equation is established through a cutoff technique. Finally, we use the revised Carleman estimate to get the required boundary observability estimate.
