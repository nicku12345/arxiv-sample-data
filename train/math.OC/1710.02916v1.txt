We consider a class of linear-quadratic-Gaussian mean-field games with a major agent and considerable heterogeneous minor agents in the presence of mean-field interactions. The individual admissible controls are constrained in closed convex subsets \Gamma_{k} of \mathbb{R}^{m}. The decentralized strategies for individual agents and consistency condition system are represented in an unified manner through a class of mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equations involving projection operators on \Gamma_{k}. The well-posedness of consistency system is established in both the local and global cases by the contraction mapping and discounting method respectively. Related \varepsilon-Nash equilibrium property is also verified.
