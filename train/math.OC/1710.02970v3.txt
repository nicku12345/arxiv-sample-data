This paper deals with optimal transmission switching (OTS) problems involving discrete binary decisions about network topology and non-convex power flow constraints. We adopt a semidefinite programming formulation for the OPF problem which, however, remains nonconvex due to the presence of discrete variables and bilinear products between the decision variables. To tackle the latter, we introduce a novel physically-inspired, virtual-voltage approximation that leads to provable lower and upper bounds on the solution of the original problem. To deal with the exponential complexity caused by the discrete variables, we introduce a graph partition-based algorithm which breaks the problem into several parallel mixed-integer subproblems of smaller size. Simulations demonstrate the high degree of accuracy and affordable computational requirements of our approach.
