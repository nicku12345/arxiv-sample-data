This paper focuses on a stochastic formulation of Bayesian attitude estimation on the special orthogonal group. In particular, an exponential probability density model for random matrices, referred to as the matrix Fisher distribution is used to represent the uncertainties of attitude estimates and measurements in a global fashion. Various stochastic properties of the matrix Fisher distribution are derived on the special orthogonal group, and based on these, two types of intrinsic frameworks for Bayesian attitude estimation are constructed. These avoid complexities or singularities of the attitude estimators developed in terms of quaternions. The proposed approaches are particularly useful to deal with large estimation errors or large uncertainties for complex maneuvers to obtain accurate estimates of the attitude.
