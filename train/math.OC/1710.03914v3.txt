We consider an energy storage problem involving a wind farm with a forecasted power output, a stochastic load, an energy storage device, and a connection to the larger power grid with stochastic prices. Electricity prices and wind power forecast errors are modeled using a novel hidden semi-Markov model that accurately replicates not just the distribution of the errors, but also crossing times, capturing the amount of time each process stays above or below some benchmark such as the forecast. This is an important property of stochastic processes involved in storage problems. We show that we achieve more robust solutions using this model than when more common stochastic models are considered. The new model introduces some additional complexity to the problem as its information states are partially hidden, forming a partially observable Markov decision process. We derive a near-optimal time-dependent policy using backward approximate dynamic programming, which overcomes the computational hurdles of classical (exact) backward dynamic programming, with higher quality solutions than the more familiar forward approximate dynamic programming methods.
