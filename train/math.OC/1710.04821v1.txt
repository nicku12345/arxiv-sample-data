We consider an isoperimetric inequality for (m+1)-dimensional area minimizing submanifolds of arbitrary codimension which lie outside a convex set \mathcal{K} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1} and are bounded by a submanifold of \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \setminus \mathcal{K} and the convex set \mathcal{K}. We show that the least value of the isoperimetric ratio is attained for an (m+1)-dimensional flat half-disk of \mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+. This extends prior work of Choe, Ghomi, and Ritor\'{e} in codimension one and proves a conjecture of Choe in the case of relative area minimizers.
