Electric vehicle (EV) charging can negatively impact electric distribution networks by exceeding equipment thermal ratings and causing voltages to drop below standard ranges. In this paper, we develop a decentralized EV charging control scheme to achieve "valley-filling" (i.e., flattening demand profile during overnight charging), meanwhile meeting heterogeneous individual charging requirements and satisfying distribution network constraints. The formulated problem is an optimization problem with a non-separable objective function and strongly coupled inequality constraints. We propose a novel shrunken primal-dual subgradient (SPDS) algorithm to support the decentralized control scheme, derive conditions guaranteeing its convergence, and verify its efficacy and convergence with a representative distribution network model.
