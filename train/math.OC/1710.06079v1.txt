In this paper, we study the approximate controllability for the stochastic heat equation over measurable sets, and the optimal actuator location of the minimum norm controls. We formulate a relaxed optimization problem for both actuator location and its corresponding minimum norm control into a two-person zero sum game problem and develop a sufficient and necessary condition for the optimal solution via Nash equilibrium. At last, we prove that the relaxed optimal solution is an optimal actuator location for the classical problem.
