We tackle highly nonconvex, nonsmooth composite optimization problems whose objectives comprise a Moreau-Yosida regularized term. Classical nonconvex proximal splitting algorithms, such as nonconvex ADMM, suffer from lack of convergence for such a problem class. To overcome this difficulty, in this work we consider a lifted variant of the Moreau-Yosida regularized model and propose a novel multiblock primal-dual algorithm that intrinsically stabilizes the dual block. We provide a complete convergence analysis of our algorithm and identify respective optimality qualifications under which stationarity of the original model is retrieved at convergence. Numerically, we demonstrate the relevance of Moreau-Yosida regularized models and the efficiency of our algorithm on robust regression as well as joint feature selection and semi-supervised learning.
