In this paper we present a linear method for the identification of both the energy and flux relaxation kernels in the equation of thermodynamics with memory proposed by M.E. Gurtin and A.G. Pipkin. The method reduces the identification of the two kernels to the solution of two (linear) deconvolution problems. The energy relaxation kernel is reconstructed by means of energy measurements as the solution of a Volterra integral equation of the first kind which does not depend on the still unknown flux relaxation kernel. Then, flux measurements are used to identify the flux relaxation kernel.
