We study some optimal control problems on networks with junctions, approximate the junctions by a switching rule of delay-relay type and study the passage to the limit when \varepsilon, the parameter of the approximation, goes to zero. First, for a twofold junction problem we characterize the limit value function as viscosity solution and maximal subsolution of a suitable Hamilton-Jacobi problem. Then, for a threefold junction problem we consider two different approximations, recovering in both cases some uniqueness results in the sense of maximal subsolution.
