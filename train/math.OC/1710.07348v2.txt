For the problem of sparse recovery, it is widely accepted that nonconvex minimizations are better than \ell_1 penalty in enhancing the sparsity of solution. However, to date, the theory verifying that nonconvex penalties outperform (or are at least as good as) \ell_1 minimization in exact, uniform recovery has mostly been limited to separable cases. In this paper, we establish general recovery guarantees through null space conditions for nonconvex, non-separable regularizations, which are slightly less demanding than the standard null space property for \ell_1 minimization.
