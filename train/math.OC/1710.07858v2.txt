We disclose an interesting connection between the gradient flow of a \mathcal{C}^2-smooth function \psi and evanescent orbits of the second order gradient system defined by the square-norm of \nabla\psi, under adequate convexity assumption. As a consequence, we obtain the following surprising result for two \mathcal{C}^2, convex and bounded from below functions \psi_1, \psi_2: if ||\nabla\psi_1||=||\nabla\psi_2||, then \psi_1=\psi_2 + k, for some k\in \mathbb{R}.
