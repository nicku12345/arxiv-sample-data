It is the aim of this work provide a rigorous treatment concerning the formation of spatial rational expectations equlibria in a general class of spatial economic models under the effect of externalities, using techniques from the calculus of variations. Using detailed estimates for a para-metric optimisation problem, the existence of spatial rational expectations equilibria is proved and they are characterised in terms of a nonlocal Euler-Lagrange equation.
