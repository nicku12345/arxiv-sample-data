In this note, we consider a framework for the analysis of iterative algorithms which can described in terms of a structured set-valued operator. More precisely, at each point in the ambient space, we assume that the value of operator can be expressed as a finite union of values of single-valued paracontracting operators. Our main result, which shows that the associated fixed point iteration is locally convergent around strong fixed points, generalises a theorem due to Bauschke and Noll (2014).
