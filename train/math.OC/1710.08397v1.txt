We consider optimal control problems where the state equation is an elliptic PDE of a Schr\"odinger type, governed by the Laplace operator -\Delta with the addition of a potential V, and the control is the potential V itself, that may vary in a suitable admissible class. In a previous paper (Ref. [7]) an existence result was established under a monotonicity assumption on the cost functional, which occurs if the data do not change sign. In the present paper this sign assumption is removed and the existence of an optimal potential is still valid. Several numerical simulations, made by FreeFem++, are shown
