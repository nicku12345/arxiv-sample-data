Given a non-convex twice continuously differentiable cost function with Lipschitz continuous gradient, we prove that all of block coordinate gradient descent, block mirror descent and proximal block coordinate descent converge to a local minimizer, almost surely with random initialization. Furthermore, we show that these results also hold true even for the cost functions with non-isolated critical points.
