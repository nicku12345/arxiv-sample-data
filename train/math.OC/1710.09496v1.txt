We propose convex optimization algorithms to recover a good approximation of a point measure \mu on the unit sphere S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n from its moments with respect to a set of real-valued functions f_1,\dots, f_m. Given a finite subset C\subseteq S the algorithm produces a measure \mu^* supported on C and we prove that \mu^* is a good approximation to \mu whenever the functions f_1,\dots, f_m are a sufficiently large random sample of independent Kostlan-Shub-Smale polynomials. More specifically, we give sufficient conditions for the validity of the equality \mu=\mu^* when \mu is supported on C and prove that \mu^* is close to the best approximation to \mu supported on C provided that all points in the support of \mu are close to C.
