This paper addresses input-to-state stability (ISS) properties with respect to boundary and in-domain disturbances for a class of semi-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. The developed approach is a combination of the method of De Giorgi iteration and the technique of Lyapunov functionals by adequately splitting the original problem into two subsystems. The ISS in L^\infty-norm for a 1-D transport equation and the ISS in L^2-norm for Burgers' equation have been established using this method. As an application of the main result for the 1-D transport equation, a study on ISS properties in L^\infty-norm of a 1-D transport equation with anti-stable term under boundary feedback control is carried out. This is the first time that the method of De Giorgi iteration is introduced in the ISS theory for infinite dimensional systems, and the developed method can be generalized for tackling some problems on multidimensional spatial domains and be applied to a wider class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs.
