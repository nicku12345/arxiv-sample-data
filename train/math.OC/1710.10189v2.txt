This paper focuses on integer linear programs where solutions are binary matrices, and the corresponding symmetry group is the set of all column permutations. Orbitopal fixing, as introduced by Kaibel et al., is a technique designed to break symmetries in the special case of partitioning (resp. packing) formulations involving matrices with exactly (resp. at most) one 1-entry in each row.The main result of this paper is to extend orbitopal fixing to the full orbitope, defined as the convex hull of binary matrices with lexicographically nonincreasing columns.We determine all the variables whose values are fixed in the intersection of an hypercube face with the full orbitope.Sub-symmetries arising in a given subset of matrices are also considered, thus leading to define the full sub-orbitope in the case of the sub-symmetric group.We propose a linear time orbitopal fixing algorithm handling both symmetries and sub-symmetries.We introduce a dynamic variant of this algorithm where the lexicographical order follows the branching decisions occurring alongthe B&B search. Experimental results for the Unit Commitment Problem are presented. A comparison with state-of-the-art techniques is considered to show the effectiveness of the proposed variants of the algorithm.
