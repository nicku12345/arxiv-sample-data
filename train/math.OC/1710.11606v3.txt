We prove lower bounds on the complexity of finding \epsilon-stationary points (points x such that \|\nabla f(x)\| \le \epsilon) of smooth, high-dimensional, and potentially non-convex functions f. We consider oracle-based complexity measures, where an algorithm is given access to the value and all derivatives of f at a query point x. We show that for any (potentially randomized) algorithm \mathsf{A}, there exists a function f with Lipschitz pth order derivatives such that \mathsf{A} requires at least \epsilon^{-(p+1)/p} queries to find an \epsilon-stationary point. Our lower bounds are sharp to within constants, and they show that gradient descent, cubic-regularized Newton's method, and generalized pth order regularization are worst-case optimal within their natural function classes.
