In this paper, we discuss the solution of a Quadratic Eigenvalue Complementarity Problem (QEiCP) by using Difference of Convex (DC) programming approaches. We first show that QEiCP can be represented as dc programming problem. Then we investigate different dc programming formulations of QEiCP and discuss their dc algorithms based on a well-known method -- DCA. A new local dc decomposition is proposed which aims at constructing a better dc decomposition regarding to the specific feature of the target problem in some neighborhoods of the iterates. This new procedure yields faster convergence and better precision of the computed solution. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the new dc algorithms in practice.
