This paper presents a new iterative state estimation algorithm for advection dominated flows with non-Gaussian uncertainty description of L^\infty-type: uncertain initial condition and model error are assumed to be pointvise bounded in space and time, and the observation noise has uncertain but bounded second moments. The algorithm approximates this L^\infty-type bounding set by a union of possibly overlapping ellipsoids, which are localized (in space) on a number of sub-domains. On each sub-domain the state of the original system is estimated by the standard L^2-type filter (e.g. Kalman/minimax filter) which uses Gaussian/ellipsoidal uncertainty description and observations (if any) which correspond to this sub-domain. The resulting local state estimates are stitched together by the iterative d-ADN Schwartz method to reconstruct the state of the original system. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated with a set of numerical examples.
