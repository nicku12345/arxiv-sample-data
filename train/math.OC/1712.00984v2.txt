In this paper, we introduce an inertial version of the Proximal Incremental Aggregated Gradient method (PIAG) for minimizing the sum of smooth convex component functions and a possibly nonsmooth convex regularization function. Theoretically, we show that the inertial Proximal Incremental Aggregated Gradiend (iPIAG) method enjoys a global linear convergence under a quadratic growth condition, which is strictly weaker than strong convexity, provided that the stepsize is not larger than a constant. Moreover, we present two numerical expreiments which demonstrate that iPIAG outperforms the original PIAG.
