Finite-dimensional dissipative dynamical systems with multiple time-scales are obtained when modeling chemical reaction kinetics with ordinary differential equations. Such stiff systems are computationally hard to solve and therefore, optimal control problems which contain ordinary differential equations as infinitesimal constraints are even more difficult to handle. Model reduction might offer an approach to improve numerical efficiency as well as avoiding stiffness of such models. We show in this paper in benchmark fashion how attracting manifold computation methods could be exploited to solve optimal control more efficiently while having in mind the ambitious long-term goal to apply them to real-time control problems in chemical kinetics.
