We consider the problem of boundary control for a vibrating string with N interior point masses. We assume the control is at the left end, and the string is fixed at the right end. Singularities in waves are "smoothed" out to one order as they cross a point mass. We characterize the reachable set for a L^2 control. The control problem is reduced to a moment problem, which is then solved using the theory of exponential divided differences in tandem with unique shape and velocity controllability results.
