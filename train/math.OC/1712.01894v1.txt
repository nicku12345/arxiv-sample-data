In this paper, we investigate the energy system design problems with the multi-generation technologies, i.e., simultaneous generation of multiple types of energy. We propose a long-term planning model which integrates macro-level strategic decisions such as facility location and multi-generation technology investment, and micro-level operational decisions such as production planning and energy transportation. Our results illustrate the economic value of multi-generation technologies in lieu of the spatio-temporal demand uncertainty for energy. In particular, we show that the multi-generation technologies can reduce demand uncertainty by risk pooling both within and across different facilities.
