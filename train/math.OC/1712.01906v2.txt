The strong growth condition (SGC) is known to be a sufficient condition for linear convergence of the stochastic gradient method using a constant step-size \gamma (SGM-CS). In this paper, we provide a necessary condition, for the linear convergence of SGM-CS, that is weaker than SGC. Moreover, when this necessary is violated up to a additive perturbation \sigma, we show that both the projected stochastic gradient method using a constant step-size (PSGM-CS) and the proximal stochastic gradient method exhibit linear convergence to a noise dominated region, whose distance to the optimal solution is proportional to \gamma \sigma.
