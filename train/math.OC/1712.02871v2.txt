We construct an approximate public-signal correlated equilibrium for a nonzero-sum differential game in the class of stochastic strategies with memory. The construction is based on a solution of an auxiliary nonzero-sum continuous-time stochastic game. This class of games includes stochastic differential games and continuous-time Markov games. Moreover, we study the limit of approximate equilibrium outcomes in the case when the auxiliary stochastic games tend to the original deterministic one. We show that it lies in the convex hull of the set of equilibrium values provided by deterministic punishment strategies.
