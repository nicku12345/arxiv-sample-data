This paper addresses the compliance minimization of a truss, where the number of available nodes is limited. It is shown that this optimization problem can be recast as a second-order cone programming with a cardinality constraint. We propose a simple heuristic based on the alternative direction method of multipliers. The efficiency of the proposed method is compared with a global optimization approach based on mixed-integer second-order cone programming. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method often finds a solution having a good objective value with small computational cost.
