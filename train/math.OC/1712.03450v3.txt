This paper presents reduction theorems for stability, attractivity, and asymptotic stability of compact subsets of the state space of a hybrid dynamical system. Given two closed sets \Gamma_1 \subset \Gamma_2 \subset \Re^n, with \Gamma_1 compact, the theorems presented in this paper give conditions under which a qualitative property of \Gamma_1 that holds relative to \Gamma_2 (stability, attractivity, or asymptotic stability) can be guaranteed to also hold relative to the state space of the hybrid system. As a consequence of these results, sufficient conditions are presented for the stability of compact sets in cascade-connected hybrid systems. We also present a result for hybrid systems with outputs that converge to zero along solutions. If such a system enjoys a detectability property with respect to a set \Gamma_1, then \Gamma_1 is globally attractive. The theory of this paper is used to develop a hybrid estimator for the period of oscillation of a sinusoidal signal.
