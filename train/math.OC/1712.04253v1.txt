In this paper, we introduce the concept of Z_1-eigenvalue to infinite dimensional generalized Hilbert tensors (hypermatrix) \mathcal{H}_\lambda^{\infty}=(\mathcal{H}_{i_{1}i_{2}\cdots i_{m}}),      \mathcal{H}_{i_{1}i_{2}\cdots i_{m}}=\frac{1}{i_{1}+i_{2}+\cdots i_{m}+\lambda},\   \lambda\in \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Z}^-;\ i_{1},i_{2},\cdots,i_{m}=0,1,2,\cdots,n,\cdots,      and proved that its Z_1-spectral radius is not larger than \pi for \lambda>\frac{1}{2}, and is at most \frac{\pi}{\sin{\lambda\pi}} for \frac{1}{2}\geq \lambda>0. Besides, the upper bound of Z_1-spectral radius of an mth-order n-dimensional generalized Hilbert tensor \mathcal{H}_\lambda^n is obtained also, and such a bound only depends on n and \lambda.
