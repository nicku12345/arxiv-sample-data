Nowadays common practice in deploying photovoltaic distributed generations (PVDGs) is customer-based installation in the distribution network. Increasing level of PVDG applications and expedite approval by utilities have raised concern about the negative impacts of PVDG installations on the distribution network operations such as reverse power flows and undesirable voltage fluctuations. One potential solutions is to optimize the siting and sizing of these distributed renewable generation resources. This paper presents a comparative study on both optimal and randomized installation of PVDGs with the latter modeling real life customer-based renewable integration. The proposed models examine and compare the impacts of PVDG installation on distribution network operation. Numerical simulations have been performed on a local distribution network model with realistic load profiles, GIS information, local solar insolation, and feeder and voltage settings. It is found that when the distribution system has a medium penetration ratio optimal PVDG installations may introduce essential improvements in terms of voltage deviation and energy loss reduction than randomized installation. However, if the penetration ratio is very low or extremely high there will be not significant difference between the two.
