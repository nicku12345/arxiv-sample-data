This article develops a duality principle for a semi-linear model in micro-magnetism. The results are obtained through standard tools of convex analysis and the Legendre transform concept. We emphasize the dual variational formulation presented is concave and suitable for numerical computations. Moreover, sufficient conditions of optimality are also established.
