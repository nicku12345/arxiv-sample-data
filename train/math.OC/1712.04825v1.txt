In this paper we present explicit estimate for Lipschitz constant of solution to a problem of calculus of variations. The approach we use is due to Gamkrelidze and is based on the equivalence of the problem of calculus of variations and a time-optimal control problem. The obtained estimate is used to compute complexity bounds for a path-following method applied to a convex problem of calculus of variations with polyhedral end-point constraints.
