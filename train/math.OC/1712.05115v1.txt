In this corrigendum, an error in the proof of a theorem in [Linear Algebra and its Applications 509 (2016) 82--113] is pointed out. This theorem states that every graph T_n consisting of n-2 triangles sharing a common base is SPN. An alternative proof is given here for the case n=5, but for all n>5 it remains open whether T_n is SPN. As a result, the question whether K_{2,n}, n>4, is SPN also remains open.
