The goal of this work is to improve focusing of high-intensity ultrasound by modifying the geometry of acoustic lenses through shape optimization. The shape optimization problem is formulated by introducing a tracking-type cost functional to match a desired pressure distribution in the focal region. Westervelt's equation, a nonlinear acoustic wave equation, is used to model the pressure field. We apply the optimize first, then discretize approach, where we first rigorously compute the shape derivative of our cost functional. A gradient-based optimization algorithm is then developed within the concept of isogeometric analysis, where the geometry is exactly represented by splines at every gradient step and the same basis is used to approximate the equations. Numerical experiments in a 2D setting illustrate our findings.
