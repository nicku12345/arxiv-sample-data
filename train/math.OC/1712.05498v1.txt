We consider a finite state, finite action, zero-sum stochastic games with data defining the game lying in the ordered field of algebraic numbers. In both the discounted and the limiting average versions of these games we prove that the value vector also lies in the same field of algebraic numbers. In a prescribed sense, our results settle a problem that has remained open since, at least, 1991.
