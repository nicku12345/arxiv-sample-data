In this short survey, I revisit the role of the proximal point method in large scale optimization. I focus on three recent examples: a proximally guided subgradient method for weakly convex stochastic approximation, the prox-linear algorithm for minimizing compositions of convex functions and smooth maps, and Catalyst generic acceleration for regularized Empirical Risk Minimization.
