This paper is devoted to the study of the stability and stabilizability of heat equation in non-cylindrical domain. The interesting thing is that there is a class of initial values such that the system is no longer exponentially stable. The system is only polynomially stable or only analogously exponentially stable. Then, the rapid exponential stabilization of the system is obtained by the backstepping method.
