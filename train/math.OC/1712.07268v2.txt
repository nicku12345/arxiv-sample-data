Increasing penetration of inverter-based distributed energy resources (DERs) opens up interesting opportunities for the transmission systems. We present a hypothesis that the numerous DERs in var control mode can be seen as geographically distributed var devices (mini-SVCs) and if controlled properly, can be exploited to increase system flexibility by providing local var support to the grid as an ancillary service. Based on this premise, a var support framework is proposed in this paper. It utilizes a novel D-OPF formulation for unbalanced three-phase feeders enabling the estimation of the maximum var support that can be provided by the DERs to the grid at different operating points without compromising the distribution network performance. Further, a co-simulation method is developed to investigate the true impact of the proposed DER var support on the grid in an integrated Transmission-Distribution (T-D) system.
