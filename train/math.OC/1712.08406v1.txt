This paper considers the backstepping design of state feedback controllers for coupled linear parabolic partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs) of Volterra-type with distinct diffusion coefficients, spatially-varying parameters and mixed boundary conditions. The corresponding target system is a cascade of parabolic PDEs with local couplings allowing a direct specification of the closed-loop stability margin. The determination of the state feedback controller leads to kernel equations, which are a system of coupled linear second-order hyperbolic PIDEs with spatially-varying coefficients and rather unusual boundary conditions. By extending the method of successive approximations for the scalar case to the considered system class, the well-posedness of these kernel equations is verified by providing a constructive solution procedure. This results in a systematic method for the backstepping control of coupled parabolic PIDEs as well as PDEs. The applicability of the new backstepping design method is confirmed by the stabilization of two coupled parabolic PIDEs with Dirichlet/Robin unactuated boundaries and a coupled Neumann/Dirichlet actuation.
