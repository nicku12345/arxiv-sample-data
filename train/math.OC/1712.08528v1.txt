In the past extensive researches have been conducted on demand side management (DSM) program which aims at reducing peak loads and saving electricity cost. In this paper, we propose a framework to study decentralized household demand side management in a residential distribution network which consists of multiple smart homes with schedulable electrical appliances and some rooftop photovoltaic generation units. Each smart home makes individual appliance scheduling to optimize the electric energy cost according to the day-ahead forecast of electricity prices and its willingness for convenience sacrifice. Using the developed simulation model, we examine the performance of decentralized household DSM and study their impacts on the distribution network operation and renewable integration, in terms of utilization efficiency of rooftop PV generation, overall voltage deviation, real power loss, and possible reverse power flows.
