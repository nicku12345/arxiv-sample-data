The support of a vector is the number of nonzero-components. We show that given an integral m\times n matrix A, the integer linear optimization problem \max\left\{\boldsymbol{c}^T\boldsymbol{x} : A\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{b}, \, \boldsymbol{x}\ge\boldsymbol{0}, \,\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{Z}^n\right\} has an optimal solution whose support is bounded by 2m \, \log (2 \sqrt{m} \| A \|_\infty), where  \| A \|_\infty is the largest absolute value of an entry of A. Compared to previous bounds, the one presented here is independent on the objective function. We furthermore provide a nearly matching asymptotic lower bound on the support of optimal solutions.
