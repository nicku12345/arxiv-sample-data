In a previous paper, the authors showed that in a reflexive Banach space the lower limit of a sequence of maximal monotone operators is always representable by a convex function. The present paper gives precisions to the latter result by demonstrating the continuity of the representation with respect to the epi-convergence of the representative functions, and the stability of the class of maximal monotone operators with respect to the Mosco-convergence of their representative functions.
