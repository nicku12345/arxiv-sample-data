This paper introduces a computationally efficient comparative approach to classical pricing rules for day-ahead electricity markets, namely Convex Hull Pricing, IP Pricing and European-like market rules, in a Power Exchange setting with non-convex demand bids. These demand bids can, for example, be useful to large industrial consumers, and extend demand block orders in use by European Power Exchanges. For this purpose, we show that Convex Hull Prices can be efficiently computed using continuous relaxations for bidding products involving start-up costs, minimum power output levels and ramp constraints, or analogous versions on the demand side. Relying on existing efficient algorithmic approaches to handle European-like market rules for such bidding products, we provide comparative numerical experiments using realistic data, which, together with stylized examples, elucidates the relative merits of each pricing rule from economic and computational perspectives. The motivation for this work is the prospective need for mid-term evolution of day-ahead markets in Europe and in the US, as well as the importance of day-ahead price signals, since these (spot) prices are used as reference prices for many power derivatives. The datasets, models and algorithms programmed in Julia/JuMP are provided in an online Git repository.
