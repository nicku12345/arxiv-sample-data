This paper investigates the problem on the minimum ellipsoid containing the intersection of multiple ellipsoids, which has been extensively applied to information science, target tracking and data fusion etc. There are three major relaxation methods involving SDP relaxation, S-procedure relaxation and bounding ellipsoid relaxation, which are derived by different ideas or viewpoints. However, it is unclear for the interrelationships among these methods. This paper reveals the equivalence among the three relaxation methods by three stages. Firstly, the SDP relaxation method can be equivalently simplified to a decoupled SDP relaxation method. Secondly, the equivalence between the SDP relaxation method and the S-procedure relaxation method can be obtained by rigorous analysis. Thirdly, we establish the equivalence between the decoupled SDP relaxation method and the bounding ellipsoid relaxation method. Therefore, the three relaxation methods are unified through the decoupled SDP relaxation method. By analysis of the computational complexity, the decoupled SDP relaxation method has the least computational burden among the three methods. The above results are helpful for the research of set-membership filter and distributed estimation fusion. Finally, the performance of each method is evaluated by some typical numerical examples in information fusion and filtering.
