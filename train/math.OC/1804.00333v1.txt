This paper derives sufficient conditions for bounded distributed connectivity-preserving coordination of Euler-Lagrange systems with only position measurements and with system uncertainties, respectively. The paper proposes two strategies that suitably scale conventional gradient-based controls to account for the actuation bounds and to reserve sufficient actuation for damping injection. For output feedback control of networked systems with only position measurements, the paper incorporates a first-order filter to estimate velocities and to inject damping for stability. For networks of uncertain systems, the paper augments conventional linear filter-based adaptive compensation with damping injection to maintain the local connectivity of the network. Analyses based on monotonically decreasing Lyapunov-like functions and Barbalat's lemma lead to sufficient conditions for bounded local connectivity-preserving coordination of Euler-Lagrange networks under the two strategies. The sufficient conditions clarify the interrelationships among the bounded actuations, initial system velocities and initial inter-system distances. Simulation results validate these conditions.
