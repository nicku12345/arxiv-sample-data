Gradient descent methods and especially their stochastic variants have become highly popular in the last decade due to their efficiency on big data optimization problems. In this thesis we present the development of data sampling strategies for these methods. In the first four chapters we focus on four views on the sampling for convex problems, developing and analyzing new state-of-the-art methods using non-standard data sampling strategies. Finally, in the last chapter we present a more flexible framework, which generalizes to more problems as well as more sampling rules.
