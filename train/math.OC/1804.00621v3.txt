We provide formulae for the \varepsilon-subdifferential of the integral function  I_f(x):=\int_T f(t,x) d\mu(t),  where the integrand f:T\times X \to [-\infty,+\infty] is measurable in (t,x) and convex in x. The state variable lies in a locally convex space, possibly non-separable, while T is given a structure of a nonnegative complete \sigma-finite measure space (T,\mathcal{A},\mu). The resulting characterizations are given in terms of the \epsilon-subdifferential of the data functions involved in the integrand, f, without requiring any qualification conditions. We also derive new formulas when some usual continuity-type conditions are in force. These results are new even for the finite sum of convex functions and for the finite-dimensional setting.
