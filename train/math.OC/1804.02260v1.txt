An algorithm to cluster mobility-on-demand trips considering road network structure is developed in this paper. The benefits of our network partition algorithm are demonstrated in numerical simulations, showing that we can use fewer vehicles and can serve more customers with slightly longer wait time by including predicted future travel demand in trip assignment, compared with the benchmark reactive control policy.
