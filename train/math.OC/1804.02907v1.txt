In this paper the spherical quasi-convexity of quadratic functions on spherically convex sets is studied. Several conditions characterizing the spherical quasi-convexity of quadratic functions are presented. In particular, conditions implying spherical quasi-convexity of quadratic functions on the spherical positive orthant are given. Some examples are provided as an application of the obtained results.
