The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) is a region in the brain that is responsible for controlling circadian rhythms. The SCN contains on the order of 10^4 neuronal oscillators which have a preferred period slightly longer than 24 hours. The oscillators try to synchronize with each other as well as responding to external stimuli such as sunlight exposure. A mean field game model for these neuronal oscillators is formulated with two goals in mind: 1) to understand the long time behavior of the oscillators when an individual remains in the same time zone, and 2) to understand how the oscillators recover from jet lag when the individual has traveled across time zones. In particular, we would like to study the claim that jet lag is worse after traveling east than west. Finite difference schemes are used to find numerical approximations to the mean field game solutions. Numerical results are presented and conjectures are posed. The numerics suggest the time to recover from jet lag is about the same for east versus west trips, but the cost the oscillators accrue while recovering is larger for eastward trips.
