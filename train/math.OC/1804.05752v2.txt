Let \mathcal{V} be the set of all combinations of expected value of finite objective functions from designing information. I showed that \mathcal{V} is a compact and convex set implemented by signal structures with finite support when unknown states are finite. Moreover, \mathcal{V}(\mu) as a correspondence of prior is continuous. This result can be applied to develop a concavification method of Lagrange multipliers that works with general constrained optimization. It also provides tractability to a wide range of information design problems.
