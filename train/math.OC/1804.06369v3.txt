This letter addresses the issue of linearization of quadratic thermal limits of transmission lines for linear OPF formulation. A new irregular polygon based linearization is proposed. The approach is purely based on geometrical concepts and does not introduce any optimization problem. Comparison of the number of constraints is given with different errors for different branch capabilities and systems. Test case analysis is also presented to validate the irregular polygon linearization strategy with optimal value and computational time results.
