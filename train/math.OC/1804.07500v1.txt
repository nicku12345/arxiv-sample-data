This paper considers the consensusability of multi-agent systems with delay and packet dropout. By proposing a kind of predictor-like protocol, sufficient and necessary conditions are given for the mean-square consensusability in terms of system matrices, time delay, communication graph and the packetdrop probability. Moreover, sufficient and necessary conditions are also obtained for the formationability of multi-agent systems.
