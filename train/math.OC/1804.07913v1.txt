We consider a simply supported plate with constant thickness, defined on an unknown multiply connected domain. We optimize its shape according to some given performance functional. Our method is of fixed domain type, easy to be implemented, based on a fictitious domain approach and the control variational method. The algorithm that we introduce is of gradient type and performs simultaneous topological and boundary variations. Numerical experiments are also included and show its efficiency.
