This paper proposes to combine a 10Hz motion planner based on a kinematic bicycle Model Predictive Control (MPC) and a 100Hz closed-loop Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to cope with normal driving situations. Its novelty consists in ensuring the feasibility of the computed trajectory by the motion planner through a limitation of the steering angle depending on the speed. This ensures the validity of the kinematic bicycle model at any time. The architecture is tested on a high-fidelity simulation model on a challenging track with small curve radius, with and without surrounding obstacles.
