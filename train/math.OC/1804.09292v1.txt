The aim of this paper is to present an extragradient method for variational inequality associated to a point-to-set vector field in Hadamard manifolds and to study its convergence properties. In order to present our method the concept of \epsilon-enlargement of maximal monotone vector fields is used and its lower-semicontinuity is stablished in order to obtain the convergence of the method in this new context.
