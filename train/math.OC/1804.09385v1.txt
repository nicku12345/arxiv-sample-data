Recently, the \l_{p}-norm regularization minimization problem (P_{p}^{\lambda}) has attracted great attention in compressed sensing. However, the \l_{p}-norm \|x\|_{p}^{p} in problem (P_{p}^{\lambda}) is nonconvex and non-Lipschitz for all p\in(0,1), and there are not many optimization theories and methods are proposed to solve this problem. In fact, it is NP-hard for all p\in(0,1) and \lambda>0. In this paper, we study two modified \l_{p} regularization minimization problems to approximate the NP-hard problem (P_{p}^{\lambda}). Inspired by the good performance of Half algorithm and 2/3 algorithm in some sparse signal recovery problems, two iterative thresholding algorithms are proposed to solve the problems (P_{p,1/2,\epsilon}^{\lambda}) and (P_{p,2/3,\epsilon}^{\lambda}) respectively. Numerical results show that our algorithms perform effectively in finding the sparse signal in some sparse signal recovery problems for some proper p\in(0,1).
