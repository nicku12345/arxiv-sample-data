A dynamic method to solve the Non-linear Programming (NLP) problem with Equality Constraints (ECs) and Inequality Constraints (IECs) is proposed. Inspired by the Lyapunov continuous-time dynamics stability theory in the control field, the optimal solution is analogized to the stable equilibrium point of a finite-dimensional dynamic system and it is solved in an asymptotic manner. The Dynamic Optimization Equation (DOE), which has the same dimension to that of the optimization parameter vector, is established and its solution will converge to the optimal solution of the NLP globally with a theoretical guarantee. Using the matrix pseudo-inverse, the DOE is valid even without the regularity requirement. In addition, the analytic expressions of the Lagrange multipliers and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) multipliers, which adjoin the ECs and the IECs respectively during the entire optimization process, are also derived. Via the proposed method, the NLP may be transformed to the Initial-value Problem (IVP) to be solved, with mature Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) integration methods. Illustrative examples are solved and it is shown that the dynamic method developed may produce the right numerical solutions with high efficiency.
