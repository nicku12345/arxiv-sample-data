The aims of this article are two-fold. First, we give a geometric characterization of the optimal basic solutions of the general linear programming problem (no compactness assumptions) and provide a simple, self-contained proof of it together with an economical interpretation. Then, we turn to considering a dynamic version of the linear programming problem in that we consider the Kuratowski convergence of polyhedra and study the behaviour of optimal solutions. Our methods are purely geometric.
