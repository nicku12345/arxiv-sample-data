This work presents stochastic optimization methods targeted at least-squares problems involving Monte Carlo integration. While the most common approach to solving these problems is to apply stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or similar methods such as AdaGrad and Adam, which involve estimating a stochastic gradient from a small number of Monte Carlo samples computed at each iteration, we show that for this category of problems it is possible to achieve faster asymptotic convergence rates using an increasing number of samples per iteration instead, a strategy we call increasing precision (IP). We then improve pre-asymptotic convergence by introducing a hybrid approach that combines the qualities of increasing precision and otherwise "constant" precision, resulting in methods such as the IP-SGD hybrid and IP-AdaGrad hybrid, essentially by modifying their gradient estimators to have an equivalent effect to increasing precision. Finally, we observe that, in some problems, incorporating a Gauss-Newton preconditioner to the IP-SGD hybrid method can provide much better convergence than employing a Quasi-Newton approach or covariance-preconditioning as in AdaGrad or Adam.
