We study a graph-theoretic approach to the \mathcal{H}_{\infty} performance of leader following consensus dynamics on directed and undirected graphs. We first provide graph-theoretic bounds on the system \mathcal{H}_{\infty} norm of the leader following dynamics and show the tightness of the proposed bounds. Then, we discuss the relation between the system \mathcal{H}_{\infty} norm for directed and undirected networks for specific classes of graphs, i.e., balanced digraphs and directed trees. Moreover, we investigate the effects of adding directed edges to a directed tree on the resulting system \mathcal{H}_{\infty} norm. In the end, we apply these theoretical results to a reference velocity tracking problem in a platoon of connected vehicles and discuss the effect of the location of the leading vehicle on the overall \mathcal{H}_{\infty} performance of the system.
