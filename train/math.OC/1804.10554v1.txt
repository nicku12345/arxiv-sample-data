Distributed coordination algorithms (DCA) carry out information processing processes among a group of networked agents without centralized information fusion. Though it is well known that DCA characterized by an SIA (stochastic, indecomposable, aperiodic) matrix generate consensus asymptotically via synchronous iterations, the dynamics of DCA with asynchronous iterations have not been studied extensively, especially when viewed as stochastic processes. This paper aims to show that for any given irreducible stochastic matrix, even non-SIA, the corresponding DCA lead to consensus successfully via random asynchronous iterations under a wide range of conditions on the transition probability. Particularly, the transition probability is neither required to be independent and identically distributed, nor characterized by a Markov chain.
