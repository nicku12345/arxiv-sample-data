This work provides formulae for the \epsilon-subdifferential of integral functions in the framework of complete \sigma-finite measure spaces and locally convex spaces. In this work we present here new formulae for this \epsilon-subdifferential under the presence of continuity-type qualification conditions relying on the data involved in the integrand. the integral function I_f are also presented.
