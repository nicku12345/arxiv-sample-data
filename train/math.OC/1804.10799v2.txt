This paper deals with dynamical networks for which the relations between node signals are described by proper transfer functions and external signals can influence each of the node signals. In particular, we are interested in graph-theoretic conditions for identifiability of such dynamical networks, where we assume that only a subset of nodes is measured but the underlying graph structure of the network is known. This problem has recently been investigated in the case of generic identifiability. In this paper, we investigate a stronger notion of identifiability for all network matrices associated with a given graph. For this, we introduce a new graph-theoretic concept called constrained vertex-disjoint paths. As our main result, we state conditions for identifiability based on these constrained vertex-disjoint paths.
