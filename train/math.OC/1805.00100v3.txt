In this paper we provide non-simultaneous charging and discharging guarantees for a linear energy storage system (ESS) model for a model predictive control (MPC) based home energy management system (HEMS) algorithm. The HEMS optimally controls the residential load and residentially-owned power sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) power generation and energy storage, given residential customer preferences such as energy cost sensitivity and ESS lifetime. Under certain problem formulations with a linear ESS model, simultaneous charging and discharging can be observed as the optimal solution when there is high penetration of PV power. We present analysis for a proposed HEMS optimization formulation that ensures non-simultaneous ESS charging and discharging operation for a linear ESS model that captures both charging and discharging efficiency of the ESS. The energy storage system model behavior guarantees are shown for various electricity pricing schemes such as time of use (TOU) pricing and net metering. Simulation results demonstrating desirable ESS behavior are provided for each electricity pricing scheme.
