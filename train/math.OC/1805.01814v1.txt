An observable canonical form is formulated for the set of rational systems on a variety each of which is a single-input-single-output, affine in the input, and a minimal realization of its response map. The equivalence relation for the canonical form is defined by the condition that two equivalent systems have the same response map. A proof is provided that the defined form is well-defined canonical form. Special cases are discussed.
