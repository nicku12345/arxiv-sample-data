This paper is concerned with the stabilization of parallel-flow heat exchangers equation with boundary control and arbitrarily delayed observation. The observer and predictor-based method, developed by [B.Z. Guo, K.Y. Yang, Automatica, 2009, 45(6): 1468-1475], is used to stabilize equation. The exponentially stabilization of such system by estimated state feedback control law is proved.
