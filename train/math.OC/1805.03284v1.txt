We show that the joint spectral radius of a finite collection of nonnegative matrices can be bounded by the eigenvalue of a non-linear operator. This eigenvalue coincides with the ergodic constant of a risk-sensitive control problem, or of an entropy game, in which the state space consists of all switching sequences of a given length. We show that, by increasing this length, we arrive at a convergent approximation scheme to compute the joint spectral radius. The complexity of this method is exponential in the length of the switching sequences, but it is quite insensitive to the size of the matrices, allowing us to solve very large scale instances (several matrices in dimensions of order 1000 within a minute). An idea of this method is to replace a hierarchy of optimization problems, introduced by Ahmadi, Jungers, Parrilo and Roozbehani, by a hierarchy of nonlinear eigenproblems. To solve the latter eigenproblems, we introduce a projective version of Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. This method is of independent interest as it applies more generally to the nonlinear eigenproblem for a monotone positively homogeneous map. Here, this method allows for scalability by avoiding the recourse to linear or semidefinite programming techniques.
