In the present paper we focus our attention on the design of the feedback-based feed-forward controller asymptotically stabilizing the double-pendulum-type crane system with the time-varying rope length in the desired end position of payload (the origin of the coordinate system). In principle, we will consider two cases, in the first case, the sway angle of payload is uncontrolled and the second case, when the sway angle of payload is controlled by an external force. Mathematical modelling in the framework of Lagrange formalism and numerical simulation in the Matlab environment indicate the substantial reduction of the transportation time to the desired end position. Another principal novelty of this paper lies in deriving and analysis of a complete mathematical model without approximating the nonlinear terms and without neglecting some structural parameters of systems for the reasons described in the Remark 4.2 and Remark 5.1.
