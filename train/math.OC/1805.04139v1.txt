Tensor analysis has been a widely studied in physics applications including circuit theory and electric machines. This paper reviews some of the main features of this type of representation for unbalanced power distribution systems and discusses its implementation in modern programming languages. A tensor representation simplifies the nomenclature and calculations in three phase unbalanced grids, reduces the storage requirement and improves the computation speed. A fixed point algorithm is proposed for the power flow solution showing the flexibility of the tensor approach. Simulations in Matlab/Octave demonstrate the advantages of this representation.
