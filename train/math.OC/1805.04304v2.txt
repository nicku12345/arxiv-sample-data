Cooperation of multiple connected vehicles has the potential to benefit the road traffic greatly. In this paper, we consider analysis and synthesis problems of the cooperative control of a platoon of heterogeneous connected vehicles with directed acyclic interactions (characterized by directed acyclic graphs). In contrast to previous works that view heterogeneity as a type of uncertainty, this paper directly takes heterogeneity into account in the problem formulation, allowing us to develop a deeper understanding of the influence of heterogeneity on the collective behavior of a platoon of connected vehicles. Our major strategies include an application of the celebrated internal model principle and an exploitation of lower-triangular structures for platoons with directed acyclic interactions. The major findings include: 1) we explicitly highlight the tracking ability of heterogeneous platoons, showing that the followers can only track the leader's spacing and velocity; 2) we analytically derive a stability region of feedback gains for platoons with directed acyclic interactions; 3) and consequently we propose a synthesis method based on the solution to an algebraic Riccati equation that shares the dimension of single vehicle dynamics. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of our results.
