In this paper we present a cubic regularized Newton's method to minimize a smooth function over a Riemannian manifold. The proposed algorithm is shown to reach a second-order \epsilon-stationary point within \mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{\frac{3}{2}}) iterations, under the condition that the pullbacks are locally Lipschitz continuous, a condition that is shown to be satisfied if the manifold is compact. Furthermore, we present a local superlinear convergence result under some additional conditions.
