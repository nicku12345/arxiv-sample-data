Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, has emerged as an efficient and cost-effective solution for package delivery. Especially, drones are expected to incur lower cost, and achieve fast and environment friendly delivery. While most of existing drone research concentrates on surveillance applications, few works studied the drone package delivery planning problem. Even so, the previous works only focus on the drone delivery planning of a single supplier. In this paper, thus we propose the supplier cooperation in drone delivery (CoDD) framework. The framework considers jointly package assignment, supplier cooperation, and cost management. The objective of the framework is to help suppliers minimize and achieve fair share of the cost as well as reach a stable cooperation. The trade-off between using drones and outsourcing package delivery to a carrier is also investigated. The performance evaluation of the CoDD framework is conducted by using the Solomon benchmark suite and a real Singapore dataset which evidently confirms the practical findings.
