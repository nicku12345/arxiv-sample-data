In this paper, gradient-based optimization methods are combined with finite-element modeling for improving electric devices. Geometric design parameters are considered by affine decomposition of the geometry or by the design element approach, both of which avoid remeshing. Furthermore, it is shown how to robustify the optimization procedure, i.e., how to deal with uncertainties on the design parameters. The overall procedure is illustrated by an academic example and by the example of a permanent-magnet synchronous machine. The examples show the advantages of deterministic optimization compared to standard and popular stochastic optimization procedures such as, e.g., particle swarm optimization.
