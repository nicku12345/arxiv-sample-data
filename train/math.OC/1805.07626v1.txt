This paper investigates the water network's potential ability to provide demand response services to the power grid under the framework of a distribution-level water-energy nexus (micro-WEN). In particular, the hidden controllability of water loads, such as irrigation systems, was closely studied to improve the flexibility of electrical grids. A optimization model is developed for the demand-side management (DSM) of micro-WEN, and the simulation results assert that grid flexibility indeed benefits from controllable water loads. Although the proposed optimal DSM model is an intractable mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, quasi-convex hull techniques were developed to relax the MINLP into a mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) problem. The numerical study shows that the quasi-convex hull relaxation is tight and that the resulting MICP problem is computationally efficient.
