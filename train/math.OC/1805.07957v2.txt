In this paper we develop necessary conditions for optimality, in the form of the stochastic Pontryagin maximum principle, for controlled equations with pointwise delay in the state and with control dependent noise, in the general case of controls u \in U with U not necessarily convex. The maximum principle is formulated by means of first and second order adjoint BSDEs. We also outline how to deal with control problems with pointwise delay both in the state and in the control.
