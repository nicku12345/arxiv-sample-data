We offer a unified treatment of distinct measures of well-posedness for homogeneous conic systems. To that end, we introduce a distance to infeasibility based entirely on geometric considerations of the elements defining the conic system. Our approach sheds new light on and connects several well-known condition measures for conic systems, including {\em Renegar's} distance to infeasibility, the {\em Grassmannian} condition measure, a measure of the {\em most interior} solution, and other geometric measures of {\em symmetry} and of {\em depth} of the conic system.
