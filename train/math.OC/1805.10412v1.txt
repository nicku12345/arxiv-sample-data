We study web and mobile applications that are used to schedule advance service, from medical appointments to restaurant reservations. We model them as online weighted bipartite matching problems with non-stationary arrivals. We propose new algorithms with performance guarantees for this class of problems. Specifically, we show that the expected performance of our algorithms is bounded below by 1-\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}+O(\frac{1}{k}) times that of an optimal offline algorithm, which knows all future information upfront, where k is the minimum capacity of a resource. This is the tightest known lower bound. This performance analysis holds for any Poisson arrival process. Our algorithms can also be applied to a number of related problems, including display ad allocation problems and revenue management problems for opaque products. We test the empirical performance of our algorithms against several well-known heuristics by using appointment scheduling data from a major academic hospital system in New York City. The results show that the algorithms exhibit the best performance among all the tested policies. In particular, our algorithms are 21\% more effective than the actual scheduling strategy used in the hospital system according to our performance metric.
