A multicriteria economic problem is considered: the basic production assets and the labor resources define a set of feasible solutions (alternatives), labor costs, costs of the basic production assets (to be minimized), and cost of the manufactured products (to be maximized) are objective functions. The production function with constant elasticity of substitution is used. The decision maker's (DM's) preferences are introduced as follows: lower labor costs and costs of the basic production assets have the greater importance than higher income, and vice a versa. The fuzzy preferences along with the compromise have a degree of its confidence. Such crisp and fuzzy information is applied in the axiomatic approach of the Pareto set reduction by V. D. Noghin. We show how to construct a set, which is an upper bound of the optimal choice and belongs to the Pareto set of the problem in crisp and fuzzy cases. In fuzzy case one should solve a three crisp multicriteria problems. Thus, upon the crisp and fuzzy DM's preferences a narrower upper bounds of the optimal set of resources with respect to criteria and additional information are obtained.
