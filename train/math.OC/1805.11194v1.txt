As problems in machine learning, smartgrid dispatch, and IoT coordination problems have grown, distributed and fully-decentralized optimization models have gained attention for providing computational scalability to optimization tools. However, in applications where consumer devices are trusted to serve as distributed computing nodes, compromised devices can expose the optimization algorithm to cybersecurity threats which have not been examined in previous literature. This paper examines potential attack vectors for generalized distributed optimization problems, with a focus on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a popular tool for convex optimization. Methods for detecting and mitigating attacks in ADMM problems are described, and simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models. The weaknesses of fully-decentralized optimization schemes, in which nodes communicate directly with neighbors, is demonstrated, and a number of potential architectures for providing security to these networks is discussed.
