Though considerable effort has been devoted to exploiting generation-side and demand-side operational flexibility in order to cope with uncertain renewable generations, grid-side operational flexibility has not been fully investigated. In this review, we define grid-side flexibility as the ability of a power network to deploy its flexibility resources to cope with the changes of power system state, particularly due to variation of renewable generation. Starting with a survey on the metrics of operational flexibility, we explain the definition from both physical and mathematical point of views. Then conceptual examples are presented to demonstrate the impacts of grid-side flexibility graphically, providing a geometric interpretation for a better understanding of the concepts. Afterwards the formulations and solution approaches in terms of grid-side flexibility in power system operation and planning are reviewed, based on which future research directions and challenges are outlined.
