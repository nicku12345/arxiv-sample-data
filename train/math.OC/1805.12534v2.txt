In this paper, we consider an opioid epidemic dynamical model with random perturbation that typically describes the interplay between regular prescription use, addictive use, and the process of rehabilitation from addiction and vice-versa. In particular, we provide two-sided bounds on the solution of the transition density function for the Fokker-Planck equation that corresponds to the opioid epidemic dynamical model, when a random perturbation enters only through the dynamics of the susceptible group in the compartmental model. Here, the proof for such bounds basically relies on the interpretation of the solution for the transition density function as the value function of a certain optimal stochastic control problem. Finally, as a possible interesting development in this direction, we also provide an estimate for the attainable exit probability with which the solution for the randomly perturbed opioid epidemic dynamical model exits from a given bounded open domain during a certain time interval. Note that such qualitative information on the first exit-time as well as two-sided bounds on the transition density function are useful for developing effective and fact-informed intervention strategies that primarily aim at curbing opioid epidemics or assisting in interpreting outcome results from opioid-related policies.
