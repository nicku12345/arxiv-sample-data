In this article, we introduce the class of semimonotone star (E_0^s) matrices. We establish the importance of the class of E_0^s-matrices in the context of complementarity theory. We show that the principal pivot transform of E_0^s-matrix is not necessarily E_0^s in general. However, we prove that \tilde{E_0^s}-matrices, a subclass of the E_0^s-matrices with some additional conditions, is in E_0^f by showing this class is in P_0. We prove that LCP(q, A) can be processable by Lemke's algorithm if A\in \tilde{E_0^s}\cap P_0. We find some conditions for which the solution set of LCP(q, A) is bounded and stable under the \tilde{E^s_0}-property. We propose an algorithm based on an interior point method to solve LCP(q, A) given A \in \tilde{E^{s}_{0}}.
