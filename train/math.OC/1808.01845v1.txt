Motivated by recent work in this area we expand on a generalization of port-Hamiltonian systems that is obtained by replacing the Hamiltonian function representing energy storage by a general Lagrangian subspace. This leads to a new class of algebraic constraints in physical systems modeling, and to an interesting class of DAE systems. It is shown how constant Dirac structures and Lagrangian subspaces allow for similar representations, and how this leads to descriptions of the DAE systems entailing generalized Lagrange multipliers.
