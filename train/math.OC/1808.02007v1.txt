To address the challenge of the renewable energy uncertainty, the ISO New England (ISO-NE) has proposed to apply do-not-exceed (DNE) limits, which represent the maximum nodal injection of renewable energy the grid can accommodate. Unfortunately, it appears challenging to compute DNE limits that simultaneously maintain the system flexibility and incorporate a large portion of the available renewable energy at the minimum cost. In addition, it is often challenging to accurately estimate the joint probability distribution of the renewable energy. In this paper, we propose a two-stage distributionally robust optimization model that co-optimizes the power dispatch and the DNE limits, by adopting an affinely adjustable power re-dispatch and an adjustable joint chance constraint that measures the renewable utilization. Notably, this model admits a second-order conic reformulation that can be efficiently solved by the commercial solvers (e.g., MOSEK). We conduct case studies based on modified IEEE test instances to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and analyze the trade-off among the system flexibility, the renewable utilization, and the dispatch cost.
