We study distributed optimization to minimize a global objective that is a sum of smooth and strongly-convex local cost functions. Recently, several algorithms over undirected and directed graphs have been proposed that use a gradient tracking method to achieve linear convergence to the global minimizer. However, a connection between these different approaches has been unclear. In this paper, we first show that many of the existing first-order algorithms are in fact related with a simple state transformation, at the heart of which lies the \mathcal{AB} algorithm. We then describe \textit{distributed heavy-ball}, denoted as \mathcal{AB}m, i.e., \mathcal{AB} with momentum, that combines gradient tracking with a momentum term and uses nonidentical local step-sizes. By simultaneously implementing both row- and column-stochastic weights, \mathcal{AB}m removes the conservatism in the related work due to doubly-stochastic weights or eigenvector estimation. \mathcal{AB}m thus naturally leads to optimization and average-consensus over both undirected and directed graphs, casting a unifying framework over several well-known consensus algorithms over arbitrary strongly-connected graphs. We show that \mathcal{AB}m has a global R-linear rate when the largest step-size is positive and sufficiently small. Following the standard practice in the heavy-ball literature, we numerically show that \mathcal{AB}m achieves accelerated convergence especially when the objective function is ill-conditioned.
