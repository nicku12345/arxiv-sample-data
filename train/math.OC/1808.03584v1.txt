A class of convex constrained minimization problems over polyhedral cones for geometry-dependent quadratic objective functions is considered in a functional analysis framework. Shape differentiability of the primal minimization problem needs a bijective property for mapping of the primal cone. This restrictive assumption is relaxed to bijection of the dual cone within the Lagrangian formulation as a primal-dual minimax problem. In this paper, we give results on primal-dual shape sensitivity analysis that extends the class of shape-differentiable problems supported by explicit formula of the shape derivative. We apply the results to the Stokes problem under mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions subject to the divergence-free constraint.
