We present a method for finding optimal controllers for unknown, time-varying, dynamic systems which can be re-initialized from a given initial condition repeatedly, in which the performance measure is available for sampling with noise, but analytically unknown. Such systems are present throughout industry where processes must be repeated many times, such as a voltage source which is repeatedly turned on for a fraction of a second from zero initial conditions and then turned off again, whose output must track a specific trajectory, while the system's components are slowly drifting with time due to temperature variations. For systems with convex cost functions we prove that our algorithm will produce controllers that approach the minimal cost, e.g., the cost minimizing LQR optimal controller that could have been designed analytically had the system and objective function been known. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness with simulation studies of noisy and time-varying systems.
