We analyze the behavior of a large number of strategic drivers traveling over an urban traffic network using the mean-field game framework. We assume an incentive mechanism for congestion mitigation under which each driver selecting a particular route is charged a tax penalty that is affine in the logarithm of the number of agents selecting the same route. We show that the mean-field approximation of such a large-population dynamic game leads to the so-called linearly solvable Markov decision process, implying that an open-loop \epsilon-Nash equilibrium of the original game can be found simply by solving a finite-dimensional linear system.
