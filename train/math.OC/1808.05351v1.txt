In this paper, we consider a class of transportation problems which arises in sample surveys and other areas of statistics. The associated cost matrices of these transportation problems are of special structure. We observe that the optimality of North West corner solution holds for the general problem where cost component is replaced by a convex function. We revisit assignment problem and present a weighted version of K\ddot{o}nig-Egerv\acute{a}ry theorem and Hungarian method. The weighted Hungarian method proposed in the paper can be used for solving transportation problem.
