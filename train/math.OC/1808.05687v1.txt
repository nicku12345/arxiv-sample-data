We consider a class of parameter-dependent optimal control problems of elliptic PDEs with constraints of general type on the control variable. Applying the concept of variational discretization, [4], together with techniques from the Reduced basis method, we construct a reduced basis surrogate model for the control problem. We establish estimators for the greedy sampling procedure which only involve the residuals of the state and the adjoint equation, but not of the gradient equation of the optimality system. The estimators are sharp up to a constant, i.e. they are equivalent to the approximation erros in control, state, and adjoint state. Numerical experiments show the performance of our approach.
