It is likely that electricity storage will play a significant role in the balancing of future energy systems. A major challenge is then that of how to assess the contribution of storage to capacity adequacy, i.e. to the ability of such systems to meet demand. This requires an understanding of how to optimally schedule multiple storage facilities. The present paper studies this problem in the cases where the objective is the minimisation of expected energy unserved (EEU) and also a form of weighted EEU in which the unit cost of unserved energy is higher at higher levels of unmet demand. We also study how the contributions of individual stores may be identified for the purposes of their inclusion in electricity capacity markets.
