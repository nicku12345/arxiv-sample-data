This paper introduces and investigates a regularity condition in the asymptotic sense for the optimization problems whose objective functions are polynomial. We prove two sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions for polynomial optimization problems. Further, when the constraint sets are semi-algebraic, we show results on the stability of the solution map of polynomial optimization problems. At the end of the paper, we discuss the genericity of the regularity condition.
