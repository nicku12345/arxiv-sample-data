Let v_n be the maximum expected length of an increasing subsequence, which can be selected by an online nonanticipating policy from a random sample of size n. Refining known estimates, we obtain an asymptotic expansion of v_n up to a O(1) term. The method we use is based on detailed analysis of the dynamic programming equation, and is also applicable to the online selection problem with observations occurring at times of a Poisson process.
