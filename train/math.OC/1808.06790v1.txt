The Bregman distance B_{\xi_x}(y,x), \xi_x \in \partial J(y), associated to a convex sub-differentiable functional J is known to be in general non-symmetric in its arguments x, y. In this note we address the question when Bregman distances can be bounded against each other when the arguments are switched, i.e., if some constant C>0 exists such that for all x,y on a convex set M it holds that \frac{1}{C} B_{\xi_x}(y,x) \leq B_{\xi_y}(x,y) \leq C B_{\xi_x}(y,x). We state sufficient conditions for such an inequality and prove in particular that it holds for the p-powers of the \ell_p and L^p-norms when 1 < p <\infty.
