An approximate formulation of a robust geometric program (RGP) as a convex program is proposed. Interest in using geometric programs (GPs) to model complex engineering systems has been growing, and this has motivated explicitly modeling the uncertainties fundamental to engineering design optimization. RGPs provide a framework for modeling and solving GPs while representing their uncertainties as belonging to an uncertainty set. The RGP methodologies presented here are based on reformulating the GP and then robustifying it with methods from robust linear programming. These new methodologies, along with previous ones from the literature, are used to robustify two aircraft design problems, and the results of these different methodologies are compared and discussed.
