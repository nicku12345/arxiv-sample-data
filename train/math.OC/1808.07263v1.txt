For the Kuramoto model and its variations, it is difficult to analyze the exponential synchronization under the general digraphs due to the lack of symmetry. %due to the asymmetry of the adjacency matrices. In this paper, for the high-dimensional Kuramoto model of identical oscillators, a matrix Riccati differential equation (MRDE) is proposed to describe the error dynamics. Based on the MRDE, the exponential synchronization is proved by constructing a total error function for the case of digraphs admitting spanning trees. Finally, some numerical simulations are given to illustrate the obtained theoretical results.
