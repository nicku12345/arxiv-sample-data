We introduce and study a notion of directional Pareto minimality with respect to a set that generalizes the classical concept of Pareto efficiency. Then we give separate necessary and sufficient conditions for the newly introduced efficiency and several situations concerning the objective mapping and the constraints are considered. In order to investigate different cases, we adapt some well-known constructions of generalized differentiation and the connections with some recent directional regularities come naturally into play. As a consequence, several techniques from the study of genuine Pareto minima are considered in our specific situation.
