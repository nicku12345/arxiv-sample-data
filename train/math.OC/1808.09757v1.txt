The notion of path-complete p-dominance for switching linear systems (in short, path-dominance) is introduced as a way to generalize the notion of dominant/slow modes for LTI systems. Path-dominance is characterized by the contraction property of a set of quadratic cones in the state space. We show that path-dominant systems have a low-dimensional dominant behavior, and hence allow for a simplified analysis of their dynamics. An algorithm for deciding the path-dominance of a given system is presented.
