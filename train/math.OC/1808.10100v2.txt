In this paper, we present some new necessary and sufficient optimality conditions in terms of the Clarke subdifferentials for approximate Pareto solutions of a nonsmooth vector optimization problem which has an infinite number of constraints. As a consequence, we obtain optimality conditions for the particular cases of cone-constrained convex vector optimization problems and semidefinite vector optimization problems. Examples are given to illustrate the obtained results.
