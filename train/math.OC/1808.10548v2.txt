This paper proposes an optimization strategy to assist utility operators to recover power distribution systems after large outages. Specifically, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed for co-optimizing crews, resources, and network operations. The MILP model coordinates damage isolation, network reconfiguration, distributed generator re-dispatch, and crew/resource logistics. In addition, a framework for integrating different types of photovoltaic (PV) systems in the restoration process is developed.} We consider two different types of crews, namely, line crews for damage repair and tree crews for obstacle removal. We also model the repair resource logistic constraints. Furthermore, a new algorithm is developed for solving the distribution system repair and restoration problem (DSRRP). The algorithm starts by solving DSRRP using an assignment-based method, then a neighborhood search method is designed to iteratively improve the solution. The proposed method is validated on modified IEEE 123- and 8500-bus distribution test systems.
