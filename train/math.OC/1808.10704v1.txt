In this paper, the problem of finding state bounds is considered, for the first time, for a class of positive time-delay coupled differential-difference equations (CDDEs) with bounded disturbances. First, we present a novel method, which is based on nonnegative matrices and optimization techniques, for computing a like-exponential componentwise upper bound of the state vector of the CDDEs without disturbances. The main idea is to establish bounds of the state vector on finite-time intervals and then, by using the solution comparison method and the linearity of the system, extend to infinite time horizon. Next, by using state transformations, we extend the obtained results to a class of CDDEs with bounded disturbances. As a result, componentwise upper bounds, ultimate bounds and invariant set of the perturbed system are obtained. The feasibility of obtained results are illustrated through a numerical example.
