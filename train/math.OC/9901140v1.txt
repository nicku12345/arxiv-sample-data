In this paper we introduce a new method to design control laws for non-linear underactuated systems. Our method produces an infinite dimensional family of control laws, whereas most control techniques only produce a finite dimensional family. These control laws each come with a natural Lyapunov function. The inverted pendulum cart is used as an example. In addition, we construct an abstract system which is open loop unstable and cannot be stabilized using any linear control law, and demonstrate that our method produces a stabilizing control law.
