This short note is devoted to the unraveling of the hidden interactivity of ordinary games which is an artefact of predictions of the behaviour of other players by the fixed player and describes deviations of their real behaviour from such predictions. A method to improve the predictions is proposed. Applications to the strategical analysis of interactive games are also briefly specified.
