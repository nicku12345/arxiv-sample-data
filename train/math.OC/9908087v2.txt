We present a parameterization of the stabilizing controllers over commutative rings. In the classical case, that is, in the case where there exist the right-/left-coprime factorizations of the given plant, the stabilizing controllers can be parameterized by the method called ``Youla-Kucera-parameterization''. However, it is known that there exist models in which some stabilizable transfer matrices do not have their right-/left-coprime factorizations. In such models, we cannot employ the Youla-Kucera-parameterization directly. Our method of this paper can be applied to even such models.
