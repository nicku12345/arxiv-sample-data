Anantharam showed in 1985 the existence of a model in which some stabilizable plants do not have its right-/left-coprime factorizations. In this paper, we give a condition of the nonexistence of the right-/left-coprime factorizations of stabilizable plants as a generalization of Anantharam's result. As examples of the models which satisfy the condition, we present two models. We illustrate the construction of a stabilizing controller of stabilizable single-input single-output plants of such models.
