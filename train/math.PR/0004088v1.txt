A derivation operator and a divergence operator are defined on the algebra of bounded operators on the symmetric Fock space over the complexification of a real Hilbert space \eufrak{h} and it is shown that they satisfy similar properties as the derivation and divergence operator on the Wiener space over \eufrak{h}. The derivation operator is then used to give sufficient conditions for the existence of smooth Wigner densities for pairs of operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations. For \eufrak{h}=L^2(\mathbb{R}_+), the divergence operator is shown to coincide with the Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic integral for adapted integrable processes and with the non-causal quantum stochastic integrals defined by Lindsay and Belavkin for integrable processes.
