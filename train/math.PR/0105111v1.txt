We consider Markov chains on the space of (countable) partitions of the interval [0,1], obtained first by size biased sampling twice (allowing repetitions) and then merging the parts with probability \beta_m (if the sampled parts are distinct) or splitting the part with probability \beta_s according to a law \sigma (if the same part was sampled twice). We characterize invariant probability measures for such chains. In particular, if \sigma is the uniform measure then the Poisson-Dirichlet law is an invariant probability measure, and it is unique within a suitably defined class of ``analytic'' invariant measures. We also derive transience and recurrence criteria for these chains.
