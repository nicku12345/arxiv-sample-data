We study in this short note aging properties of Sinai's (nearest neighbour) random walk in random environment. With \PP^o denoting the annealed law of the RWRE X_n, our main result is a full proof of the following statement due to P. Le Doussal, C. Monthus and D. S. Fisher: \lim_{\eta\to0} \lim_{n\to\infty} \PP^o (\frac{|X_{n^h} - X_n|}{(\log n)^2} < \eta) = \frac{1}{h^2} [ {5/3} - {2/3} e^{-(h-1)} ].
