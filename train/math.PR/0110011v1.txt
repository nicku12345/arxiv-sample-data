Let \mu_{g} and \mu_{p} denote the Gaussian and Poisson measures on {\Bbb R}, respectively. We show that there exists a unique measure \widetilde{\mu}_{g} on {\Bbb C} such that under the Segal-Bargmann transform S_{\mu_g} the space L^2({\Bbb R},\mu_g) is isomorphic to the space {\cal H}L^2({\Bbb C}, \widetilde{\mu}_{g}) of analytic L^2-functions on {\Bbb C} with respect to \widetilde{\mu}_{g}. We also introduce the Segal-Bargmann transform S_{\mu_p} for the Poisson measure \mu_{p} and prove the corresponding result. As a consequence, when \mu_{g} and \mu_{p} have the same variance, L^2({\Bbb R},\mu_g) and L^2({\Bbb R},\mu_p) are isomorphic to the same space {\cal H}L^2({\Bbb C}, \widetilde{\mu}_{g}) under the S_{\mu_g} and S_{\mu_p}-transforms, respectively. However, we show that the multiplication operators by x on L^2({\Bbb R}, \mu_g) and on L^2({\Bbb R}, \mu_p) act quite differently on {\cal H}L^2({\Bbb C}, \widetilde{\mu}_{g}).
