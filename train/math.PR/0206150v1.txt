In a series of papers, G. Harmer and D. Abbott study the behavior of random walks associated with games introduced in 1997 by J. M. R. Parrondo. These games illustrate an apparent paradox that random and deterministic mixtures of losing games may produce winning games. In this paper, classical cyclic random walks on the additive group of integers modulo m, a given integer, are used in a straightforward way to derive the strong law limits of a general class of games that contains the Parrondo games. We then consider the question of when random mixtures of fair games related to these walks may result in winning games. Although the context for these problems is elementary, there remain open questions. An extension of the structure of these walks to a class of shift diffusions is also presented, leading to the fact that a random mixture of two fair shift diffusions may be transient to +\infty.
