We consider the model of directed polymers in a random environment introduced by Petermann : the random walk is \mathbb{R}^d-valued and has independent gaussian N(0,I_d)-increments, and the random media is a stationary centred Gaussian process (g(k,x), k \geq 1, x \in \mathbb{R}^d) with covariance matrix cov(g(i,x),g(j,y))=\delta_{ij} \Gamma(x-y) , where \Gamma is a bounded integrable function on \mathbb{R}^d . For this model, we establish an upper bound of the volume exponent in all dimensions d.
