Francesco Guerra and Fabio Toninelli have developped a very powerful technique to study the high temperature behaviour of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick mean field spin glass model.   They show that this model is asymptoticaly comparable to a linear model. The key ingredient is a clever interpolation technique between the two different Hamiltonians describing the models.   This paper contribution to the subject are the following: (1) The replica-symmetric solution holds for general spins, not just \pm 1 valued. (2) The proof does not involve cavitation but only first order differential calculus and Gaussian integration by parts.
