In this work we introduce correlated random walks on \Z. When picking suitably at random the coefficient of correlation, and taking the average over a large number of walks, we obtain a discrete Gaussian process, whose scaling limit is the fractional Brownian motion. We have to use two radically different models for both cases {1\over2}\leq H<1 and 0<H<{1\over2}. This result provides an algorithm for the simulation of the fractional Brownian motion, which appears to be quite efficient.
