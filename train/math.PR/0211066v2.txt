We introduce a model of a randomly growing interface in multidimensional Euclidean space. The growth model incorporates a random order model as an ingredient of its graphical construction, in a way that replicates the connection between the planar increasing sequences model and the one-dimensional Hammersley process. We prove a hydrodynamic limit for the height process, and a limit which says that certain perturbations of the random surface follow the characteristics of the macroscopic equation. By virtue of the space-time Poissonian construction, we know the macroscopic velocity function explicitly up to a constant factor.
