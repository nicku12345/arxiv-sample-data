We consider the exponential functional A_{\infty}=\int_0^{\infty} e^{\xi_s} ds associated to a Levy process (\xi_t)_{t \geq 0}. We find the asymptotic behavior of the tail of this random variable, under some assumptions on the process \xi, the main one being Cramer's condition, that asserts the existence of a real \chi >0 such that {\Bbb E}(e^{\chi \xi_1})=1. Then there exists C>0 satisfying, when t \to +\infty :  {\Bbb P} (A_{\infty}> t) \sim C t^{-\chi} \quad .  This result can be applied for example to the process \xi_t = at - S_{\alpha}(t) where S_{\alpha} stands for the stable subordinator of index \alpha (0 < \alpha < 1), and a is a positive real (we have then \chi=a^{1/(\alpha -1)}).
