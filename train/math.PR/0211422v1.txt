In this note, the Sherrington Kirkpatrick model of interacting spins is under consideration. In the high temperature region, we give an asymptotic expansion for the expected value of some genereral polynomial of the overlap of the system when the size N grows to infinity. Some of the coefficients obtained are shown to be vanishing, while the procedure to get the nontrivial ones has to be performed by a computer program, due to the great amount of computation involved.
