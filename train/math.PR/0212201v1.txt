This paper is devoted to a detailed study of a p-spins interaction model with external field, including some sharp bounds on the speed of self averaging of the overlap as well as a central limit theorem for its fluctuations, the thermodynamical limit for the free energy and the definition of an Almeida-Thouless type line. Those results show that the external field dominates the tendency to disorder induced by the increasing level of interaction between spins, and our system will share many of its features with the SK model, which is certainly not the case when the external magnetic field vanishes.
