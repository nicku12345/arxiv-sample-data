T-semi-selfdecomposability and subclasses L_m(b, Q) and \tilde L_m(b, Q) of measures on complete separable metric vector spaces are introduced and basic properties are proved. In particular, we show that \mu is T-semi-selfdecomposable if and only if \mu = T(\mu) \nu where \nu is infinitely divisible and \mu is operator selfdecomposable if and only if \mu \in L_0(b, Q) for all 0< b < 1.
