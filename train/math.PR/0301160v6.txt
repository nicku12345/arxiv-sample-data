Consider percolation on the triangular lattice. Let \kappa(p) be the free energy at the zero field.   We show that |\kappa'''(p)| \leq |p-p_c|^{-1/3+o(1)} \mbox{ if } p \neq p_c. Furthermore, we show that there exists a sequence \epsilon_n\downarrow 0 such that |\kappa'''(p_c\pm \epsilon_n)|\geq \epsilon_n^{-1/3+o(1)}. This answers affirmatively a conjecture, asked by Sykes and Essam a half century ago, whether \kappa(p) has a singularity at the criticality.
