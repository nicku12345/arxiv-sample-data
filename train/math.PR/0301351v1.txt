The paper considers (a) Representations of measure preserving transformations (``rotations'') on Wiener space, and (b) The stochastic calculus of variations induced by parameterized rotations \{T_\theta w, 0 \le \theta \le \eps\}: ``Directional derivatives'' (dF(T_\theta w)/d \theta)_{\theta=0}, ``vector fields'' or ``tangent processes'' (dT_\theta w /d\theta)_{\theta=0} and flows of rotations.
