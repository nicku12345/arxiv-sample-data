We study the asymptotic behavior of the simple random walk on oriented version of \mathbb{Z}^2. The considered latticesare not directed on the vertical axis but unidirectional on the horizontal one, with symmetric random orientations which are positively correlated. We prove that the simple random walk is transient and also prove a functionnal limit theorem in the space of cadlag functions, with an unconventional normalization.
