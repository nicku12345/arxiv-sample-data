Let \mathcal{T}_n(x) denote the time of first visit of a point x on the lattice torus \mathbb {Z}_n^2=\mathbb{Z}^2/n\mathbb{Z}^2 by the simple random walk. The size of the set of \alpha, n-late points \mathcal{L}_n(\alpha )=\{x\in \mathbb {Z}_n^2:\mathcal{T}_n(x)\geq \alpha \frac{4}{\pi}(n\log n)^2\} is approximately n^{2(1-\alpha)}, for \alpha \in (0,1) [\mathcal{L}_n(\alpha) is empty if \alpha >1 and n is large enough]. These sets have interesting clustering and fractal properties: we show that for \beta \in (0,1), a disc of radius n^{\beta} centered at nonrandom x typically contains about n^{2\beta (1-\alpha /\beta ^2)} points from \mathcal{L}_n(\alpha) (and is empty if \beta <\sqrt{\alpha} ), whereas choosing the center x of the disc uniformly in \mathcal{L}_n(\alpha) boosts the typical number of \alpha, n-late points in it to n^{2\beta (1-\alpha)}. We also estimate the typical number of pairs of \alpha, n-late points within distance n^{\beta} of each other; this typical number can be significantly smaller than the expected number of such pairs, calculated by Brummelhuis and Hilhorst [Phys. A 176 (1991) 387--408]. On the other hand, our results show that the number of ordered pairs of late points within distance n^{\beta} of each other is larger than what one might predict by multiplying the total number of late points, by the number of late points in a disc of radius n^{\beta} centered at a typical late point.
