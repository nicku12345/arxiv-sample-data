We consider inhomogeneous Bernoulli measures of the form \prod_{x\in\Lambda} p_x where p_x are prescribed and uniformly bounded above and below away from 0 and 1. A comparison inequality is proved between the Kawasaki and Bernoulli-Laplace Dirichlet forms. Together with a recent result of Caputo on the gap of the Bernoulli-Laplace model, this proves a spectral gap of the correct order L^{-2} on cubes of side length L for the Kawasaki dynamics. The two block estimate of hydrodynamic limits is also obtained.
