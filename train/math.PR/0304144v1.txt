The aim of this paper is to generalize the well-known asymptotic shape result for first-passage percolation on \Zd to first-passage percolation on a random environment given by the infinite cluster of a supercritical Bernoulli percolation model. We prove the convergence of the renormalized set of wet points to a deterministic shape that does not depend on the random environment. As a special case of the previous result, we obtain an asymptotic shape theorem for the chemical distance in supercritical Bernoulli percolation. We also prove a flat edge result. Some various examples are also given.
