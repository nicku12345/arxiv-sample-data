We survey the recent mathematical results about aging in certain simple disordered models. We start by the Bouchaud trap model. We then survey the results obtained for simple models of spin-glass dynamics, like the REM (the Random Energy Model, which is well approximated by the Bouchaud model on the complete graph), then the spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. We will insist on the differences in phenomenology for different types of aging in different time scales and different models. This talk is based on joint works with A.Bovier, J.Cerny, A.Dembo, V.Gayrard, A.Guionnet, as well as works by C.Newman, R.Fontes, M.Isopi, D.Stein.
