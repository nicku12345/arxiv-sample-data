Phase separation is a fairly common physical phenomenon with examples including the formation of water droplets from humid air (fog, rain), the separation of a crystalline structure from an isotropic material such as a liquid or even the formation of the sizzling gas bubbles when a soda can is opened. It was recognized long ago (at least on a phenomenological level) that systems exhibiting several phases in equilibrium can be described with an appropriate variational principle: the phases arrange themselves in such a way that the energy associated with the phase boundaries is minimal. Typically this leads to an almost deterministic behavior and the phase boundaries are fairly regular. However, when looked at from a microscopic point of view, the system consists of a bunch of erratically moving molecules with relatively strong short-range interaction and the simplicity of the above macroscopic description looks more than miraculous. Indeed, when starting from the molecular level, there are many more questions to be asked and understood: which are the phases which we will see? why do only those occur? why are the phase boundaries sharp? how should we find (define) the energy associated with the interfaces? Only then can we ask the question: why does the system minimize this energy? It is only in the last decade that a mathematically satisfactory understanding of this phenomenon has been achieved. The main goal of the talk is to present the current state of affairs focusing thereby on results obtained in joint works with Raphael Cerf. The connection to fields of mathematics other than probability theory or statistical mechanics will be highlighted; namely, to geometric measure theory and to the calculus of variations.
