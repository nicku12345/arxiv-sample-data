We establish large deviation principle (LDP) for the family of vector-valued random processes (X^\epsilon,Y^\epsilon),\epsilon\to 0 defined as  X^\epsilon_t=\frac{1}{\epsilon^\kappa}\int_0^t H(\xi^\epsilon_s,Y^\epsilon_s)ds, dY^\epsilon_t=F(\xi^\epsilon_t,Y^\epsilon_t)dt+ D\epsilon^{1/2-\kappa}G(\xi^\epsilon_t,Y^\epsilon_t)dW_t, where W_t is Wiener process and \xi^\epsilon_t is fast ergodic diffusion. We show that, under \kappa<{1/2} or less and Veretennikov-Khasminskii type condition for fast diffusion, the LDP holds with rate function of Freidlin-Wentzell's type.
