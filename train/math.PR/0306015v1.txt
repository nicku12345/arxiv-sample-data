Let \{Z_t, t\geq 0\} be a strictly stable process on \R with index \alpha\in (0,2]. We prove that for every p > \alpha, there exists \gamma = \gamma (\alpha, p) and \k = \k (\alpha, p)\in (0, +\infty) such that \lim_{\ee\downarrow 0}\ee^{\gamma}\log\pb\lcr ||Z||_{p}\leq \ee \rcr = - \k, where ||Z||_{p} stands for the strong p-variation of Z on [0,1]. The critical exponent \gamma (\alpha, p) takes a different shape according as |Z| is a subordinator and p >1, or not. The small ball constant \k (\alpha, p) is explicitly computed when p \leq 1, and a lower bound on \k (\alpha, p) is easily obtained in the general case. In the symmetric case and when p > 2, we can also give an upper bound on \k (\alpha, p) in terms of the Brownian small ball constant under the (1/p)-H\"older semi-norm. Along the way, we remark that the positive random variable ||Z||^p_{p} is not necessarily stable when p > 1, which gives a negative answer to an old question of P.~E.~Greenwood.
