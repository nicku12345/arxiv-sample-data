Motivated by the recent work of Benjamini, Haggstrom, Peres, and Steif (2003) on dynamical random walks, we: Prove that, after a suitable normalization, the dynamical Gaussian walk converges weakly to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in classical Wiener space; derive sharp tail-asymptotics for the probabilities of large deviations of the said dynamical walk; and characterize (by way of an integral test) the minimal envelop(es) for the growth-rate of the dynamical Gaussian walk. This development also implies the tail capacity-estimates of Mountford (1992) for large deviations in classical Wiener space. The results of this paper give a partial affirmative answer to the problem, raised in Benjamini et al (2003, Question 4), of whether there are precise connections between the OU process in classical Wiener space and dynamical random walks.
