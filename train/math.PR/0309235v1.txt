We give a characterization of the invariant measures for the exclusion process on the integers with certain reversible transition kernels. Some examples include all nearest-neighbor kernels with asymptotic mean zero. One tool used is a necessary and sufficient condition for reversible measures to be extremal in the set of all invariant measures which is an interesting result in its own right.
