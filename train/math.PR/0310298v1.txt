Let \mathcal{T}(x,\eps) denote the occupation measure of an interval of length 2\eps centered at x by the Cauchy process run until it hits (-\infty,-1]\cup [1,\infty). We prove that \sup_{|x|\leq 1}\mathcal{T}(x,\eps)/(\eps(\ln\eps)^2)\to 2/\pi a.s. as \eps\to 0. We also obtain the multifractal spectrum for thick points, i.e. the Hausdorff dimension of the set of \alpha-thick points x for which \lim_{\eps \to 0} \mathcal{T}(x,\eps)/(\eps(\ln\eps)^2) = \alpha > 0.
