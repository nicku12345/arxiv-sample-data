According to a theorem of S. Schumacher and T. Brox, for a diffusion X in a Brownian environment it holds that (X_t-b_{\log t})/\log^2t\to 0  in probability, as t\to\infty, where b_{\cdot} is a stochastic process having an explicit description and depending only on the environment. We compute the distribution of the number of sign changes for b on an interval [1,x] and study some of the consequences of the computation; in particular we get the probability of b keeping the same sign on that interval. These results have been announced in 1999 in a non-rigorous paper by P. Le Doussal, C. Monthus, and D. Fisher and were treated with a Renormalization Group analysis. We prove that this analysis can be made rigorous using a path decomposition for the Brownian environment and renewal theory. Finally, we comment on the information these results give about the behavior of the diffusion.
