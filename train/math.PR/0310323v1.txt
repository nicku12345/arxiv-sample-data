Let a sequence of iid. random variables \xi_1,...,\xi_n be given on a measurable space (X,\cal X) with distribution \mu together with a function f(x_1,...,x_k) on the product space (X^k,{\cal X}^k). Let \mu_n denote the empirical measure defined by these random variables and consider the random integral  J_{n,k}(f)={{n^{k/2}}\over{k!}}\int' f(u_1,...,u_k) (\mu_n(du_1)-\mu(du_1))...(\mu_n(du_k)-\mu(du_k)),  where prime means that the diagonals are omitted from the domain of integration. In this work a good bound is given on the probability P(|J_{n,k}(f)|>x) for all x>0. This result shows that the tail behaviour of the distribution funtcion of the random integral J_{n,k}(f) and that of the integral of the function f with respect to a Gaussian random field show a similar behaviour. The proof is based on an adaptation of some methods of the theory of Wiener--Ito integrals. In particular, a sort of diagram formula is proved for the random integrals J_{n,k}(f) together with some of its important properties, a result which may be interesting in itself. The relation of this estimate to some results about U-statistics is also discussed.
