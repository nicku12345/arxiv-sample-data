Let a sequence of iid. random variables \xi_1,...,\xi_n be given on a space (X,\cal X) with distribution \mu together with a nice class \cal F of functions f(x_1,...,x_k) of k variables on the product space (X^k,{\cal X}^k). For all f\in\cal F we consider the random integral J_{n,k}(f) of the function f with respect to the k-fold product of the normalized signed measure \sqrt n(\mu_n-\mu), where \mu_n denotes the empirical measure defined by the random variables \xi_1,...,\xi_n and investigate the probabilities P(\sup_{f\in {\cal F}}|J_{n,k}(f)|>x) for all x>0. We show that for nice classes of functions, for instance if \cal F is a Vapnik-Cervonenkis class, an almost as good bound can be given for these probabilities as in the case when only the random integral of one function is considered.
