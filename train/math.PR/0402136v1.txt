In this paper we consider two-point unilateral Markov fields on a two-dimensional lattice as considered by Pickard, Galbraith and Walley. We show that, under various ergodicity conditions, they can be perfectly simulated in the stationary state on any finite window. The techniques which are used connect perfect simulation with oriented percolation through suitable coupling constructions.
