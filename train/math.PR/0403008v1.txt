Let (\Omega, \A, \mu) be a Lebesgue space and T an ergodic measure preserving automorphism on \Omega with positive entropy. We show that there is a bounded and strictly stationary martingale difference sequence defined on \Omega with a common non-degenerate lattice distribution satisfying the central limit theorem with an arbitrarily slow rate of convergence and not satisfying the local limit theorem. A similar result is established for martingale difference sequences with densities provided the entropy is infinite. In addition, the martingale difference sequence may be chosen to be strongly mixing.
