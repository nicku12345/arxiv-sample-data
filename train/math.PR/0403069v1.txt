Let X be a linear diffusion and f a non-negative, Borel measurable function. We are interested in finding conditions on X and f which imply that the perpetual integral functional  I^X_\infty(f):=\int_0^\infty f(X_t) dt  is identical in law with the first hitting time of a point for some other diffusion. This phenomenon may often be explained using random time change. Because of some potential applications in mathematical finance, we are considering mainly the case when X is a Brownian motion with drift \mu>0, denoted \{B^{(\mu)}_t: t\geq 0\}, but it is obvious that the method presented is more general. We also review the known examples and give new ones. In particular, results concerning one-sided functionals  \int_0^\infty f(B^{(\mu)}_t) {\bf 1}_{\{B^{(\mu)}_t<0\}} dt\quad {\rm and}\quad \int_0^\infty f(B^{(\mu)}_t) {\bf 1}_{\{B^{(\mu)}_t>0\}} dt  are presented.   This approach generalizes the proof, based on the random time change techniques, of the fact that the Dufresne functional (this corresponds to f(x)=\exp(-2x)), playing quite an important r\^ole in the study of geometric Brownian motion, is identical in law with the first hitting time for a Bessel process. Another functional arising naturally in this context is %associated to the function  \int_0^\infty \big(a+\exp(B^{(\mu)}_t)\big)^{-2} dt,  which is seen, in the case \mu=1/2, to be identical in law with the first hitting time for a Brownian motion with drift \mu=a/2.   The paper is concluded by discussing how the Feynman-Kac formula can be used to find the distribution of a perpetual integral functional.
