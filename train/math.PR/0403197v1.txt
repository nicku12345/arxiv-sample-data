The group of affine transformations with rational coefficients, aff(Q), acts naturally on the real line, but also on the p-adic fields. The aim of this note is to show that all these actions are necessary and sufficient to represent bounded \mu-harmonic functions for a probability measure \mu on aff(Q) that is supported by a finitely generated sub-group, that is to describe the Poisson boundary.
