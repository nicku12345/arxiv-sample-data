A random composition of n appears when the points of a random closed set \widetilde{\mathcal{R}}\subset[0,1] are used to separate into blocks n points sampled from the uniform distribution. We study the number of parts K_n of this composition and other related functionals under the assumption that \widetilde{\mathcal{R}}=\phi(S_{\bullet}), where (S_t,t\geq0) is a subordinator and \phi:[0,\infty]\to[0,1] is a diffeomorphism. We derive the asymptotics of K_n when the L\'{e}vy measure of the subordinator is regularly varying at 0 with positive index. Specializing to the case of exponential function \phi(x)=1-e^{-x}, we establish a connection between the asymptotics of K_n and the exponential functional of the subordinator.
