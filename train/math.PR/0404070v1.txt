For a symmetric random walk in Z^2 with 2+\delta moments, we represent |\mathcal{R}(n)|, the cardinality of the range, in terms of an expansion involving the renormalized intersection local times of a Brownian motion. We show that for each k\geq 1 \[ (\log n)^k [ \frac{1}{n} |\mathcal{R}(n)| +\sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^j (\textstyle{\frac1{2\pi}}\log n +c_X)^{-j} \gamma_{j,n}]\to 0, \qquad a.s. \] where W_t is a Brownian motion, W^{(n)}_t=W_{nt}/\sqrt n, \gamma_{j,n} is the renormalized intersection local time at time 1 for W^{(n)}, and c_X is a constant depending on the distribution of the random walk.
