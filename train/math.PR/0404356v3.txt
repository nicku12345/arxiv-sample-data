Let Y=(y_1,y_2,...), y_1\ge y_2\ge..., be the list of sizes of the cycles in the composition of c n transpositions on the set \{1,2,...,n\}. We prove that if c>1/2 is constant and n\to\infty, the distribution of f(c)Y/n converges to PD(1), the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with paramenter 1, where the function f is known explicitly. A new proof is presented of the theorem by Diaconis, Mayer-Wolf, Zeitouni and Zerner stating that the PD(1) measure is the unique invariant measure for the uniform coagulation-fragmentation process.
