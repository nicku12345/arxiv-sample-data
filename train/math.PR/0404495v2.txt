Iterated Brownian motion Z_{t} serves as a physical model for diffusions in a crack. If \tau_{D}(Z)  is the first exit time of this processes from a domain D \subset \RR{R}^{n}, started at z\in D, then P_{z}[\tau_{D}(Z)>t] is the distribution of the lifetime of the process in D. In this paper we determine the large time asymptotics of P_{z}[\tau_{P_{\alpha}}(Z) > t] which gives exponential integrability of \tau_{P_{\alpha}}(Z)  for parabola-shaped domains of the form  P_{\alpha}=\{(x,Y)\in \RR{R} \times \RR{R}^{n-1}: x>0, |Y|<Ax^{\alpha} \}, for  0<\alpha <1, A>0. We also obtain similar results for twisted domains in \RR{R}^{2} as defined in \cite{DSmits}. In particular, for a planar iterated Brownian motion in a parabola \mathcal{P}=\{(x,y): x>0, |y|< \sqrt{x} \} we find that for z\in \mathcal{P}   \lim_{t\to\infty} t^{-{1/7}} \log P_{z}[\tau_{\mathcal{P}}(Z) >t]= - \frac{7 \pi ^{2}}{2^{25/ 7}}.
