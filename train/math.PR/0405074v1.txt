It is known that Schramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLEs) have a.s. frontier points if \kappa>4 and a.s. cutpoints if 4<\kappa<8. If \kappa>4, an appropriate version of \SLE(\kappa) has a renewal property: it starts afresh after visiting its frontier. Thus one can give an excursion decomposition for this particular \SLE(\kappa) ``away from its frontier''. For 4<\kappa<8, there is a two-sided analogue of this situation: a particular version of \SLE(\kappa) has a renewal property w.r.t its cutpoints; one studies excursion decompositions of this \SLE ``away from its cutpoints''. For \kappa=6, this overlaps Vir\'ag's results on ``Brownian beads''. As a by-product of this construction, one proves Watts' formula, which describes the probability of a double crossing in a rectangle for critical plane percolation.
