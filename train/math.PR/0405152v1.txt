For {1/2}<\alpha<1, we propose the MDP analysis for family  S^\alpha_n=\frac{1}{n^\alpha}\sum_{i=1}^nH(X_{i-1}), n\ge 1,  where (X_n)_{n\ge 0} be a homogeneous ergodic Markov chain, X_n\in \mathbb{R}^d, when the spectrum of operator P_x is continuous. The vector-valued function H is not assumed to be bounded but the Lipschitz continuity of H is required. The main helpful tools in our approach are Poisson equation and Stochastic Exponential; the first enables to replace the original family by \frac{1}{n^\alpha}M_n with a martingale M_n while the second to avoid the direct Laplace transform analysis.
