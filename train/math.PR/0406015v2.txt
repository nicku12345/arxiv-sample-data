Using Lamperti's relationship between L\'{e}vy processes and positive self-similar Markov processes (pssMp), we study the weak convergence of the law \mathbb{P}_x of a pssMp starting at x>0, in the Skorohod space of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g paths, when x tends to 0. To do so, we first give conditions which allow us to construct a c\`{a}dl\`{a}g Markov process X^{(0)}, starting from 0, which stays positive and verifies the scaling property. Then we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the laws \mathbb{P}_x to converge weakly to the law of X^{(0)} as x goes to 0. In particular, this answers a question raised by Lamperti [Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 22 (1972) 205--225] about the Feller property for pssMp at x=0.
