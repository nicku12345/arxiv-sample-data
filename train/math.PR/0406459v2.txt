Recently, D. Williams \cite{williams} gave an explicit example of a random time \rho  associated with Brownian motion such that \rho  is not a stopping time but \mathbb{E}M_{\rho}=\mathbb{E}M_{0} for every bounded martingale M. The aim of this paper is to give some characterizations for such random times, which we call pseudo-stopping times, and to construct further examples, using techniques of progressive enlargements of filtrations.
