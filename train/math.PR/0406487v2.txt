We present a class of graphs where simple random walk is recurrent, yet two independent walkers meet only finitely many times almost surely. In particular, the comb lattice, obtained from Z^2 by removing all horizontal edges off the X-axis, has this property. We also conjecture that the same property holds for some other graphs, including the incipient infinite cluster for critical percolation in Z^2.
