We consider a multi-particle generalization of linear edge-reinforced random walk (ERRW). We observe that in absence of exchangeability, new techniques are needed in order to study the multi-particle model. We describe an unusual coupling construction associated with the two-point edge-reinforced process on Z and prove a form of recurrence: the two particles meet infinitely often a.s.
