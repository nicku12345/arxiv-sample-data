Consider the set of finite words on a totally ordered alphabet with q letters. We prove that the distribution of the length of the standard right factor of a random Lyndon word with length n, divided by n, converges to: \mu(dx)=\frac1q \delta_{1}(dx) + \frac{q-1}q \mathbf{1}_{[0,1)}(x)dx, when n goes to infinity. The convergence of all moments follows. This paper completes thus the results of \cite{Bassino}, giving the asymptotics of the mean length of the standard right factor of a random Lyndon word with length n in the case of a two letters alphabet.
