We prove that the ground state eigenfunction for symmetric stable processes of order \alpha\in (0, 2) killed upon leaving the interval (-1, 1) is concave on (-{1/2}, {1/2}). We call this property "mid--concavity." A similar statement holds for rectangles in \R^d, d>1. These result follow from similar results for finite dimensional distributions of Brownian motion and subordination.
