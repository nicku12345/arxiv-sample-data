Let the random variable Z_{n,k} denote the number of increasing subsequences of length k in a random permutation from S_n, the symmetric group of permutations of \{1,...,n\}. We show that Var(Z_{n,k_n})=o((EZ_{n,k_n})^2) as  n\to\infty if and only if k_n=o(n^\frac25). In particular then, the weak law of large numbers holds for Z_{n,k_n} if k_n=o(n^\frac25). We also show the following approximation result for the uniform measure U_n on S_n. Define the probability measure \mu_{n;k_n} on S_n as follows: Consider n cards, numbered from 1 to n, and laid out on a table from left to right in increasing order. Place a mark on k_n of the cards, chosen at random. Then pick up all the unmarked cards and randomly insert them between the k_n marked cards that remained on the table. Denote the resulting distribution on S_n by \mu_{n;k_n}. The weak law of large numbers holds for Z_{n,k_n} if and only if the total variation distance between \mu_{n;k_n} and U_n converges to 0 as n\to\infty.   In order to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the second moment, we need to analyze certain occupation times of certain conditioned two-dimensional random walks.
