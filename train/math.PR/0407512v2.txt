We consider the Cauchy problem for a semilinear stochastic differential inclusion in a Hilbert space. The linear operator generates a strongly continuous semigroup and the nonlinear term is multivalued and satisfies a condition which is more heneral than the Lipschitz condition. We prove the existence of a mild solution to this problem. This solution is not "strong" in the probabilistic sense, that is, it is not defined on the underlying probability space, but on a larger one, which provides a "very good extension" in the sense of Jacod and Memin. Actually, we construct this solution as a Young measure, limit of approximated solutions provided by the Euler scheme. The compactness in the space of Young measures of this sequence of approximated solutions is obtained by proving that some measure of noncompactness equals zero.
