In this paper excursions of a stationary diffusion in stationary state are studied. In particular, we compute the joint distribution of the occupation times I^{(+)}_t and I^{(-)}_t above and below, respectively, the observed level at time t during an excursion. We consider also the starting time g_t and the ending time d_t of the excursion (straddling t) and discuss their relations to the Levy measure of the inverse local time. It is seen that the pairs (I^{(+)}_t, I^{(-)}_t) and (t-g_t, d_t-t) are identically distributed. Moreover, conditionally on I^{(+)}_t + I^{(-)}_t =v, the variables I^{(+)}_t and I^{(-)}_t are uniformly distributed on (0,v).   Using the theory of the Palm measures, we derive an analoguous result for excursion bridges.
