Let (Z_n)_{n\in\N} be a d-dimensional {\it random walk in random scenery}, i.e.,   Z_n=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}Y(S_k) with (S_k)_{k\in\N_0} a random walk in \Z^d and (Y(z))_{z\in\Z^d} an i.i.d. scenery, independent of the walk. The walker's steps have mean zero and finite variance. We identify the speed and the rate of the logarithmic decay of \P(\frac 1n Z_n>b_n) for various choices of sequences (b_n)_n in [1,\infty). Depending on (b_n)_n and the upper tails of the scenery, we identify different regimes for the speed of decay and different variational formulas for the rate functions. In contrast to recent work \cite{AC02} by A. Asselah and F. Castell, we consider sceneries {\it unbounded} to infinity. It turns out that there are interesting connections to large deviation properties of self-intersections of the walk, which have been studied recently by X. Chen \cite{C03}.
