We prove that all the translation invariant Gibbs states of the Ising model are a linear combination of the pure phases \mu^+,\mu^- in the phase transition regime. This implies that the average magnetization is continuous in the phase transition regime (\beta > \beta_c). Furthermore, combined with previous results on the slab percolation threshold this shows the validity of Pisztora's coarse graining up to the critical temperature.
