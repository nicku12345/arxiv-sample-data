In this paper, we introduce a model of Brownian polymer in a continuous random environment. The asymptotic behavior of the partition function associated to this polymer measure is studied, and we are able to separate a weak and strong disorder regime under some reasonable assumptions on the spatial covariance of the environment. Some further developments, concerning some concentration inequalities for the partition function, are given for the weak disorder regime.
