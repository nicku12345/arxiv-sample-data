The chemical distance D(x,y) is the length of the shortest open path between two points x and y in an infinite Bernoulli percolation cluster. In this work, we study the asymptotic behaviour of this random metric, and we prove that, for an appropriate norm \mu depending on the dimension and the percolation parameter, the probability of the event \[\biggl\{0\leftrightarrow x,\frac{D(0,x)}{\mu(x)}\notin (1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \biggr\}\] exponentially decreases when \|x\|_1 tends to infinity. From this bound we also derive a large deviation inequality for the corresponding asymptotic shape result.
