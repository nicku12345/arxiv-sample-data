This paper is devoted to the problem of sample path large deviations for the Markov processes on R_+^N having a constant but different transition mechanism on each boundary set {x:x_i=0 for i\notin\Lambda, x_i>0 for i\in\Lambda}. The global sample path large deviation principle and an integral representation of the rate function are derived from local large deviation estimates. Our results complete the proof of Dupuis and Ellis of the sample path large deviation principle for Markov processes describing a general class of queueing networks.
