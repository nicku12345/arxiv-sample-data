For a subcritical Galton-Watson process (\zeta_n), it is well known that under an X \log X condition, the quotient P(\zeta_n > 0)/ E\zeta_n has a finite positive limit. There is an analogous result for a (one-dimensional) supercritical branching random walk: when a is in the so-called subcritical speed area, the probability of presence around na in the n-th generation is asymptotically proportional to the corresponding expectation. In Rouault (1993) this result was stated under a natural X \log X assumption on the offspring point process and a (unnatural) condition on the offspring mean. Here we prove that the result holds without this latter condition, in particular we allow an infinite mean and a dimension d \geq 1 for the state-space. As a consequence the result holds also for homogeneous fragmentations as defined in Bertoin (2001), using the method of discrete-time skeletons; this completes the proof of Theorem 4 in Bertoin-Rouault (2004 see math/PR/0409545). Finally, an application to conditioning on the presence allows to meet again the probability tilting and the so-called additive martingale.
