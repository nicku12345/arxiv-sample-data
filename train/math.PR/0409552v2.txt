Let U_m be an m \times m Haar unitary matrix and U_{[m,n]} be its n \times n truncation. In this paper the large deviation is proven for the empirical eigenvalue density of U_{[m,n]} as m/n \to \lambda  and n \to \infty. The rate function and the limit distribution are given explicitly. U_{[m,n]} is the random matrix model of quq, where u is a Haar unitary in a finite von Neumann algebra, q is a certain projection and they are free. The limit distribution coincides with the Brown measure of the operator quq.
