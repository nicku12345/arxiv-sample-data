We consider a last-passage directed percolation model in Z_+^2, with i.i.d. weights whose common distribution has a finite (2+p)th moment. We study the fluctuations of the passage time from the origin to the point \big(n,n^{\lfloor a \rfloor}\big). We show that, for suitable a (depending on p), this quantity, appropriately scaled, converges in distribution as n\to\infty to the Tracy-Widom distribution, irrespective of the underlying weight distribution. The argument uses a coupling to a Brownian directed percolation problem and the strong approximation of Koml\'os, Major and Tusn\'ady.
