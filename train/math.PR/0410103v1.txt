Let M be a noncompact metric space in which every closed ball is compact, and let G be a semigroup of Lipschitz mappings of M. Denote by (Y_n)_{n\geq1} a sequence of independent G-valued, identically distributed random variables   (r.v.'s), and by Z an M-valued r.v. which is independent of the r.v. Y_n, n\geq1. We consider the Markov chain (Z_n)_{n\geq0} with state space M which is defined recursively by Z_0=Z and Z_{n+1}=Y_{n+1}Z_n for n\geq0.   Let \xi be a real-valued function on G\times M. The aim of this paper is to prove central limit theorems for the sequence of r.v.'s (\xi(Y_n,Z_{n-1}))_{n\geq1}.   The main hypothesis is a condition of contraction in the mean for the action on M of the mappings Y_n; we use a spectral method based on a quasi-compactness property of the transition probability of the chain mentioned above, and on a special perturbation theorem.
