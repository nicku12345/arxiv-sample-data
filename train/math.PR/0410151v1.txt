The Lauricella theory of multiple hypergeometric functions is used to shed some light on certain distributional properties of the mean of a Dirichlet process. This approach leads to several results, which are illustrated here. Among these are a new and more direct procedure for determining the exact form of the distribution of the mean, a correspondence between the distribution of the mean and the parameter of a Dirichlet process, a characterization of the family of Cauchy distributions as the set of the fixed points of this correspondence, and an extension of the Markov-Krein identity. Moreover, an expression of the characteristic function of the mean of a Dirichlet process is obtained by resorting to an integral representation of a confluent form of the fourth Lauricella function. This expression is then employed to prove that the distribution of the mean of a Dirichlet process is symmetric if and only if the parameter of the process is symmetric, and to provide a new expression of the moment generating function of the variance of a   Dirichlet process.
