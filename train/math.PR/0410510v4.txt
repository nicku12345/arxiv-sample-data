The aim of this note is to provide some results for stochastic convolutions corresponding to stochastic Volterra equations in separable Hilbert space. We study convolution of the form W^{\Psi}(t):=\int_0^t S(t-\tau)\Psi(\tau)dW(\tau), t\geq 0, where S(t), t\geq 0, is so-called {\em resolvent} for Volterra equation considered,\Psi is an appropriate process and W is a cylindrical Wiener process.
