In order to study how well a finite group might be generated by repeated random multiplications, P. Diaconis suggested the following urn model. An urn contains some balls labeled by elements which generate a group G. Two are drawn at random with replacement and a ball labeled with the group product (in the order they were picked) is added to the urn. We give a proof of his conjecture that the limiting fraction of balls labeled by each group element almost surely approaches 1/|G|.
