Schramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLEs) describe a one-parameter family of growth processes in the plane that have particular conformal invariance properties. For instance, SLE can define simple random curves in a simply connected domain. In this paper we are interested in questions pertaining to the definition of several SLEs in a domain (i.e. several random curves). In particular, one derives infinitesimal commutation conditions, discuss some elementary solutions, study integrability conditions following from commutation and show how to lift these infinitesimal relations to global relations in simple cases. The situation in multiply-connected domains is also discussed.
