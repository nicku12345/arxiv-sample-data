We derive Painlev\'e--type expressions for the distribution of the m^{th} largest eigenvalue in the Gaussian Orthogonal and Symplectic Ensembles in the edge scaling limit. The work of Johnstone and Soshnikov (see [7], [10]) implies the immediate relevance of our formulas for the m^{th} largest eigenvalue of the appropriate Wishart distribution.
