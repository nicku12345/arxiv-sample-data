Let \zeta be the intersection exponent of random walks in Z^3 and \alpha be a positive real number. We construct a stochastic process from a simple random walk by erasing loops of length at most N^\alpha. We will prove that for \alpha < \frac{1}{1+2\zeta}, the limiting distribution is Gaussian. For \alpha > 2 the limiting distribution will be shown to be equal to the limiting distribution of the loop erased walk.
