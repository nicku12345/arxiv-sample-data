We study a spin system on a large box with both Ising interaction and Sherrington-Kirpatrick couplings, in the presence of an external field. Our results are: (i) existence of the pressure in the limit of an infinite box. When both Ising and Sherrington-Kirpatrick temperatures are high enough, we prove that: (ii) the value of the pressure is given by a suitable replica symmetric solution, and (iii) the fluctuations of the pressure are of order of the inverse of the square of the volume with a normal distribution in the limit. In this regime, the pressure can be expressed in terms of random field Ising models.
