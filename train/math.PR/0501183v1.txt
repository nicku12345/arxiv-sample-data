Given a probability distribution \mu a set \Lambda (\mu) of positive real numbers is introduced, so that \Lambda (\mu) measures the "divisibility" of \mu. The basic properties of \Lambda (\mu) are described and examples of probability distributions are given, which exhibit the existence of a continuum of situations interpolating the extreme cases of infinitely and minimally divisible probability distributions.
