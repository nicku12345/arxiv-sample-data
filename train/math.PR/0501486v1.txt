For every bounded planar domain D with a smooth boundary, we define a `Lyapunov exponent' \Lambda(D) using a fairly explicit formula. We consider two reflected Brownian motions in D, driven by the same Brownian motion (i.e., a `synchronous coupling'). If \Lambda(D)>0 then the distance between the two Brownian particles goes to 0 exponentially fast with rate \Lambda (D)/(2|D|) as time goes to infinity. The exponent \Lambda(D) is strictly positive if the domain has at most one hole. It is an open problem whether there exists a domain with \Lambda(D)<0.
