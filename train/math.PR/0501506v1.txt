We present three new identities in law for quadratic functionals of conditioned bivariate Gaussian processes. In particular, our results provide a two-parameter generalization of a celebrated identity in law, involving the path variance of a Brownian bridge, due to Watson (1961). The proof is based on ideas from a recent note by J. R. Pycke (2005) and on the stochastic Fubini theorem for general Gaussian measures proved in Deheuvels et al. (2004).
