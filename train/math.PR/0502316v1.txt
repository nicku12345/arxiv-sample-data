In this paper, we are interested in some questions of Greven and den Hollander about the rate function I\_{\eta}^q of quenched large deviations for random walk in random environment. By studying the hitting times of RWRE, we prove that in the recurrent case, \lim\_{\theta\to 0^+}(I\_{\eta}^q)''(\theta)=+\infty, which gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Greven and den Hollander. We also establish a comparison result between the rate function of quenched large deviations for a diffusion in a drifted Brownian potential, and the rate function for a drifted Brownian motion with the same speed.
