We consider the coupling of a single server queue and a storage model defined as a Queue/Store model in Draief et al. 2004. We establish that if the input variables, arrivals at the queue and store, satisfy large deviations principles and are linked through an {\em exponential tilting} then the output variables (departures from each system) satisfy large deviations principles with the same rate function. This generalizes to the context of large deviations the extension of Burke's Theorem derived in Draief et al. 2004.
