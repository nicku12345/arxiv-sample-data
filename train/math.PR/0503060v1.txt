Let \tau be the first hitting time of the point 1 by the geometric Brownian motion X(t)= x \exp(B(t)-2\mu t) with drift \mu \geq 0 starting from x>1. Here B(t) is the Brownian motion starting from 0 with E^0 B^2(t) = 2t. We provide an integral formula for the density function of the stopped exponential functional A(\tau)=\int_0^\tau X^2(t) dt and determine its asymptotic behaviour at infinity. Although we basically rely on methods developed in \cite{BGS}, the present paper also covers the case of arbitrary drifts \mu \geq 0 and provides a significant unification and extension of results of the above-mentioned paper. As a corollary we provide an integral formula and give asymptotic behaviour at infinity of the Poisson kernel for half-spaces for Brownian motion with drift in real hyperbolic spaces of arbitrary dimension.
