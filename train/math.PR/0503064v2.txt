We show that under reasonably general assumptions, the first order asymptotics of the free energy of matrix models are generating functions for colored planar maps. This is based on the fact that solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson equations are, by nature, generating functions for enumerating planar maps, a remark which bypasses the use of Gaussian calculus.
