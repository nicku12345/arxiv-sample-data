We consider the operator \sL f(x)=\tfrac12 \sum_{i,j=1}^\infty a_{ij}(x)\frac{\del^2 f}{\del x_i \del x_j}(x)-\sum_{i=1}^\infty \lam_i x_i b_i(x) \frac{\del f}{\del x_i}(x). We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to the martingale problem for this operator under appropriate conditions on the a_{ij}, b_i, and \lam_i. The process corresponding to \sL solves an infinite dimensional stochastic differential equation similar to that for the infinite dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
