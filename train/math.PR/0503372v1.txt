We provide an integral formula for the Poisson kernel of half-spaces for Brownian motion in real hyperbolic space \H^n. This enables us to find asymptotic properties of the kernel. Our starting point is the formula for its Fourier transform. When n=3, 4 or 6 we give an explicit formula for the Poisson kernel itself. In the general case we give various asymptotics and show convergence to the Poisson kernel of \H^n.
