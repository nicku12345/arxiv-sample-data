In this paper we study a one-parameter family of attractive reversible nearest particle system on a finite interval. As the length of the interval increases, the time that the nearest particle system first hits the empty set increases in different order, from logarithmic to exponential, according to the intensity of interaction. In particular, at the critical case, the first hitting time increases in a polynomial order.
