The purpose of the paper is to construct a polyhedral Markov field in {\mathbb R}^3 in analogy with the planar construction of the original Arak (1982) polygonal Markov field. We provide a dynamic construction of the process in terms of evolution of two-dimensional multi-edge systems tracing polyhedral boundaries of the field in three-dimensional time-space. We also give a general algorithm for simulating Gibbsian modifications of the constructed polyhedral field.
