This paper extends earlier work by Cox and Durrett, who studied the coalescence times for two lineages in the stepping stone model on the two-dimensional torus. We show that the genealogy of a sample of size n is given by a time change of Kingman's coalescent. With DNA sequence data in mind, we investigate mutation patterns under the infinite sites model, which assumes that each mutation occurs at a new site. Our results suggest that the spatial structure of the human population contributes to the haplotype structure and a slower than expected decay of genetic correlation with distance revealed by recent studies of the human genome.
