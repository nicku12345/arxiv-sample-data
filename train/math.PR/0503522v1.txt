In this paper we investigate the speed of convergence of the fluctuations of a general class of Feynman-Kac particle approximation models. We design an original approach based on new Berry-Esseen type estimates for abstract martingale sequences combined with original exponential concentration estimates of interacting processes. These results extend the corresponding statements in the classical theory and apply to a class of branching and genealogical path-particle models arising in nonlinear filtering literature as well as in statistical physics and biology.
