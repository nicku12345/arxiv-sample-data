Iteration of randomly chosen quadratic maps defines a Markov process: X_{n+1}=\epsilon_{n+1}X_n(1-X_n), where \epsilon_n are i.i.d. with values in the parameter space [0,4] of quadratic maps F_{\theta}(x)=\theta x(1-x). Its study is of significance as an important Markov model, with applications to problems of optimization under uncertainty arising in economics. In this article a broad criterion is established for positive Harris recurrence of X_n.
