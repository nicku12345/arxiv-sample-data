Under a complex technical condition, similar to such used in extreme value theory, we find the rate q(\epsilon)^{-1} at which a stochastic process with stationary increments \xi should be sampled, for the sampled process \xi(\lfloor\cdot /q(\epsilon)\rfloor q(\epsilon)) to deviate from \xi by at most \epsilon, with a given probability, asymptotically as \epsilon \downarrow0. The canonical application is to discretization errors in computer simulation of stochastic processes.
