We consider a superprocess with coalescing Brownian spatial motion. We first prove a dual relationship between two systems of coalescing Brownian motions. In consequence we can express the Laplace functionals for the superprocess in terms of coalescing Brownian motions, which allows us to obtain some explicit results. We also point out several connections between such a superprocess and the Arratia flow. A more general model is discussed at the end of this paper.
