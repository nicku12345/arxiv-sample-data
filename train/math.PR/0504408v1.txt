The aim of this short note is to present the notion of IDT processes, which is a wide generalization of L\'{e}vy processes obtained from a modified infinitely divisible property. Special attention is put on a number of examples, in order to clarify how much the IDT processes either differ from, or resemble to, L\'{e}vy processes.
