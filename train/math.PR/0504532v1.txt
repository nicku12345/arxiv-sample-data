In a recent paper by two of the authors, the concepts of upwards and downwards \epsilon-movability were introduced, mainly as a technical tool for studying dynamical percolation of interacting particle systems. In this paper, we further explore these concepts which can be seen as refinements or quantifications of stochastic domination, and we relate them to previously studied concepts such as uniform insertion tolerance and extractability.
