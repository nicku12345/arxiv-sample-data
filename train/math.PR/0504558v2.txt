A new method is described for constructing a generalized solution of a stochastic evolution equation. Existence, uniqueness, regularity and a probabilistic representation of this Wiener Chaos solution are established for a large class of equations. As an application of the general theory, new results are obtained for several types of the passive scalar equation.
