The paper studies a multiserver retrial queueing system with m servers. Arrival process is a point process with strictly stationary and ergodic increments. A customer arriving to the system occupies one of the free servers. If upon arrival all servers are busy, then the customer goes to the secondary queue, orbit, and after some random time retries more and more to occupy a server. A service time of each customer is exponentially distributed random variable with parameter \mu_1. A time between retrials is exponentially distributed with parameter \mu_2 for each customer. Using a martingale approach the paper provides an analysis of this system. The paper establishes the stability condition and studies a behavior of the limiting queue-length distributions as \mu_2 increases to infinity. As \mu_2\to\infty, the paper also proves the convergence of appropriate queue-length distributions to those of the associated `usual' multiserver queueing system without retrials. An algorithm for numerical solution of the equations, associated with the limiting queue-length distribution of retrial systems, is provided.
