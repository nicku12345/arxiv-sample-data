The present paper provides some new stochastic inequalities for the characteristics of the M/GI/1/n and GI/M/1/n loss queueing systems. These stochastic inequalities are based on substantially deepen up- and down-crossings analysis, and they are stronger than the known stochastic inequalities obtained earlier. Specifically, for a class of GI/M/1/n queueing system, two-side stochastic inequalities are obtained.
