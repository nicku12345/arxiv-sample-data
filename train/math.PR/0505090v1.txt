It was proved \cite{EMYa, QY} that stochastic lattice gas dynamics converge to the Navier-Stokes equations in dimension d=3 in the incompressible limits. In particular, the viscosity is finite. We proved that, on the other hand, the viscosity for a two dimensional lattice gas model diverges faster than \log \log t. Our argument indicates that the correct divergence rate is (\log t)^{1/2}. This problem is closely related to the logarithmic correction of the time decay rate for the velocity auto-correlation function of a tagged particle.
