Let Q_n denote a random symmetric n by n matrix, whose upper diagonal entries are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables (which take values 0 and 1 with probability 1/2). We prove that Q_n is non-singular with probability 1-O(n^{-1/8+\delta}) for any fixed \delta > 0. The proof uses a quadratic version of Littlewood-Offord type results concerning the concentration functions of random variables and can be extended for more general models of random matrices.
