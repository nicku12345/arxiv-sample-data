A generalized It{\hat {\rm o}} formula for time dependent functions of two-dimensional continuous semi-martingales is proved. The formula uses the local time of each coordinate process of the semi-martingale, left space and time first derivatives and second derivative \nabla_1^- \nabla_2^-f only which are assumed to be of locally bounded variation in certain variables, and stochastic Lebesgue-Stieltjes integrals of two parameters.The two-parameter integral is defined as a natural generalization of the It{\hat {\rm o}} integral and Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral through a type of It{\hat {\rm o}} isometry formula.
