We study the behavior of an infinite system of ordinary differential equations modeling the dynamics of a metapopulation, a set of (discrete) populations subject to local catastrophes and connected via migration under a mean field rule; the local population dynamics follow a generalized logistic law. We find a threshold below which all the solutions tend to total extinction of the metapopulation, which is then the only equilibrium; above the threshold, there exists a unique equilibrium with positive population, which, under an additional assumption, is globally attractive. The proofs employ tools from the theories of Markov processes and of dynamical systems.
