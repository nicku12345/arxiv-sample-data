In this paper, we consider the special class of positive local submartingales (X_{t}) of the form: X_{t}=N_{t}+A_{t}, where the measure (dA_{t}) is carried by the set {t: X_{t}=0}. We show that many examples of stochastic processes studied in the literature are in this class and propose a unified approach based on martingale techniques to study them. In particular, we establish some martingale characterizations for these processes and compute explicitly some distributions involving the pair (X_{t},A_{t}). We also associate with X a solution to the Skorokhod's stopping problem for probability measures on the positive half-line.
