For a stochastic process with state space some Polish space, this paper gives sufficient conditions on the initial and conditional distributions for the joint law to satisfy Gaussian concentration inequalities, transportation inequalities and also logarithmic Sobolev inequalities in the case of the Euclidean space. In several cases, the obtained constants are of optimal order of growth with respect to the number of variables, or are independent of this number. These results extend results known for mutually independent variables to weakly dependent variables under Dobrushin-Shlosman type conditions.
