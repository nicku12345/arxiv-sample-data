We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a homogeneous Markov process taking values in \R^n to enjoy the time-inversion property of degree \alpha. The condition sets the shape for the semigroup densities of the process and allows to further extend the class of known processes satisfying the time-inversion property. As an application we recover the result of Watanabe in \cite{Wa1975} for continuous and conservative Markov processes on \R_+. As new examples we generalize Dunkl processes and construct a matrix-valued process with jumps related to the Wishart process by a skew-product representation.
