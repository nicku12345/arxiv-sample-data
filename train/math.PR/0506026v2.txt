We present moment inequalities for completely degenerate Banach space valued (generalized) U-statistics of arbitrary order. The estimates involve suprema of empirical processes which, in the real-valued case, can be replaced by simpler norms of the kernel matrix (i.e., norms of some multilinear operators associated with the kernel matrix). As a corollary, we derive tail inequalities for U-statistics with bounded kernels and for some multiple stochastic integrals.
