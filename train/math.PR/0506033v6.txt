The M/GI/m/n queueing system with m homogeneous servers and the finite number n of waiting spaces is studied. Let \lambda be the customers arrival rate, and let \mu be the reciprocal of the expected service time of a customer. Under the assumption \lambda=m\mu it is proved that the expected number of losses during a busy period is the same value for all n\geq1, while in the particular case of the Markovian system M/M/m/n the expected number of losses during a busy period is \frac{m^m}{m!} for all n\geq0. Under the additional assumption that the probability distribution function of a service time belongs to the class NBU or NWU, the paper establishes simple inequalities for those expected numbers of losses in M/GI/m/n queueing systems.
