Let (\mu_{\alpha}) be a net of Radon sub-probability measures on the real line, and (t_{\alpha}) be a net in ]0,+\infty[ converging to 0. Assuming that the generalized log-moment generating function L(\lambda) exists for all \lambda in a nonempty open interval G, we give conditions on the left or right derivatives of L_{\mid G}, implying vague (and thus narrow when 0\in G) large deviations. The rate function (which can be nonconvex) is obtained as an abstract Legendre-Fenchel transform. This allows us to strengthen the G\"{a}rtner-Ellis theorem by removing the usual differentiability assumption. A related question of R. S. Ellis is solved.
