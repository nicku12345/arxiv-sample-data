Let 0<a<b<\infty be fixed scalars. Assign independently to each edge in the lattice \mathbb{Z}^2 the value a with probability p or the value b with probability 1-p. For all u,v\in\mathbb{Z}^2, let T(u,v) denote the first passage time between u and v. We show that there are points x\in\mathbb{R}^2 such that the ``time constant'' in the direction of x, namely, \lim_{n\to\infty}n^{-1}\mathbf{E}_p[T(\mathbf{0},nx)], is not a three times differentiable function of p.
