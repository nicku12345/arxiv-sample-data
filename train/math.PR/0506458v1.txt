We prove positivity results about linearization and connection coefficients for Bessel polynomials. The proof is based on a recursion formula and explicit formulas for the coefficients in special cases. The result implies that the distribution of a convex combination of independent Student-t random variables with arbitrary odd degrees of freedom has a density which is a convex combination of certain Student-t densities with odd degrees of freedom.
