Starting with a percolation model in \Z^d in the subcritical regime, we consider a random walk described as follows: the probability of transition from x to y is proportional to some function f of the size of the cluster of y. This function is supposed to be increasing, so that the random walk is attracted by bigger clusters. For f(t)=e^{\beta t} we prove that there is a phase transition in \beta, i.e., the random walk is subdiffusive for large \beta and is diffusive for small \beta.
