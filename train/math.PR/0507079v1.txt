Let L be a second order elliptic operator on R^d with a constant diffusion matrix and a dissipative (in a weak sense) drift b \in L^p_{loc} with some p>d.   We assume that L possesses a Lyapunov function, but no local boundedness of b is assumed. It is known that then there exists a unique probability measure \mu satisfying the equation L^*\mu=0 and that the closure of L in L^1(\mu) generates a Markov semigroup \{T_t\}_{t\ge 0} with the resolvent \{G_\lambda\}_{\lambda > 0}.   We prove that, for any Lipschitzian function f\in L^1(\mu) and all t,\lambda>0, the functions T_tf and G_\lambda f are Lipschitzian and |\nabla T_tf(x)| \leq T_t|\nabla f|(x) and |\nabla G_\lambda f(x)| \leq \frac{1}{\lambda} G_\lambda |\nabla f|(x).   An analogous result is proved in the parabolic case.
