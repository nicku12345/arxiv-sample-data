In this paper, we are interested in the behavior of the typical Poisson-Voronoi cell in the plane when the radius of the largest disk centered at the nucleus and contained in the cell goes to infinity. We prove a law of large numbers for its number of vertices and the area of the cell outside the disk. Moreover, for the latter, we establish a central limit theorem as well as moderate deviation type results. The proofs deeply rely on precise connections between Poisson-Voronoi tessellations, convex hulls of Poisson samples and germ-grain models in the unit ball. Besides, we derive analogous facts for the Crofton cell of a stationary Poisson line process in the plane.
