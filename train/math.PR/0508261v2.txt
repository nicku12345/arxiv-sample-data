We introduce a class of iterated processes called \alpha-time Brownian motion for 0<\alpha \leq 2. These are obtained by taking Brownian motion and replacing the time parameter with a symmetric \alpha-stable process. We prove a Chung-type law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for these processes which is a generalization of LIL proved in \cite{hu} for iterated Brownian motion. When \alpha =1 it takes the following form  \liminf_{T\to\infty}T^{-1/2}(\log \log T) \sup_{0\leq t\leq T}|Z_{t}|=\pi^{2}\sqrt{\lambda_{1}} a.s.  where \lambda_{1} is the first eigenvalue for the Cauchy process in the interval [-1,1]. We also define the local time L^{*}(x,t) and range R^{*}(t)=|\{x: Z(s)=x \text{for some} s\leq t\}| for these processes for 1<\alpha <2. We prove that there are universal constants c_{R},c_{L}\in (0,\infty)  such that  \limsup_{t\to\infty}\frac{R^{*}(t)}{(t/\log \log t)^{1/2\alpha}\log \log t}= c_{R} a.s.     \liminf_{t\to\infty} \frac{\sup_{x\in \RR{R}}L^{*}(x,t)}{(t/\log \log t)^{1-1/2\alpha}}= c_{L} a.s.
