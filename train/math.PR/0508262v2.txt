We introduce a class of stochastic processes based on symmetric \alpha-stable processes.   These are obtained by taking Markov processes and replacing the time parameter with the modulus of a symmetric \alpha-stable process. We call them \alpha-time processes. They generalize Brownian time processes studied in \cite{allouba1, allouba2, allouba3}, and they introduce new interesting examples. We establish the connection of   \alpha-time processes to some higher order PDE's for \alpha rational. We also study the exit problem for \alpha-time processes as they exit regular domains and connect them to elliptic PDE's. We also obtain the PDE connection of subordinate killed Brownian motion in bounded domains of regular boundary.
