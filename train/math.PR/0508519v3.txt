We generalize Lindeberg's proof of the central limit theorem to an invariance principle for arbitrary smooth functions of independent and weakly dependent random variables. The result is applied to get a similar theorem for smooth functions of exchangeable random variables. This theorem allows us to identify, for the first time, the limiting spectral distributions of Wigner matrices with exchangeable entries.
