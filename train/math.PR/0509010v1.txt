We prove that if (X,\mathfrakA,P) is an arbitrary probability space with countably generated \sigma-algebra \mathfrakA, (Y,\mathfrakB,Q) is an arbitrary complete probability space with a lifting \rho and \hat R is a complete probability measure on \mathfrakA \hat \otimes_R \mathfrakB determined by a regular conditional probability {S_y:y\in Y} on \mathfrakA with respect to \mathfrakB, then there exist a lifting \pi on (X\times Y,\mathfrakA \hat \otimes_R \mathfrakB,\hat R) and liftings \sigma_y on (X,\hat \mathfrakA_y,\hat S_y), y\in Y, such that, for every E\in\mathfrakA \hat \otimes_R \mathfrakB and every y\in Y, [\pi(E)]^y=\sigma_y\bigl([\pi(E)]^y\bigr). Assuming the absolute continuity of R with respect to P\otimes Q, we prove the existence of a regular conditional probability {T_y:y\in Y} and liftings \varpi on (X\times Y,\mathfrakA \hat \otimes_R \mathfrakB,\hat R), \rho' on (Y,\mathfrakB,\hat Q) and \sigma_y on (X,\hat \mathfrakA_y,\hat S_y), y\in Y, such that, for every E\in\mathfrakA \hat \otimes_R \mathfrakB and every y\in Y, [\varpi(E)]^y=\sigma_y\bigl([\varpi(E)]^y\bigr) and \varpi(A\times B)=\bigcup_{y\in\rho'(B)}\sigma_y(A)\times{y}\qquadif A\times B\in\mathfrakA\times\mathfrakB. Both results are generalizations of Musia\l, Strauss and Macheras [Fund. Math. 166 (2000) 281-303] to the case of measures which are not necessarily products of marginal measures. We prove also that liftings obtained in this paper always convert \hat R-measurable stochastic processes into their \hat R-measurable modifications.
