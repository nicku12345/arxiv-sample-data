In the paper stochastic Volterra equations of nonscalar type in Hilbert space are studied. The aim of the paper is to provide some results on stochastic convolution and mild solutions to those Volterra equations. The motivation of the paper comes from a model of aging viscoelastic materials. The pseudo-resolvent approach is used.
