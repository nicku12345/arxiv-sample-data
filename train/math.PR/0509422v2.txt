In this paper, we prove two main results. The first one is to give a new condition for the existence of two-parameter p, q-variation path integrals. Our condition of locally bounded p,q-variation is more natural and easy to verify than those of Young. This result can be easily generalized to multi-parameter case. The second result is to define the integral of local time \int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_0^t g(s,x)d_{s,x}L_s(x) pathwise and then give generalized It\hat {\rm o}'s formula when \nabla^-f(s,x) is only of bounded p,q-variation in (s,x). In the case that g(s,x)=\nabla^-f(s,x) is of locally bounded variation in (s,x), the integral \int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_0^t \nabla^-f(s,x)d_{s,x}L_s(x) is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral and was used in Elworthy, Truman and Zhao \cite{Zhao}. When g(s,x)=\nabla^-f(s,x) is of only locally p, q-variation, where p\geq 1,q\geq 1, and 2q+1>2pq, the integral is a two-parameter Young integral of p,q-variation rather than a Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral. In the special case that f(s,x)=f(x) is independent of s, we give a new condition for Meyer's formula and \int_{-\infty}^\infty L_t(x)d_x\nabla^-f(x) is defined pathwise as a Young integral. For this we prove the local time L_t(x) is of p-variation in x for each t\geq 0, for each p>2 almost surely (p-variation in the sense of Lyons and Young, i.e. \sup\limits_{E: \ a finite partition of [-N,N]} \sum\limits_{i=1}^m|L_t(x_i)-L_t(x_{i-1})|^p<\infty).
