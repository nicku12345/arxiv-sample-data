Let M be a random matrix in the orthogonal group \O_n, distributed according to Haar measure, and let A be a fixed n\times n matrix over \R such that \tr(AA^t)=n. Then the total variation distance of the random variable \tr(AM) to standard normal is bounded by 2\sqrt{3}/(n-1), and this rate is sharp up to the constant. Analogous results are obtained for M a random unitary matrix and A a fixed n\times n matrix over \C. The proofs are applications of a new abstract normal approximation theorem which extends Stein's method of exchangeable pairs to situations in which continuous symmetries are present.
