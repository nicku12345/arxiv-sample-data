We introduce a new family of distributions to approximate \mathbb {P}(W\in A) for A\subset\{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...\} and W a sum of independent integer-valued random variables \xi_1, \xi_2, ..., \xi_n with finite second moments, where, with large probability, W is not concentrated on a lattice of span greater than 1. The well-known Berry--Esseen theorem states that, for Z a normal random variable with mean \mathbb {E}(W) and variance \operatorname {Var}(W), \mathbb {P}(Z\in A) provides a good approximation to \mathbb {P}(W\in A) for A of the form (-\infty,x]. However, for more general A, such as the set of all even numbers, the normal approximation becomes unsatisfactory and it is desirable to have an appropriate discrete, nonnormal distribution which approximates W in total variation, and a discrete version of the Berry--Esseen theorem to bound the error. In this paper, using the concept of zero biasing for discrete random variables (cf. Goldstein and Reinert [J. Theoret. Probab. 18 (2005) 237--260]), we introduce a new family of discrete distributions and provide a discrete version of the Berry--Esseen theorem showing how members of the family approximate the distribution of a sum W of integer-valued variables in total variation.
