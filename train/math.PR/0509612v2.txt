For a class of processes modeling the evolution of a spatially structured population with migration and a logistic local regulation of the reproduction dynamics, we show convergence to an upper invariant measure from a suitable class of initial distributions. It follows from recent work of Alison Etheridge that this upper invariant measure is nontrivial for sufficiently large super-criticality in the reproduction. For sufficiently small super-criticality, we prove local extinction by comparison with a mean field model. This latter result extends also to more general local reproduction regulations.
