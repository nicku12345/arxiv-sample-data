We consider Random Walk in Random Scenery, denoted X_n, where the random walk is symmetric on Z^d, with d>4, and the random field is made up of i.i.d random variables with a stretched exponential tail decay, with exponent \alpha with 1<\alpha. We present asymptotics for the probability, over both randomness, that \{X_n>n^{\beta}\} for 1/2<\beta<1. To obtain such asymptotics, we establish large deviations estimates for the the self-intersection local times process.
