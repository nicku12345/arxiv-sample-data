We formulate large deviations principle (LDP) for diffusion pair (X^\epsilon,\xi^\epsilon)=(X_t^\epsilon,\xi_t^\epsilon), where first component has a small diffusion parameter while the second is ergodic Markovian process with fast time. More exactly, the LDP is established for (X^\epsilon,\nu^\epsilon) with \nu^\epsilon(dt,dz) being an occupation type measure corresponding to \xi_t^\epsilon. In some sense we obtain a combination of Freidlin-Wentzell's and Donsker-Varadhan's results. Our approach relies the concept of the exponential tightness and Puhalskii's theorem.
