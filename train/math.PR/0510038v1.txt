According to Comets, Gantert and Zeitouni on the one hand and to Derriennic on the other hand, some functionals associated to the hitting times of random walks in random environment on the integer line coincide, for the walk itself and for the walk in the reversed environment. We show that these two duality principles are algebraically equivalent, that they both stem from the Markov property of the walk in a fixed environment, and not of the ergodicity of the model, and that there exists finitist and almost sure versions of this duality.
