Consider the centered Gaussian field on the lattice \mathbb{Z}^d, d large enough, with covariances given by the inverse of \sum_{j=k}^K q_j(-\Delta)^j, where \Delta is the discrete Laplacian and q_j \in \mathbb{R},k\leq j\leq K, the q_j satisfying certain additional conditions. We extend a previously known result to show that the probability that all spins are nonnegative on a box of side-length N has an exponential decay at rate of order N^{d-2k}\log{N}. The constant is given in terms of a higher-order capacity of the unit cube, analogous to the known case of the lattice free field. This result then allows us to show that, if we condition the field to stay positive in the N-box, the local sample mean of the field is pushed to a height of order \sqrt{\log N}.
