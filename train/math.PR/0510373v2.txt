Let (T,d) be a metric space and \phi:\mathbb{R}_+\to \mathbb{R} an increasing, convex function with \phi(0)=0. We prove that if m is a probability measure m on T which is majorizing with respect to d,\phi, that is, \mathcal{S}:=\sup_{x\in T}\int^{D(T)}_0\phi^{-1}(\frac{1}{m(B(x,\epsilon))}) d\epsilon <\infty, then \[\mathbf{E}\sup_{s,t\in T}|X(s)-X(t)|\leq 32\mathcal{S}\] for each separable stochastic process X(t), t\in T, which satisfies \mathbf{E}\phi(\frac{|X(s)-X(t)|}{d(s,t)})\leq 1 for all s,t\in T, s\neq t. This is a strengthening of one of the main results from Talagrand [Ann. Probab. 18 (1990) 1--49], and its proof is significantly simpler.
