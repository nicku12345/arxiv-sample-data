The solution \vartheta =(\vartheta_{t})_{t\geq 0} of a class of linear stochastic partial differential equations is approximated using Clark's robust representation approach (\cite{c}, \cite{cc}). The ensuing approximations are shown to coincide with the time marginals of solutions of a certain McKean-Vlasov type equation. We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution of the McKean-Vlasov equation. The result leads to a representation of \vartheta as a limit of empirical distributions of systems of equally weighted particles. In particular, the solution of the Zakai equation and that of the Kushner-Stratonovitch equation (the two main equations of nonlinear filtering) are shown to be approximated the empirical distribution of systems of particles that have equal weights (unlike those presented in \cite{kj1} and \cite{kj2}) and do not require additional correction procedures (such as those introduced in \cite{dan3}, \cite{dan4}, \cite{dmm}, etc).
