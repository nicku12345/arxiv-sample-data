We consider an interacting particle system on the one dimensional lattice \bf Z modeling combustion. The process depends on two integer parameters 2\le a<M<\infty. Particles move independently as continuous time simple symmetric random walks except that 1. When a particle jumps to a site which has not been previously visited by any particle, it branches into a particles; 2. When a particle jumps to a site with M particles, it is annihilated. We start from a configuration where all sites to the left of the origin have been previously visited and study the law of large numbers and central limit theorem for r_t, the rightmost visited site at time t.   The proofs are based on the construction of a renewal structure leading to a definition of regeneration times for which good tail estimates can be performed.
