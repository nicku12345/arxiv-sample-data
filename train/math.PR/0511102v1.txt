Results of penalization of a one-dimensional Brownian motion (X_t) , by its one-sided maximum \dis (S_t=\sup_{0 \leq u \leq t}X_u), which were recently obtained by the authors are improved with the consideration-in the present paper- of the asymptotic behaviour of the likewise penalized Brownian bridges of length t, as t\to \infty, or penalizations by functions of (S_t,X_t), and also the study of the speed of convergence, as t\to \infty, of the penalized distributions at time t.
