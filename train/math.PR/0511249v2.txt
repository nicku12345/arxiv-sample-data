We show that for the mean zero simple exclusion process in \mathbb {Z}^d and for the asymmetric simple exclusion process in \mathbb{Z}^d for d\geq3, the self-diffusion coefficient of a tagged particle is stable when approximated by simple exclusion processes on large periodic lattices. The proof depends on a similar stability property of the Sobolev inner product associated with the operator.
