Berry Esseen type bounds to the normal, based on zero- and size-bias couplings, are derived using Stein's method. The zero biasing bounds are illustrated with an application to combinatorial central limit theorems where the random permutation has either the uniform distribution or one which is constant over permutations with the same cycle type and having no fixed points. The size biasing bounds are applied to the occurrences of fixed relatively ordered sub-sequences (such as rising sequences) in a random permutation, and to the occurrences of patterns, extreme values, and subgraphs on finite graphs.
