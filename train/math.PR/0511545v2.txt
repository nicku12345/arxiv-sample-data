Let \mu be a Gaussian measure on some measurable space \{W=\{w\},{\mathcal{B}}(W)\} and let \nu be a measure on the same space which is absolutely continuous with respect to \nu. The paper surveys results on the problem of constructing a transformation T on the W space such that Tw=w+u(w) where u takes values in the Cameron-Martin space and the image of \mu under T is \mu. In addition we ask for the existence of transformations T belonging to some particular classes.
