We prove a functional limit theorem for the rescaled occupation time fluctuations of a (d,\alpha,\beta)-branching particle system [particles moving in \mathbb {R}^d according to a symmetric \alpha-stable L\'{e}vy process, branching law in the domain of attraction of a (1+\beta)-stable law, 0<\beta<1, uniform Poisson initial state] in the case of intermediate dimensions, \alpha/\beta<d<\alpha(1+\beta)/\beta. The limit is a process of the form K\lambda\xi, where K is a constant, \lambda is the Lebesgue measure on \mathbb {R}^d, and \xi=(\xi_t)_{t\geq0} is a (1+\beta)-stable process which has long range dependence. For \alpha<2, there are two long range dependence regimes, one for \beta>d/(d+\alpha), which coincides with the case of finite variance branching (\beta=1), and another one for \beta\leq d/(d+\alpha), where the long range dependence depends on the value of \beta. The long range dependence is characterized by a dependence exponent \kappa which describes the asymptotic behavior of the codifference of increments of \xi on intervals far apart, and which is d/\alpha for the first case (and for \alpha=2) and (1+\beta-d/(d+\alpha))d/\alpha for the second one. The convergence proofs use techniques of \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb {R}^d)-valued processes.
