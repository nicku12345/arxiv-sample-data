We study some simple mathematical models designed to test the following hypothesis: can a pathogen escape the immune system only because of its high probability of mutation? We propose both spatial and non-spatial models. In all of our models, we assume that pathogens can mutate, leading to the appearance of new types of pathogens. We also assume that the immune system is able to get rid of all the pathogens of a given type at once but that it recognizes only one type at a time.
