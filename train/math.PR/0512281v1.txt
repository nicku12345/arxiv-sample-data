We give some representation about recent achievements in analysis of the M/G/1 queue with egalitarian processor sharing discipline (EPS). The new formmulas are derived for the j-th moments (j=1,2,...) of the (conditional) stationary sojourn time in the M/G/1--EPS queue with K (K=0,1,2,...) permanent jobs of infinite size. We discuss also how to simplify the computations of the moments.
