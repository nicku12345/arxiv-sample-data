A characterisation of quantum stochastic positive definite (PD) exponent is given in terms of the conditional positive definiteness (CPD) of their form-generator. The pseudo-Hilbert dilation of the stochastic form-generator and the pre-Hilbert dilation of the corresponding dissipator is found. The structure of quasi-Poisson stochastic generators giving rise to a quantum stochastic birth processes is studied.
