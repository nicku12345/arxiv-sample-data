Let (S_0,S_1,...) be a supermartingale relative to a nondecreasing sequence of \sigma-algebras H_{\le0},H_{\le1},..., with S_0\le0 almost surely (a.s.) and differences X_i:=S_i-S_{i-1}. Suppose that X_i\le d and \mathsf {Var}(X_i|H_{\le i-1})\le \sigma_i^2 a.s. for every i=1,2,..., where d>0 and \sigma_i>0 are non-random constants. Let T_n:=Z_1+...+Z_n, where Z_1,...,Z_n are i.i.d. r.v.'s each taking on only two values, one of which is d, and satisfying the conditions \mathsf {E}Z_i=0 and \mathsf {Var}Z_i=\sigma ^2:=\frac{1}{n}(\sigma_1^2+...+\sigma_n^2). Then, based on a comparison inequality between generalized moments of S_n and T_n for a rich class of generalized moment functions, the tail comparison inequality  \mathsf P(S_n\ge y) \le c \mathsf P^{\mathsf Lin,\mathsf L C}(T_n\ge y+\tfrach2)\quad\forall y\in \mathbb R is obtained, where c:=e^2/2=3.694..., h:=d+\sigma ^2/d, and the function y\mapsto \mathsf {P}^{\mathsf {Lin},\mathsf {LC}}(T_n\ge y) is the least log-concave majorant of the linear interpolation of the tail function y\mapsto \mathsf {P}(T_n\ge y) over the lattice of all points of the form nd+kh (k\in \mathbb {Z}). An explicit formula for \mathsf {P}^{\mathsf {Lin},\mathsf {LC}}(T_n\ge y+\tfrac{h}{2}) is given. Another, similar bound is given under somewhat different conditions. It is shown that these bounds improve significantly upon known bounds.
