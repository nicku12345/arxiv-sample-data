This paper is an adaptation of a method used in \cite{K} to the model of random quadrangulations. We prove local weak convergence of uniform measures on quadrangulations and show that the local growth of quadrangulation is governed by certain critical time-reversed branching process and the rescaled profile converges to the reversed continuous-state branching process. As an intermediate result we derieve a biparametric generating function for certain class of quadrangulations with boundary.
