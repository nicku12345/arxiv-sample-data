It is shown how to construct a successful co-adapted coupling of two copies of an n-dimensional Brownian motion (B_1,...,B_n) while simultaneously coupling all corresponding copies of L\'{e}vy stochastic areas \int B_i dB_j-\int B_j dB_i. It is conjectured that successful co-adapted couplings still exist when the L\'{e}vy stochastic areas are replaced by a finite set of multiply iterated path- and time-integrals, subject to algebraic compatibility of the initial conditions.
