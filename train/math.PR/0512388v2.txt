In this paper we study the property of asymptotic direction for random walks in random i.i.d. environments (RWRE). We prove that if the set of directions where the walk is transient is non empty and open, the walk admits an asymptotic direction. The main tool to obtain this result is the construction of a renewal structure with cones. We also prove that RWRE admits at most two opposite asymptotic directions.
