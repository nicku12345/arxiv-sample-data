For a finite mean supercriticial Bellman-Harris process, there exist numbers \chi_t (the Seneta constants) such that \chi_t times the size of the population at time t converges almost surely to a non-degenerate limit. We obtain a characterisation of the slowly varying part of the Seneta constants under the assumption that the life-time distribution of particles is strongly non-lattice.
