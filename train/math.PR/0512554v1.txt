Let F be a class of functions on a probability space (\Omega,\mu) and let X_1,...,X_k be independent random variables distributed according to \mu. We establish high probability tail estimates of the form \sup_{f \in F} |\{i : |f(X_i)| \geq t \} using a natural parameter associated with F. We use this result to analyze weakly bounded empirical processes indexed by F and processes of the form Z_f=|k^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^k |f|^p(X_i)-\E|f|^p| for p>1. We also present some geometric applications of this approach, based on properties of the random operator \Gamma=k^{-1/2}\sum_{i=1}^k \inr{X_i,\cdot}e_i, where the (X_i)_{i=1}^k are sampled according to an isotropic, log-concave measure on \R^n.
