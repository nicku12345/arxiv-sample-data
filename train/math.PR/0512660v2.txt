In this paper we present the fluid limit of an heavily loaded Earliest Deadline First queue with impatient customers, represented by a measure-valued process keeping track of residual time-credits of lost and waiting customers. This fluid limit is the solution of an integrated transport equation. We then use this fluid limit to derive fluid approximations of the processes counting the number of waiting and already lost customers.
