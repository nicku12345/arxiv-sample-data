We introduce a notion of nonlinear expectation --G--expectation-- generated by a nonlinear heat equation with infinitesimal generator G. We first discuss the notion of G-standard normal distribution. With this nonlinear distribution we can introduce our G-expectation under which the canonical process is a G--Brownian motion. We then establish the related stochastic calculus, especially stochastic integrals of Ito's type with respect to our G--Brownian motion and derive the related Ito's formula. We have also give the existence and uniqueness of stochastic differential equation under our G-expectation. As compared with our previous framework of g-expectations, the theory of G-expectation is intrinsic in the sense that it is not based on a given (linear) probability space.
