The Northeast Model is a spin system on the two-dimensional integer lattice that evolves according to the following rule: Whenever a site's southerly and westerly nearest neighbors have spin 1, it may reset its own spin by tossing a p-coin; at all other times, its spin remains frozen. It is proved that the northeast model has a phase transition at p_{c}=1-\beta_{c}, where \beta_{c} is the critical parameter for oriented percolation. For p<p_{c}, the trivial measure \delta_{0} that puts mass one on the configuration with all spins set at 0 is the unique ergodic, translation invariant, stationary measure. For p\geq p_{c}, the product Bernoulli-p measure on configuration space is the unique nontrivial, ergodic, translation invariant, stationary measure for the system, and it is mixing. For p>2/3 it is shown that there is exponential decay of correlations.
