In this note we introduce the notion of Newton--C\^{o}tes functionals corrected by L\'{e}vy areas, which enables us to consider integrals of the type \int f(y) \mathrm{d}x, where f is a {\mathscr{C}}^{2m} function and x,y are real H\"{o}lderian functions with index \alpha>1/(2m+1) for all m\in {\mathbb{N}}^*. We show that this concept extends the Newton--C\^{o}tes functional introduced in Gradinaru et al., to a larger class of integrands. Then we give a theorem of existence and uniqueness for differential equations driven by x, interpreted using the symmetric Russo--Vallois integral.
