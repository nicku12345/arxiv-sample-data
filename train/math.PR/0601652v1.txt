Let X be a random variable. We shall call an independent random variable Y to be a symmetrizer for X, if X+Y is symmetric around zero. A random variable is said to be symmetry resistant if the variance of any symmetrizer Y, is never smaller than the variance of X itself. We prove that a Bernoulli(p) random variable is symmetry resistant if and only if p is not 1/2. This is an old problem proved in 1999 by Kagan, Mallows, Shepp, Vanderbei & Vardi using linear programming principles. We reprove it here using completely probabilistic tools using Skorokhod embedding and Ito's rule.
