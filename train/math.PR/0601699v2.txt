We develop a notion of nonlinear expectation --G-expectation-- generated by a nonlinear heat equation with infinitesimal generator G. We first study multi-dimensional G-normal distributions. With this nonlinear distribution we can introduce our G-expectation under which the canonical process is a multi dimensional G-Brownian motion. We then establish the related stochastic calculus, especially stochastic integrals of Ito's type with respect to our G-Brownian motion and derive the related Ito's formula. We have also obtained the existence and uniqueness of stochastic differential equation under our G-expectation.
