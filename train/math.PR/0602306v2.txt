Let \{S_n\} be a random walk in the domain of attraction of a stable law \mathcal{Y}, i.e. there exists a sequence of positive real numbers (a_n) such that S_n/a_n converges in law to \mathcal{Y}. Our main result is that the rescaled process (S_{\lfloor nt\rfloor}/a_n, t\ge 0), when conditioned to stay positive, converges in law (in the functional sense) towards the corresponding stable L\'{e}vy process conditioned to stay positive. Under some additional assumptions, we also prove a related invariance principle for the random walk killed at its first entrance in the negative half-line and conditioned to die at zero.
