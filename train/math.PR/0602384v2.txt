In this paper we discuss existence and uniqueness for a one-dimensional time inhomogeneous stochastic differential equation directed by an \mathbb{F}-semimartingale M and a finite cubic variation process \xi which has the structure Q+R, where Q is a finite quadratic variation process and R is strongly predictable in some technical sense: that condition implies, in particular, that R is weak Dirichlet, and it is fulfilled, for instance, when R is independent of M. The method is based on a transformation which reduces the diffusion coefficient multiplying \xi to 1. We use generalized It\^{o} and It\^{o}--Wentzell type formulae. A similar method allows us to discuss existence and uniqueness theorem when \xi is a H\"{o}lder continuous process and \sigma is only H\"{o}lder in space. Using an It\^{o} formula for reversible semimartingales, we also show existence of a solution when \xi is a Brownian motion and \sigma is only continuous.
