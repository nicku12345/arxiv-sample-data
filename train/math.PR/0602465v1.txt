A Milstein-type scheme was proposed to improve the rate of convergence of its approximation of the solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by a vector of continuous semimartingales. A necessary and sufficient condition was provided for this rate to be 1/n when the SDE is driven by a vector of continuous local martingales, or continuous semimartingales under an additional assumption on their finite variation part. The asymptotic behavior (weak convergence) of the normalized error processes was also studied.
