Herein, we analyze an efficient branching particle method for asymptotic solutions to a class of continuous-discrete filtering problems. Suppose that t\to X_t is a Markov process and we wish to calculate the measure-valued process t\to\mu_t(\cdot)\doteq P\{X_t\in \cdot|\sigma\{Y_{t_k}, t_k\leq t\}\}, where t_k=k\epsilon and Y_{t_k} is a distorted, corrupted, partial observation of X_{t_k}. Then, one constructs a particle system with observation-dependent branching and n initial particles whose empirical measure at time t, \mu_t^n, closely approximates \mu_t. Each particle evolves independently of the other particles according to the law of the signal between observation times t_k, and branches with small probability at an observation time. For filtering problems where \epsilon is very small, using the algorithm considered in this paper requires far fewer computations than other algorithms that branch or interact all particles regardless of the value of \epsilon. We analyze the algorithm on L\'{e}vy-stable signals and give rates of convergence for E^{1/2}\{\|\mu^n_t-\mu_t\|_{\gamma}^2\}, where \Vert\cdot\Vert_{\gamma} is a Sobolev norm, as well as related convergence results.
