We extend a Gaussian functional inequality to a countable product of Gaussian measures. This inequality improves on the classical Poincare inequality for Gaussian measures. As an application, we prove that First Passage Percolation has sublinear variance when the edge times distribution belongs to a wide class of continuous distributions, including the exponential one. This extends a result by Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm, valid for positive Bernoulli edge times.
