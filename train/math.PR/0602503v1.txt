We study the error induced by the time discretization of a decoupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (X,Y,Z). The forward component X is the solution of a Brownian stochastic differential equation and is approximated by a Euler scheme X^N with N time steps. The backward component is approximated by a backward scheme. Firstly, we prove that the errors (Y^N-Y,Z^N-Z) measured in the strong L\_p-sense (p \geq 1) are of order N^{-1/2} (this generalizes the results by Zhang 2004). Secondly, an error expansion is derived: surprisingly, the first term is proportional to X^N-X while residual terms are of order N^{-1}.
