A new class of random partial differential equations of parabolic type is considered, where the stochastic term consists of an irregular noisy drift, not necessarily Gaussian, for which a suitable interpretation is provided. After freezing a realization of the drift (stochastic process), we study existence and uniqueness (in some appropriate sense) of the associated parabolic equation and a probabilistic interpretation is investigated.
