In this paper we derive non asymptotic deviation bounds for \P_\nu (|\frac 1t \int_0^t V(X_s) ds - \int V d\mu | \geq   R) where X is a \mu stationary and ergodic Markov process and V is some \mu integrable function. These bounds are obtained under various moments assumptions for V, and various regularity assumptions for \mu. Regularity means here that \mu may satisfy various functional inequalities (F-Sobolev, generalized Poincar\'e etc...).
