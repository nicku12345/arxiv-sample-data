We study the upper tail behaviors of the local times of the additive stable processes. Let X_1(t),...,X_p(t) be independent, d-dimensional symmetric stable processes with stable index 0<\alpha\le 2 and consider the additive stable process \bar{X}(t_1,...,t_p)=X_1(t_1)+... +X_p(t_p). Under the condition d<\alpha p, we obtain a precise form of the large deviation principle for the local time \[\eta^x([0,t]^p)=\int_0^t...\int_0^t\delta_x\bigl(X_1(s_1)+... +X_p(s_p)\bigr) ds_1... ds_p\] of the multiparameter process \bar{X}(t_1,...,t_p), and for its supremum norm \sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}^d}\eta^x([0,t]^p). Our results apply to the law of the iterated logarithm and our approach is based on Fourier analysis, moment computation and time exponentiation.
