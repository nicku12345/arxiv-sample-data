Let \mathbf{H}=(h_{ij}) and \mathbf{G}=(g_{ij}) be two m\times n, m\leq n, random matrices, each with i.i.d complex zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian entries, with correlation between any two elements given by \mathbb{E}[h_{ij}g_{pq}^\star]=\rho \delta_{ip}\delta_{jq} such that |\rho|<1, where {}^\star denotes the complex conjugate and \delta_{ij} is the Kronecker delta. Assume \{s_k\}_{k=1}^m and \{r_l\}_{l=1}^m are unordered singular values of \mathbf{H} and \mathbf{G}, respectively, and s and r are randomly selected from \{s_k\}_{k=1}^m and \{r_l\}_{l=1}^m, respectively. In this paper, exact analytical closed-form expressions are derived for the joint probability distribution function (PDF) of \{s_k\}_{k=1}^m and \{r_l\}_{l=1}^m using an Itzykson-Zuber-type integral, as well as the joint marginal PDF of s and r, by a bi-orthogonal polynomial technique. These PDFs are of interest in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication channels and systems.
