We consider the fragmentation at nodes of the L\'{e}vy continuous random tree introduced in a previous paper. In this framework we compute the asymptotic for the number of small fragments at time \theta. This limit is increasing in \theta and discontinuous. In the \alpha-stable case the fragmentation is self-similar with index 1/\alpha, with \alpha \in (1,2) and the results are close to those Bertoin obtained for general self-similar fragmentations but with an additional assumtion which is not fulfilled here.
