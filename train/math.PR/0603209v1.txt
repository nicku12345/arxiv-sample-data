A deck of n cards is shuffled by repeatedly moving the top card to one of the bottom k_n positions uniformly at random. We give upper and lower bounds on the total variation mixing time for this shuffle as k_n ranges from a constant to n. We also consider a symmetric variant of this shuffle in which at each step either the top card is randomly inserted into the bottom k_n positions or a random card from the bottom k_n positions is moved to the top. For this reversible shuffle we derive bounds on the L^2 mixing time. Finally, we transfer mixing time estimates for the above shuffles to the lazy top to bottom-k walks that move with probability 1/2 at each step.
