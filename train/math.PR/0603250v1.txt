We propose a time-space discretization scheme for quasi-linear parabolic PDEs. The algorithm relies on the theory of fully coupled forward--backward SDEs, which provides an efficient probabilistic representation of this type of equation. The derivated algorithm holds for strong solutions defined on any interval of arbitrary length. As a bypass product, we obtain a discretization procedure for the underlying FBSDE. In particular, our work provides an alternative to the method described in [Douglas, Ma and Protter (1996) Ann. Appl. Probab. 6 940--968] and weakens the regularity assumptions required in this reference.
