We give a general proof of aging for trap models using the arcsine law for stable subordinators. This proof is based on abstract conditions on the potential theory of the underlying graph and on the randomness of the trapping landscape. We apply this proof to aging for trap models on large two-dimensional tori and for trap dynamics of the Random Energy Model on a broad range of time scales.
