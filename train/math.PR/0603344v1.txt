These notes cover one of the topics of the class given in the Les Houches Summer School ``Mathematical statistical physics'' in July 2005. The lectures tried to give a summary of the recent mathematical results about the long-time behaviour of dynamics of (mean-field) spin-glasses and other disordered media. We have chosen here to restrict the scope of these notes to the dynamics of trap models only, but to cover this topic in somewhat more depth.
