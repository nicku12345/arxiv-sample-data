In this paper, we consider directed polymers in random environment with long range jumps in discrete space and time. We extend to this case some techniques, results and classifications known in the usual short range case. However, some properties are drastically different when the underlying random walk belongs to the domain of attraction of an \a-stable law. For instance, we construct natural examples of directed polymers in random environment which experience weak disorder in low dimension.
