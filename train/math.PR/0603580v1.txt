We consider the supercritical oriented percolation model. Let {\fK} be all the percolation points. For each u\in {\fK}, we write \gamma_u as its right-most path. Let G=\cup_u \gamma_u. In this paper, we show that   G is a single tree with only one topological end. We also present a relationship between {\fK} and G and construct a bijection between {\fK} and \Z using the preorder traversal algorithm. Through applications of this fundamental graph property, we show the uniqueness of an infinite oriented cluster by ignoring finite vertices.
