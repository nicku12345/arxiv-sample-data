Let \tau_{D}(Z)  be the first exit time of iterated Brownian motion from a domain D \subset \RR{R}^{n} started at z\in D and let P_{z}[\tau_{D}(Z) >t] be its distribution. In this paper we establish the exact asymptotics of P_{z}[\tau_{D}(Z) >t] over bounded domains as an improvement of the results in \cite{deblassie, nane2}, for z\in D \begin{eqnarray}   \lim_{t\to\infty} t^{-1/2}\exp({3/2}\pi^{2/3}\lambda_{D}^{2/3}t^{1/3}) P_{z}[\tau_{D}(Z)>t]= C(z),\nonumber \end{eqnarray} where C(z)=(\lambda_{D}2^{7/2})/\sqrt{3 \pi}(\psi(z)\int_{D}\psi(y)dy) ^{2}. Here \lambda_{D} is the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian {1/2}\Delta in D, and \psi  is the eigenfunction corresponding to \lambda_{D} .   We also study lifetime asymptotics of Brownian-time Brownian motion (BTBM), Z^{1}_{t}=z+X(|Y(t)|), where X_{t} and Y_{t} are independent one-dimensional Brownian motions.
