In this article, we consider random walk on the infinite cluster of bond percolation on \Z^d (d \geq 2). We show that the Laplace transformation of the number of visited points N\_n, has a behaviour as the random walk was on \Z^d. More precisely, for all 0<\alpha<1, we proved that there exist constants C\_i and C\_s such that for all infinite cluster that contains the origin, we have:  e^{-C\_i n^{\frac{d}{d+2}}} \leq \E\_0^{\omega} (\alpha^{N\_n}) \leq e^{-C\_sn^{\frac{d}{d+2}}}. Our approach is based on finding an isoperimetric inequalities on the infinite cluster, lifted on a wreath product which give good behaviour. The problem of the isoperimetry on wreath product was already raised by A.Ershler.
