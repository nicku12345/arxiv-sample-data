We define multiple chordal SLEs in a simply connected domain by considering a natural configurational measure on paths. We show how to construct these measures so that they are conformally covariant and satisfy certain boundary perturbation and Markov properties, as well as a cascade relation. As an example of our construction, we derive the scaling limit of Fomin's identity in the case of two paths directly; that is, we prove that the probability that an SLE(2) and a Brownian excursion do not intersect can be given in terms of the determinant of the excursion hitting matrix. Finally, we define the lambda-SAW, a one-parameter family of measures on self-avoiding walks on Z^2.
