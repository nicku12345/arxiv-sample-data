In this paper, we establish sharp two-sided estimates for the Green functions of non-symmetric diffusions with measure-valued drifts in bounded Lipschitz domains. As consequences of these estimates, we get a 3G type theorem and a conditional gauge theorem for these diffusions in bounded Lipschitz domains. We also establish two-sided estimates for the heat kernels of Schrodinger-type operators with measure-valued potential in bounded C^{1,1}-domains and a scale invariant boundary Harnack principle for the positive harmonic functions with respect to Schrodinger-type operators in bounded Lipschitz domains.
