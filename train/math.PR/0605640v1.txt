We study the size of connected components of random nearest-neighbor graphs with vertex set the points of a homogeneous Poisson point process in {\mathbb{R}}^d. The connectivity function is shown to decay superexponentially, and we identify the exact exponent. From this we also obtain the decay rate of the maximal number of points of a path through the origin. We define the generation number of a point in a component and establish its asymptotic distribution as the dimension d tends to infinity.
