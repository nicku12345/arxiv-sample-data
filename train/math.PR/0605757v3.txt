Recently, in [Preprint (2006)], we extended the concept of intrinsic ultracontractivity to nonsymmetric semigroups. In this paper, we study the intrinsic ultracontractivity of nonsymmetric diffusions with measure-valued drifts and measure-valued potentials in bounded domains. Our process Y is a diffusion process whose generator can be formally written as L+\mu\cdot\nabla-\nu with Dirichlet boundary conditions, where L is a uniformly elliptic second-order differential operator and \mu=(\mu^1,...,\mu^d) is such that each component \mu^i, i=1,...,d, is a signed measure belonging to the Kato class \mathbf{K}_{d,1} and \nu is a (nonnegative) measure belonging to the Kato class \mathbf{K}_{d,2}. We show that scale-invariant parabolic and elliptic Harnack inequalities are valid for Y. In this paper, we prove the parabolic boundary Harnack principle and the intrinsic ultracontractivity for the killed diffusion Y^D with measure-valued drift and potential when D is one of the following types of bounded domains: twisted H\"{o}lder domains of order \alpha\in(1/3,1], uniformly H\"{o}lder domains of order \alpha\in(0,2) and domains which can be locally represented as the region above the graph of a function. This extends the results in [J. Funct. Anal. 100 (1991) 181--206] and [Probab. Theory Related Fields 91 (1992) 405--443]. As a consequence of the intrinsic ultracontractivity, we get that the supremum of the expected conditional lifetimes of Y^D is finite.
