We consider a basic stochastic particle system consisting of N identical particles with isotropic k-particle synchronization, k\geq 2. In the limit when both number of particles N and time t=t(N) grow to infinity we study an asymptotic behavior of a coordinate spread of the particle system. We describe three time stages of t(N) for which a qualitative behavior of the system is completely different. Moreover, we discuss the case when a spread of the initial configuration depends on N and increases to infinity as N\to \infty .
