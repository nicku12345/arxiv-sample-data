The improper stochastic integral Z=\int_0^{\infty-}\exp(-X_{s-})dY_s is studied, where \{(X_t, Y_t), t \geqslant 0 \} is a L\'evy process on \mathbb R ^{1+d} with \{X_t \} and \{Y_t \} being \mathbb R-valued and \mathbb R ^d-valued, respectively. The condition for existence and finiteness of Z is given and then the law \mathcal L(Z) of Z is considered. Some sufficient conditions for \mathcal L(Z) to be selfdecomposable and some sufficient conditions for \mathcal L(Z) to be non-selfdecomposable but semi-selfdecomposable are given. Attention is paid to the case where d=1, \{X_t\} is a Poisson process, and \{X_t\} and \{Y_t\} are independent. An example of Z of type G with selfdecomposable mixing distribution is given.
