We consider catalytic branching populations. They consist of a catalyst population evolving according to a critical binary branching process in continuous time with a constant branching rate and a reactant population with a branching rate proportional to the number of catalyst individuals alive. The reactant forms a process in random medium. We describe asymptotically the genealogy of catalytic branching populations coded as the induced forest of \mathbb{R}-trees using the many individuals--rapid branching continuum limit. The limiting continuum genealogical forests are then studied in detail from both the quenched and annealed points of view. The result is obtained by constructing a contour process and analyzing the appropriately rescaled version and its limit. The genealogy of the limiting forest is described by a point process. We compare geometric properties and statistics of the reactant limit forest with those of the "classical" forest.
