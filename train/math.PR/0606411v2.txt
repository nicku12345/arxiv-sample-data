We consider a diffusion process X in a random L\'{e}vy potential \mathbb{V} which is a solution of the informal stochastic differential equation \begin{eqnarray*}\cases{dX_t=d\beta_t-{1/2}\mathbb{V}'(X_t) dt,\cr X_0=0,}\end{eqnarray*} (\beta B. M. independent of \mathbb{V}). We study the rate of convergence when the diffusion is transient under the assumption that the L\'{e}vy process \mathbb{V} does not possess positive jumps. We generalize the previous results of Hu--Shi--Yor for drifted Brownian potentials. In particular, we prove a conjecture of Carmona: provided that there exists 0<\kappa<1 such that \mathbf{E}[e^{\kappa\mathbb{V}_1}]=1, then X_t/t^{\kappa} converges to some nondegenerate distribution. These results are in a way analogous to those obtained by Kesten--Kozlov--Spitzer for the transient random walk in a random environment.
