Let (\Omega,\mathcal{B},P) be a probability space, \mathcal{A}\subset\mathcal{B} a sub-\sigma-field, and \mu a regular conditional distribution for P given \mathcal{A}. Necessary and sufficient conditions for \mu(\omega)(A) to be 0--1, for all A\in\mathcal{A} and \omega\in A_0, where A_0\in\mathcal{A} and P(A_0)=1, are given. Such conditions apply, in particular, when \mathcal{A} is a tail sub-\sigma-field. Let H(\omega) denote the \mathcal{A}-atom including the point \omega\in\Omega. Necessary and sufficient conditions for \mu(\omega)(H(\omega)) to be 0--1, for all \omega\in A_0, are also given. If (\Omega,\mathcal{B}) is a standard space, the latter 0--1 law is true for various classically interesting sub-\sigma-fields \mathcal{A}, including tail, symmetric, invariant, as well as some sub-\sigma-fields connected with continuous time processes.
