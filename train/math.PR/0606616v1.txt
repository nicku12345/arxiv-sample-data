A new formulation of non-local branching superprocesses is given from which we derive as special cases the rebirth, the multitype, the mass-structured, the multilevel and the age-reproduction-structured superprocesses and the superprocess-controlled immigration process. This unified treatment simplifies considerably the proof of existence of the old classes of superprocesses and also gives rise to some new ones.
