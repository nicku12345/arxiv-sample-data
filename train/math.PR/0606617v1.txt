A special type of immigration associated with measure-valued branching processes is formulated by using skew convolution semigroups. We give characterization for a general inhomogeneous skew convolution semigroup in terms of probability entrance laws. The related immigration process is constructed by summing up measure-valued paths in the Kuznetsov process determined by an entrance rule. The behavior of the Kuznetsov process is then studied, which provides insights into trajectory structures of the immigration process. Some well-known results on excessive measures are formulated in terms of stationary immigration processes.
