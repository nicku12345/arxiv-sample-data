It is proved that a general non-differentiable skew convolution semigroup associated with a strongly continuous semigroup of linear operators on a real separable Hilbert space can be extended to a differentiable one on the entrance space of the linear semigroup. A cadlag strong Markov process on an enlargement of the entrance space is constructed from which we obtain a realization of the corresponding Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Some explicit characterizations of the entrance spaces for special linear semigroups are given.
