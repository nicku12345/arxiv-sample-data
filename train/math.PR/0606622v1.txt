A non-critical branching immigration superprocess with dependent spatial motion is constructed and characterized as the solution of a stochastic equation driven by a time-space white noise and an orthogonal martingale measure. A representation of its conditional log-Laplace functionals is established, which gives the uniqueness of the solution and hence its Markov property. Some properties of the superprocess including an ergodic theorem are also obtained.
