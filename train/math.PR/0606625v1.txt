Let {\cal T} be a rooted Galton-Watson tree with offspring distribution \{p_k\} that has p_0=0, mean m=\sum kp_k>1 and exponential tails. Consider the \lambda-biased random walk \{X_n\}_{n\geq 0} on {\cal T}; this is the nearest neighbor random walk which, when at a vertex v with d_v offspring, moves closer to the root with probability \lambda/(\lambda+d_v), and moves to each of the offspring with probability 1/(\lambda+d_v). It is known that this walk has an a.s. constant speed \v=\lim_n |X_n|/n   (where |X_n| is the distance of X_n from the root), with \v>0 for  0<\lambda<m and \v=0 for \lambda \ge m. For all \lambda \le m, we prove a quenched CLT for |X_n|-n\v. (For \lambda>m the walk is positive recurrent, and there is no CLT.) The most interesting case by far is \lambda=m, where the CLT has the following form: for almost every {\cal T}, the ratio |X_{[nt]}|/\sqrt{n} converges in law as n \to \infty to a deterministic multiple of the absolute value of a Brownian motion. Our approach to this case is based on an explicit description of an invariant measure for the walk from the point of view of the particle (previously, such a measure was explicitly known only for \lambda=1) and the construction of appropriate harmonic coordinates.
