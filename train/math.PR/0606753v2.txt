Let B^{H, K}= \big\{B^{H, K}(t), t \in \R_+ \big\} be a bifractional Brownian motion in \R^d. We prove that B^{H, K} is strongly locally nondeterministic. Applying this property and a stochastic integral representation of B^{H, K}, we establish Chung's law of the iterated logarithm for B^{H, K}, as well as sharp H\"older conditions and tail probability estimates for the local times of B^{H, K}. We also consider the existence and the regularity of the local times of multiparameter bifractional Brownian motion B^{\bar{H}, \bar{K}}= \big\{B^{\bar{H}, \bar{K}}(t), t \in \R^N_+ \big\} in \R^d using Wiener-It\^o chaos expansion.
