It is known that a random walk on \Z^d among i.i.d. uniformly elliptic random bond conductances verifies a central limit theorem. It is also known that approximations of the covariance matrix can be obtained by considering periodic environments. Here we estimate the speed of convergence of this homogenization result. We obtain similar estimates for finite volume approximations of the effective conductance and of the lowest Dirichlet eigenvalue. A lower bound is also given for the variance of the Green function of a random walk in a random non-negative potential.
