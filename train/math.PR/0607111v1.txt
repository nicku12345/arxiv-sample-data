The aim of this work is to evaluate the cheapest superreplication price of a general (possibly path-dependent) European contingent claim in a context where the model is uncertain. This setting is a generalization of the uncertain volatility model (UVM) introduced in by Avellaneda, Levy and Paras. The uncertainty is specified by a family of martingale probability measures which may not be dominated. We obtain a partial characterization result and a full characterization which extends Avellaneda, Levy and Paras results in the UVM case.
