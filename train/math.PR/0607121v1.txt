Consider a random walk (S_n:n\geq0) with drift -\mu and S_0=0. Assuming that the increments have exponential moments, negative mean, and are strongly nonlattice, we provide a complete asymptotic expansion (in powers of \mu>0) that corrects the diffusion approximation of the all time maximum M=\max_{n\geq0}S_n. Our results extend both the first-order correction of Siegmund [Adv. in Appl. Probab. 11 (1979) 701--719] and the full asymptotic expansion provided in the Gaussian case by Chang and Peres [Ann. Probab. 25 (1997) 787--802]. We also show that the Cram\'{e}r--Lundberg constant (as a function of \mu) admits an analytic extension throughout a neighborhood of the origin in the complex plane \mathbb{C}. Finally, when the increments of the random walk have nonnegative mean \mu, we show that the Laplace transform, E_{\mu}\exp(-bR(\infty)), of the limiting overshoot, R(\infty), can be analytically extended throughout a disc centered at the origin in \mathbb{C\times C} (jointly for both b and \mu). In addition, when the distribution of the increments is continuous and appropriately symmetric, we show that E_{\mu}S_{\tau} [where \tau is the first (strict) ascending ladder epoch] can be analytically extended to a disc centered at the origin in \mathbb{C}, generalizing the main result in [Ann. Probab. 25 (1997) 787--802] and extending a related result of Chang [Ann. Appl. Probab. 2 (1992) 714--738].
