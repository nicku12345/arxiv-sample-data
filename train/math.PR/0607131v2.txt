We study asymptotic percolation as N\to \infty in an infinite random graph {\cal G}_N embedded in the hierarchical group of order N, with connection probabilities depending on an ultrametric distance between vertices. {\cal G}_N is structured as a cascade of finite random subgraphs of (approximate) Erd\"os-Renyi type. We give a criterion for percolation, and show that percolation takes place along giant components of giant components at the previous level in the cascade of subgraphs for all consecutive hierarchical distances. The proof involves a hierarchy of random graphs with vertices having an internal structure and random connection probabilities.
