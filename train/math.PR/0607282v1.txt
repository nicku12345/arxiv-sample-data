For real L\'{e}vy processes (X\_t)\_{t \geq 0} having no Brownian component with Blumenthal-Getoor index \beta, the estimate \E \sup\_{s \leq t} | X\_s - a\_p s |^p \leq C\_p t for every t \in [0,1] and suitable a\_p \in \R has been established by Millar \cite{MILL} for \beta < p \leq 2 provided X\_1 \in L^p. We derive extensions of these estimates to the cases p > 2 and p \leq\beta.
