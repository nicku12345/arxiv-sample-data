A L\'evy process on R^d with distribution \mu at time 1 is denoted by X^{(\mu)}=\{X_t^{(\mu)}\}. If the improper stochastic integral \int_0^{\infty-} f(s)dX_s^{(\mu)} of f with respect to X^{(\mu)} is definable, its distribution is denoted by \Phi_f(\mu). The class of all infinitely divisible distributions \mu on R^d such that \Phi_f(\mu) is definable is denoted by D(\Phi_f). The class D(\Phi_f), its two extensions D_c(\Phi_f) and D_e(\Phi_f) (compensated and essential), and its restriction D^0(\Phi_f) (absolutely definable) are studied. It is shown that D_e(\Phi_f) is monotonic with respect to f, which means that |f_2|\leq |f_1| implies D_e(\Phi_{f_1})\subset D_e(\Phi_{f_2}). Further, D^0(\Phi_f) is monotonic with respect to f but neither D(\Phi_f) nor D_c(\Phi_f) is monotonic with respect to f. Furthermore, there exist \mu, f_1, and f_2 such that 0\leq f_2\leq f_1, \mu\in D(\Phi_{f_1}), and \mu\not\in D(\Phi_{f_2}). An explicit example for this is related to some properties of a class of martingale L\'evy processes.
