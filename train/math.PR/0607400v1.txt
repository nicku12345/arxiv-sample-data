We analyze a pair of reflected Brownian motions in a planar domain D, for which the increments of both processes form mirror images of each other when the processes are not on the boundary. We show that for D in a class of smooth convex planar domains, the two processes remain ordered forever, according to a certain partial order.   This is used to prove that the second eigenvalue is simple for the Laplacian with Neumann boundary conditions for the same class of domains.
