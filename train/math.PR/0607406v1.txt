We analyze the asymptotic behavior of random variables x(n,x\_0) defined by x(0,x\_0)=x\_0 and x(n+1,x\_0)=A(n)x(n,x\_0), where \sAn is a stationary and ergodic sequence of random matrices with entries in the semi-ring \mbox{\R\cup\{-\infty\}} whose addition is the \max and whose multiplication is +. Such sequences modelize a large class of discrete event systems, among which timed event graphs, 1-bounded Petri nets, some queuing networks, train or computer networks. We give necessary conditions for (\frac{1}{n}x(n,x\_0))\_{n\in\N} to converge almost surely. Then, we prove a general scheme to give partial converse theorems. When \max\_{A\_{ij}(0)\neq -\infty}|A\_{ij}(0)| is integrable, it allows us: - to give a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of (\frac{1}{n}x(n,0))\_{n\in\N} when the sequence (A(n))\_{n\in\N} is i.i.d., - to prove that, if (A(n) )\_{n\in\N} satisfy a condition of reinforced ergodicity and a condition of fixed structure (i.e. \P(A\_{ij}(0)=-\infty)\in\{0,1\}), then (\frac{1}{n}x(n,0))\_{n\in\N} converges almost-surely, - and to reprove the convergence of (\frac{1}{n}x(n,0))\_{n\in\N} if the diagonal entries are never -\infty.
