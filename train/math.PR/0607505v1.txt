We examine the fluctuations of the empirical density measure for the colour version of the symmetric nearest neighbour zero range particle systems in dimension one. We show that the weak limit of these fluctuations is the solution of a system of coupled generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We also discuss how this result may be used to prove a central limit theorem for the tagged particle on the level of finite dimensional distributions, and identify the limiting variance. This is the central limit theorem associated to propagation of chaos for this interacting particle system.
