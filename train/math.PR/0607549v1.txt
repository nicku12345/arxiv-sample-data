We consider a model of the reaction X+Y\to 2X on the integer lattice in which Y particles do not move while X particles move as independent continuous time, simple symmetric random walks. Y particles are transformed instantaneously to X particles upon contact. We start with a fixed number a\ge 1 of Y particles at each site to the right of the origin, and define a class of configurations of the X particles to the left of the origin having a finite l^1 norm with a specified exponential weight. Starting from any configuration of X particles to the left of the origin within such a class, we prove a central limit theorem for the position of the rightmost visited site of the X particles.
