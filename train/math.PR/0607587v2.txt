We establish a connection between the structure of a stationary symmetric alpha-stable random field (0 < alpha < 2) and ergodic theory of non-singular group actions, elaborating on a previous work by Rosinski (2000). With the help of this connection, we study the extreme values of the field over increasing boxes. Depending on the ergodic theoretical and group theoretical structures of the underlying action, we observe different kinds of asymptotic behavior of this sequence of extreme values.
