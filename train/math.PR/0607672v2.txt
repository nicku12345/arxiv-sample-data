Let X=\{X(t),t\in R_+\} be a real-valued symmetric L\'{e}vy process with continuous local times \{L^x_t,(t,x)\in R_+\times R\} and characteristic function Ee^{i\lambda X(t)}=e^{-t\psi(\lambda)}. Let \[\sigma^2_0(x-y)=\frac{4}{\pi}\int^{\infty}_0\frac{\sin^2({\lambda(x- y)}/{2})}{{\psi(\lambda)}} d\lambda.\] If \sigma^2_0(h) is concave, and satisfies some additional very weak regularity conditions, then for any p\ge1, and all t\in R_+, \[\lim_{h\downar row0}\int_a^b\biggl|{\frac{L^{x+h}_t-L^x_t}{\sigma_0(h)}}\biggr|^p dx =2^{p/2}E|\eta|^p\int_a^b|L^x_t|^{p/2} dx\] for all a,b in the extended real line almost surely, and also in L^m, m\ge1. (Here \eta is a normal random variable with mean zero and variance one.) This result is obtained via the Eisenbaum Isomorphism Theorem and depends on the related result for Gaussian processes with stationary increments, \{G(x),x\in R^1\}, for which E(G(x)-G(y))^2=\sigma_0^2(x-y); \[\lim_{h\to0}\int_a^b\biggl|\frac{G (x+h)-G(x)}{\sigma_0(h)}\biggr|^p dx=E|\eta|^p(b-a)\] for all a,b\in R^1, almost surely.
