We consider both the effect of particle inertia on stochastic Stokes' drift, and also a related process which could be considered as a crude model of stochastic Stokes' drift driven by an eddy diffusivity. In the latter, the stochastic forcing is a stable OU process rather than Brownian motion. We show that the eddy Stokes' drift velocity has a peak at a non-zero value of the correlation time-scale for particles that have the same (limiting) diffusivity. For both of the models considered, this study shows that not only can stochastic Stokes' drift be used to sort particles with different diffusivities, but also it can be used to sort particles of the same diffusivities but with different particle masses or correlation time-scales. This effect may be important in particle sorting applications.
