An annulus SLE_\kappa trace tends to a single point on the target circle, and the density function of the end point satisfies some differential equation. Some martingales or local martingales are found for annulus SLE_4, SLE_8 and SLE_{8/3}. From the local martingale for annulus SLE_4 we find a candidate of discrete lattice model that may have annulus SLE_4 as its scaling limit. The local martingale for annulus SLE_{8/3} is similar to those for chordal and radial SLE_{8/3}. But it seems that annulus SLE_{8/3} does not satisfy the restriction property.
