We consider the stochastic Stokes drift of a flexible dumbbell. The dumbbell consists of two isotropic Brownian particles connected by a linear spring with zero natural length, and is advected by a sinusoidal wave. We find an asymptotic approximation for the Stokes drift in the limit of a weak wave, and find good agreement with the results of a Monte Carlo simulation. We show that it is possible to use this effect to sort particles by their flexibility even when all the particles have the same diffusivity.
