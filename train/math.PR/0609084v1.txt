Let B_t be a one dimensional Brownian motion, and let \alpha' denote the derivative of the intersection local time of B_t as defined in Jay Rosen's work (see references). The object of this paper is to prove the following formula (1/2)\alpha'_t(x) + (1/2)sgn(x)t = \int_0^t L_s^{B_s - x}dB_s - \int_0^t sgn(B_t - B_u - x) du which was given as a formal identity by Rosen without proof.
