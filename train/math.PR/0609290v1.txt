We prove functional limits theorems for the occupation time process of a system of particles moving independently in R^d according to a symmetric \alpha-stable L\'evy process, and starting off from an inhomogeneous Poisson point measure with intensity measure \mu(dx)=(1+|x|^{\gamma})^{-1}dx,\gamma>0, and other related measures. In contrast to the homogeneous case (\gamma=0), the system is not in equilibrium and ultimately it vanishes, and there are more different types of occupation time limit processes depending on arrangements of the parameters \gamma, d and \alpha. The case \gamma<d<\alpha leads to an extension of fractional Brownian motion.
