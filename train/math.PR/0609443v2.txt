Let \sigma(u), u\in \mathbb{R} be an ergodic stationary Markov chain, taking a finite number of values a_1,...,a_m, and b(u)=g(\sigma(u)), where g is a bounded and measurable function.   We consider the diffusion type process  dX^\epsilon_t = b(X^\epsilon_t/\epsilon)dt + \epsilon^\kappa\sigma\big(X^\epsilon_t/\epsilon\big)dB_t, t\le T  subject to X^\epsilon_0=x_0, where \epsilon is a small positive parameter, B_t is a Brownian motion, independent of \sigma, and \kappa> 0 is a fixed constant. We show that for \kappa<1/6, the family \{X^\epsilon_t\}_{\epsilon\to 0} satisfies the Large Deviations Principle (LDP) of the Freidlin-Wentzell type with the constant drift \mathbf{b} and the diffusion \mathbf{a}, given by  \mathbf{b}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^m\dfrac{g(a_i)}{a^2_i}\pi_i\Big/ \sum\limits_{i=1}^m\dfrac{1}{a^2_i}\pi_i, \quad \mathbf{a}=1\Big/\sum\limits_{i=1}^m\dfrac{1}{a^2_i}\pi_i,  where \{\pi_1,...,\pi_m\} is the invariant distribution of the chain \sigma(u).
