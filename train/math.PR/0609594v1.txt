We study a random graph model which combines properties of the edge percolation model on Z^d and a classical random graph G(n,c/n). We show that this model, being a homogeneous random graph, has a natural relation to the so-called "rank 1 case" of inhomogeneous random graphs. This allows us to use the newly developed theory of inhomogeneous random graphs to describe completely the phase diagram in the case d=1. The phase transition is similar to the classical random graph, it is of the second order. We also find the scaled size of the largest connected component above the phase transition.
