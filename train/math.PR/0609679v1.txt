Dunkl processes are martingales as well as c\`{a}dl\`{a}g homogeneous Markov processes taking values in \mathbb{R}^d and they are naturally associated with a root system. In this paper we study the jumps of these processes, we describe precisely their martingale decompositions into continuous and purely discontinuous parts and we obtain a Wiener chaos decomposition of the corresponding L^2 spaces of these processes in terms of adequate mixed multiple stochastic integrals.
