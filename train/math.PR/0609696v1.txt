Khoshnevisan and Xiao showed in [Ann. Probab. 33 (2005) 841--878] that the statement about almost surely vanishing Bessel--Riesz capacity of the image of a Borel set G\subset\mathbb{R}_+ under a symmetric L\'{e}vy process X in \mathbb{R}^d is equivalent to the vanishing of a deterministic f-capacity for a particular function f defined in terms of the characteristic exponent of X. The authors conjectured that a similar statement is true for all L\'{e}vy processes in \mathbb{R}^d. We show that the conjecture is true provided we extend the definition of f and require certain integrability conditions which cannot be avoided in general.
