Let Q be a transition probability on a measurable space E, let (X\_n)\_n be a Markov chain associated to Q, and let \xi be a real-valued measurable function on E, and S\_n = \sum\_{k=1}^{n} \xi(X\_k). Under functional hypotheses on the action of Q and its Fourier kernels Q(t), we investigate the rate of convergence in the central limit theorem for the sequence (\frac{S\_n}{\sqrt n})\_n. According to the hypotheses, we prove that the rate is, either O(n^{-\frac{\tau}{2}}) for all \tau<1, or O(n^{-{1/2}}). We apply the spectral method of Nagaev which is improved by using a perturbation theorem of Keller and Liverani and a method of martingale difference reduction. When E is not compact or \xi is not bounded, the conditions required here are weaker than the ones usually imposed when the standard perturbation theorem is used. For example, in the case of V-geometric ergodic chains or Lipschitz iterative models, the rate of convergence in the c.l.t is O(n^{-{1/2}}) under a third moment condition on \xi.
