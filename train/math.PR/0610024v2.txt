The model considered is that of ``signal plus white noise.'' Known connections between the noncausal filtering error and mutual information are combined with new ones involving the causal estimation error, in a general abstract setup. The results are shown to be invariant under a wide class of causality patterns; they are applied to the derivation of the causal estimation error of a Gaussian nonstationary filtering problem and to a multidimensional extension of the Yovits--Jackson formula.
