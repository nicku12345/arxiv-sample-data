We consider a multitype epidemic model which is a natural extension of the randomized Reed--Frost epidemic model. The main result is the derivation of an asymptotic Gaussian limit theorem for the final size of the epidemic. The method of proof is simpler, and more direct, than is used for similar results elsewhere in the epidemics literature. In particular, the results are specialized to epidemics upon extensions of the Bernoulli random graph.
