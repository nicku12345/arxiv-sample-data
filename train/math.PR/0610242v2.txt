The complete representation of the Martin compactification for reflected random walks on a half-space \Z^d\times\N is obtained. It is shown that the full Martin compactification is in general not homeomorphic to the ``radial'' compactification obtained by Ney and Spitzer for the homogeneous random walks in \Z^d : convergence of a sequence of points z_n\in\Z^{d-1}\times\N to a point of on the Martin boundary does not imply convergence of the sequence z_n/|z_n| on the unit sphere S^d. Our approach relies on the large deviation properties of the scaled processes and uses Pascal's method combined with the ratio limit theorem. The existence of non-radial limits is related to non-linear optimal large deviation trajectories.
