Permanental processes can be viewed as a generalisation of squared centered Gaussian processes. We develop in this paper two main subjects. The first one analyses the connections of these processes with the local times of general Markov processes. The second deals with Bosonian point processes and the Bose-Einstein condensation. The obtained results in both directions are related and based on the notion of infinite divisibility.
