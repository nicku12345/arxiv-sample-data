The (standard) Brownian web is a collection of coalescing one- dimensional Brownian motions, starting from each point in space and time. It arises as the diffusive scaling limit of a collection of coalescing random walks. We show that it is possible to obtain a nontrivial limiting object if the random walks in addition branch with a small probability. We call the limiting object the Brownian net, and study some of its elementary properties.
