The purpose of this paper is to find explicit formulas for basic objects pertaining the local potential theory of the operator (I-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}, 0<\alpha<2. The potential theory of this operator is based on Bessel potentials J_{\alpha}=(I-\Delta)^{-\alpha/2}. We compute the {\it harmonic measure} of the half-space and write a concise form of the corresponding {\it Green function} for the operator (I-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}. To achieve this we analyze the so-called {\it relativistic \alpha-stable process} on \R^d space, killed when exiting the half-space. In terms of this process we are dealing here with the 1-{\it potential theory} or, equivalently, potential theory of Schr{\"o}dinger operator based on the generator of the process with Kato's potential q=-1.
