We consider a diffusion process X in a random potential \V of the form \V_x = \S_x -\delta x where \delta is a positive drift and \S is a strictly stable process of index \alpha\in (1,2) with positive jumps. Then the diffusion is transient and X_t / \log^\alpha t converges in law towards an exponential distribution. This behaviour contrasts with the case where \V is a drifted Brownian motion and provides an example of a transient diffusion in a random potential which is as "slow" as in the recurrent setting.
