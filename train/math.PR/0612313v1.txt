We study optimal approximation of stochastic processes by polynomial splines with free knots. The number of free knots is either a priori fixed or may depend on the particular trajectory. For the s-fold integrated Wiener process as well as for scalar diffusion processes we determine the asymptotic behavior of the average L_p-distance to the splines spaces, as the (expected) number k of free knots tends to infinity.
