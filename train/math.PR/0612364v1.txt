Let X_1, X_2, ..., X_n, ...  be a sequence of iid random variables with values in a finite alphabet \{1,...,m\}. Let LI_n be the length of the longest increasing subsequence of X_1, X_2, ..., X_n. We express the limiting distribution of LI_n as functionals of m and (m-1)-dimensional Brownian motions. These expressions are then related to similar functionals appearing in queueing theory, allowing us to further establish asymptotic behaviors as m grows. The finite alphabet results are then used to treat the countable (infinite) alphabet.
