We introduce here a new universality conjecture for levels of random Hamiltonians, in the same spirit as the local REM conjecture made by S. Mertens and H. Bauke. We establish our conjecture for a wide class of Gaussian and non-Gaussian Hamiltonians, which include the p-spin models, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and the number partitioning problem. We prove that our universality result is optimal for the last two models by showing when this universality breaks down.
