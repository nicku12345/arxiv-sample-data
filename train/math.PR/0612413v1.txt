We study the dynamical properties of the Brownian diffusions having \sigma {\rm Id} as diffusion coefficient matrix and b=\nabla U as drift vector. We characterize this class through the equality D^2_+=D^2_-, where D_{+} (resp. D_-) denotes the forward (resp. backward) stochastic derivative of Nelson's type. Our proof is based on a remarkable identity for D_+^2-D_-^2 and on the use of the martingale problem. We also give a new formulation of a famous theorem of Kolmogorov concerning reversible diffusions. We finally relate our characterization to some questions about the complex stochastic embedding of the Newton equation which initially motivated of this work.
