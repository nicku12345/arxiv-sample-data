We study a random graph model which is a superposition of the bond percolation model on Z^d with probability p of an edge, and a classical random graph G(n, c/n). We show that this model, being a {\it homogeneous} random graph, has a natural relation to the so-called "rank 1 case" of {\it inhomogeneous} random graphs. This allows us to use the newly developed theory of inhomogeneous random graphs to describe the phase diagram on the set of parameters c\geq 0 and 0 \leq p<p_c, where p_c=p_c(d) is the critical probability for the bond percolation on Z^d. The phase transition is similar to the classical random graph, it is of the second order. We also find the scaled size of the largest connected component above the phase transition.
