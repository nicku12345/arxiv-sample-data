For \gamma>-{1/2}, we provide the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion of the weighted mean-centered Wiener process, defined by \[W _{\gamma}(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+2\gamma}}\Big\{W\big(t^{1+2\gamma}\big)- \int_0^1W\big(u^{1+2\gamma}\big)du\Big\},\] for t\in(0,1]. We show that the orthogonal functions in these expansions have simple expressions in term of Bessel functions. Moreover, we obtain that the L^2[0,1] norm of W_{\gamma} is identical in distribution with the L^2[0,1] norm of the weighted Brownian bridge t^{\gamma}B(t).
