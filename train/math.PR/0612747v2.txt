There has been recent interest in the conditional central limit question for (strictly) stationary, ergodic processes ...,X_{-1},X_0,X_1,... whose partial sums S_n=X_1+...+X_n are of the form S_n=M_n+R_n, where M_n is a square integrable martingale with stationary increments and R_n is a remainder term for which E(R_n^2)=o(n). Here we explore the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for the same class of processes. Letting \Vert\cdot\Vert denote the norm in L^2(P), a sufficient condition for the partial sums of a stationary process to have the form S_n=M_n+R_n is that n^{-3/2}\Vert E(S_n|X_0,X_{-1},...)\Vert be summable. A sufficient condition for the LIL is only slightly stronger, requiring n^{-3/2}\log^{3/2}(n)\Vert E(S_n|X_0,X_{-1},...)\Vert to be summable. As a by-product of our main result, we obtain an improved statement of the conditional central limit theorem. Invariance principles are obtained as well.
