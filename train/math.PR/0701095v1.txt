In this paper we consider an interacting particle system modeled as a system of N stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motions with a drift term including a confining potential acting on each particle, and an interaction potential modeling the interaction among all the particles of the system. The limiting behavior as the size N grows to infinity is achieved as a law of large numbers for the empirical process associated with the interacting particle system
