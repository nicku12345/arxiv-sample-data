We obtain the hydrodynamic limit of one-dimensional interacting particle systems describing the macroscopic evolution of the density of mass in infinite volume from the microscopic dynamics. The processes are weak pertubations of the symmetric exclusion process by shift operators describing the spread of particles around positions where new sites are created.
