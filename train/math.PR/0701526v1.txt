In this article, we study the family of probability measures (indexed by a positive real number t), obtained by penalization of the Brownian motion by a given functional of its local times at time t. We prove that this family tends to a limit measure when t goes to infinity if the functional satisfies some conditions of domination, and we check these conditions in several particular cases.
