This paper studies variations of the usual voter model that favor types that are locally less common. Such models are dual to certain systems of branching annihilating random walks that are parity preserving. For both the voter models and their dual branching annihilating systems we determine all homogeneous invariant laws, and we study convergence to these laws started from other initial laws.
