A limit theorem for a sequence of diffusion processes on graphs is proved in a case when vary both parameters of the processes (the drift and diffusion coefficients on every edge and the asymmetry coefficients in every vertex), and configuration of graphs, where the processes are set on. The explicit formulae for the parameters of asymmetry for the vertices of the limiting graph are given in the case, when, in the pre-limiting graphs, some groups of vertices form knots contracting into a points.
