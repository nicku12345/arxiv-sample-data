A version of ``preferential attachment'' random graphs, corresponding to linear ``weights'' with random ``edge additions,'' which generalizes some previously considered models, is studied. This graph model is embedded in a continuous-time branching scheme and, using the branching process apparatus, several results on the graph model asymptotics are obtained, some extending previous results, such as growth rates for a typical degree and the maximal degree, behavior of the vertex where the maximal degree is attained, and a law of large numbers for the empirical distribution of degrees which shows certain   ``scale-free'' or ``power-law'' behaviors.
