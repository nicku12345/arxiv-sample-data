We consider the first passage percolation model on the square lattice. In this model, \{t(e): e{an edge of}{\bf Z}^2 \} is an independent identically distributed family with a common distribution F. We denote by T({\bf 0}, v) the passage time from the origin to v for v\in {\bf R}^2 and B(t)=\{v\in {\bf R}^d: T({\bf 0}, v)\leq t\}. It is well known that if F(0) < p_c, there exists a compact shape {\bf B}_F\subset {\bf R}^2 such that for all \epsilon >0, t {\bf B}_F(1-\epsilon) \subset {B(t)} \subset t{\bf B}_F(1+\epsilon), eventually with a probability 1. For each shape boundary point u, we denote its right- and left-curvature exponents by \kappa^+(u) and \kappa^-(u). In addition, for each vector u, we denote the transversal fluctuation exponent by \xi(u). In this paper, we can show that \xi(u) \leq 1-\max\{\kappa^-(u)/2, \kappa^+(u)/2\} for all shape boundary points u.   To pursue a curvature on {\bf B}_F, we consider passage times with a special distribution infsupp(F)=l and F(l)=p > \vec{p}_c, where l is a positive number and \vec{p}_c is a critical point for the oriented percolation model. With this distribution, it is known that there is a flat segment on the shape boundary between angles 0< \theta_p^- < \theta_p^+< 90^\circ. In this paper, we show that the shape are strictly convex at the directions \theta_p^\pm. Moreover, we also show that for all r>0, \xi((r, \theta^\pm_p)) = 0.5 and \xi((r, \theta)) =1 for all \theta_p^- <\theta< \theta_p^+ and r>0.
