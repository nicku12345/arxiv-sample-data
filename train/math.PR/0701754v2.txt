We study the decay rate of large deviation probabilities of occupation times, up to time t, for the voter model \eta\colon\Z^2\times[0,\infty)\ra\{0,1\} with simple random walk transition kernel, starting from a Bernoulli product distribution with density \rho\in(0,1). Bramson, Cox and Griffeath (1988) showed that the decay rate order lies in [\log(t),\log^2(t)].   In this paper, we establish the true decay rates depending on the level. We show that the decay rates are \log^2(t) when the deviation from \rho is maximal (i.e., \eta\equiv 0 or 1), and \log(t) in all other situations.
