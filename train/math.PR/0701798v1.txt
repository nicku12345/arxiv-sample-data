We consider finite-state time-nonhomogeneous Markov chains where the probability of moving from state i to state j\neq i at time n is G(i,j)/n^\zeta for a ``generator'' matrix G and strength parameter \zeta>0. In these chains, as time grows, the positions are less and less likely to change, and so form simple models of age-dependent time-reinforcing behaviors. These chains, however, exhibit some different, perhaps unexpected, asymptotic occupation laws depending on parameters.   Although on the one hand it is shown that the asymptotic position converges to a point-mixture for all \zeta>0, on the other hand, the average position, when variously 0<\zeta<1, \zeta>1 or \zeta=1, is shown to converges to a constant, a point-mixture, or a distribution \mu_G with no atoms and full support on a certain simplex respectively. The last type of limit can be seen as a sort of ``spreading'' between the cases 0<\zeta<1 and \zeta>1.   In particular, when G is appropriately chosen, \mu_G is a Dirichlet distribution with certain parameters, reminiscent of results in Polya urns.
