For a distribution F^{*\tau} of a random sum S_{\tau}=\xi_1+...+\xi_{\tau} of i.i.d. random variables with a common distribution F on the half-line [0,\infty), we study the limits of the ratios of tails \bar{F^{*\tau}}(x)/\bar{F}(x) as x\to\infty (here, \tau is a counting random variable which does not depend on \{\xi_n\}_{n\ge1}). We also consider applications of the results obtained to random walks, compound Poisson distributions, infinitely divisible laws, and subcritical branching processes.
