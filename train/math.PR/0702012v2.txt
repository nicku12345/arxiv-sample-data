We study a variant of poly-nuclear growth where the level boundaries perform continuous-time, discrete-space random walks, and study how its asymptotic behavior is affected by the presence of a columnar defect on the line. We prove that there is a non-trivial phase transition in the strength of the perturbation, above which the law of large numbers for the height function is modified.
