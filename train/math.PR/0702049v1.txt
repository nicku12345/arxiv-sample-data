For a fractional Brownian motion B^H with Hurst parameter H\in]{1/4},{1/2}[\cup]{1/2},1[, multiple indefinite integrals on a simplex are constructed and the regularity of their sample paths are studied. Then, it is proved that the family of probability laws of the processes obtained by replacing B^H by \epsilon^{{1/2}} B^H satisfies a large deviation principle in H\"older norm. The definition of the multiple integrals relies upon a representation of the fractional Brownian motion in terms of a stochastic integral with respect to a standard Brownian motion. For the large deviation principle, the abstract general setting given by Ledoux in [Lecture Notes in Math., vol. 1426 (1990) 1-14] is used.
