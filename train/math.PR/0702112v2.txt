A random vector X with representation X=\sum_{j\geq0}A_jZ_j is considered. Here, (Z_j) is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random vectors and (A_j) is a sequence of random matrices, `predictable' with respect to the sequence (Z_j). The distribution of Z_1 is assumed to be multivariate regular varying. Moment conditions on the matrices (A_j) are determined under which the distribution of X is regularly varying and, in fact, `inherits' its regular variation from that of the (Z_j)'s. We compute the associated limiting measure. Examples include linear processes, random coefficient linear processes such as stochastic recurrence equations, random sums and stochastic integrals.
