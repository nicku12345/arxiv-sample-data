We prove that every random walk in i.i.d. environment in dimension greater than or equal to 2 that has an almost sure positive speed in a certain direction, an annealed invariance principle and some mild integrability condition for regeneration times also satisfies a quenched invariance principle. The argument is based on intersection estimates and a theorem of Bolthausen and Sznitman.
