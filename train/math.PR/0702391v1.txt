In this short paper, we consider a quadruple (\Omega, \AA, \theta, \mu),where \AA is a \sigma-algebra of subsets of \Omega, and \theta is a measurable bijection from \Omega into itself that preserves the measure \mu. For each B \in \AA, we consider the measure \mu_B obtained by taking cycles (excursions) of iterates of \theta from B. We then derive a relation for \mu_B that involves the forward and backward hitting times of B by the trajectory (\theta^n \omega, n \in \Z) at a point \omega \in \Omega. Although classical in appearance, its use in obtaining uniqueness of invariant measures of various stochastic models seems to be new. We apply the concept to countable Markov chains and Harris processes.
