The on-line nearest-neighbour graph on a sequence of n uniform random points in (0,1)^d (d \in \N) joins each point after the first to its nearest neighbour amongst its predecessors. For the total power-weighted edge-length of this graph, with weight exponent \alpha \in (0,d/2], we prove O(\max \{n^{1-(2\alpha/d)}, \log n \}) upper bounds on the variance. On the other hand, we give an n \to \infty large-sample convergence result for the total power-weighted edge-length when \alpha > d/2. We prove corresponding results when the underlying point set is a Poisson process of intensity n.
