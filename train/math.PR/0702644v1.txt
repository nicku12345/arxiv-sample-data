The original density is 1 for t\in (0,1), b is an integer base (b\geq 2%), and p\in (0,1) is a parameter. The first construction stage divides the unit interval into b subintervals and multiplies the density in each subinterval by either 1 or -1 with the respective frequencies of \frac{1% }{2}+\frac{p}{2} and {1/2}-\frac{p}{2}. It is shown that the resulting density can be renormalized so that, as n\to \infty  (n being the number of iterations) the signed measure converges in some sense to a non-degenerate limit. If H=1+\log_{b} p>{1}/{2}, hence p>b^{{-1}/{% 2}}, renormalization creates a martingale, the convergence is strong, and the limit shares the H\"{o}lder and Hausdorff properties of the fractional Brownian motion of exponent H. If H\leq {1}/{2}, hence p\leq b^{{-1}/{2}%}, this martingale does not converge. However, a different normalization can be applied, for H\leq {1/2} to the martingale itself and for H>% {1/2} to the discrepancy between the limit and a finite approximation. In all cases the resulting process is found to converge weakly to the Wiener Brownian motion, independently of H and of b. Thus, to the usual additive paths toward Wiener measure, this procedure adds an infinity of multiplicative paths.
