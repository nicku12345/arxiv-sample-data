We give lower bounds for the density p_T(x,y) of the law of X_t, the solution of dX_t=\sigma (X_t) dB_t+b(X_t) dt,X_0=x, under the following local ellipticity hypothesis: there exists a deterministic differentiable curve x_t, 0\leq t\leq T, such that x_0=x, x_T=y and \sigma \sigma ^*(x_t)>0, for all t\in \lbrack 0,T]. The lower bound is expressed in terms of a distance related to the skeleton of the diffusion process. This distance appears when we optimize over all the curves which verify the above ellipticity assumption. The arguments which lead to the above result work in a general context which includes a large class of Wiener functionals, for example, It\^{o} processes. Our starting point is work of Kohatsu-Higa which presents a general framework including stochastic PDE's.
