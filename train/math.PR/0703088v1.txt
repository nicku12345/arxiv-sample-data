In this article we consider the stochastic heat equation u_{t}-\Delta u=\dot B in (0,T) \times \bR^d, with vanishing initial conditions, driven by a Gaussian noise \dot B which is fractional in time, with Hurst index H \in (1/2,1), and colored in space, with spatial covariance given by a function f. Our main result gives the necessary and sufficient condition on H for the existence of the process solution. When f is the Riesz kernel of order \alpha \in (0,d) this condition is H>(d-\alpha)/4, which is a relaxation of the condition H>d/4 encountered when the noise \dot B is white in space. When f is the Bessel kernel or the heat kernel, the condition remains H>d/4.
