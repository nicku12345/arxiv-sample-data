We consider a one-dimensional transient cookie random walk. It is known from a previous paper that a cookie random walk (X_n) has positive or zero speed according to some positive parameter \alpha >1 or \le 1. In this article, we give the exact rate of growth of (X_n) in the zero speed regime, namely: for 0<\alpha <1, X_n/n^{\frac{\alpha+1}{2}} converges in law to a Mittag-Leffler distribution whereas for \alpha=1, X_n(\log n)/n converges in probability to some positive constant.
