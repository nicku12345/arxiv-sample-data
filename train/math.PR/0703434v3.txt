We consider a random field \varphi:\{1,...,N\}\to\mathbb{R} as a model for a linear chain attracted to the defect line \varphi=0, that is, the x-axis. The free law of the field is specified by the density \exp(-\sum_iV(\Delta\varphi_i)) with respect to the Lebesgue measure on \mathbb{R}^N, where \Delta is the discrete Laplacian and we allow for a very large class of potentials V(\cdot). The interaction with the defect line is introduced by giving the field a reward \varepsilon\ge0 each time it touches the x-axis. We call this model the pinning model. We consider a second model, the wetting model, in which, in addition to the pinning reward, the field is also constrained to stay nonnegative. We show that both models undergo a phase transition as the intensity \varepsilon of the pinning reward varies: both in the pinning (a=\mathrm{p}) and in the wetting (a=\mathrm{w}) case, there exists a critical value \varepsilon_c^a such that when \varepsilon>\varepsilon_c^a the field touches the defect line a positive fraction of times (localization), while this does not happen for \varepsilon<\varepsilon_c^a (delocalization). The two critical values are nontrivial and distinct: 0<\varepsilon_c^{\mat hrm{p}}<\varepsilon_c^{\mathrm{w}}<\infty, and they are the only nonanalyticity points of the respective free energies. For the pinning model the transition is of second order, hence the field at \varepsilon=\varepsilon_c^{\mathrm{p}} is delocalized. On the other hand, the transition in the wetting model is of first order and for \varepsilon=\varepsilon_c^{\mathrm{w}} the field is localized. The core of our approach is a Markov renewal theory description of the field.
