We study the approximation of certain stochastic integrals with respect to a d-dimensional diffusion by corresponding stochastic integrals with piece-wise constant integrands. In finance this corresponds to replacing a continuously adjusted portfolio by discretely adjusted one. The approximation error is measured with respect to L^2 and it is shown that under certain assumptions the approximation rate is n^{-1/2} when one optimizes over deterministic but not necessarily equidistant time-nets.
