We show that a slight modification of a theorem of Ruzmaikina and Aizenman on competing particle systems on the real line leads to a characterization of Poisson-Dirichlet distributions PD(a,0). Precisely, let s be a proper random mass-partition i.e. a random sequence (s_i, i\in\N) such that s_1\geq s_2\geq ... and \sum_i s_i=1 a.s. Consider {W_i}_{i\in\N}, an iid sequence of positive random variables with a density and such that E[W^\lambda] is finite for all \lambda\in\R. It is shown that if the law of s is invariant under a random multiplicative shift s_i W_i of the atoms followed by a renormalization, then it must be a mixture of Poisson-Dirichlet distribution PD(a,0), a\in (0,1).
