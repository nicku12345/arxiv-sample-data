In this paper, we derive comparison results for terminal values of d-dimensional special semimartingales and also for finite-dimensional distributions of multivariate L\'{e}vy processes. The comparison is with respect to nondecreasing, (increasing) convex, (increasing) directionally convex and (increasing) supermodular functions. We use three different approaches. In the first approach, we give sufficient conditions on the local predictable characteristics that imply ordering of terminal values of semimartingales. This generalizes some recent convex comparison results of exponential models in [Math. Finance 8 (1998) 93--126, Finance Stoch. 4 (2000) 209--222, Proc. Steklov Inst. Math. 237 (2002) 73--113, Finance Stoch. 10 (2006) 222--249]. In the second part, we give comparison results for finite-dimensional distributions of L\'{e}vy processes with infinite L\'{e}vy measure. In the first step, we derive a comparison result for Markov processes based on a monotone separating transition kernel. By a coupling argument, we get an application to the comparison of compound Poisson processes. These comparisons are then extended by an approximation argument to the ordering of L\'{e}vy processes with infinite L\'{e}vy measure. The third approach is based on mixing representations which are known for several relevant distribution classes. We discuss this approach in detail for the comparison of generalized hyperbolic distributions and for normal inverse Gaussian processes.
