We study the asymptotic expansions with respect to h of \[\mathrm{E}[\Delta_hf(X_t)],\qquad \mathrm{E}[\Delta_hf(X_t)|\mathscr{F}^X_t]\quadand\quad \mathrm{E}[\Delta_hf(X_t)|X_t],\] where \Delta_hf(X_t)=f(X_{t+h})-f(X_t), when f:\mathbb {R}\to\mathbb{R} is a smooth real function, t\geq0 is a fixed time, X is the solution of a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index H>{1}/{2} and \mathscr{F}^X is its natural filtration.
