We study the extremal behavior of a stochastic integral driven by a multivariate L\'{e}vy process that is regularly varying with index \alpha>0. For predictable integrands with a finite (\alpha+\delta)-moment, for some \delta>0, we show that the extremal behavior of the stochastic integral is due to one big jump of the driving L\'{e}vy process and we determine its limit measure associated with regular variation on the space of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g functions.
