In this expository article, we discuss the rank-derangement problem, which asks for the number of permutations of a deck of cards such that each card is replaced by a card of a different rank. This combinatorial problem arises in computing the probability of winning the game of `frustration solitaire'. The solution is a prime example of the method of inclusion and exclusion. We also discuss and announce the solution to Montmort's `Probleme du Treize', a related problem dating back to circa 1708.
