Consider the braid group B_3=< a,b| aba=bab> and the nearest neighbor random walk defined by a probability \nu with support \{a,a^{-1},b,b^{-1}\}. The rate of escape of the walk is explicitly expressed in function of the unique solution of a set of eight polynomial equations of degree three over eight indeterminates. We also explicitly describe the harmonic measure of the induced random walk on B_3 quotiented by its center. The method and results apply, mutatis mutandis, to nearest neighbor random walks on dihedral Artin groups.
