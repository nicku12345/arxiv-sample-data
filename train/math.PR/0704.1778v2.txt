We consider a nearest-neighbor, one dimensional random walk \{X_n\}_{n\geq0} in a random i.i.d. environment, in the regime where the walk is transient but with zero speed, so that X_n is of order n^s for some s<1. Under the quenched law (i.e., conditioned on the environment), we show that no limit laws are possible: There exist sequences \{n_k\} and \{x_k\} depending on the environment only, such that X_{n_k}-x_k=o(\log n_k)^2 (a localized regime). On the other hand, there exist sequences \{t_m\} and \{s_m\} depending on the environment only, such that \log s_m/\log t_m\to s<1 and P_{\omega}(X_{t_m}/s_m\leq x)\to1/2 for all x>0 and \to0 for x\leq0 (a spread out regime).
