In this paper, we present a complete proof of the construction of graphs with bounded valency such that the simple random walk has a return probability at time n at the origin of order exp(-n^{\alpha}), for fixed \alpha \in [0,1[ and with Folner function exp(n^{\frac{2\alpha}{1-\alpha}}). We begin by giving a more detailled proof of this result contained in (see \cite{ershdur}). In the second part, we give an application of the existence of such graphs. We obtain bounds of the correct order for some functional of the local time of a simple random walk on an infinite cluster on the percolation model.
