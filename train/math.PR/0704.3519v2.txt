Consider the first exit time T_{a,b} from a finite interval [-a,b] for an homogeneous fluctuating functional X of a linear Brownian motion. We show the existence of a finite positive constant \k such that \lim_{t\to\infty}t^{-1}\log \p[ T_{ab} > t] = -\k. Following Chung's original approach, we deduce a "liminf" law of the iterated logarithm for the two-sided supremum of X. This extends and gives a new point of view on a result of Khoshnevisan and Shi.
