Consider the partition function of a directed polymer in an IID field. We assume that both tails of the negative and the positive part of the field are at least as light as exponential. It is a well-known fact that the free energy of the polymer is equal to a deterministic constant for almost every realization of the field and that the upper tail of the large deviations is exponential. The lower tail of the large deviations is typically lighter than exponential. In this paper we provide a method to obtain estimates on the rate of decay of the lower tail of the large deviations, which are sharp up to multiplicative constants. As a consequence, we show that the lower tail of the large deviations exhibits three regimes, determined according to the tail of the negative part of the field. Our method is simple to apply and can be used to cover other oriented and non-oriented models including first/last-passage percolation and the parabolic Anderson model
