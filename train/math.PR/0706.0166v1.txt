Consider a N\times n random matrix Y_n=(Y_{ij}^{n}) where the entries are given by  Y_{ij}^{n}=\frac{\sigma_{ij}(n)}{\sqrt{n}} X_{ij}^{n}  the X_{ij}^{n} being centered, independent and identically distributed random variables with unit variance and (\sigma_{ij}(n); 1\le i\le N, 1\le j\le n) being an array of numbers we shall refer to as a variance profile. We study in this article the fluctuations of the random variable  \log\det(Y_n Y_n^* + \rho I_N)  where Y^* is the Hermitian adjoint of Y and \rho > 0 is an additional parameter. We prove that when centered and properly rescaled, this random variable satisfies a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and has a Gaussian limit whose parameters are identified. A complete description of the scaling parameter is given; in particular it is shown that an additional term appears in this parameter in the case where the 4^\textrm{th} moment of the X_{ij}'s differs from the 4^{\textrm{th}} moment of a Gaussian random variable. Such a CLT is of interest in the field of wireless communications.
