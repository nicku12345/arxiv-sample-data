We prove that bounded harmonic functions of anisotropic fractional Laplacians are H\"older continuous under mild regularity assumptions on the corresponding L\'evy measure. Under some stronger assumptions the Green function, Poisson kernel and the harmonic functions are even differentiable of order up to three.
