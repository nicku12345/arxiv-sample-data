The purpose of this paper is to find optimal estimates for the Green function of a half-space of {\it the relativistic \alpha-stable process} with parameter m on \Rd space. This process has an infinitesimal generator of the form mI-(m^{2/\alpha}I-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}, where 0<\alpha<2, m>0, and reduces to the isotropic \alpha-stable process for m=0. Its potential theory for open bounded sets has been well developed throughout the recent years however almost nothing was known about the behaviour of the process on unbounded sets. The present paper is intended to fill this gap and we provide two-sided sharp estimates for the Green function for a half-space. As a byproduct we obtain some improvements of the estimates known for bounded sets specially for balls. The advantage of these estimates is a clarification of the relationship between the diameter of the ball and the parameter m of the process.   The main result states that the Green function is comparable with the Green function for the Brownian motion if the points are away from the boundary of a half-space and their distance is greater than one. On the other hand for the remaining points the Green function is somehow related the Green function for the isotropic \alpha-stable process. For example, for d\ge3, it is comparable with the Green function for the isotropic \alpha-stable process, provided that the points are close enough.
