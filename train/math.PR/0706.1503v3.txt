Let X=(X_t)_{t\ge0} be a stable L\'{e}vy process of index \alpha \in(1,2) with no negative jumps and let S_t=\sup_{0\le s\le t}X_s denote its running supremum for t>0. We show that the density function f_t of S_t can be characterized as the unique solution to a weakly singular Volterra integral equation of the first kind or, equivalently, as the unique solution to a first-order Riemann--Liouville fractional differential equation satisfying a boundary condition at zero. This yields an explicit series representation for f_t. Recalling the familiar relation between S_t and the first entry time \tau_x of X into [x,\infty), this further translates into an explicit series representation for the density function of \tau_x.
