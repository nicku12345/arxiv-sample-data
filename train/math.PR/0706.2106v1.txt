We study the "rank 1 case" of the inhomogeneous random graph model. In the subcritical case we derive an exact formula for the asymptotic size of the largest connected component scaled to log n. This result is new, it completes the corresponding known result in the supercritical case. We provide some examples of application of a new formula.
