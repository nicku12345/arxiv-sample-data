We give a realization of the stable L\'evy forest of a given size conditioned by its mass from the path of the unconditioned forest. Then, we prove an invariance principle for this conditioned forest by considering k independent Galton-Watson trees whose offspring distribution is in the domain of attraction of any stable law conditioned on their total progeny to be equal to n. We prove that when n and k tend towards +\infty, under suitable rescaling, the associated coding random walk, the contour and height processes converge in law on the Skorokhod space respectively towards the "first passage bridge" of a stable L\'evy process with no negative jumps and its height process.
