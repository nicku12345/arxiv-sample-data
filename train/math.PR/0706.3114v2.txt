In this paper we show that the continuum time version of the Minority Game satisfies the criteria for the application of a theorem on the existence of an invariant measure. We consider the special case of a game with "sufficiently" asymmetric initial condition where the number of possible choices for each individual is S=2 and \Gamma<+\infty. An upper bound for the asymptotic behavior, as the number of agents grows to infinity, of the waiting time for reaching the stationary state is then obtained.
