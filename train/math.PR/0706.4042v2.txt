For a stopped diffusion process in a multidimensional time-dependent domain \D, we propose and analyse a new procedure consisting in simulating the process with an Euler scheme with step size \Delta and stopping it at discrete times (i\Delta)_{i\in\N^*} in a modified domain, whose boundary has been appropriately shifted. The shift is locally in the direction of the inward normal n(t,x) at any point (t,x) on the parabolic boundary of \D, and its amplitude is equal to 0.5826 (...) |n^*\sigma|(t,x)\sqrt \Delta where \sigma stands for the diffusion coefficient of the process. The procedure is thus extremely easy to use. In addition, we prove that the rate of convergence w.r.t. \Delta for the associated weak error is higher than without shifting, generalizin g previous results by \cite{broa:glas:kou:97} obtained for the one dimensional Brownian motion. For this, we establish in full generality the asymptotics of the triplet exit time/exit position/overshoot for the discretely stopped Euler scheme. Here, the overshoot means the distance to the boundary of the process when it exits the domain. Numerical experiments support these results.
