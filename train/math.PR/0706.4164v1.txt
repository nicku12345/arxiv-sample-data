Let X_1,...,X_N denote N independent d-dimensional L\'evy processes, and consider the N-parameter random field \[\X(\bm{t}):= X_1(t_1)+...+X_N(t_N).\] First we demonstrate that for all nonrandom Borel sets F\subseteq\R^d, the Minkowski sum \X(\R^N_+)\oplus F, of the range \X(\R^N_+) of \X with F, can have positive d-dimensional Lebesgue measure if and only if a certain capacity of F is positive. This improves our earlier joint effort with Yuquan Zhong \ycite{KXZ:03} by removing a symmetry-type condition there. Moreover, we show that under mild regularity conditions, our necessary and sufficient condition can be recast in terms of one-potential densities. This rests on developing results in classical [non-probabilistic] harmonic analysis that might be of independent interest. As was shown in \fullocite{KXZ:03}, the potential theory of the type studied here has a large number of consequences in the theory of L\'evy processes. We present a few new consequences here.
