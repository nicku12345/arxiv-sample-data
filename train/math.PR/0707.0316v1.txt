Limit theorems are presented for the rescaled occupation time fluctuation process of a critical finite variance branching particle system in \mathbb{R}^{d} with symmetric \alpha-stable motion starting off from either a standard Poisson random field or the equilibrium distribution for critical d=2\alpha and large d>2\alpha dimensions. The limit processes are generalised Wiener processes. The obtained convergence is in space-time, finite-dimensional distributions sense. With the addtional assumption on the branching law we obtain functional convergence.
