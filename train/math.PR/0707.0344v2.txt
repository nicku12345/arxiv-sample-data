In this paper we prove a Large Deviation Principle for the sequence of symmetrised empirical measures \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta_{(X^n_i,X^n_{\sigma_n(i)})} where \sigma_n is a random permutation and ((X_i^n)_{1 \leq i \leq n})_{n \geq 1} is a triangular array of random variables with suitable properties. As an application we show how this result allows to improve the Large Deviation Principles for symmetrised initial-terminal conditions bridge processes recently established by Adams, Dorlas and K\"{o}nig.
