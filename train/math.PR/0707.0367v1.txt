We begin with the study of some properties of the radial Dunkl process associated to a reduced root system R. It is shown that this diffusion is the unique strong solution for all t \geq 0 of a SDE with singular drift. Then, we study T_0, the first hitting time of the positive Weyl chamber : we prove, via stochastic calculus, a result already obtained by Chybiryakov on the finiteness of T_0. The second and new part deals with the law of T_0 for which we compute the tail distribution, as well as some insight via stochastic calculus on how root systems are connected with eigenvalues of standard matrix-valued processes. This gives rise to the so-called \beta-processes. The ultraspherical \beta-Jacobi case still involves a reduced root system while the general case is closely connected to a non reduced one. This process lives in a convex bounded domain known as principal Weyl alcove and the strong uniqueness result remains valid. The last part deals with the first hitting time of the alcove's boundary and the semi group density which enables us to answer some open questions.
