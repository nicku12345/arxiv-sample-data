We study the asymptotic properties of the number of open paths of length n in an oriented \rho-percolation model. We show that this number is e^{n\alpha(\rho)(1+o(1))} as n \to \infty. The exponent \alpha is deterministic, it can be expressed in terms of the free energy of a polymer model, and it can be explicitely computed in some range of the parameters. Moreover, in a restricted range of the parameters, we even show that the number of such paths is n^{-1/2} W e^{n\alpha(\rho)}(1+o(1)) for some nondegenerate random variable W. We build on connections with the model of directed polymers in random environment, and we use techniques and results developed in this context.
