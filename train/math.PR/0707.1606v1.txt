Kingman derived the Ewens sampling formula for random partitions from the genealogy model defined by a Poisson process of mutations along lines of descent governed by a simple coalescent process. M\"ohle described the recursion which determines the generalization of the Ewens sampling formula when the lines of descent are governed by a coalescent with multiple collisions. In a recent work by Dong, Gnedin and Pitman, authors exploit an analogy with the theory of regenerative composition and partition structures, and provide various characterizations of the associated exchangeable random partitions. This paper gives parallel results for the further generalized model with lines of descent following a coalescent with simultaneous multiple collisions.
