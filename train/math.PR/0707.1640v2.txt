In the classical occupancy scheme, one considers a fixed discrete probability measure {\bf p}=(p_i: {i\in{\cal I}}) and throws balls independently at random in boxes labeled by {\cal I}, such that p_i is the probability that a given ball falls into the box i. In this work, we are interested in asymptotic regimes of this scheme in the situation induced by a refining sequence ({\bf p}(k) : k\in\N) of random probability measures which arise from some multiplicative cascade. Our motivation comes from the study of the asymptotic behavior of certain fragmentation chains
