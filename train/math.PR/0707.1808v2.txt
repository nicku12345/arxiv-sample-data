Let  r, s>0 . For a given probability measure P on \mathbb{R}^d, let (\alpha_n)_{n \geq 1} be a sequence of (asymptotically) L^r(P)- optimal quantizers. For all \mu \in \mathbb{R}^d  and for every \theta >0, one defines the sequence (\alpha_n^{\theta, \mu})_{n \geq 1} by : \forall n \geq 1, \alpha_n^{\theta, \mu} = \mu + \theta(\alpha_n - \mu) = \{\mu + \theta(a- \mu), a \in \alpha_n \} . In this paper, we are interested in the asymptotics of the L^s-quantization error induced by the sequence (\alpha_n^{\theta, \mu})_{n \geq 1}. We show that for a wide family of distributions, the sequence (\alpha_n^{\theta, \mu})_{n \geq 1} is L^s-rate-optimal. For the Gaussian and the exponential distributions, one shows how to choose the parameter \theta such that (\alpha_n^{\theta, \mu})_{n \geq 1} satisfies the empirical measure theorem and probably be asymptotically L^s-optimal.
