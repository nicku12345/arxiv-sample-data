We prove a functional law of iterated logarithm for the following kind of anticipating stochastic differential equations \xi^u_t=X_0^u+\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log\log u}}\sum_{j=1}^k \int_0^{t} A_j^u(\xi^u_s)\circ dW_{s}^j+ \int_0^{t} A_0^u(\xi^u_s)ds, where u>e, W=\{(W_t^1,...,W_t^k), 0\le t\le 1\} is a standard k-dimensional Wiener process, A_0^u,A_1^u,..., A_k^u:\mathbb{R}^d\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^d are functions of class \mathcal{C}^2 with bounded partial derivatives up to order 2, X_0^u is a random vector not necessarily adapted and the first integral is a generalized Stratonovich integral .
