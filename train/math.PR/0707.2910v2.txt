The present paper is concerned with some self-interacting diffusions (X_t,t\geq 0) living on \mathbb{R}^d. These diffusions are solutions to stochastic differential equations: \mathrm{d}X_t = \mathrm{d}B_t - g(t)\nabla V(X_t - \bar{\mu}_t) \mathrm{d}t where \bar{\mu}_t is the empirical mean of the process X, V is an asymptotically strictly convex potential and g is a given function. The authors have still studied the ergodic behavior of X and proved that it is strongly related to g. We go further and give necessary and sufficient conditions (for small g's) in order that X converges in probability to X_\infty (which is related to the global minima of V).
