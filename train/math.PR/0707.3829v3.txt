Consider a critical nearest neighbor branching random walk on the d-dimensional integer lattice initiated by a single particle at the origin. Let G_{n} be the event that the branching random walk survives to generation n. We obtain limit theorems conditional on the event G_{n} for a variety of occupation statistics: (1) Let V_{n} be the maximal number of particles at a single site at time n. If the offspring distribution has finite \alphath moment for some integer \alpha\geq 2, then in dimensions 3 and higher, V_n=O_p(n^{1/\alpha}); and if the offspring distribution has an exponentially decaying tail, then V_n=O_p(\log n) in dimensions 3 and higher, and V_n=O_p((\log n)^2) in dimension 2. Furthermore, if the offspring distribution is non-degenerate then P(V_n\geq \delta \log n | G_{n})\to 1 for some \delta >0. (2) Let M_{n} (j) be the number of multiplicity-j sites in the nth generation, that is, sites occupied by exactly j particles. In dimensions 3 and higher, the random variables M_{n} (j)/n converge jointly to multiples of an exponential random variable. (3) In dimension 2, the number of particles at a "typical" site (that is, at the location of a randomly chosen particle of the nth generation) is of order O_p(\log n), and the number of occupied sites is O_p(n/\log n).
