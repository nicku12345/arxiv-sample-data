The problem of nonlinear filtering of a random field observed in the presence of a noise, modeled by a persistent fractional Brownian sheet of Hurst index (H_1,H_2) with 0.5<H_1,H_2<1, is studied and a suitable version of the Bayes' formula for the optimal filter is obtained. Two types of spatial "fractional" analogues of the Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai equation are also derived: one tracks evolution of the unnormalized optimal filter along an arbitrary "monotone increasing" (in the sense of partial ordering in \mathbb{R}^2) one-dimensional curve in the plane, while the other describes dynamics of the filter along the paths that are truly two-dimensional. Although the paper deals with the two-dimensional parameter space, the presented approach and results extend to d-parameter random fields with arbitrary d\geq 3.
