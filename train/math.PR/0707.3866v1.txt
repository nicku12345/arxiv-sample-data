We develop the mathematics of a filtration shrinkage model that has recently been considered in the credit risk modeling literature. Given a finite collection of points x_1<...<x_N in \mathbb{R}, the region indicator function R(x) assumes the value i if x\in(x_{i-1},x_i]. We take \mathbb{F} to be the filtration generated by (R(X_t))_{t\geq0}, where X is a diffusion with infinitesimal generator \mathcal{A}. We prove a martingale representation theorem for \mathbb{F} in terms of stochastic integrals with respect to N random measures whose compensators have a simple form given in terms of certain L\'{e}vy measures F^{j\pm}_i, which are related to the differential equation \mathcal{A}u=\lambda u.
