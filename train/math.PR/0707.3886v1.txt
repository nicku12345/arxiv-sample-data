Let X_t be any additive process in \mathbb{R}^d. There are finite indices \delta_i, \beta_i, i=1,2 and a function u, all of which are defined in terms of the characteristics of X_t, such that   \liminf_{t\to0}u(t)^{-1/\eta}X_t^*= \cases{0, \quad if \eta>\delta_1, \cr\infty, \quad if \eta<\delta_2,}   \limsup_{t\to0}u(t)^{-1/\eta}X_t^*= \cases{0, \quad if \eta>\beta_2, \cr\infty, \quad if \eta<\beta_1,}\qquad {a.s.},   where X_t^*=\sup_{0\le s\le t}|X_s|. When X_t is a L\'{e}vy process with X_0=0, \delta_1=\delta_2, \beta_1=\beta_2 and u(t)=t. This is a special case obtained by Pruitt. When X_t is not a L\'{e}vy process, its characteristics are complicated functions of t. However, there are interesting conditions under which u becomes sharp to achieve \delta_1=\delta_2, \beta_1=\beta_2.
