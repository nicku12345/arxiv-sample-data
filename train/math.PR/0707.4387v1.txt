In this paper we are concerned with one-dimensional backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE in short) of the following type: \[Y_t=\xi -\int_{t\wedge \tau}^{\tau}Y_r|Y_r|^q dr-\int_{t\wedge \tau}^{\tau}Z_r dB_r,\qquad t\geq 0,\] where \tau is a stopping time, q is a positive constant and \xi is a \mathcal{F}_{\tau}-measurable random variable such that \mathbf{P}(\xi =+\infty)>0. We study the link between these BSDE and the Dirichlet problem on a domain D\subset \mathbb{R}^d and with boundary condition g, with g=+\infty on a set of positive Lebesgue measure. We also extend our results for more general BSDE.
