We consider anticipative Stratonovich stochastic differential equations driven by some stochastic process lifted to a rough path. Neither adaptedness of initial point and vector fields nor commuting conditions between vector field is assumed. Under a simple condition on the stochastic process, we show that the unique solution of the above SDE understood in the rough path sense is actually a Stratonovich solution. We then show that this condition is satisfied by the Brownian motion. As application, we obtain rather flexible results such as support theorems, large deviation principles and Wong--Zakai approximations for SDEs driven by Brownian motion along anticipating vectorfields. In particular, this unifies many results on anticipative SDEs.
