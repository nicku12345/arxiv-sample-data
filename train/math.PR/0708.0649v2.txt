We consider a nearest-neighbor, one-dimensional random walk \{X_n\}_{n\geq 0} in a random i.i.d. environment, in the regime where the walk is transient with speed v_P > 0 and there exists an s\in(1,2) such that the annealed law of n^{-1/s} (X_n - n v_P) converges to a stable law of parameter s. Under the quenched law (i.e., conditioned on the environment), we show that no limit laws are possible. In particular we show that there exist sequences {t_k} and {t_k'} depending on the environment only, such that a quenched central limit theorem holds along the subsequence t_k, but the quenched limiting distribution along the subsequence t_k' is a centered reverse exponential distribution. This complements the results of a recent paper of Peterson and Zeitouni (arXiv:0704.1778v1 [math.PR]) which handled the case when the parameter s\in(0,1).
