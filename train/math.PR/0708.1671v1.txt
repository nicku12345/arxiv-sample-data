By using coupling and Girsanov transformations, the dimension-free Harnack inequality and the strong Feller property are proved for transition semigroups of solutions to a class of stochastic generalized porous media equations. As applications, explicit upper bounds of the L^p-norm of the density as well as hypercontractivity, ultracontractivity and compactness of the corresponding semigroup are derived.
