We consider the parabolic Anderson model, the Cauchy problem for the heat equation with random potential in Z^d. We use i.i.d. potentials \xi: Z^d \to \R in the third universality class, namely the class of almost bounded potentials, in the classification of van der Hofstad, Konig and Morters [HKM06]. This class consists of potentials whose logarithmic moment generating function is regularly varying with parameter \gamma=1, but do not belong to the class of so-called double-exponentially distributed potentials studied by Gartner and Molchanov (PTRF 1998).   In [HKM06] the asymptotics of the expected total mass was identified in terms of a variational problem that is closely connected to the well-known logarithmic Sobolev inequality and whose solution, unique up to spatial shifts, is a perfect parabola. In the present paper we show that those potentials whose shape (after appropriate vertical shifting and spatial rescaling) is away from that parabola contribute only negligibly to the total mass. The topology used is the strong L^1-topology on compacts for the exponentials of the potential. In the course of the proof, we show that any sequence of approximate minimisers of the above variational formula approaches some spatial shift of the minimiser, the parabola.
