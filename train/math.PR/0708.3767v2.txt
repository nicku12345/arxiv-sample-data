Suppose we are given an infinite, finitely generated group G and a transient random walk on the wreath product (\mathbb{Z}/ 2\mathbb{Z})\wr G, such that its projection on G is transient and has finite first moment. This random walk can be interpreted as a lamplighter random walk on G. Our aim is to show that the random walk on the wreath product escapes to infinity with respect to a suitable (pseudo-)metric faster than its projection onto G. We also address the case where the pseudo-metric is the length of a shortest ``travelling salesman tour''. In this context, and excluding some degenerate cases if G=\mathbb{Z}, the linear rate of escape is strictly bigger than the rate of escape of the lamplighter random walk's projection on G.
