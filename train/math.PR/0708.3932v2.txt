In Section 1, we present a number of classical results concerning the Generalized Gamma Convolution (:GGC) variables, their Wiener-Gamma representations, and relation with the Dirichlet processes.To a GGC variable, one may associate a unique Thorin measure. Let G a positive r.v. and \Gamma_t(G) (resp. \Gamma_t(1/G)) the Generalized Gamma Convolution with Thorin measure t-times the law of G (resp. the law of 1/G). In Section 2, we compare the laws of \Gamma_t(G) and \Gamma_t(1/G).In Section 3, we present some old and some new examples of GGC variables, among which the lengths of excursions of Bessel processes straddling an independent exponential time.
