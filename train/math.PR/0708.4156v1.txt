We consider an infinite system of particles in one dimension, each particle performs independant Sinai's random walk in random environment. Considering an instant t, large enough, we prove a result in probability showing that the particles are trapped in the neighborhood of well defined points of the lattice depending on the random environment the time t and the starting point of the particles.
