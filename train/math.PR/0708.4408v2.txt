Consider an arbitrary transient random walk on \Z^d with d\in\N. Pick \alpha\in[0,\infty) and let L_n(\alpha) be the spatial sum of the \alpha-th power of the n-step local times of the walk. Hence, L_n(0) is the range, L_n(1)=n+1, and for integers \alpha, L_n(\alpha) is the number of the \alpha-fold self-intersections of the walk. We prove a strong law of large numbers for L_n(\alpha) as n\to\infty. Furthermore, we identify the asymptotic law of the local time in a random site uniformly distributed over the range. These results complement and contrast analogous results for recurrent walks in two dimensions recently derived by \v{C}ern\'y \cite{Ce07}. Although these assertions are certainly known to experts, we could find no proof in the literature in this generality.
