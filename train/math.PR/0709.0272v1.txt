Let X be the branching particle diffusion corresponding to the operator   Lu+\beta (u^{2}-u) on D\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}   (where \beta \geq 0 and \beta\not\equiv 0). Let \lambda_{c} denote the generalized principal eigenvalue for the operator L+\beta  on D and assume that it is finite. When \lambda_{c}>0 and L+\beta-\lambda_{c} satisfies certain spectral theoretical conditions, we prove that the random measure \exp \{-\lambda_{c}t\}X_{t} converges almost surely in the vague topology as t tends to infinity. This result is motivated by a cluster of articles due to Asmussen and Hering dating from the mid-seventies as well as the more recent work concerning analogous results for superdiffusions of \cite{ET,EW}. We extend significantly the results in \cite{AH76,AH77} and include some key examples of the branching process literature. As far as the proofs are concerned, we appeal to modern techniques concerning martingales and `spine' decompositions or `immortal particle pictures'.
