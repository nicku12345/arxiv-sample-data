Let \{X_n,n\ge1\} be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, taking non-negative integer values, and call X_n a \delta-record if X_n>\max\{X_1,...,X_{n-1}\}+\delta, where \delta is an integer constant. We use martingale arguments to show that the counting process of \delta-records among the first n observations, suitably centered and scaled, is asymptotically normally distributed for \delta\ne0. In particular, taking \delta=-1 we obtain a central limit theorem for the number of weak records.
