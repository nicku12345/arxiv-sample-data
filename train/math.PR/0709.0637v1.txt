We establish estimates for the local and uniform moduli of continuity of the local time of multifractional Brownian motion, B^H=(B^{H(t)}(t),t\in\mathbb{R}^+). An analogue of Chung's law of the iterated logarithm is studied for B^H and used to obtain the pointwise H\"{o}lder exponent of the local time. A kind of local asymptotic self-similarity is proved to be satisfied by the local time of B^H.
