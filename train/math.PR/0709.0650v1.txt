We observe stationary random tessellations X=\{\Xi_n\}_{n\ge1} in \mathbb{R}^d through a convex sampling window W that expands unboundedly and we determine the total (k-1)-volume of those (k-1)-dimensional manifold processes which are induced on the k-facets of X (1\le k\le d-1) by their intersections with the (d-1)-facets of independent and identically distributed motion-invariant tessellations X_n generated within each cell \Xi_n of X. The cases of X being either a Poisson hyperplane tessellation or a random tessellation with weak dependences are treated separately. In both cases, however, we obtain that all of the total volumes measured in W are approximately normally distributed when W is sufficiently large. Structural formulae for mean values and asymptotic variances are derived and explicit numerical values are given for planar Poisson--Voronoi tessellations (PVTs) and Poisson line tessellations (PLTs).
