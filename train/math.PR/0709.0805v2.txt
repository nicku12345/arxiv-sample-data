In this note, a diffusion approximation result is shown for stochastic differential equations driven by a (Liouville) fractional Brownian motion B with Hurst parameter H in (1/3,1/2). More precisely, we resort to the Kac-Stroock type approximation using a Poisson process studied in Bardina, Jolis and Tudor (2003) and Delgado and Jolis (2000), and our method of proof relies on the algebraic integration theory introduced by Gubinelli (2004).
