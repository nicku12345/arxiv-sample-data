In this paper we study a two-dimensional directed self-avoiding walk model of a random copolymer in a random emulsion. The copolymer is a random concatenation of monomers of two types, A and B, each occurring with density 1/2. The emulsion is a random mixture of liquids of two types, A and B, organised in large square blocks occurring with density p and 1-p, respectively, where p \in (0,1). The copolymer in the emulsion has an energy that is minus \alpha times the number of AA-matches minus \beta times the number of BB-matches, where without loss of generality the interaction parameters can be taken from the cone \{(\alpha,\beta)\in\R^2\colon \alpha\geq |\beta|\}. To make the model mathematically tractable, we assume that the copolymer is directed and can only enter and exit a pair of neighbouring blocks at diagonally opposite corners.   In \cite{dHW06}, it was found that in the supercritical percolation regime p \geq p_c, with p_c the critical probability for directed bond percolation on the square lattice, the free energy has a phase transition along a curve in the cone that is independent of p. At this critical curve, there is a transition from a phase where the copolymer is fully delocalized into the A-blocks to a phase where it is partially localized near the AB-interface. In the present paper we prove three theorems that complete the analysis of the phase diagram : (1) the critical curve is strictly increasing; (2) the phase transition is second order; (3) the free energy is infinitely differentiable throughout the partially localized phase.
