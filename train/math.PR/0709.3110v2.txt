We present a tail inequality for suprema of empirical processes generated by variables with finite \psi_\alpha norms and apply it to some geometrically ergodic Markov chains to derive similar estimates for empirical processes of such chains, generated by bounded functions. We also obtain a bounded difference inequality for symmetric statistics of such Markov chains.
