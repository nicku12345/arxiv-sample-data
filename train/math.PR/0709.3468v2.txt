We consider some questions raised by the recent paper of Gantert, L\"owe and Steif (2005) concerning ``signed'' voter models on locally finite graphs. These are voter model like processes with the difference that the edges are considered to be either positive or negative. If an edge between a site x and a site y is negative (respectively positive) the site y will contribute towards the flip rate of x if and only if the two current spin values are equal (respectively opposed).
