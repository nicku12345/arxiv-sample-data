Let X be the unique normal martingale such that X_0=0 and \[\mathrm{d}[X]_t=(1-t-X_{t-}) \mathrm{d}X_t+\mathrm{d}t\] and let Y_t:=X_t+t for all t\geq 0; the semimartingale Y arises in quantum probability, where it is the monotone-independent analogue of the Poisson process. The trajectories of Y are examined and various probabilistic properties are derived; in particular, the level set \{t\geq 0\dvt Y_t=1\} is shown to be non-empty, compact, perfect and of zero Lebesgue measure. The local times of Y are found to be trivial except for that at level 1; consequently, the jumps of Y are not locally summable.
