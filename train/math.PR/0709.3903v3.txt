Fix \nu>0, denote by G(\nu/2) a Gamma random variable with parameter \nu/2 and let n\geq2 be a fixed even integer. Consider a sequence \{F_k\}_{k\geq1} of square integrable random variables belonging to the nth Wiener chaos of a given Gaussian process and with variance converging to 2\nu. As k\to\infty, we prove that F_k converges in distribution to 2G(\nu/2)-\nu if and only if E(F_k^4)-12E(F_k^3)\to12\nu^2-48\nu.
