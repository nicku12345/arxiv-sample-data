Spatial branching processes became increasingly popular in the past decades, not only because of their obvious connection to biology, but also because superprocesses are intimately related to nonlinear partial differential equations. Another hot topic in today's research in probability theory is `random media', including the now classical problems on `Brownian motion among obstacles' and the more recent `random walks in random environment' and `catalytic branching' models. These notes aim to give a gentle introduction into some topics in spatial branching processes and superprocesses in deterministic environments (sections 2-6) and in random media (sections 7-11).
