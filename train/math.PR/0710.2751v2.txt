Many real phenomena may be modelled as locally finite unions of d-dimensional time dependent random closed sets in \mathbb{R}^d, described by birth-and-growth stochastic processes, so that their mean volume and surface densities, as well as the so called mean \emph{extended} volume and surface densities, may be studied in terms of relevant quantities characterizing the process. We extend here known results in the Poissonian case to a wider class of birth-and-growth stochastic processes, proving in particular the absolute continuity of the random time of capture of a point x\in\R^d by processes of this class.
