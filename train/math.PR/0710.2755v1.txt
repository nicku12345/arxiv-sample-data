The reduced Markov branching process is a stochastic model for the genealogy of an unstructured biological population. Its limit behavior in the critical case is well studied for the Zolotarev-Slack regularity parameter \alpha\in(0,1]. We turn to the case of very heavy tailed reproduction distribution \alpha=0 assuming Zubkov's regularity condition with parameter \beta\in(0,\infty). Our main result gives a new asymptotic pattern for the reduced branching process conditioned on non-extinction during a long time interval.
