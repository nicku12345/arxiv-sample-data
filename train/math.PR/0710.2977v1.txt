The Skorokhod map is a convenient tool for constructing solutions to stochastic differential equations with reflecting boundary conditions. In this work, an explicit formula for the Skorokhod map \Gamma_{0,a} on [0,a] for any a>0 is derived. Specifically, it is shown that on the space \mathcal{D}[0,\infty) of right-continuous functions with left limits taking values in \mathbb{R}, \Gamma_{0,a}=\Lambda_a\circ \Gamma_0, where \Lambda_a:\mathcal{D}[0,\infty)\to\mathcal{D}[0,\infty) is defined by \[\Lambda_a(\phi)(t)=\phi(t)-\sup_{s\in[0,t]}\biggl[\bigl(\ phi(s)-a\bigr)^+\wedge\inf_{u\in[s,t]}\phi(u)\biggr]\] and \Gamma_0:\mathcal{D}[0,\infty)\to\mathcal{D}[0,\infty) is the Skorokhod map on [0,\infty), which is given explicitly by \[\Gamma_0(\psi)(t)=\psi(t)+\sup_{s\in[0,t]}[-\psi(s)]^+.\] In addition, properties of \Lambda_a are developed and comparison properties of \Gamma_{0,a} are established.
