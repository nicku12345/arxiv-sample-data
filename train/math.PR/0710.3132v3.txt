We study the statistics of the largest eigenvalues of real symmetric and sample covariance matrices when the entries are heavy tailed. Extending the result obtained by Soshnikov in \cite{Sos1}, we prove that, in the absence of the fourth moment, the top eigenvalues behave, in the limit, as the largest entries of the matrix.
