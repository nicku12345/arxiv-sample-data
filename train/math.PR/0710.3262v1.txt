The zero bias distribution W^* of W, defined though the characterizing equation \mathit{EW}f(W)=\sigma^2Ef'(W^*) for all smooth functions f, exists for all W with mean zero and finite variance \sigma^2. For W and W^* defined on the same probability space, the L^1 distance between F, the distribution function of W with \mathit{EW}=0 and Var(W)=1, and the cumulative standard normal \Phi has the simple upper bound \[\Vert F-\Phi\Vert_1\le2E|W^*-W|.\] This inequality is used to provide explicit L^1 bounds with moderate-sized constants for independent sums, projections of cone measure on the sphere S(\ell_n^p), simple random sampling and combinatorial central limit theorems.
