We consider an autoregressive model on \mathbb{R} defined by the recurrence equation X_n=A_nX_{n-1}+B_n, where \{(B_n,A_n)\} are i.i.d. random variables valued in \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^+ and \mathbb {E}[\log A_1]=0 (critical case). It was proved by Babillot, Bougerol and Elie that there exists a unique invariant Radon measure of the process \{X_n\}. The aim of the paper is to investigate its behavior at infinity. We describe also stationary measures of two other stochastic recursions, including one arising in queuing theory.
