We consider a system of d linear stochastic heat equations driven by an additive infinite-dimensional fractional Brownian noise on the unit circle S^1. We obtain sharp results on the H\"older continuity in time of the paths of the solution u=\{u(t, x)\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}_+, x \in S^1}. We then establish upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities of u, in terms of respectively Hausdorff measure and Newtonian capacity.
