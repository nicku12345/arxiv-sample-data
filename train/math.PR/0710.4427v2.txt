We consider a random walk on the discrete cylinder ({\mathbb{Z}}/N{\mathbb{Z}})^d\times{\mathbb{Z}}, d\geq3 with drift N^{-d\alpha} in the \mathbb{Z}-direction and investigate the large N-behavior of the disconnection time T^{\mathrm{disc}}_N, defined as the first time when the trajectory of the random walk disconnects the cylinder into two infinite components. We prove that, as long as the drift exponent \alpha is strictly greater than 1, the asymptotic behavior of T^{\mathrm{disc}}_N remains N^{2d+o(1)}, as in the unbiased case considered by Dembo and Sznitman, whereas for \alpha<1, the asymptotic behavior of T^{\mathrm{disc}}_N becomes exponential in N.
