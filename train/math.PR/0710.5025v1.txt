We develop in this paper an improvement of the method given by S. Bobkov and M. Ledoux. Using the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality, we prove a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality adapted for all measures on \dR^n, with a strictly convex and super-linear potential. This inequality implies modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for all uniform strictly convex potential as well as the Euclidean logarithmic Sobolev inequality.
