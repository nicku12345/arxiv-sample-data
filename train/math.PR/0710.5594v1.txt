Let L be a multidimensional L\'evy process under P in its own filtration. The f^q-minimal martingale measure Q_q is defined as that equivalent local martingale measure for \mathcal {E}(L) which minimizes the f^q-divergence E[(dQ/dP)^q] for fixed q\in(-\infty,0)\cup(1,\infty). We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Q_q and an explicit formula for its density. For q=2, we relate the sufficient conditions to the structure condition and discuss when the former are also necessary. Moreover, we show that Q_q converges for q\searrow1 in entropy to the minimal entropy martingale measure.
