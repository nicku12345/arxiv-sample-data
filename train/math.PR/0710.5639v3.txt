In this paper, we prove some central and non-central limit theorems for renormalized weighted power variations of order q>=2 of the fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H in (0,1), where q is an integer. The central limit holds for 1/(2q)<H<= 1-1/(2q), the limit being a conditionally Gaussian distribution. If H<1/(2q), we show the convergence in L^2 to a limit which only depends on the fractional Brownian motion, and if H> 1-1/(2q), we show the convergence in L^2 to a stochastic integral with respect to the Hermite process of order q.
