We consider the Poisson Boolean model of continuum percolation on a homogeneous Riemannian manifold M. Let lambda be intensity of the Poisson process in the model and let lambda_u be the infimum of the set of intensities that a.s. produce a unique unbounded component. We show that above \lambda_u there is a.s. a unique unbounded component. We also study what happens at \lambda_u for some spaces. In particular, if M is the product of the hyperbolic disc and the real line, then at \lambda_u there is a.s. not a unique unbounded component. The results are inspired by results for Bernoulli bond percolation on graphs due to Haggstrom, Peres and Schonmann.
