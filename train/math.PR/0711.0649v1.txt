We study a discrete time spatial branching system on \mathbb{Z}^d with logistic-type local regulation at each deme depending on a weighted average of the population in neighboring demes. We show that the system survives for all time with positive probability if the competition term is small enough. For a restricted set of parameter values, we also obtain uniqueness of the nontrivial equilibrium and complete convergence, as well as long-term coexistence in a related two-type model. Along the way we classify the equilibria and their domain of attraction for the corresponding deterministic coupled map lattice on \mathbb{Z}^d.
