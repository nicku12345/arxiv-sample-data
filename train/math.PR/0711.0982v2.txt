We consider a dynamical system described by the differential equation \dot{Y}_t=-U'(Y_t) with a unique stable point at the origin. We perturb the system by the L\'evy noise of intensity \varepsilon to obtain the stochastic differential equation dX^{\varepsilon}_t=-U'(X^{\varepsilon}_{t-}) dt+\varepsilon dL_t. The process L is a symmetric L\'evy process whose jump measure \nu has exponentially light tails, \nu([u,\infty))\sim\exp(-u^{\alpha}), \alpha>0, u\to \infty. We study the first exit problem for the trajectories of the solutions of the stochastic differential equation from the interval (-1,1). In the small noise limit \varepsilon\to0, the law of the first exit time \sigma_x, x\in(-1,1), has exponential tail and the mean value exhibiting an intriguing phase transition at the critical index \alpha=1, namely, \ln\mathbf{E}\sigma\sim\varepsilon^{-\alpha} for 0<\alpha<1, whereas \ln\mathbf{E}\sigma\sim\varepsilon^{- 1}|\ln\varepsilon|^{1-{1}/{\alpha}} for \alpha>1.
