In this paper we introduce the notion of fractional martingale as the fractional derivative of order \alpha of a continuous local martingale, where \alpha\in(-{1/2},{1/2}), and we show that it has a nonzero finite variation of order \frac{2}{1+2\alpha}, under some integrability assumptions on the quadratic variation of the local martingale. As an application we establish an extension of L\'evy's characterization theorem for the fractional Brownian motion.
