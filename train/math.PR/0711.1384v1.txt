Let X, X_1, X_2,... be a sequence of non-degenerate i.i.d. random variables with mean zero. The best possible weighted approximations are investigated in D[0, 1] for the partial sum processes \{S_{[nt]}, 0\le t\le 1\}, where S_n=\sum_{j=1}^nX_j, under the assumption that X belongs to the domain of attraction of the normal law. The conclusions then are used to establish similar results for the sequence of self-normalized partial sum processes \{S_{[nt]}/V_n, 0\le t\le 1\}, where V_n^2=\sum_{j=1}^nX_j^2. L_p approximations of self-normalized partial sum processes are also discussed.
