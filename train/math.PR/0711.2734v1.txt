We generalize a previous result concerning free martingale polynomials for the stationary free Jacobi process of parameters \lambda \in ]0.1], \theta = 1/2. Hopelessly, apart from the case \lambda = 1, the polynomials we derive are no longer orthogonal with respect to the spectral measure. As a matter of fact, we use the multiplicative renormalization to write down the corresponding orthogonality measure.
