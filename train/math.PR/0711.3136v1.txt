A fractional fuzzy Potts measure is a probability distribution on spin configurations of a finite graph G obtained in two steps: first a subgraph of G is chosen according to a random cluster measure \phi_{p,q}, and then a spin (\pm1) is chosen independently for each component of the subgraph and assigned to all vertices of that component. We show that whenever q\geq1, such a measure is positively associated, meaning that any two increasing events are positively correlated. This generalizes earlier results of H\"{a}ggstr\"{o}m [Ann. Appl. Probab. 9 (1999) 1149--1159] and H\"{a}ggstr\"{o}m and Schramm [Stochastic Process. Appl. 96 (2001) 213--242].
