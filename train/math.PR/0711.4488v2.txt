Let X and Y be two independent random walks on \Z^2 with zero mean and finite variances, and let L_t(X,Y) be the local time of X-Y at the origin at time t. We show that almost surely with respect to Y, L_t(X,Y)/\log t conditioned on Y converges in distribution to an exponential random variable with the same mean as the distributional limit of L_t(X,Y)/\log t without conditioning. This question arises naturally from the study of the parabolic Anderson model with a single moving catalyst, which is closely related to a pinning model.
