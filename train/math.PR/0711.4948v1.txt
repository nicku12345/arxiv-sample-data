We give a self-contained and detailed presentation of Kesten's results that allow to relate critical and near-critical percolation on the triangular lattice. They constitute an important step in the derivation of the exponents describing the near-critical behavior of this model. For future use and reference, we also show how these results can be obtained in more general situations, and we state some new consequences.
