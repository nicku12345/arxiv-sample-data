It is shown that the limits of the nested subclasses of five classes of infinitely divisible distributions on R^d, which are the Jurek class, the Goldie-Steutel-Bondesson class, the class of selfdecomposable distributions, the Thorin class and the class of generalized type G distributions, are identical with the closure of the class of stable distributions. More general results are also given.
