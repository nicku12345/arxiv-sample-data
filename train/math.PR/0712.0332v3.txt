We derive some geometric properties of chordal SLE(\kappa;\vec{\rho}) processes. Using these results and the method of coupling two SLE processes, we prove that the outer boundary of the final hull of a chordal SLE(\kappa;\vec{\rho}) process has the same distribution as the image of a chordal SLE(\kappa';\vec{\rho'}) trace, where \kappa>4, \kappa'=16/\kappa, and the forces \vec{\rho} and \vec{\rho'} are suitably chosen. We find that for \kappa\ge 8, the boundary of a standard chordal SLE(\kappa) hull stopped on swallowing a fixed x\in\R\sem\{0\} is the image of some SLE(16/\kappa;\vec{\rho}) trace started from x. Then we obtain a new proof of the fact that chordal SLE(\kappa) trace is not reversible for \kappa>8. We also prove that the reversal of SLE(4;\vec{\rho}) trace has the same distribution as the time-change of some SLE(4;\vec{\rho'}) trace for certain values of \vec{\rho} and \vec{\rho'}.
