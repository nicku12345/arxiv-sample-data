Let W^H=\{W^H(t), t \in \rr\} be a fractional Brownian motion of Hurst index H \in (0, 1) with values in \rr, and let L = \{L_t, t \ge 0\} be the local time process at zero of a strictly stable L\'evy process X=\{X_t, t \ge 0\} of index 1<\alpha\leq 2 independent of W^H. The \a-stable local time fractional Brownian motion Z^H=\{Z^H(t), t \ge 0\} is defined by Z^H(t) = W^H(L_t). The process Z^H is self-similar with self-similarity index H(1 - \frac 1 \alpha) and is related to the scaling limit of a continuous time random walk with heavy-tailed waiting times between jumps (\cite{coupleCTRW,limitCTRW}). However, Z^H does not have stationary increments and is non-Gaussian.   In this paper we establish large deviation results for the process Z^H. As applications we derive upper bounds for the uniform modulus of continuity and the laws of the iterated logarithm for Z^H.
