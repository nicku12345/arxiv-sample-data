We study the exact asymptotics for the distribution of the first time \tau_x a L\'evy process X_t crosses a negative level -x. We prove that \mathbf P(\tau_x>t)\sim V(x)\mathbf P(X_t\ge 0)/t as t\to\infty for a certain function V(x). Using known results for the large deviations of random walks we obtain asymptotics for \mathbf P(\tau_x>t) explicitly in both light and heavy tailed cases. We also apply our results to find asymptotics for the distribution of the busy period in an M/G/1 queue.
