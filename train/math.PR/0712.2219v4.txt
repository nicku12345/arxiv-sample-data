In this paper we study the class of backward doubly stochastic differential equations (BDSDEs, for short) whose terminal value depends on the history of forward diffusion. We first establish a probabilistic representation for the spatial gradient of the stochastic viscosity solution to a quasilinear parabolic SPDE in the spirit of the Feynman-Kac formula, without using the derivatives of the coefficients of the corresponding BDSDE. Then such a representation leads to a closed-form representation of the martingale integrand of BDSDE, under only standard Lipschitz condition on the coefficients.
