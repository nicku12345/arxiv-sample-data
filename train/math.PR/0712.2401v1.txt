We study functionals of the form \[\zeta_{t}=\int_0^{t}...\int_0^{t} | X_1(s_1)+...+ X_p(s_p)|^{-\sigma}ds_1... ds_p\] where X_1(t),..., X_p(t) are i.i.d. d-dimensional symmetric stable processes of index 0<\bb\le 2. We obtain results about the large deviations and laws of the iterated logarithm for \zeta_{t}.
