By establishing the intrinsic super-Poincar\'e inequality, some explicit conditions are presented for diffusion semigroups on a non-compact complete Riemannian manifold to be intrinsically ultracontractive. These conditions, as well as the resulting uniform upper bounds on the intrinsic heat kernels, are sharp for some concrete examples.
