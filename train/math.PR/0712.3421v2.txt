Following the recent investigations of Baik and Suidan in \cite{baik2005gcl} and Bodineau and Martin in \cite{bodineau2005upl}, we prove large deviation properties for a last-passage percolation model in \mathbb{Z}^{2}_{+} whose paths are close to the axis. The results are mainly obtained when the random weights are Gaussian or have a finite moment-generating function and rely, as in \cite{baik2005gcl} and \cite{bodineau2005upl}, on an embedding in Brownian paths and the KMT approximation. The study of the subexponential case completes the exposition.
