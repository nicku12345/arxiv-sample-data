Many statistics are based on functions of sample moments. Important examples are the sample variance s_{n-1}^2, the sample coefficient of variation SV(n), the sample dispersion SD(n) and the non-central t-statistic t(n). The definition of these quantities makes clear that the vector defined by   (\sum_{i=1}^nX_i,\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^2)   plays an important role. In studying the asymptotic behaviour of this vector we start by formulating best possible conditions under which the vector (X,X^2) belongs to a bivariate domain of attraction of a stable law. This approach is new, uniform and simple. Our main results include a full discussion of the asymptotic behaviour of SV(n), SD(n) and t^2(n). For simplicity, in restrict ourselves to positive random variables X.
