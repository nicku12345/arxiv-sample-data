We attempt to bring some modest unity to three subareas of heavy tail analysis and extreme value theory: limit laws for componentwise maxima of iid random variables;hidden regular variation and asymptotic independence;conditioned limit laws when one component of a random vector is extreme. The common theme is multivariate regular variation on a cone and the three cases cited come from specifying the cones [0,\infty]^d\setminus \{\boldsymbol 0\};(0,\infty]^d; and [0,\infty]\times (0,\infty].
