We study the convergence to the multiple Wiener-It\^{o} integral from processes with absolutely continuous paths. More precisely, consider a family of processes, with paths in the Cameron-Martin space, that converges weakly to a standard Brownian motion in \mathcal C_0([0,T]). Using these processes, we construct a family that converges weakly, in the sense of the finite dimensional distributions, to the multiple Wiener-It\^{o} integral process of a function f\in L^2([0,T]^n). We prove also the weak convergence in the space \mathcal C_0([0,T]) to the second order integral for two important families of processes that converge to a standard Brownian motion.
