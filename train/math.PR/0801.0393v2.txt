We give a review of the state of the art with regard to the theory of scale functions for spectrally negative Levy processes. From this we introduce a general method for generating new families of scale functions. Using this method we introduce a new family of scale functions belonging to the Gaussian Tempered Stable Convolution (GTSC) class. We give particular emphasis to special cases as well as cross-referencing their analytical behaviour against known general considerations.
