We consider a conditionally Poissonian random graph model where the mean degrees, `capacities', follow a power-tailed distribution with finite mean and infinite variance. Such a graph of size N has a giant component which is super-small in the sense that the typical distance between vertices is of the order of \log\log N. The shortest paths travel through a core consisting of nodes with high mean degrees. In this paper we derive upper bounds of the typical distance when an upper part of the core is removed, including the case that the whole core is removed.
