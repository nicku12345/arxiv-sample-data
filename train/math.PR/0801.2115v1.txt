We say that a string of length d occurs, in a Bernoulli sequence, if a success is followed by exactly (d-1) failures before the next success. The counts of such d-strings are of interest, and in specific independent Bernoulli sequences are known to correspond to asymptotic d-cycle counts in random permutations.   In this note, we give a new framework, in terms of conditional Poisson processes, which allows for a quick characterization of the joint distribution of the counts of all d-strings, in a general class of Bernoulli sequences, as certain mixtures of the product of Poisson measures. This general class includes all Bernoulli sequences considered before, as well many new sequences.
