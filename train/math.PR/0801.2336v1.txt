This paper investigates the Einstein relation; the connection between the volume growth, the resistance growth and the expected time a random walk needs to leave a ball on a weighted graph. The Einstein relation is proved under different set of conditions. In the simplest case it is shown under the volume doubling and time comparison principles. This and the other set of conditions provide the basic framework for the study of (sub-) diffusive behavior of the random walks on weighted graphs.
