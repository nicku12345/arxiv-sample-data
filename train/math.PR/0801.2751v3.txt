In this article, we prove that the measures \mathbb{Q}_T associated to the one-dimensional Edwards' model on the interval [0,T] converge to a limit measure \mathbb{Q} when T goes to infinity, in the following sense: for all s\geq0 and for all events \Lambda_s depending on the canonical process only up to time s, \mathbb{Q}_T(\Lambda_s)\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}(\Lambda_s). Moreover, we prove that, if \mathbb{P} is Wiener measure, there exists a martingale (D_s)_{s\in\mathbb{R}_+} such that \mathbb{Q}(\Lambda_s) =\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}}(\mathbh{1}_{\Lambda_s}D_s), and we give an explicit expression for this martingale.
