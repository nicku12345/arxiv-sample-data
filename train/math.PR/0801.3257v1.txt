We establish existence and uniqueness for the martingale problem associated with a system of degenerate SDE's representing a catalytic branching network. For example, in the hypercyclic case: dX_{t}^{(i)}=b_i(X_t)dt+\sqrt{2\gamma_{i}(X_{t}) X_{t}^{(i+1)}X_{t}^{(i)}}dB_{t}^{i}, X_t^{(i)}\ge 0, i=1,..., d, where X^{(d+1)}\equiv X^{(1)}, existence and uniqueness is proved when \gamma and b are continuous on the positive orthant, \gamma is strictly positive, and b_i>0 on \{x_i=0\}. The special case d=2, b_i=\theta_i-x_i is required in work of Dawson-Greven-den Hollander-Sun-Swart on mean fields limits of block averages for 2-type branching models on a hierarchical group. The proofs make use of some new methods, including Cotlar's lemma to establish asymptotic orthogonality of the derivatives of an associated semigroup at different times,and a refined integration by parts technique from Dawson-Perkins]. As a by-product of the proof we obtain the strong Feller property of the associated resolvent.
