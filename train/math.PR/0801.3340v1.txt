Under the continuous assumption on the generator g, Briand et al. [Electron. Comm. Probab. 5 (2000) 101--117] showed some connections between g and the conditional g-expectation ({\mathcal{E}}_g[\cdot|{\mathcal{F}}_t])_{t\in[0,T]} and Rosazza Gianin [Insurance: Math. Econ. 39 (2006) 19--34] showed some connections between g and the corresponding dynamic risk measure (\rho^g_t)_{t\in[0,T]}. In this paper we prove that, without the additional continuous assumption on g, a g-expectation {\mathcal{E}}_g satisfies translation invariance if and only if g is independent of y, and {\mathcal{E}}_g satisfies convexity (resp. subadditivity) if and only if g is independent of y and g is convex (resp. subadditive) with respect to z. By these conclusions we deduce that the static risk measure \rho^g induced by a g-expectation {\mathcal{E}}_g is a convex (resp. coherent) risk measure if and only if g is independent of y and g is convex (resp. sublinear) with respect to z. Our results extend the results in Briand et al. [Electron. Comm. Probab. 5 (2000) 101--117] and Rosazza Gianin [Insurance: Math. Econ. 39 (2006) 19--34] on these subjects.
