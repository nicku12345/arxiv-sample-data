We establish limit theorems for the fluctuations of the rescaled occupation time of a (d,\alpha,\beta)-branching particle system. It consists of particles moving according to a symmetric \alpha-stable motion in \mathbb{R}^d. The branching law is in the domain of attraction of a (1+\beta)-stable law and the initial condition is an equilibrium random measure for the system (defined below). In the paper we treat separately the cases of intermediate \alpha/\beta<d<(1+\beta)\alpha/\beta, critical d=(1+\beta)\alpha/\beta and large d>(1+\beta)\alpha/\beta  dimensions. In the most interesting case of intermediate dimensions we obtain a version of a fractional stable motion. The long-range dependence structure of this process is also studied. Contrary to this case, limit processes in critical and large dimensions have independent increments.
