A real valued function defined on}\mathbb{R} {\small is called}g{\small --convex if it satisfies the following \textquotedblleft generalized Jensen's inequality\textquotedblright under a given}g{\small -expectation, i.e., }h(\mathbb{E}^{g}[X])\leq \mathbb{E}% ^{g}[h(X)]{\small, for all random variables}X {\small such that both sides of the inequality are meaningful. In this paper we will give a necessary and sufficient conditions for a }C^{2}{\small -function being}% g {\small -convex. We also studied some more general situations. We also studied}g{\small -concave and}g{\small -affine functions.
