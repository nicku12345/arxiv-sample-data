Let \mu and \nu be fixed probability measures on a filtered space (\Omega, {\cal F}, ({\cal F}_t)_{t\in {\bf R}^{+}}). Denote by \mu_T  and \nu_T  (respectively, \mu_{T-}  and \nu_{T-} ) the restrictions of the measures \mu and \nu on {\cal F}_T  (respectively, on {\cal F}_{T-} ) for a stopping time T. We find the Hahn decomposition of \mu_T  and \nu_T  using the Hahn decomposition of the measures \mu, \nu, and the Hellinger process h_t in the strict sense of order 1/2. The norm of the absolutely continuous component of \mu_{T-}  with respect to \nu_{T-}  is computed in terms of density processes and Hellinger integrals.
