In this article we consider a Brownian motion with drift of the form \[dS_t=\mu_t dt+dB_t\qquadfor t\ge0,\] with a specific nontrivial (\mu_t)_{t\geq0}, predictable with respect to \mathbb{F}^B, the natural filtration of the Brownian motion B=(B_t)_{t\ge0}. We construct a process H=(H_t)_{t\ge0}, also predictable with respect to \mathbb{F}^B, such that ((H\cdot S)_t)_{t\ge 0} is a Brownian motion in its own filtration. Furthermore, for any \delta>0, we refine this construction such that the drift (\mu_t)_{t\ge0} only takes values in ]\mu-\delta,\mu+\delta[, for fixed \mu>0.
