A Boussinesq model for the Benard convection under random influences is considered as a system of stochastic partial differential equations. This is a coupled system of stochastic Navier-Stokes equations and the transport equation for temperature. Large deviations are proved, using a weak convergence approach based on a variational representation of functionals of infinite dimensional Brownian motion.
