We study the stability of single server retrial queues under general distribution for retrial times and stationary ergodic service times, for three main retrial policies studied in the literature: classical linear, constant and control policies. The approach used is the renovating events approach to obtain sufficient stability conditions by strong coupling convergence of the process modeling the dynamics of the system to a unique stationary ergodic regime. We also obtain instability conditions by convergence in distribution to improper limiting sequences.
