For a sequence of identically distributed negatively associated random variables \{X_n; n\geq 1\} with partial sums S_n=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i, n\geq 1, refinements are presented of the classical Baum-Katz and Lai complete convergence theorems. More specifically, necessary and sufficient moment conditions are provided for complete moment convergence of the form  \sum_{n \ge n_0} n^{r -2 -\frac{1}{pq}} a_n E(\max_{1 \le k \le n}|S_k|^{\frac{1}{q}} - \epsilon b_n^{\frac{1}{pq}})^+ < \infty  to hold where r>1, q>0 and either n_0=1, 0<p<2, a_n=1, b_n=n or n_0=3, p=2, a_n=(\log n)^{-\frac{1}{2q}}, b_n=n\log n. These results extend results of Chow (1988) and Li and Sp\u{a}taru (2005) from the independent and identically distributed case to the identically distributed negatively associated setting. The complete moment convergence is also shown to be equivalent to a form of complete integral convergence.
