This paper uses two new ingredients, namely stochastic differential equations satisfied by continuous-state branching processes (CSBPs), and a topology under which the Lamperti transformation is continuous, in order to provide self-contained proofs of Lamperti's 1967 representation of CSBPs in terms of spectrally positive L\'evy processes. The first proof is a direct probabilistic proof, and the second one uses approximations by discrete processes, for which the Lamperti representation is evident.
