We consider the solution u(x,t) to a stochastic heat equation. For fixed x, the process F(t)=u(x,t) has a nontrivial quartic variation. It follows that F is not a semimartingale, so a stochastic integral with respect to F cannot be defined in the classical It\^{o} sense. We show that for sufficiently differentiable functions g(x,t), a stochastic integral \int g(F(t),t)\,dF(t) exists as a limit of discrete, midpoint-style Riemann sums, where the limit is taken in distribution in the Skorokhod space of cadlag functions. Moreover, we show that this integral satisfies a change of variable formula with a correction term that is an ordinary It\^{o} integral with respect to a Brownian motion that is independent of F.
