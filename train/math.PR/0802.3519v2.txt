We consider the directed first passage percolation model on {\bf Z}^2. In this model, we assign independently to each edge e a passage time t(e) with a common distribution F. We denote by \vec{T}({\bf 0}, (r,\theta)) the passage time from the origin to (r, \theta) by a northeast path for (r, \theta)\in {\bf R}^+\times [0,\pi/2]. It is known that \vec{T}({\bf 0}, (r, \theta))/r converges to a time constant \vec{\mu}_F (\theta). Let \vec{p}_c denote the critical probability for oriented percolation. In this paper, we show that the time constant has a phase transition divided by \vec{p}_c, as follows:   (1) If F(0) < \vec{p}_c, then \vec{\mu}_F(\theta) >0 for all 0\leq \theta\leq \pi/2.   (2) If F(0) = \vec{p}_c, then \vec{\mu}_F(\theta) >0 if and only if \theta\neq \pi/4.   (3) If F(0)=p > \vec{p}_c, then there exists a percolation cone between \theta_p^- and \theta_p^+ for   0\leq \theta^-_p< \theta^+_p \leq \pi/2 such that \vec{\mu} (\theta) >0 if and only if \theta\not\in [\theta_p^-, \theta^+_p]. Furthermore, all the moments of \vec{T}({\bf 0}, (r, \theta)) converge whenever \theta\in [\theta_p^-, \theta^+_p]. As applications, we describe the shape of the directed growth model on the distribution of F. We give a phase transition for the shape divided by \vec{p}_c.
