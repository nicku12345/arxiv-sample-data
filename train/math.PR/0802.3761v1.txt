We describe quantization designs which lead to asymptotically and order optimal functional quantizers. Regular variation of the eigenvalues of the covariance operator plays a crucial role to achieve these rates. For the development of a constructive quantization scheme we rely on the knowledge of the eigenvectors of the covariance operator in order to transform the problem into a finite dimensional quantization problem of normal distributions. Furthermore we derive a high-resolution formula for the L^2-quantization errors of Riemann-Liouville processes.
