We improve the geometric properties of SLE(\kappa;\vec{\rho}) processes derived in an earlier paper, which are then used to obtain more results about the duality of SLE. We find that for \kappa\in (4,8), the boundary of a standard chordal SLE(\kappa) hull stopped on swallowing a fixed x\in\R\sem\{0\} is the image of some SLE(16/\kappa;\vec{\rho}) trace started from a random point. Using this fact together with a similar proposition in the case that \kappa\ge 8, we obtain a description of the boundary of a standard chordal SLE(\kappa) hull for \kappa>4, at a finite stopping time. Finally, we prove that for \kappa>4, in many cases, the limit of a chordal or strip SLE(\kappa;\vec{\rho}) trace exists.
