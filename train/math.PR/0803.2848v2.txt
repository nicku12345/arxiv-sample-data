We consider a variant of self-repelling random walk on the integer lattice Z where the self-repellence is defined in terms of the local time on oriented edges. The long-time asymptotic scaling of this walk is surprisingly different from the asymptotics of the similar process with self-repellence defined in terms of local time on unoriented edges. We prove limit theorems for the local time process and for the position of the random walker. The main ingredient is a Ray-Knight-type of approach. At the end of the paper, we also present some computer simulations which show the strange scaling behaviour of the walk considered.
