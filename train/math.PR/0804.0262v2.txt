We take the point of view of a particle performing random walk with bounded jumps on \mathbb{Z}^d in a stationary and ergodic random environment. We prove the quenched large deviation principle (LDP) for the pair empirical measure of the environment Markov chain. By an appropriate contraction, we deduce the quenched LDP for the mean velocity of the particle and obtain a variational formula for the corresponding rate function. We propose an Ansatz for the minimizer of this formula. When d=1, we verify this Ansatz and generalize the nearest-neighbor result of Comets, Gantert and Zeitouni to walks with bounded jumps.
