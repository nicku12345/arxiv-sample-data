We study the generalized random Fibonacci sequences defined by their first nonnegative terms and for n\ge 1, F_{n+2} = \lambda F_{n+1} \pm F_{n} (linear case) and \widetilde F_{n+2} = |\lambda \widetilde F_{n+1} \pm \widetilde F_{n}| (non-linear case), where each \pm sign is independent and either + with probability p or - with probability 1-p (0<p\le 1). Our main result is that, when \lambda is of the form \lambda_k = 2\cos (\pi/k) for some integer k\ge 3, the exponential growth of F_n for 0<p\le 1, and of \widetilde F_{n} for 1/k < p\le 1, is almost surely positive and given by  \int_0^\infty \log x d\nu_{k, \rho} (x),  where \rho is an explicit function of p depending on the case we consider, taking values in [0, 1], and \nu_{k, \rho} is an explicit probability distribution on \RR_+ defined inductively on generalized Stern-Brocot intervals. We also provide an integral formula for 0<p\le 1 in the easier case \lambda\ge 2. Finally, we study the variations of the exponent as a function of p.
