Let q\geq 2 be a positive integer, B be a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index H\in(0,1), Z be an Hermite random variable of index q, and H_q denote the Hermite polynomial having degree q. For any n\geq 1, set V_n=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} H_q(B_{k+1}-B_k). The aim of the current paper is to derive, in the case when the Hurst index verifies H>1-1/(2q), an upper bound for the total variation distance between the laws \mathscr{L}(Z_n) and \mathscr{L}(Z), where Z_n stands for the correct renormalization of V_n which converges in distribution towards Z. Our results should be compared with those obtained recently by Nourdin and Peccati (2007) in the case when H<1-1/(2q), corresponding to the situation where one has normal approximation.
