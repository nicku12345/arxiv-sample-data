In this Note we study optimal stopping problems for strong Markov processes and affine functions. We give a justification of the Snell envelope form using standard results of optimal stopping. We also justify the convexity of the value function, and without a priori restriction to a particular class of stopping times, we deduce that the smallest optimal stopping time is necessarily a hitting time.
