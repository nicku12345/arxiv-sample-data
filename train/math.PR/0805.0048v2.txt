In the L\'evy construction of Brownian motion, a Haar-derived basis of functions is used to form a finite-dimensional process W^{N} and to define the Wiener process as the almost sure path-wise limit of W^{N} when N tends to infinity. We generalize such a construction to the class of centered Gaussian Markov processes X which can be written X_{t} = g(t) \cdot \int_{0}^{t} f(t) dW_{t} with f and g being continuous functions. We build the finite-dimensional process X^{N} so that it gives an exact representation of the conditional expectation of X with respect to the filtration generated by {\lbrace X_{k/2^{N}}\rbrace} for 0 \leq k \leq 2^{N}. Moreover, we prove that the process X^{N} converges in distribution toward X.
