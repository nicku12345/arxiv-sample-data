We show that the spectral gap for the interchange process (and the symmetric exclusion process) in a d-dimensional box of side length L is asymptotic to \pi^2/L^2. This gives more evidence in favor of Aldous's conjecture that in any graph the spectral gap for the interchange process is the same as the spectral gap for a corresponding continuous-time random walk. Our proof uses a technique that is similar to that used by Handjani and Jungreis, who proved that Aldous's conjecture holds when the graph is a tree.
