We consider nonlinear parabolic SPDEs of the form \partial_t u=\sL u + \sigma(u)\dot w, where \dot w denotes space-time white noise, \sigma:\R\to\R is [globally] Lipschitz continuous, and \sL is the L^2-generator of a L\'evy process. We present precise criteria for existence as well as uniqueness of solutions. More significantly, we prove that these solutions grow in time with at most a precise exponential rate. We establish also that when \sigma is globally Lipschitz and asymptotically sublinear, the solution to the nonlinear heat equation is ``weakly intermittent,'' provided that the symmetrization of \sL is recurrent and the initial data is sufficiently large.   Among other things, our results lead to general formulas for the upper second-moment Liapounov exponent of the parabolic Anderson model for \sL in dimension (1+1). When \sL=\kappa\partial_{xx} for \kappa>0, these formulas agree with the earlier results of statistical physics \cite{Kardar,KrugSpohn,LL63}, and also probability theory \cite{BC,CM94} in the two exactly-solvable cases where u_0=\delta_0 and u_0\equiv 1.
