Let (\tau_x)_{x \in \Z^d} be i.i.d. random variables with heavy (polynomial) tails. Given a \in [0,1], we consider the Markov process defined by the jump rates \omega_{x \to y} = {\tau_x}^{-(1-a)} {\tau_y}^a between two neighbours x and y in \Z^d. We give the asymptotic behaviour of the principal eigenvalue of the generator of this process, with Dirichlet boundary condition. The prominent feature is a phase transition that occurs at some threshold depending on the dimension.
