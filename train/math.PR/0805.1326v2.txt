We consider some interacting particle processes with long-range dynamics: the zero-range and exclusion processes with long jumps. We prove that the hydrodynamic limit of these processes corresponds to a (possibly non-linear) fractional heat equation. The scaling in this case is superdiffusive. In addition, we discuss a central limit theorem for a tagged particle on the zero-range process and existence and uniqueness of solutions of the Cauchy problem for the fractional heat equation.
