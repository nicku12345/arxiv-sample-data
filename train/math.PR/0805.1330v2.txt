We study the small deviation problem \log\mathbb{P}(\sup_{t\in[0,1]}|X_t|\leq\varepsilon), as \varepsilon\to0, for general L\'{e}vy processes X. The techniques enable us to determine the asymptotic rate for general real-valued L\'{e}vy processes, which we demonstrate with many examples. As a particular consequence, we show that a L\'{e}vy process with nonvanishing Gaussian component has the same (strong) asymptotic small deviation rate as the corresponding Brownian motion.
