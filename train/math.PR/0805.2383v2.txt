We consider a porous media type equation over all of \R^d with d = 1, with monotone discontinuous coefficients with linear growth and prove a probabilistic representation of its solution in terms of an associated microscopic diffusion. This equation is motivated by some singular behaviour arising in complex self-organized critical systems. One of the main analytic ingredients of the proof, is a new result on uniqueness of distributional solutions of a linear PDE on \R^1 with non-continuous coefficients.
