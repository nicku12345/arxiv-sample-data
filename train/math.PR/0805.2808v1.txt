In this expository paper we describe a relatively elementary method of establishing the existence of a Dutch book in a simple multivariate normal prediction setting. The method involves deriving a nonstandard predictive distribution that is motivated by invariance. This predictive distribution satisfies an interesting identity which in turn yields an elementary demonstration of the existence of a Dutch book for a variety of possible predictive distributions.
