This paper is about the rate of convergence of the Markov chain X_{n+1}=AX_{n}+B_{n} (mod p), where A is an integer matrix with nonzero eigenvalues and {B_{n}}_{n} is a sequence of independent and identically distributed integer vectors, with support not parallel to a proper subspace of Q^{k} invariant under A. If |\lambda_{i}|\not=1 for all eigenvalues \lambda_{i} of A, then n=O((\ln p)^{2})  steps are sufficient and n=O(\ln p) steps are necessary to have X_{n} sampling from a nearly uniform distribution. Conversely, if A has the eigenvalues \lambda_{i} that are roots of positive integer numbers, |\lambda_{1}|=1 and |\lambda_{i}|>1 for all i\not=1, then O(p^{2})  steps are necessary and sufficient.
