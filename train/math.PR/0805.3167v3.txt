Let \a be a complex random variable with mean zero and bounded variance. Let N_{n} be the random matrix of size n whose entries are iid copies of \a and M be a fixed matrix of the same size. The goal of this paper is to give a general estimate for the condition number and least singular value of the matrix M + N_{n}, generalizing an earlier result of Spielman and Teng for the case when \a is gaussian.   Our investigation reveals an interesting fact that the "core" matrix M does play a role on tail bounds for the least singular value of M+N_{n} . This does not occur in Spielman-Teng studies when \a is gaussian.   Consequently, our general estimate involves the norm \|M\|.   In the special case when \|M\| is relatively small, this estimate is nearly optimal and extends or refines existing results.
