Let \{b_H(t),t\in\mathbb{R}\} be the fractional Brownian motion with parameter 0<H<1. When 1/2<H, we consider diffusion equations of the type \[X(t)=c+\int_0^t\sigma\bigl(X(u)\bigr)\mathrm {d}b_H(u)+\int _0^t\mu\bigl(X(u)\bigr)\mathrm {d}u.\] In different particular models where \sigma(x)=\sigma or \sigma(x)=\sigma x and \mu(x)=\mu or \mu(x)=\mu x, we propose a central limit theorem for estimators of H and of \sigma based on regression methods. Then we give tests of the hypothesis on \sigma for these models. We also consider functional estimation on \sigma(\cdot) in the above more general models based in the asymptotic behavior of functionals of the 2nd-order increments of the fBm.
