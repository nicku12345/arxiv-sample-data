For 0<\alpha\leq2, a super-\alpha-stable motion X in \mathsf{R}^d with branching of index 1+\beta\in(1,2) is considered. Fix arbitrary t>0. If d<\alpha/\beta, a dichotomy for the density function of the measure X_t holds: the density function is locally H\"{o}lder continuous if d=1 and \alpha>1+\beta but locally unbounded otherwise. Moreover, in the case of continuity, we determine the optimal local H\"{o}lder index.
