For each n \geq 1, let \{X_{j,n}\}_{1 \leq j \leq n} be a sequence of strictly stationary random variables. In this article, we give some asymptotic weak dependence conditions for the convergence in distribution of the point process N_n=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\delta_{X_{j,n}} to an infinitely divisible point process. From the point process convergence, we obtain the convergence in distribution of the partial sum sequence S_n=\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_{j,n} to an infinitely divisible random variable, whose L\'{e}vy measure is related to the canonical measure of the limiting point process. As examples, we discuss the case of triangular arrays which possess known (row-wise) dependence structures, like the strong mixing property, the association, or the dependence structure of a stochastic volatility model.
