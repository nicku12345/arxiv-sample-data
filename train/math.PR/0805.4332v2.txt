The one dimensional distribution of a L\'{e}vy process is not known in general even though its characteristic function is given by the famous L\'{e}vy-Khinchine theorem. This article gives an exact series representation for the one dimensional distribution of a L\'{e}vy process satisfying certain moment conditions. Moreover, this work clarifies an old result by Cram\'{e}r on Edgeworth expansions for the distribution function of a L\'{e}vy process.
