The Malliavin derivative for a L\'evy process (X_t) can be defined on the space \DD_{1,2} using a chaos expansion or in the case of a pure jump process also via an increment quotient operator \cite{sole-utzet-vives}. In this paper we define the Malliavin derivative operator \D on the class \mathcal{S} of smooth random variables f(X_{t_1}, ..., X_{t_n}), where f is a smooth function with compact support. We show that the closure of L_2(\Om) \supseteq \mathcal{S} \stackrel{\D}{\to} L_2(\m\otimes \mass) yields to the space \DD_{1,2}. As an application we conclude that Lipschitz functions map from \DD_{1,2} into \DD_{1,2}.
