We consider the continuous model of log-infinitely divisible multifractal random measures (MRM) introduced in \cite{bacry} . If M is a non degenerate multifractal measure with associated metric \rho(x,y)=M([x,y]) and structure function \zet a, we show that we have the following relation between the (Euclidian) Hausdorff dimension {\rm dim}_H of a measurable set K and the Hausdorff dimension {\rm dim}_H^{\rho} with respect to \rho of the same set: \zeta({\rm dim}_H^{\rho}(K))={\r m dim}_H(K). Our results can be extended to higher dimensions in the log normal case: inspired by quantum gravity in dime nsion 2, we consider the 2 dimensional case.
