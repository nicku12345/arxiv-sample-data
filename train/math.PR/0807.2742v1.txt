We study the number of collisions X_n of an exchangeable coalescent with multiple collisions (\Lambda-coalescent) which starts with n particles and is driven by rates determined by a finite characteristic measure \nu({\rm d}x)=x^{-2}\Lambda({\rm d}x). Via a coupling technique we derive limiting laws of X_n, using previous results on regenerative compositions derived from stick-breaking partitions of the unit interval. The possible limiting laws of X_n include normal, stable with index 1\le\alpha<2 and Mittag-Leffler distributions. The results apply, in particular, to the case when \nu is a beta(a-2,b) distribution with parameters a>2 and b>0. The approach taken allows to derive asymptotics of three other functionals of the coalescent, the absorption time, the length of an external branch chosen at random from the n external branches, and the number of collision events that occur before the randomly selected external branch coalesces with one of its neighbours.
