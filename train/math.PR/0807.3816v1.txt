Let M =(M_t)_{t\geq 0} be any continuous real-valued stochastic process. We prove that if there exists a sequence (a_n)_{n\geq 1} of real numbers which converges to 0 and such that M satisfies the reflection property at all levels a_n and 2a_n with n\geq 1, then M is an Ocone local martingale with respect to its natural filtration. We state the subsequent open question: is this result still true when the property only holds at levels a_n? Then we prove that the later question is equivalent to the fact that for Brownian motion, the \sigma-field of the invariant events by all reflections at levels a_n, n\ge1 is trivial. We establish similar results for skip free \mathbb{Z}-valued processes and use them for the proof in continuous time, via a discretisation in space.
