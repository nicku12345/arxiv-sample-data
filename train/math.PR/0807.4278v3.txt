Consider a \Lambda-coalescent that comes down from infinity (meaning that it starts from a configuration containing infinitely many blocks at time 0, yet it has a finite number N_t of blocks at any positive time t>0). We exhibit a deterministic function v:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty) such that N_t/v(t)\to1, almost surely, and in L^p for any p\geq1, as t\to0. Our approach relies on a novel martingale technique.
