The focus of this paper is on the asymptotics of large-time numbers of customers in time-periodic Markovian many-server queues with customer abandonment in heavy traffic. Limit theorems are obtained for the periodic number-of-customers processes under the fluid and diffusion scalings. Other results concern limits for general time-dependent queues and for time-homogeneous queues in steady state.
