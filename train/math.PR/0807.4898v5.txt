Given an n \times n complex matrix A, let   \mu_{A}(x,y):= \frac{1}{n} |\{1\le i \le n, \Re \lambda_i \le x, \Im \lambda_i \le y\}| be the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of its eigenvalues   \lambda_i \in \BBC, i=1, ... n.   We consider the limiting distribution (both in probability and in the almost sure convergence sense) of the normalized ESD \mu_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} A_n} of a random matrix A_n = (a_{ij})_{1 \leq i,j \leq n} where the random variables a_{ij} - \E(a_{ij}) are iid copies of a fixed random variable x with unit variance. We prove a \emph{universality principle} for such ensembles, namely that the limit distribution in question is {\it independent} of the actual choice of x. In particular, in order to compute this distribution, one can assume that x is real of complex gaussian. As a related result, we show how laws for this ESD follow from laws for the \emph{singular} value distribution of \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} A_n - zI for complex z. As a corollary we establish the Circular Law conjecture (in both strong and weak forms), that asserts that \mu_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} A_n} converges to the uniform measure on the unit disk when the a_{ij} have zero mean.
