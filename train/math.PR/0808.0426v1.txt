Consider an urn model whose replacement matrix is triangular, has all entries nonnegative and the row sums are all equal to one. We obtain the strong laws for the counts of balls corresponding to each color. The scalings for these laws depend on the diagonal elements of a rearranged replacement matrix. We use the strong laws obtained to study further behavior of certain three color urn models.
