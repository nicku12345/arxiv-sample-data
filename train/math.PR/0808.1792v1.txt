Let K_n denote the number of types of a sample of size n taken from an exchangeable coalescent process (\Xi-coalescent) with mutation. A distributional recursion for the sequence (K_n)_{n\in{\mathbb N}} is derived. If the coalescent does not have proper frequencies, i.e., if the characterizing measure \Xi on the infinite simplex \Delta does not have mass at zero and satisfies \int_\Delta |x|\Xi(dx)/(x,x)<\infty, where |x|:=\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i and (x,x):=\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i^2 for x=(x_1,x_2,...)\in\Delta, then K_n/n converges weakly as n\to\infty to a limiting variable K which is characterized by an exponential integral of the subordinator associated with the coalescent process. For so-called simple measures \Xi satisfying \int_\Delta\Xi(dx)/(x,x)<\infty we characterize the distribution of K via a fixed-point equation.
