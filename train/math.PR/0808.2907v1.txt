A uniformly random graph on n vertices with a fixed degree sequence, obeying a \gamma subpower law, is studied. It is shown that, for \gamma>3, in a subcritical phase with high probability the largest component size does not exceed n^{1/\gamma+\varepsilon_n}, \varepsilon_n=O(\ln\ln n/\ln n), 1/\gamma being the best power for this random graph. This is similar to the best possible n^{1/(\gamma-1)} bound for a different model of the random graph, one with independent vertex degrees, conjectured by Durrett, and proved recently by Janson.
