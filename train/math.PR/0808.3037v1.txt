In this paper we obtain the central limit theorems, moderate deviations and the laws of the iterated logarithm for the energy \[H_n=\sum_{1\le j<k\le n}\omega_j\omega_k1_{\{S_j=S_k\}}\] of the polymer \{S_1,...,S_n\} equipped with random electrical charges \{\omega_1,...,\omega_n\}. Our approach is based on comparison of the moments between H_n and the self-intersection local time \[Q_n=\sum_{1\le j<k\le n}1_{\{S_j=S_k\}}\] run by the d-dimensional random walk \{S_k\}. As partially needed for our main objective and partially motivated by their independent interest, the central limit theorems and exponential integrability for Q_n are also investigated in the case d\ge3.
