Let B^H=\{B^H(t),t\in{{\mathbb{R}}_+^N}\} be an (N,d)-fractional Brownian sheet with index H=(H_1,...,H_N)\in(0,1)^N defined by B^H(t)=(B^H_1(t),...,B^H_d(t)) (t\in {\mathbb{R}}_+^N), where B^H_1,...,B^H_d are independent copies of a real-valued fractional Brownian sheet B_0^H. We prove that if d<\sum_{\ell=1}^NH_{\ell}^{-1}, then the local times of B^H are jointly continuous. This verifies a conjecture of Xiao and Zhang (Probab. Theory Related Fields 124 (2002)). We also establish sharp local and global H\"{o}lder conditions for the local times of B^H. These results are applied to study analytic and geometric properties of the sample paths of B^H.
