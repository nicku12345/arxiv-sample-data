Consider a uniformly random regular graph of a fixed degree d\ge3, with n vertices. Suppose that each edge is open (closed), with probability p(q=1-p), respectively. In 2004 Alon, Benjamini and Stacey proved that p^*=(d-1)^{-1} is the threshold probability for emergence of a giant component in the subgraph formed by the open edges. In this paper we show that the transition window around p^* has width roughly of order n^{-1/3}. More precisely, suppose that p=p(n) is such that \omega:=n^{1/3}|p-p^*|\to\infty. If p<p^*, then with high probability (whp) the largest component has O((p-p^*)^{-2}\log n) vertices. If p>p^*, and \log\omega\gg\log\log n, then whp the largest component has about n(1-(p\pi+q)^d)\asymp n(p-p^*) vertices, and the second largest component is of size (p-p^*)^{-2}(\log n)^{1+o(1)}, at most, where \pi=(p\pi+q)^{d-1},\pi\in(0,1). If \omega is merely polylogarithmic in n, then whp the largest component contains n^{2/3+o(1)} vertices.
