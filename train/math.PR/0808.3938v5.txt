n this paper, we prove a result linking the square and the rectangular R-transforms, the consequence of which is a surprising relation between the square and rectangular versions the free additive convolutions, involving the Marchenko-Pastur law. Consequences on random matrices, on infinite divisibility and on the arithmetics of the square versions of the free additive and multiplicative convolutions are given.
