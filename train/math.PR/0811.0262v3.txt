Consider a discrete-time one-dimensional supercritical branching random walk. We study the probability that there exists an infinite ray in the branching random walk that always lies above the line of slope \gamma-\epsilon, where \gamma denotes the asymptotic speed of the right-most position in the branching random walk. Under mild general assumptions upon the distribution of the branching random walk, we prove that when \epsilon\to 0, the probability in question decays like \exp\{- {\beta + o(1)\over \epsilon^{1/2}}\}, where \beta is a positive constant depending on the distribution of the branching random walk. In the special case of i.i.d. Bernoulli(p) random variables (with 0<p<{1\over 2}) assigned on a rooted binary tree, this answers an open question of Robin Pemantle.
