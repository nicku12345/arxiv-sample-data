Let N be distributed as a Poisson random set on R^d with intensity comparable to the Lebesgue measure. Consider the Voronoi tiling of R^d, (C_v)_{v\in N}, where C_v is composed by points x in R^d that are closer to v than to any other v' in N. A polyomino P of size n is a connected union (in the usual R^d topological sense) of n tiles, and we denote by Pi_n the collection of all polyominos P of size n containing the origin. Assume that the weight of a Voronoi tile C_v is given by F(C_v), where F is a nonnegative functional on Voronoi tiles. In this paper we investigate the tail behavior of the maximal weight among polyominoes in Pi_n for some functionals F, mainly when F(C_v) is the number of faces of C_v. Next we apply our results to study self-avoiding paths, first-passage percolation models and the stabbing number on the dual graph, named the Delaunay triangulation. As the main application we show that first passage percolation has at most linear variance.
