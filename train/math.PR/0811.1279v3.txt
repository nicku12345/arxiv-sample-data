We consider an interacting particle process on a graph which, from a macroscopic point of view, looks like \Z^d and, at a microscopic level, is a complete graph of degree N (called a patch). There are two birth rates: an inter-patch one \lambda and an intra-patch one \phi. Once a site is occupied, there is no breeding from outside the patch and the probability c(i) of success of an intra-patch breeding decreases with the size i of the population in the site. We prove the existence of a critical value \lambda_{cr}(\phi, c, N) and a critical value \phi_{cr}(\lambda, c, N). We consider a sequence of processes generated by the families of control functions \{c_i\}_{i \in \N} and degrees \{N_i\}_{i \in \N}; we prove, under mild assumptions, the existence of a critical value i_{cr}. Roughly speaking we show that, in the limit, these processes behave as the branching random walk on \Z^d with external birth rate \lambda and internal birth rate \phi. Some examples of models that can be seen as particular cases are given.
