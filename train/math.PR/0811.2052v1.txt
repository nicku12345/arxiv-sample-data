We consider a sequence (\xi_n)_{n\ge1} of i.i.d. random values living in the domain of attraction of an extreme value distribution. For such sequence, there exists (a_n) and (b_n), with a_n>0 and b_n\in\ER for every n\ge 1, such that the sequence (X_n) defined by X_n=(\max(\xi_1,...,\xi_n)-b_n)/a_n converges in distribution to a non degenerated distribution. In this paper, we show that (X_n) can be viewed as an Euler scheme with decreasing step of an ergodic Markov process solution to a SDE with jumps and we derive a functional limit theorem for the sequence (X_n) from some methods used in the long time numerical approximation of ergodic SDE's.
