A result of R. Durrett, D. Iglehart and D. Miller states that Brownian meander is Brownian motion conditioned to stay positive for a unit of time, in the sense that it is the weak limit, as x goes to 0, of Brownian motion started at x>0 and conditioned to stay positive for a unit of time. We extend this limit theorem to the case of multidimensional Brownian motion conditioned to stay in a smooth convex cone.
