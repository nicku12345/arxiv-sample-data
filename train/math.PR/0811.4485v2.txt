We prove infinite-dimensional second order Poincar\'e inequalities on Wiener space, thus closing a circle of ideas linking limit theorems for functionals of Gaussian fields, Stein's method and Malliavin calculus. We provide two applications: (i) to a new "second order" characterization of CLTs on a fixed Wiener chaos, and (ii) to linear functionals of Gaussian-subordinated fields.
