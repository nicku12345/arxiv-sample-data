In this paper we analyze the performance of Warning Propagation, a popular message passing algorithm. We show that for 3CNF formulas drawn from a certain distribution over random satisfiable 3CNF formulas, commonly referred to as the planted-assignment distribution, running Warning Propagation in the standard way (run message passing until convergence, simplify the formula according to the resulting assignment, and satisfy the remaining subformula, if necessary, using a simple "off the shelf" heuristic) results in a satisfying assignment when the clause-variable ratio is a sufficiently large constant.
