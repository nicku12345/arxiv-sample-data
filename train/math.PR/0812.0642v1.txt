We establish an almost sure scaling limit theorem for super-Brownian motion on \mathbb{R}^d associated with the semi-linear equation u_t = {1/2}\Delta u +\beta u-\alpha u^2, where \alpha and \beta are positive constants. In this case, the spectral theoretical assumptions that required in Chen et al (2008) are not satisfied. An example is given to show that the main results also hold for some sub-domains in \mathbb{R}^d.
