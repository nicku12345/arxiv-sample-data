We consider the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise u_t={1/2}\Delta u+ u \diamond \dot{W} in \bR_{+} \times \bR^d, where \diamond denotes the Wick product, and the solution is interpreted in the mild sense. The noise \dot W is fractional in time (with Hurst index H \geq 1/2), and colored in space (with spatial covariance kernel f). We prove that if f is the Riesz kernel of order \alpha, or the Bessel kernel of order \alpha<d, then the sufficient condition for the existence of the solution is d \leq 2+\alpha (if H>1/2), respectively d<2+\alpha (if H=1/2), whereas if f is the heat kernel or the Poisson kernel, then the equation has a solution for any d. We give a representation of the k-th order moment of the solution, in terms of an exponential moment of the "convoluted weighted" intersection local time of k independent d-dimensional Brownian motions.
