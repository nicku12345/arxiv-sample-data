The method of \emph{random integral representation}, that is, the method of representing a given probability measure as the probability distribution of some random integral, was quite successful in the past few decades. In this note we will find such a representation for generalized s-selfdecomposable and selfdecomposable distributions that have the \emph{factorization property}. These are the classes \mathcal{U}^f_{\be} and L^f, respectively
