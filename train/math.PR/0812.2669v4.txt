We study models of discrete-time, symmetric, \Z^{d}-valued random walks in random environments, driven by a field of i.i.d. random nearest-neighbor conductances \omega_{xy}\in[0,1], with polynomial tail near 0 with exponent \gamma>0. We first prove for all d\geq5 that the return probability shows an anomalous decay (non-Gaussian) that approches (up to sub-polynomial terms) a random constant times n^{-2} when we push the power \gamma to zero. In contrast, we prove that the heat-kernel decay is as close as we want, in a logarithmic sense, to the standard decay n^{-d/2} for large values of the parameter \gamma.
