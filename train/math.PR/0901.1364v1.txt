We consider a totally asymmetric exclusion process on the positive half-line. When particles enter in the system according to a Poisson source, Liggett has computed all the limit distributions when the initial distribution has an asymptotic density. In this paper we consider systems for which particles enter at the boundary according to a complex mechanism depending on the current configuration in a finite neighborhood of the origin. For this kind of models, we prove a strong law of large numbers for the number of particles entered in the system at a given time. Our main tool is a new representation of the model as a multi-type particle system with infinitely many particle types.
