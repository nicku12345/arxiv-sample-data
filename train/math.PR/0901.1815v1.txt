We construct the entropic measure \mathbb{P}^\beta on compact manifolds of any dimension. It is defined as the push forward of the Dirichlet process (another random probability measure, well-known to exist on spaces of any dimension) under the {\em conjugation map} \Conj:\mathcal{P}(M)\to\mathcal{P}(M). This conjugation map is a continuous involution. It can be regarded as the canonical extension to higher dimensional spaces of a map between probability measures on 1-dimensional spaces characterized by the fact that the distribution functions of \mu and \Conj(\mu) are inverse to each other. We also present an heuristic interpretation of the entropic measure as d\mathbb{P}^\beta(\mu)=\frac{1}{Z}\exp(-\beta\cdot {Ent} (\mu|m))\cdot d\mathbb{P}^0(\mu).
