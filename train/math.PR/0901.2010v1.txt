This note is devoted to show how to push forward the algebraic integration setting in order to treat differential systems driven by a noisy input with H\"older regularity greater than 1/4. After recalling how to treat the case of ordinary stochastic differential equations, we mainly focus on the case of delay equations. A careful analysis is then performed in order to show that a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H>1/4 fulfills the assumptions of our abstract theorems.
