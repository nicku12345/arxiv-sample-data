This paper investigates weak convergence of U-statistics via approximation in probability. The classical condition that the second moment of the kernel of the underlying U-statistic exists is relaxed to having 4/3 moments only (modulo a logarithmic term). Furthermore, the conditional expectation of the kernel is only assumed to be in the domain of attraction of the normal law (instead of the classical two-moment condition).
