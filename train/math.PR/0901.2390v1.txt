In the paper we study dynamics of the arbitrage prices of credit default swaps within a hazard process model of credit risk. We derive these dynamics without postulating that the immersion property is satisfied between some relevant filtrations. These results are then applied so to study the problem of replication of general defaultable claims, including some basket claims, by means of dynamic trading of credit default swaps.
