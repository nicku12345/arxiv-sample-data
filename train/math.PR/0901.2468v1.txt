Let \mathbf{X}_1,...,\mathbf{X}_n be a random sample from a p-dimensional population distribution. Assume that c_1n^{\alpha}\leq p\leq c_2n^{\alpha} for some positive constants c_1,c_2 and \alpha. In this paper we introduce a new statistic for testing independence of the p-variates of the population and prove that the limiting distribution is the extreme distribution of type I with a rate of convergence O((\log n)^{5/2}/\sqrt{n}). This is much faster than O(1/\log n), a typical convergence rate for this type of extreme distribution. A simulation study and application to stochastic optimization are discussed.
