Let \xi be a Dawson--Watanabe superprocess in \mathbb{R}^d such that \xi_t is a.s. locally finite for every t\geq 0. Then for d\geq2 and fixed t>0, the singular random measure \xi_t can be a.s. approximated by suitably normalized restrictions of Lebesgue measure to the \varepsilon-neighborhoods of \operatorname {supp}\xi_t. When d\geq3, the local distributions of \xi_t near a hitting point can be approximated in total variation by those of a stationary and self-similar pseudo-random measure \tilde{\xi}. By contrast, the corresponding distributions for d=2 are locally invariant. Further results include improvements of some classical extinction criteria and some limiting properties of hitting probabilities. Our main proofs are based on a detailed analysis of the historical structure of \xi.
