Theory of Kingman's partition structures has two culminating points: the general paintbox representation, relating finite partitions to hypothetical infinite populations via a natural sampling procedure, known as Kingman's paintbox; a central example of the theory - the Ewens-Pitman two-parameter family of partitions.   In these notes we further develop the theory by passing to structures enriched by the order on the collection of categories; extending the class of tractable models by exploring the idea of regeneration; analysing regenerative properties of the Ewens-Pitman partitions; studying asymptotic features of the regenerative compositions.
