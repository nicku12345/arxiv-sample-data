Percolation is one of the simplest and nicest models in probability theory/statistical mechanics which exhibits critical phenomena. Dynamical percolation is a model where a simple time dynamics is added to the (ordinary) percolation model. This dynamical model exhibits very interesting behavior. Our goal in thissurvey is to give an overview of the work in dynamical percolation that has been done (and some of which is in the process of being written up).
