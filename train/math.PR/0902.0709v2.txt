The bead process is the particle system defined on parallel lines, with underlying measure giving constant weight to all configurations in which particles on neighbouring lines interlace, and zero weight otherwise. Motivated by the statistical mechanical model of the tiling of an abc-hexagon by three species of rhombi, a finitized version of the bead process is defined. The corresponding joint distribution can be realized as an eigenvalue probability density function for a sequence of random matrices. The finitized bead process is determinantal, and we give the correlation kernel in terms of Jacobi polynomials. Two scaling limits are considered: a global limit in which the spacing between lines goes to zero, and a certain bulk scaling limit. In the global limit the shape of the support of the particles is determined, while in the bulk scaling limit the bead process kernel of Boutillier is reclaimed, after approriate identification of the anisotropy parameter therein.
