We prove an isoperimetric inequality for probability measures \mu on \mathbb{R}^n with density proportional to \exp(-\phi(\lambda | x|)), where |x| is the euclidean norm on \mathbb{R}^n and \phi is a non-decreasing convex function. It applies in particular when \phi(x)=x^\alpha with \alpha\ge1. Under mild assumptions on \phi, the inequality is dimension-free if \lambda is chosen such that the covariance of \mu is the identity.
