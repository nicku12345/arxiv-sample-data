Consider a simple random walk on the integers with the following transition mechanism. At each site x, the probability of jumping to the right is \omega(x)\in[\frac12,1), until the first time the process jumps to the left from site x, from which time onward the probability of jumping to the right is \frac12. We investigate the transience/recurrence properties of this process in both deterministic and stationary, ergodic environments \{\omega(x)\}_{x\in Z}. In deterministic environments, we also study the speed of the process.
