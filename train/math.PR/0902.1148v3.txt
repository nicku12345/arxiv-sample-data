In this paper we develop a new weak convergence and compact embedding method to study the existence and uniqueness of the L_{\rho}^2({\mathbb{R}^{d}};{\mathbb{R}^{1}})\otimes L_{\rho}^2({\mathbb{R}^{d}};{\mathbb{R}^{d}}) valued solution of backward stochastic differential equations with p-growth coefficients. Then we establish the probabilistic representation of the weak solution of PDEs with p-growth coefficients via corresponding BSDEs.
