We continue our investigation on the transportation-information inequalities W_pI for a symmetric markov process, introduced and studied in \cite{GLWY}. We prove that W_pI implies the usual transportation inequalities W_pH, then the corresponding concentration inequalities for the invariant measure \mu. We give also a direct proof that the spectral gap in the space of Lipschitz functions for a diffusion process implies W_1I (a result due to \cite{GLWY}) and a Cheeger type's isoperimetric inequality. Finally we exhibit relations between transportation-information inequalities and a family of functional inequalities (such as \Phi-log Sobolev or \Phi-Sobolev).
