Statistically self-similar measures on [0,1] are limit of multiplicative cascades of random weights distributed on the b-adic subintervals of [0,1]. These weights are i.i.d, positive, and of expectation 1/b. We extend these cascades naturally by allowing the random weights to take negative values. This yields martingales taking values in the space of continuous functions on [0,1]. Specifically, we consider for each H\in (0,1) the martingale (B_{n})_{n\geq1} obtained when the weights take the values -b^{-H} and b^{-H}, in order to get B_n converging almost surely uniformly to a statistically self-similar function B whose H\"{o}lder regularity and fractal properties are comparable with that of the fractional Brownian motion of exponent H. This indeed holds when H\in(1/2,1). Also the construction introduces a new kind of law, one that it is stable under random weighted averaging and satisfies the same functional equation as the standard symmetric stable law of index 1/H. When H\in(0,1/2], to the contrary, B_n diverges almost surely. However, a natural normalization factor  a_n makes the normalized correlated random walk  B_n / a_n converge in law, as n tends to \infty, to the restriction to [0,1] of the standard Brownian motion. Limit theorems are also associated with the case H>1/2.
