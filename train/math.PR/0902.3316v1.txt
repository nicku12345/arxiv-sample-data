In this paper, we discuss the solvability of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with superquadratic generators. We first prove that given a superquadratic generator, there exists a bounded terminal value, such that the associated BSDE does not admit any bounded solution. On the other hand, we prove that if the superquadratic BSDE admits a bounded solution, then there exist infinitely many bounded solutions for this BSDE. Finally, we prove the existence of a solution for Markovian BSDEs where the terminal value is a bounded continuous function of a forward stochastic differential equation.
