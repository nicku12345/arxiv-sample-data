Fix a strictly positive measure W on the d-dimensional torus   \bb T^d. For an integer N\ge 1, denote by W^N_x, x=(x_1,   ..., x_d), 0\le x_i <N, the W-measure of the cube [x/N,   (x+\mb 1)/N), where \mb 1 is the vector with all components equal to 1. In dimension 1, we prove that the hydrodynamic behavior of a superposition of independent random walks, in which a particle jumps from x/N to one of its neighbors at rate (N W^N_x)^{-1}, is described in the diffusive scaling by the linear differential equation \partial_t \rho = (d/dW)(d/dx) \rho. In dimension d>1, if W is a finite discrete measure, W=\sum_{i\ge 1} w_i \delta_{x_i}, we prove that the random walk which jumps from x/N uniformly to one of its neighbors at rate (W^N_x)^{-1} has a metastable behavior, as defined in \cite{bl1}, described by the K-process introduced in \cite{fm1}.
