We prove a Central Limit Theorem for the empirical measure in the one-dimensional Totally Asymmetric Zero-Range Process in the hyperbolic scaling N, starting from the equilibrium measure \nu_{\rho}. We also show that when taking the direction of the characteristics, the limit density fluctuation field does not evolve in time until N^{4/3}, which implies the current across the characteristics to vanish in this longer time scale.
