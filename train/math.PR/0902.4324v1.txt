This note deals with existence and uniqueness of (variational) solutions to the following type of stochastic partial differential equations on a Hilbert space H dX(t) = A(t,X(t))dt + B(t,X(t))dW(t) + h(t) dG(t) where A and B are random nonlinear operators satisfying monotonicity conditions and G is an infinite dimensional Gaussian process adapted to the same filtration as the cylindrical Wiener pocess W(t), t >= 0.
