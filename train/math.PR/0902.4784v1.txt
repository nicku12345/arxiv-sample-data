Consider Z^f_t(u)=\int_0^{tu}f(N_s) ds, t>0, u\in[0,1], where N=(N_t)_{t\in\mathbb{R}} is a normal process and f is a measurable real-valued function satisfying Ef(N_0)^2<\infty and Ef(N_0)=0. If the dependence is sufficiently weak Hariz [J. Multivariate Anal. 80 (2002) 191--216] showed that Z_t^f/t^{1/2} converges in distribution to a multiple of standard Brownian motion as t\to\infty. If the dependence is sufficiently strong, then Z_t/(EZ_t(1)^2)^{1/2} converges in distribution to a higher order Hermite process as t\to\infty by a result by Taqqu [Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 50 (1979) 53--83]. When passing from weak to strong dependence, a unique situation encompassed by neither results is encountered. In this paper, we investigate this situation in detail and show that the limiting process is still a Brownian motion, but a nonstandard norming is required. We apply our result to some functionals of fractional Brownian motion which arise in time series. For all Hurst indices H\in(0,1), we give their limiting distributions. In this context, we show that the known results are only applicable to H<3/4 and H>3/4, respectively, whereas our result covers H=3/4.
