This paper proves a Berry--Esseen theorem for sample quantiles of strongly-mixing random variables under a polynomial mixing rate. The rate of normal approximation is shown to be O(n^{-1/2}) as n\to\infty, where n denotes the sample size. This result is in sharp contrast to the case of the sample mean of strongly-mixing random variables where the rate O(n^{-1/2}) is not known even under an exponential strong mixing rate. The main result of the paper has applications in finance and econometrics as financial time series data often are heavy-tailed and quantile based methods play an important role in various problems in finance, including hedging and risk management.
