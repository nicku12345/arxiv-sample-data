It is known, but perhaps not well-known, that when the mortality is assumed to be of Gompertz-Makeham-type, the expected remaining life-length and the commutation functions used for calculating the expected values of various types of life insurances can be expressed with an incomplete gamma function with a negative shape parameter. This is not of much use if ones software cannot calculate these values. The aim of this note is to show that one can express the commutation functions using only the exponential function, the (ordinary) gamma function and the gamma distribution function, which are all implemented in common statistical and spreadsheet software. This eliminates the need to evaluate the commutation functions and expected remaining life-length with numerical integration.
