A complete representation of the Martin boundary of killed random walks on the quadrant {\mathbb{N}}^*\times{\mathbb{N}}^* is obtained. It is proved that the corresponding full Martin compactification of the quadrant {\mathbb{N}}^*\times{\mathbb{N}}^* is homeomorphic to the closure of the set \{w={z}/{(1+|z|)}:z\in{\mathbb{N}}^*\times{\mathbb{N}}^*\} in {\mathbb{R}}^2. The method is based on a ratio limit theorem for local processes and large deviation techniques.
