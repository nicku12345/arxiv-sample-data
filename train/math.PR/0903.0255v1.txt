Let f(\cdot,t) be the probability density function which represents the solution of Kac's equation at time t, with initial data f_0, and let g_{\sigma} be the Gaussian density with zero mean and variance \sigma^2, \sigma^2 being the value of the second moment of f_0. This is the first study which proves that the total variation distance between f(\cdot,t) and g_{\sigma} goes to zero, as t\to +\infty, with an exponential rate equal to -1/4. In the present paper, this fact is proved on the sole assumption that f_0 has finite fourth moment and its Fourier transform \varphi_0 satisfies |\varphi_0(\xi)|=o(|\xi|^{-p}) as |\xi|\to+\infty, for some p>0. These hypotheses are definitely weaker than those considered so far in the state-of-the-art literature, which in any case, obtains less precise rates.
