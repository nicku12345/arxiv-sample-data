We extend the strong macroscopic stability introduced in Bramson & Mountford (2002) for one-dimensional asymmetric exclusion processes with finite range to a large class of one-dimensional conservative attractive models (including misanthrope process) for which we relax the requirement of finite range kernels. A key motivation is extension of constructive hydrodynamics result of Bahadoran et al. (2002, 2006, 2008) to nonfinite range kernels.
