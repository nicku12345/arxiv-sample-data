The occupation time of an age-dependent branching particle system in \Rd is considered, where the initial population is a Poisson random field and the particles are subject to symmetric \alpha-stable migration, critical binary branching and random lifetimes. Two regimes of lifetime distributions are considered: lifetimes with finite mean and lifetimes belonging to the normal domain of attraction of a \gamma-stable law, \gamma\in(0,1). It is shown that in dimensions d>\alpha\gamma for the heavy-tailed lifetimes case, and d>\alpha for finite mean lifetimes, the occupation time proccess satisfies a strong law of large numbers.
