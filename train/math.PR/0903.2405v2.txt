Let X be a one dimensional positive recurrent diffusion with initial distribution \nu and invariant probability \mu. Suppose that for some p> 1, \exists a\in\R such that \forall x\in\R, \E_x T_a^p<\infty and \E_\nu T_a^{p/2}<\infty, where T_a is the hitting time of a. For such a diffusion, we derive non asymptotic deviation bounds of the form \P_{\nu} (|\frac1t\int_0^tf(X_s)ds-\mu(f)|\geq\ge)\leq K(p)\frac1{t^{p/2}}\frac 1{\ge^p}A(f)^p. Here f bounded or bounded and compactly supported and A(f)=\|f\|_{\infty} when f is bounded and A(f)=\mu(|f|) when f is bounded and compactly supported.   We also give, under some conditions on the coefficients of X, a polynomial control of \E_xT_a^p from above and below. This control is based on a generalized Kac's formula (see theorem \ref{thm:mainKac}) for the moments \E_x f(T_a) of a differentiable function f.
