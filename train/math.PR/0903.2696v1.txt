We study a random walk in a random environment (RWRE) on \Z^d, 1 \leq d < +\infty. The main assumptions are that conditionned on the environment the random walk is reversible. Moreover we construct our environment in such a way that the walk can't be trapped on a single point like in some particular RWRE but in some specific d-1 surfaces. These surfaces are basic surfaces with deterministic geometry. We prove that the local time in the neighborhood of these surfaces is driven by a function of the (random) reversible measure. As an application we get the limit law of the local time as a process on these surfaces.
