We describe all countable particle systems on \mathbb{R} which have the following three properties: independence, Gaussianity and stationarity. More precisely, we consider particles on the real line starting at the points of a Poisson point process with intensity measure \mathfrak{m} and moving independently of each other according to the law of some Gaussian process \xi. We classify all pairs (\mathfrak{m},\xi) generating a stationary particle system, obtaining three families of examples. In the first, trivial family, the measure \mathfrak{m} is arbitrary, whereas the process \xi is stationary. In the second family, the measure \mathfrak{m} is a multiple of the Lebesgue measure, and \xi is essentially a Gaussian stationary increment process with linear drift. In the third, most interesting family, the measure \mathfrak{m} has a density of the form \alpha e^{-\lambda x}, where \alpha >0, \lambda\in\mathbb{R}, whereas the process \xi is of the form \xi(t)=W(t)-\lambda\sigma ^2(t)/2+c, where W is a zero-mean Gaussian process with stationary increments, \sigma ^2(t)=\operatorname {Var}W(t), and c\in\mathbb{R}.
