Let {X_1,...,X_n} be i.i.d. random observations. Let \mathbb{S}=\mathbb{L}+\mathbb{T} be a U-statistic of order k\ge2 where \mathbb{L} is a linear statistic having asymptotic normal distribution, and \mathbb{T} is a stochastically smaller statistic. We show that the rate of convergence to normality for \mathbb{S} can be simply expressed as the rate of convergence to normality for the linear part \mathbb{L} plus a correction term, (\operatorname {var}\mathbb{T})\ln^2(\operatorname {var}\mathbb{T}), under the condition {\mathbb{E}\mathbb{T}^2<\infty}. An optimal bound without this \log factor is obtained under a lower moment assumption {\mathbb {E}|\mathbb{T}|^{\alpha}<\infty} for {\alpha<2}. Some other related results are also obtained in the paper. Our results extend, refine and yield a number of related-known results in the literature.
