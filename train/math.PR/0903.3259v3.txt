This paper studies a closed queueing network containing a hub (a state dependent queueing system with service depending on the number of units residing here) and k satellite stations, which are GI/M/1 queueing systems. The number of units in the system, N, is assumed to be large. After service completion in the hub, a unit visits a satellite station j, 1\leq j\leq k, with probability p_j, and, after the service completion there, returns to the hub. The parameters of service times in the satellite stations and in the hub are proportional to \frac{1}{N}. One of the satellite stations is assumed to be a bottleneck station, while others are non-bottleneck. The paper establishes the continuity of the queue-length processes in non-bottleneck satellite stations of the network when the service times in the hub are close in certain sense (exactly defined in the paper) to the exponential distribution.
