Consider a random walk in a uniformly elliptic i.i.d. random environment in dimensions d\ge 2. In 2002, Sznitman introduced for each \gamma\in (0,1) the ballisticity conditions (T)_\gamma and (T'), the latter being defined as the fulfilment of (T)_\gamma for all \gamma\in (0,1). He proved that (T') implies ballisticity and that for each \gamma\in (0.5,1), (T)_\gamma is equivalent to (T'). It is conjectured that this equivalence holds for all \gamma\in (0,1). Here we prove that for \gamma\in (\gamma_d,1), where \gamma_d is a dimension dependent constant taking values in the interval (0.366,0.388), (T)_\gamma is equivalent to (T'). This is achieved by a detour along the effective criterion, the fulfilment of which we establish by a combination of techniques developed by Sznitman giving a control on the occurrence of atypical quenched exit distributions through boxes.
