We consider, in the continuous time version, \gamma independent random walks on \mathbb{Z_+} in random environment in the Sinai's regime. Let T_\gam be the first meeting time of one pair of the \gamma random walks starting at different positions. We first show that the tail of the quenched distribution of T_\gamma, after a suitable rescaling, converges in probability, to some functional of the Brownian motion. Then we compute the law of this functional. Eventually, we obtain results about the moments of this meeting time. Being \Eo the quenched expectation, we show that, for almost all environments \omega, \Eo[T_\gamma^{c}] is finite for c<\gamma(\gamma-1)/2 and infinite for c>\gamma(\gamma-1)/2.
