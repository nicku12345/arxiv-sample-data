We consider quenched and annealed Lyapunov exponents for the Green's function of -\Delta+\gamma V, where the potentials V(x), x\in\Z^d, are i.i.d. nonnegative random variables and \gamma>0 is a scalar. We present a probabilistic proof that both Lyapunov exponents scale like c\sqrt{\gamma} as \gamma tends to 0. Here the constant c is the same for the quenched as for the annealed exponent and is computed explicitly. This improves results obtained previously by Wei-Min Wang. We also consider other ways to send the potential to zero than multiplying it by a small number.
