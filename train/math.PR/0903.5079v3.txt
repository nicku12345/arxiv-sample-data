We study a single-flip dynamics for the monotone surface in (2+1) dimensions obtained from a boxed plane partition. The surface is analyzed as a system of non-intersecting simple paths. When the flips have a non-zero bias we prove that there is a positive spectral gap uniformly in the boundary conditions and in the size of the system. Under the same assumptions, for a system of size M, the mixing time is shown to be of order M up to logarithmic corrections.
