The theory of combinatorial game (like board games) and the theory of social games (where one looks for Nash equilibria) are normally considered as two separate theories. Here we shall see what comes out of combining the ideas. The central idea is Conway's observation that real numbers can be interpreted as special types of combinatorial games. Therefore the payoff function of a social game is a combinatorial game. Probability theory should be considered as a safety net that prevents inconsistent decisions via the Dutch Book Argument. This result can be extended to situations where the payoff function is a more general game than a real number. The main difference between number valued payoff and game valued payoff is that a probability distribution that gives non-negative mean payoff does not ensure that the game will be lost due to the existence of infinitisimal games. Also the Ramsay/de Finetti theorem on exchangable sequences is discussed.
