In this note we prove an existence and uniqueness result of solution for stochastic differential delay equations with hereditary drift driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H > 1/2. Then, we show that, when the delay goes to zero, the solutions to these equations converge, almost surely and in L^p, to the solution for the equation without delay. The stochastic integral with respect to the fractional Brownian motion is a pathwise Riemann-Stieltjes integral.
