We obtain pointwise ergodic theorems with rate under conditions expressed in terms of the convergence of series involving \|\sum_{k=1} ^nf\circ \theta^k\|_2, improving previous results. Then, using known results on martingale approximation, we obtain some LIL for stationary ergodic processes and quenched central limit theorems for functional of Markov chains. The proofs are based on the use of the spectral theorem and, on a recent work of Zhao-Woodroofe extending a method of Derriennic-Lin.
