Given two independent Poisson point processes \Phi^{(1)},\Phi^{(2)} in R^d, the continuum AB percolation model is the graph with points of \Phi^{(1)} as vertices and with edges between any pair of points for which the intersection of balls of radius 2r centred at these points contains at least one point of \Phi^{(2)}. This is a generalization of the AB percolation model on discrete lattices. We show the existence of percolation for all d > 1 and derive bounds for a critical intensity. We also provide a characterization for this critical intensity when d = 2. To study the connectivity problem, we consider independent Poisson point processes of intensities n and cn in the unit cube. The AB random geometric graph is defined as above but with balls of radius r. We derive a weak law result for the largest nearest neighbour distance and almost sure asymptotic bounds for the connectivity threshold.
