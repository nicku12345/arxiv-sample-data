We aim at finding the reversal of radial SLE and proving the reversibility of whole-plane SLE. For this purpose, we define annulus SLE(\kappa,\Lambda) processes in doubly connected domains with one marked boundary point. We derive some partial differential equation for \Lambda, which is sufficient for the annulus SLE(\kappa,\Lambda) process to satisfy commutation relation. If \Lambda satisfies this PDE, then using a coupling technique, we are able to construct a global commutation coupling of two annulus SLE(\kappa,\Lambda) processes. If more conditions are satisfied, the coupling exists in the degenerate case, which becomes a coupling of two whole-plane SLE_\kappa processes. The reversibility of whole-plane SLE_\kappa follows from this coupling together with the assumption that such annulus SLE(\kappa,\Lambda) trace ends at the marked point. We then conclude that the limit of such annulus SLE(\kappa,\Lambda) trace is the reversal of radial SLE_\kappa trace. In the end, we derive some particular solutions to the PDE for \Lambda.
