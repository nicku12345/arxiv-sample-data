The main focus of this work is the asymptotic behavior of mass-conservative homogeneous fragmentations. Considering the logarithm of masses makes the situation reminiscent of branching random walks. The standard approach is to study {\bf asymptotical} exponential rates. For fixed v > 0, either the number of fragments whose sizes at time t are of order \e^{-vt} is exponentially growing with rate C(v) > 0, i.e. the rate is effective, or the probability of presence of such fragments is exponentially decreasing with rate C(v) < 0, for some concave function C. In a recent paper, N. Krell considered fragments whose sizes decrease at {\bf exact} exponential rates, i.e. whose sizes are confined to be of order \e^{-vs} for every s \leq t. In that setting, she characterized the effective rates. In the present paper we continue this analysis and focus on probabilities of presence, using the spine method and a suitable martingale.
