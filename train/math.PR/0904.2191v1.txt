It is noticed that a certain transform of the Mittag-Leffler function Ea is completely monotone for a in [1,2]. Using the explicit expressions of its Bernstein density, an identity in law between suprema of completely asymmetric Levy a-stable processes. In the spectrally positive case, we retrieve the exact expression of a unilateral small deviation constant which had been previously obtained by a different method by Bernyk, Dalang and Peskir.
