Protein translocation in cells has been modelled by   \emph{Brownian ratchets}. In such models, the protein diffuses through a nanopore. On one side of the pore, ratcheting molecules bind to the protein and hinder it to diffuse out of the pore. We study a Brownian ratchet by means of a reflected Brownian motion (X_t)_{t\geq 0} with a changing reflection point (R_t)_{t\geq 0}. The rate of change of R_t is \gamma(X_t-R_t) and the new reflection boundary is distributed uniformly between R_{t-} and X_t. The asymptotic speed of the ratchet scales with \gamma^{1/3} and the asymptotic variance is independent of \gamma.
