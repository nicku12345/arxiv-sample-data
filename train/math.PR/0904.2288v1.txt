In the article titled "Branching-Coalescing Particle Systems" published in Probability Theory and Related Fields 131(3), pages 376-414, (2005), Theorem 7 as stated there is incorrect. Indeed, we show by counterexample that the equality that we claimed there to hold for all time, in general holds only for almost every time with respect to Lebesgue measure. We prove a weaker version of the theorem that is still sufficient for our applications in the mentioned paper.
