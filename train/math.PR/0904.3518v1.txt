We consider the system of stochastic differential equations dX_t=A(X_{t-}) dZ_t, where Z_t^1, ..., Z^d_t are independent one-dimensional symmetric stable processes of order \alpha, and the matrix-valued function A is bounded, continuous and everywhere non-degenerate. We show that bounded harmonic functions associated with X are Holder continuous, but a Harnack inequality need not hold. The Levy measure associated with the vector-valued process Z is highly singular.
