For the random eigenvalues with density corresponding to the Jacobi ensemble c \cdot \prod_{i < j} | \lambda_i - \lambda_j |^\beta \prod^n_{i=1} (2 - \lambda_i)^a (2 + \lambda_i)^b I_{(-2,2)} (\lambda_i)  (a, b > -1, \beta > 0)  a strong uniform approximation by the roots of the Jacobi polynomials is derived if the parameters a, b, \beta depend on n and n \to \infty. Roughly speaking, the eigenvalues can be uniformly approximated by roots of Jacobi polynomials with parameters ((2a+2)/\beta -1, (2b+2)/\beta-1), where the error is of order \{\log n/(a+b) \}^{1/4}. These results are used to investigate the asymptotic properties of the corresponding spectral distribution if n \to \infty and the parameters a, b and \beta vary with n. We also discuss further applications in the context of multivariate random F-matrices.
