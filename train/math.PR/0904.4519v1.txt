We give a very simple and elementary proof of the existence of a weakly compact family of probability measures \{P_{\theta}:\theta \in \Theta \} to represent an important sublinear expectation--G-expectation \mathbb{E}[\cdot]. We also give a concrete approximation of a bounded continuous function X(\omega) by an increasing sequence of cylinder functions L_{ip}(\Omega) in order to prove that C_{b}(\Omega) belongs to the \mathbb{E}[|\cdot|]-completion of the L_{ip}(\Omega).
