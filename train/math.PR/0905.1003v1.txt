For the symbiotic branching model introduced by Etheridge/Fleischmann (2004), it is shown that aging and intermittency exhibit different behaviour for negative, zero, and positive correlations. Our approach also provides an alternative, elementary proof and refinements of classical results concerning second moments of the parabolic Anderson model with Brownian potential. Some refinements to more general (also infinite range) kernels of recent aging results of Dembo/Deuschel (2007) for interacting diffusions are given.
