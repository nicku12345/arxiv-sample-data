Let E=((e_{ij}))_{n\times n} be a fixed array of real numbers such that e_{ij}=e_{ji}, e_{ii}=0 for 1\le i,j \le n. Let the permutation group be denoted by S_n and the collection of involutions with no fixed points by \Pi_n, that is, \Pi_n=\{\pi\in S_n: \pi^2= id, \pi(i)\neq i\,\forall i\} with id denoting the identity permutation. For \pi uniformly chosen from \Pi_n, let Y_E=\sum_{i=1}^n e_{i\pi(i)} and W=(Y_E-\mu_E)/\sigma_E where \mu_E=E(Y_E) and \sigma_E^2= Var(Y_E). Denoting by F_W and \Phi the distribution functions of W and a \mathcal{N}(0,1) variate respectively, we bound ||F_W-\Phi||_p for  1\le p\le \infty using Stein's method and the zero bias transformation. Optimal Berry-Esseen or L^\infty bounds for the classical problem where \pi is chosen uniformly from S_n were obtained by Bolthausen using Stein's method. Although in our case \pi \in \Pi_n uniformly, the L^p bounds we obtain are of similar form as Bolthausen's bound which holds for p=\infty. The difficulty in extending Bolthausen's method from S_n to \Pi_n arising due to the involution restriction is tackled by the use of zero bias transformations.
