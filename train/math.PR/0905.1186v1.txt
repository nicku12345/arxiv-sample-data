For a family of random walks \{S^{(a)}\} satisfying \mathbf{E}S_1^{(a)}=-a<0 we consider ladder epochs \tau^{(a)}=\min\{k\geq1: S_k^{(a)}<0\}. We study the asymptotic, as a\to0, behaviour of \mathbf{P}(\tau^{(a)}>n) in the case when n=n(a)\to\infty. As a consequence we obtain also the growth rates of the moments of \tau^{(a)}.
