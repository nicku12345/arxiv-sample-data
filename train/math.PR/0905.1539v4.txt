We show that the classical Kac's random walk on (n-1)-sphere S^{n-1} starting from the point mass at e_1 mixes in \mathcal{O}(n^5(\log n)^3) steps in total variation distance. The main argument uses a truncation of the running density after a burn-in period, followed by \mathcal{L}^2 convergence using the spectral gap information derived by other authors. This improves upon a previous bound by Diaconis and Saloff-Coste of order \mathcal {O}(n^{2n}).
