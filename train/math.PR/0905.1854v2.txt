A LDP is proved for the inviscid shell model of turbulence. As the viscosity coefficient converges to 0 and the noise intensity is multiplied by the square root of the viscosity, we prove that some shell models of turbulence with a multiplicative stochastic perturbation driven by a H-valued Brownian motion satisfy a LDP in C([0,T],V) for the topology of uniform convergence on [0,T], but where V is endowed with a topology weaker than the natural one. The initial condition has to belong to V and the proof is based on the weak convergence of a family of stochastic control equations. The rate function is described in terms of the solution to the inviscid equation.
