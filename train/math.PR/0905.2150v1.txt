In this article, we consider the stochastic heat equation du=(\Delta u+f(t,x))dt+ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} g^{k}(t,x) \delta \beta_t^k, t \in [0,T], with random coefficients f and g^k, driven by a sequence (\beta^k)_k of i.i.d. fractional Brownian motions of index H>1/2. Using the Malliavin calculus techniques and a p-th moment maximal inequality for the infinite sum of Skorohod integrals with respect to (\beta^k)_k, we prove that the equation has a unique solution (in a Banach space of summability exponent p \geq 2), and this solution is H\"older continuous in both time and space.
