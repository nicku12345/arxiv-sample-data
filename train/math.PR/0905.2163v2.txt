In this paper we consider an additive functional of an observable V(x) of a Markov jump process. We assume that the law of the expected jump time t(x) under the invariant probability measure \pi of the skeleton chain belongs to the domain of attraction of a subordinator. Then, the scaled limit of the functional is a Mittag-Leffler proces, provided that \Psi(x):=V(x)t(x) is square integrable w.r.t. \pi. When the law of \Psi(x) belongs to a domain of attraction of a stable law the resulting process can be described by a composition of a stable process and the inverse of a subordinator and these processes are not necessarily independent. On the other hand when the singularities of \Psi(x) and t(x) do not overlap with large probability the law of the resulting process has some scaling invariance property. We provide an application of the results to a process that arises in quantum transport theory.
