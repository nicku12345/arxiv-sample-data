We work out the expression of the generalized Bessel function of type B in the two-rank case. This is done using Dijskma and Koornwinder's product formula for Jacobi polynomials and the obtained expression is given by multiple integrals involving only a normalized modified Bessel function and two symmetric Beta distributions. We think of that expression as the major step toward the explicit expression of the Dunkl's intertwining V operator reflections-invariant functions. Finally, we give in the same setting an explicit formula for the action of V on a product of a power of the norm and a spherical harmonic. The obtained formula extends to all dihedral systems and it improves the one derived by Y.Xu.
