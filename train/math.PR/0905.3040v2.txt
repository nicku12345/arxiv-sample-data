We consider the Glauber dynamics for the 2D Ising model in a box of side L, at inverse temperature \beta and random boundary conditions \tau whose distribution P either stochastically dominates the extremal plus phase (hence the quotation marks in the title) or is stochastically dominated by the extremal minus phase. A particular case is when P is concentrated on the homogeneous configuration identically equal to + (equal to -). For \beta large enough we show that for any \epsilon there exists c=c(\beta,\epsilon) such that the corresponding mixing time T_{mix} satisfies \lim_{L\to\infty}P(T_{mix}> \exp({cL^\epsilon})) =0. In the non-random case \tau\equiv + (or \tau\equiv -), this implies that T_{mix}< \exp({cL^\epsilon}). The same bound holds when the boundary conditions are all + on three sides and all - on the remaining one. The result, although still very far from the expected Lifshitz behaviour T_{mix}=O(L^2), considerably improves upon the previous known estimates of the form T_{mix}\le \exp({c L^{1/2 + \epsilon}}). The techniques are based on induction over length scales, combined with a judicious use of the so-called "censoring inequality" of Y. Peres and P. Winkler, which in a sense allows us to guide the dynamics to its equilibrium measure.
