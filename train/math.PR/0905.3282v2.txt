We prove that for a finite collection of real-valued functions f_{1},...,f_{n} on the group of complex numbers of modulus 1 which are derivable with Lipschitz continuous derivative, the distribution of (\tr f_{1},...,\tr f_{n}) under the properly scaled heat kernel measure at a given time on the unitary group \U(N) has Gaussian fluctuations as N tends to infinity, with a covariance for which we give a formula and which is of order N^{-1}. In the limit where the time tends to infinity, we prove that this covariance converges to that obtained by P. Diaconis and S. Evans in a previous work on uniformly distributed unitary matrices. Finally, we discuss some combinatorial aspects of our results.
