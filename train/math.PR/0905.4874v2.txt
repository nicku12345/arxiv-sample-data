The aim of this paper is to give a precise estimate on the tail probability of the visibility function in a germ-grain model: this function is defined as the length of the longest ray starting at the origin that does not intersect an obstacle in a Boolean model. We proceed in two or more dimensions using coverage techniques. Moreover, convergence results involving a type I extreme value distribution are shown in the two particular cases of small obstacles or a large obstacle-free region.
