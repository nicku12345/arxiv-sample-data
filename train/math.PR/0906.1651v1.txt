Brascamp--Lieb-type, weighted Poincar\'{e}-type and related analytic inequalities are studied for multidimensional Cauchy distributions and more general \kappa-concave probability measures (in the hierarchy of convex measures). In analogy with the limiting (infinite-dimensional log-concave) Gaussian model, the weighted inequalities fully describe the measure concentration and large deviation properties of this family of measures. Cheeger-type isoperimetric inequalities are investigated similarly, giving rise to a common weight in the class of concave probability measures under consideration.
