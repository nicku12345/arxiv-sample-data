Let X^1, ..., X^k and Y^1, ..., Y^m be jointly independent copies of random variables X and Y, respectively. For a fixed total number n of random variables, we aim at maximising M(k,m):= E \max \{X^1, ..., X^k, Y^1, >..., Y^{m} \} in k = n-m\ge 0, which corresponds to maximising the expected lifetime of an n-component parallel system whose components can be chosen from two different types. We show that the lattice \{M(k,m): k, m\ge 0\} is concave, give sufficient conditions on X and Y for M(n,0) to be always or ultimately maximal and derive a bound on the number of sign changes in the sequence M(n,0)-M(0,n), n\ge 1. The results are applied to a mixed population of Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes, with the objective to derive the optimal initial composition to maximise the expected time to extinction.
