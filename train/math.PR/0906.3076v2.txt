We establish a version of the Feynman-Kac formula for the multidimensional stochastic heat equation with a multiplicative fractional Brownian sheet. We use the techniques of Malliavin calculus to prove that the process defined by the Feynman-Kac formula is a weak solution of the stochastic heat equation. From the Feynman-Kac formula, we establish the smoothness of the density of the solution and the H\"{o}lder regularity in the space and time variables. We also derive a Feynman-Kac formula for the stochastic heat equation in the Skorokhod sense and we obtain the Wiener chaos expansion of the solution.
