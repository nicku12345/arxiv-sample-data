Let X be a Poisson point process and K\subset\mathbb{R}^d a measurable set. Construct the Voronoi cells of all points x\in X with respect to X, and denote by v_X(K) the union of all Voronoi cells with nucleus in K. For K a compact convex set the expectation of the volume difference V(v_X(K))-V(K) and the symmetric difference V(v_X(K)\triangle K) is computed. Precise estimates for the variance of both quantities are obtained which follow from a new jackknife inequality for the variance of functionals of a Poisson point process. Concentration inequalities for both quantities are proved using Azuma's inequality.
