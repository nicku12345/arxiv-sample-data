Let \{D(s), s \geq 0 \} be a L\'evy subordinator, that is, a non-decreasing process with stationary and independent increments and suppose that D(0) = 0. We study the first-hitting time of the process D, namely, the process E(t) = \inf \{s: D(s) > t \}, t \geq 0.   The process E is, in general, non-Markovian with non-stationary and non-independent increments. We derive a partial differential equation for the Laplace transform of the n-time tail distribution function P[E(t_1) > s_1,...,E(t_n) > s_n], and show that this PDE has a unique solution given natural boundary conditions. This PDE can be used to derive all n-time moments of the process E.
