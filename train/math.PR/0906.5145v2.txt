Let X_1,\...,X_n be independent with zero means, finite variances \sigma_1^2,\...,\sigma_n^2 and finite absolute third moments. Let F_n be the distribution function of (X_1+\...+X_n)/\sigma, where \sigma^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\sigma_i^2, and \Phi that of the standard normal. The L^1-distance between F_n and \Phi then satisfies \[\Vert F_n-\Phi\Vert_1\le\frac{1}{\sigma^3}\sum_{i=1}^nE|X_i|^3.\] In particular, when X_1,\...,X_n are identically distributed with variance \sigma^2, we have \[\Vert F_n-\Phi\Vert_1\le\frac{E|X_1|^3}{\sigma^3\sqrt{n}}\qquad for all n\in\mathbb{N},\] corresponding to an L^1-Berry--Esseen constant of 1.
