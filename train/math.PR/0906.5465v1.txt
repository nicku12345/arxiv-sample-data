The limit behavior is studied for the distributions of normalized U- and V-statistics of an arbitrary order with canonical (degenerate) kernels, based on samples of increasing sizes from a stationary sequence of observations satisfying classical mixing conditions. The corresponding limit distributions are represented as infinite multilinear forms of a centered Gaussian sequence with a known covariance matrix.
