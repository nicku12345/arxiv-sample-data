Hoeffding-type exponential inequalities are obtained for the distribution tails of canonical von Mises' statistics of arbitrary order based on samples from a stationary sequence of random variables satisfying the {\varphi}-mixing condition.   The present paper weakens the restrictions on the coefficient {\varphi}() which are contained in the paper "Exponential inequalities for the distributions of canonical U- and V-statistics of dependent observations" by Borisov and Volodko (2009). At the same time, we correct the corresponding proof in this paper.
