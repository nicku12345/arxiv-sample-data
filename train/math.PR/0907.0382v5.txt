In this note we prove that the local martingale part of a convex function f of a d-dimensional semimartingale X = M + A can be written in terms of an It^o stochastic integral \int H(X)dM, where H(x) is some particular measurable choice of subgradient of f at x, and M is the martingale part of X. This result was first proved by Bouleau in [2]. Here we present a new treatment of the problem. We first prove the result for X' = X + eB, e > 0, where B is a standard Brownian motion, and then pass to the limit as e tends to 0, using results in [1] and [4].
