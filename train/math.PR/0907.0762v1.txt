Let X be a regular linear continuous positively recurrent Markov process with state space \R, scale function S and speed measure m. For a\in \R denote B^+_a&=\sup_{x\geq a} \m(]x,+\infty[)(S(x)-S(a)) B^-_a&=\sup_{x\leq a} \m(]-\infty;x[)(S(a)-S(x)) We study some characteristic relations between B^+_a, B^-_a, the exponential moments of the hitting times T_a of X, the Hardy and Poincar\'e inequalities for the Dirichlet form associated with X. As a corollary, we establish the equivalence between the existence of exponential moments of the hitting times and the spectral gap of the generator of X.
