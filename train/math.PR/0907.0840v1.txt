We work out some relations between duality and intertwining in the context of discrete Markov chains, fixing up the background of previous relations first established for birth and death chains and their Siegmund duals. In view of the results, the monotone properties resulting from the Siegmund dual of birth and death chains are revisited in some detail, with emphasis on the non neutral Moran model. We also introduce an ultrametric type dual extending the Siegmund kernel. Finally we discuss the sharp dual, following closely the Diaconis-Fill study.
