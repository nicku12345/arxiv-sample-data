In this Note we consider a quadratic backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) driven by a continuous martingale M and whose generator is a deterministic function. We prove (in Theorem \ref{theorem:main}) that if M is a strong homogeneous Markov process and if the BSDE has the form \eqref{BSDE} then the unique solution (Y,Z,N) of the BSDE is reduced to (Y,Z), \textit{i.e.} the orthogonal martingale N is equal to zero showing that in a Markovian setting the "usual" solution (Y,Z) has not to be completed by a strongly orthogonal even if M does not enjoy the martingale representation property.
