We further study the interfaces arising in a situation of inhomogeneity. More precisely, we identify a characteristic length for the gradient percolation model, that enables us to tighten previous estimates established for it. This allows to construct non-trivial scaling limits: the limiting objects share some properties with critical percolation interfaces, but locally, they rather behave like off-critical percolation interfaces.
