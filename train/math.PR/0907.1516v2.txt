French environmental laws require industrialists to include probability criteria in risk assessments, especially to define confidence levels for risk management measures. This paper presents the failure probabilities as efficient indicators for technical safety barrier performances. Generic formulas are proposed to evaluate these probabilities, including failure rate, barrier architecture, full and partial proof tests. In many cases, these results can be directly used to assess safety barrier confidence levels.
