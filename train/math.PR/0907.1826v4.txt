In this paper we study asymptotic behaviour of a growth process generated by a semi-deterministic variant of cooperative sequential adsorption model (CSA). This model can also be viewed as a particular queueing system with local interactions. We show that quite limited randomness of the model still generates a rich collection of possible limiting behaviours.
