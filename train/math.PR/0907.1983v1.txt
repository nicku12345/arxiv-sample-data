In this paper, our goal is solving backward doubly stochastic differential equation (BDSDE for short) under weak assumptions on the data. The first part of the paper is devoted to the development of some new technical aspects of stochastic calculus related to BDSDEs. Then we derive a priori estimates and prove existence and uniqueness of solutions, extending the results of Pardoux and Peng \cite{PP1} to the case where the solution is taked in L^{p}, p>1 and the monotonicity conditions are satisfied. This study is limited to deterministic terminal time.
