We study a discrete-time approximation for solutions of systems of decoupled forward-backward doubly stochastic differential equations (FBDSDEs). Assuming that the coefficients are Lipschitz-continuous, we prove the convergence of the scheme when the step of time discretization, |\pi| goes to zero. The rate of convergence is exactly equal to |\pi|^{1/2}. The proof is based on a generalization of a remarkable result on the ^{2}-regularity of the solution of the backward equation derived by J.
