We consider the Markov chain \{X_n^x\}_{n=0}^\infty on \R^d defined by the stochastic recursion X_{n}^{x}=\p_{\theta_{n}}(X_{n-1}^{x}), starting at x\in\R^d, where \theta_{1}, \theta_{2},... are i.i.d. random variables taking their values in a metric space (\Theta, \mathfrak{r}), and \p_{\theta_{n}}:\R^d\mapsto\R^d are Lipschitz maps. Assume that the Markov chain has a unique stationary measure \nu. Under appropriate assumptions on \p_{\theta_n}, we will show that the measure \nu has a heavy tail with the exponent \alpha>0 i.e. \nu(\{x\in\R^d: |x|>t\})\asymp t^{-\alpha}. Using this result we show that properly normalized Birkhoff sums S_n^x=\sum_{k=1}^n X_k^x, converge in law to an \alpha--stable law for \alpha\in(0, 2].
