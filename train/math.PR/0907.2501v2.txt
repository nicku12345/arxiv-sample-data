We study when a given Gaussian random variable on a given probability space (\Omega, {\cal{F}}, P)  is equal almost surely to \beta_{1} where \beta  is a Brownian motion defined on the same (or possibly extended) probability space. As a consequences of this result, we prove that the distribution of a random variable (satisfying in addition a certain property) in a finite sum of Wiener chaoses cannot be normal. This result also allows to understand better some characterization of the Gaussian variables obtained via Malliavin calculus.
