Let \{L^{x}_{t} ; (x,t)\in R^{1}\times R^{1}_{+}\} denote the local time of Brownian motion. Our main result is to show that for each fixed t {\int (L^{x+h}_t- L^x_t)^3 dx-12h\int (L^{x+h}_t - L^x_t)L^x_t dx-24h^{2}t\over h^2} \stackrel{\mathcal{L}}{\Longrightarrow}\sqrt{192}(\int (L^x_t)^3dx)^{1/2}\eta as h\to 0, where \eta is a normal random variable with mean zero and variance one that is independent of L^{x}_{t}. This generalizes our previous result for the second moment. We also explain why our approach will not work for higher moments
