In this note, we take up the study of weak convergence for stochastic differential equations driven by a (Liouville) fractional Brownian motion B with Hurst parameter H\in(1/3,1/2). In the current paper, we approximate the d-dimensional fBm by the convolution of a rescaled random walk with Liouville's kernel. We then show that the corresponding differential equation converges in law to a fractional SDE driven by B.
