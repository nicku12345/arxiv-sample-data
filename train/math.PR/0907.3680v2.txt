We consider a system of independent one-dimensional random walks in a common random environment under the condition that the random walks are transient with positive speed v_P. We give upper bounds on the quenched probability that at least one of the random walks started in the interval [An, Bn] has traveled a distance of less than (v_P - \epsilon)n. This leads to both a uniform law of large numbers and a hydrodynamic limit. We also identify a family of distributions on the configuration of particles (parameterized by particle density) which are stationary under the (quenched) dynamics of the random walks and show that these are the limiting distributions for the system when started from a certain natural collection of distributions.
