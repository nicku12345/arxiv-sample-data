For a class of density functions q^n(x^n) on \Bbb R^n we prove an inequality between relative entropy and the sum of average conditional relative entropies of the following form: For any density function p^n(x^n) on \Bbb R^n, D(p^n||q^n)\leq Const. \sum_{i=1}^n \Bbb E D(p_i(\cdot|Y_1,..., Y_{i-1},Y_{i+1},..., Y_n) || Q_i(\cdot|Y_1,..., Y_{i-1},Y_{i+1},..., Y_n)), where p_i(\cdot|y_1,..., y_{i-1},y_{i+1},..., y_n) and Q_i(\cdot|x_1,..., x_{i-1},x_{i+1},..., x_n) denote the local specifications for p^n resp. q^n, i.e., the conditional density functions of the i'th coordinate, given the other coordinates. The constant depends on the properties of the local specifications of q^n. The above inequality implies a logarithmic Sobolev inequality for q^n. We get an explicit lower bound for the logarithmic Sobolev constant of q^n under the assumptions that: (i) the local specifications of q^n satisfy logarithmic Sobolev inequalities with constants \rho_i, and (ii) they also satisfy some condition expressing that the mixed partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian of q^n are not too large relative to the logarithmic Sobolev constants \rho_i. Condition (ii) may be weaker than that used in Otto and Reznikoff's recent paper on the estimation of logarithmic Sobolev constants of spin systems.
