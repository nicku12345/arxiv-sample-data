We study models of continuous-time, symmetric, \Z^{d}-valued random walks in random environments, driven by a field of i.i.d. random nearest-neighbor conductances \omega_{xy}\in[0,1] with a power law with an exponent \gamma near 0. We are interested in estimating the quenched decay of the return probability P_\omega^{t}(0,0), as t tends to +\infty. We show that for \gamma> \frac{d}{2}, the standard bound turns out to be of the correct logarithmic order. As an expected concequence, the same result holds for the discrete-time case.
