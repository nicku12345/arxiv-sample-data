We consider the standard first passage percolation model in the rescaled graph \mathbb {Z}^d/n for d\geq2 and a domain \Omega of boundary \Gamma in \mathbb {R}^d. Let \Gamma ^1 and \Gamma ^2 be two disjoint open subsets of \Gamma representing the parts of \Gamma through which some water can enter and escape from \Omega. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the flow \phi_n through a discrete version \Omega_n of \Omega between the corresponding discrete sets \Gamma ^1_n and \Gamma ^2_n. We prove that under some conditions on the regularity of the domain and on the law of the capacity of the edges, the upper large deviations of \phi_n/n^{d-1} above a certain constant are of volume order, that is, decays exponentially fast with n^d. This article is part of a larger project in which the authors prove that this constant is the a.s. limit of \phi_n/n^{d-1}.
