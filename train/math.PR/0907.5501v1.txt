We consider the standard first passage percolation model in the rescaled graph \mathbb{Z}^d/n for d\geq 2, and a domain \Omega of boundary \Gamma in \mathbb{R}^d. Let \Gamma^1 and \Gamma^2 be two disjoint open subsets of \Gamma, representing the parts of \Gamma through which some water can enter and escape from \Omega. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the flow \phi_n through a discrete version \Omega_n of \Omega between the corresponding discrete sets \Gamma^1_n and \Gamma^2_n. We prove that under some conditions on the regularity of the domain and on the law of the capacity of the edges, the lower large deviations of \phi_n/ n^{d-1} below a certain constant are of surface order.
