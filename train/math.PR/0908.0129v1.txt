A stochastic system of particles is considered in which the sizes of the particles increase by successive binary mergers with the constraint that each coagulation event involves a particle with minimal size. Convergence of a suitably renormalised version of this process to a deterministic hydrodynamical limit is shown and the time evolution of the minimal size is studied for both deterministic and stochastic models.
