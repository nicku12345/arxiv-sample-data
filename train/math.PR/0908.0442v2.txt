Optimal transport from the volume measure to a convex combination of Dirac measures yields a tessellation of a Riemannian manifold into pieces of arbitrary relative size. This tessellation is studied for the cost functions c_p(z,y)=\frac{1}{p}d^p(z,y) and 1\leq p<\infty. Geometric descriptions of the tessellations for all p is obtained for compact subsets of the Euclidean space. For p=2 this approach yields Laguerre tessellations. For p=1 it induces Johnson Mehl diagrams for all compact Riemannian manifolds.
