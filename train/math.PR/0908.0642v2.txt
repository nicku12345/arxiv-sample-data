In this text we study, for positive random variables, the relation between the behaviour of the Laplace transform near infinity and the distribution near zero. A result of De Bruijn shows that E(e^{-\lambda X}) \sim \exp(r\lambda^\alpha) for \lambda\to\infty and P(X\leq\epsilon) \sim \exp(s/\epsilon^\beta) for \epsilon\downarrow0 are in some sense equivalent (for 1/\alpha = 1/\beta + 1) and gives a relation between the constants r and s. We illustrate how this result can be used to obtain simple large deviation results. For use in more complex situations we also give a generalisation of De Bruijn's result to the case when the upper and lower limits are different from each other.
