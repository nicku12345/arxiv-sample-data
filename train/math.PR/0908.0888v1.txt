The theory of L^2-spectral gaps for reversible Markov chains has been studied by many authors. In this paper we consider positive recurrent general state space Markov chains with stationary transition probabilities. Replacing the assumption of reversibility by a less strong one, we still obtain a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the spectral gap property of the associated Markov operator in terms of isoperimetric constant. Moreover, we define a new sequence of isoperimetric constants which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a spectral gap in a very general setting. Finally, these results are used to obtain simple sufficient conditions for the existence of a spectral gap in terms of the first and second order transition probabilities.
