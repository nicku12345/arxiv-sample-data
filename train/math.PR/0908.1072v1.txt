We deal with random processes obtained from a homogeneous random process with independent increments by replacement of the time scale and by multiplication by a norming constant. We prove the convergence in distribution of these processes to Wiener process in Skorokhod space endowed by the topology of uniform convergence. An integral type almost sure version of this theorem is obtained.
