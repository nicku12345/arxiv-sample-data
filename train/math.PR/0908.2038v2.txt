The problem of constructing an optimal co-adapted coupling for a pair of symmetric random walks on Z_2^d was considered by Connor and Jacka (2008), and the existence of a coupling which is stochastically fastest in the class of all such co-adapted couplings was demonstrated. In this paper we show how to generalise this construction to an optimal co-adapted coupling for the continuous-time symmetric random walk on K_n^d, where K_n is the complete graph with n vertices. Moreover, we show that although this coupling is not maximal for any n (i.e. it does not achieve equality in the coupling inequality), it does tend to a maximal coupling as n\to\infty.
