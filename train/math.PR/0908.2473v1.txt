The purpose of this note is to prove a central limit theorem for the L^2-modulus of continuity of the Brownian local time obtained in \cite{CLMR}, using techniques of stochastic analysis. The main ingredients of the proof are an asymptotic version of Knight's theorem and the Clark-Ocone formula for the L^2-modulus of the Brownian local time.
