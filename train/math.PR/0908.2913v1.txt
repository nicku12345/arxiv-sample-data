In this paper we propose a framework that enables the study of large deviations for point processes based on stationary sequences with regularly varying tails. This framework allows us to keep track not of the magnitude of the extreme values of a process, but also of the order in which these extreme values appear. Particular emphasis is put on (infinite) linear processes with random coefficients. The proposed framework provide a rather complete description of the joint asymptotic behavior of the large values of the stationary sequence. We apply the general result on large deviations for point processes to derive the asymptotic decay of partial sum processes as well as ruin probabilities.
