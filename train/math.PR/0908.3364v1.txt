We consider stochastic equations of the prototype du(t,x) =(\Delta u(t,x)+u(t,x)^{1+\beta})dt+\kappa u(t,x) dW_{t} on a smooth domain D\subset \mathord{\rm I\mkern-3.6mu R\:}^d, with Dirichlet boundary condition, where \beta, \kappa are positive constants and \{W_t , t\ge0\} is a one-dimensional standard Wiener process. We estimate the probability of finite time blowup of positive solutions, as well as the probability of existence of non-trivial positive global solutions.
