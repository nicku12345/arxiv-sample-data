By the method of coupling and Girsanov transformation, Harnack inequalities [F.-Y. Wang, 1997] and strong Feller property are proved for the transition semigroup associated with the multivalued stochastic evolution equation on a Gelfand triple. The concentration property of the invariant measure for the semigroup is investigated. As applications of Harnack inequalities, explicit upper bounds of the L^p-norm of the density, contractivity, compactness and entropy-cost inequality for the semigroup are also presented.
