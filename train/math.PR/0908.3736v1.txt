Let X be a n-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, solution of the S.D.E. \d X_t = AX_t \d t + \d B_t where A is a real n\times n matrix and B a L\'evy process without Gaussian part. We show that when A is non-singular, the law of X_1 is absolutely continuous in \r^n if and only if the jumping measure of B fulfils a certain geometric condition with respect to A, which we call the exhaustion property. This optimal criterion is much weaker than for the background driving L\'evy process B, which might be very singular and sometimes even have a one-dimensional discrete jumping measure. It also solves a difficult problem for a certain class of multivariate Non-Gaussian infinitely divisible distributions.
