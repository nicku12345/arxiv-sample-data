Let P_n be the n-step right product A_1\cdots A_n, where A_1,A_2,\dots is a given infinite sequence of d\times d matrices with nonnegative entries. In a wide range of situations, the normalized matrix product P_n/{\Vert P_n\Vert} does not converge and we shall be rather interested in the asymptotic behavior of the normalized columns P_nU_i/\Vert P_nU_i\Vert, where U_1,\dots,U_d are the canonical d\times 1 vectors. Our main result in Theorem~A gives a sufficient condition {\bf (C)} over the sequence A_1,A_2,\dots ensuring the existence of {\it dominant columns} of P_n, having the same projective limit V: more precisely, for any rank n, there exists a partition of \{1,\dots,d\} made of two subsets J_n\ne\emptyset and J_n^c such that each one of the sequences of normalized columns, say P_nU_{j_n}/\Vert P_nU_{j_n}\Vert with j_n\in J_n tends to V as n tends to +\infty and are {\it dominant} in the sense that the ratio \Vert P_nU_{j_n'}/\Vert P_nU_{j_n}\Vert tends to 0, as soon as j_n'\in J_n^c. The existence of sequences of such {\it dominant columns} implies that for any probability vector X with positive entries, the probability vector P_nX/\Vert P_nX\Vert, converges as n tends to +\infty. Our main application of Theorem~A (and our initial motivation) is related to an {\it Erd\H os problem} concerned with a family of probability measures \mu_\beta (for 1<\beta<2 a real parameter) fully supported by a subinterval of the real line, known as {\it Bernoulli convolutions}.
