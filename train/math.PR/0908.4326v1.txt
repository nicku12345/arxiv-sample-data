In this article almost semi-continuous processes with stationary independent increments on a finite irreducible Markov chain are considered. For these processes the components of matrix factorization identity are concretely defined. On the basis of this concrete definition the relations for the distributions of extrema and distributions of their complements for the almost upper semi-continuous processes are established.
