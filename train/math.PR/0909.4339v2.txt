We review old and new uses of exchangeability, emphasizing the general theme of exchangeable representations of complex random structures. Illustrations of this theme include processes of stochastic coalescence and fragmentation; continuum random trees; second-order limits of distances in random graphs; isometry classes of metric spaces with probability measures; limits of dense random graphs; and more sophisticated uses in finitary combinatorics.
