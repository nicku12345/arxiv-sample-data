We study the asymptotic behavior for large N of the disconnection time T_N of a simple random walk on the discrete cylinder (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^d\times\mathbb{Z}, when d\ge2. We explore its connection with the model of random interlacements on \mathbb{Z}^{d+1} recently introduced in [Ann. Math., in press], and specifically with the percolative properties of the vacant set left by random interlacements. As an application we show that in the large N limit the tail of T_N/N^{2d} is dominated by the tail of the first time when the supremum over the space variable of the Brownian local times reaches a certain critical value. As a by-product, we prove the tightness of the laws of T_N/N^{2d}, when d\ge2.
