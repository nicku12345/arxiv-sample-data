The infinite (in both directions) sequence of the distributions \mu^{(k)} of the stochastic integrals \int_0^{\infty-}c^{-N_{t-}^{(k)}} dL_t^{(k)} for integers k is investigated. Here c>1 and (N_t^{(k)},L_t^{(k)}), t\geq0, is a bivariate compound Poisson process with L\'evy measure concentrated on three points (1,0), (0,1), (1,c^{-k}). The amounts of the normalized L\'evy measure at these points are denoted by p, q, r. For k=0 the process (N_t^{(0)},L_t^{(0)}) is marginally Poisson and \mu^{(0)} has been studied by Lindner and Sato (Ann. Probab. 37 (2009), 250-274). The distributions \mu^{(k)} are the stationary distributions of a sequence of generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes structurally related in some way. Continuity properties of \mu^{(k)} are shown to be the same as those of \mu^{(0)}. The problem to find necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of c, p, q, and r for \mu^{(k)} to be infinitely divisible is somewhat involved, but completely solved for every integer k. The conditions depend on arithmetical properties of c. The symmetrizations of \mu^{(k)} are also studied. The distributions \mu^{(k)} and their symmetrizations are c^{-1}-decomposable, and it is shown that, for each k\neq 0, \mu^{(k)} and its symmetrization may be infinitely divisible without the corresponding factor in the c^{-1}-decomposability relation being infinitely divisible. This phenomenon was first observed by Niedbalska-Rajba (Colloq. Math. 44 (1981), 347-358) in an artificial example. The notion of quasi-infinite divisibility is introduced and utilized, and it is shown that a quasi-infinitely divisible distribution on [0,\infty) can have its quasi-L\'evy measure concentrated on (-\infty,0).
