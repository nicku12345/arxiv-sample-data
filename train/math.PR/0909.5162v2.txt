Consider Glauber dynamics for the Ising model on a graph of n vertices. Hayes and Sinclair showed that the mixing time for this dynamics is at least n\log n/f(\Delta), where \Delta is the maximum degree and f(\Delta) = \Theta(\Delta \log^2 \Delta). Their result applies to more general spin systems, and in that generality, they showed that some dependence on \Delta is necessary. In this paper, we focus on the ferromagnetic Ising model and prove that the mixing time of Glauber dynamics on any n-vertex graph is at least (1/4+o(1))n \log n.
