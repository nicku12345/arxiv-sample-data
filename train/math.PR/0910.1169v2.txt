We consider the quenched and the averaged (or annealed) large deviation rate functions I_q and I_a for space-time and (the usual) space-only RWRE on \mathbb{Z}^d. By Jensen's inequality, I_a\leq I_q. In the space-time case, when d\geq3+1, I_q and I_a are known to be equal on an open set containing the typical velocity \xi_o. When d=1+1, we prove that I_q and I_a are equal only at \xi_o. Similarly, when d=2+1, we show that I_a<I_q on a punctured neighborhood of \xi_o. In the space-only case, we provide a class of non-nestling walks on \mathbb{Z}^d with d=2 or 3, and prove that I_q and I_a are not identically equal on any open set containing \xi_o whenever the walk is in that class. This is very different from the known results for non-nestling walks on \mathbb{Z}^d with d\geq4.
