Let G={G(x), x\in R_+}, G(0)=0, be a mean zero Gaussian process with E(G(x)-G(y))^2=\sigma ^2(x-y) . Let    \rho (x)= \frac12{d^{2}\over dx^2}\sigma^2(x), x\ne 0 . When \rho^{k} is integrable at zero and satisfies some additional regularity conditions,   \[ \lim_{h\downarrow 0} \int :(\frac{G(x+h)-G(x)}{h})^{k}:g(x) dx=:(G') ^{k}:(g){.3 in}a.s. \] for all g\in B_{0}(R^{+}), the set of bounded Lebesgue measurable functions on R_+ with compact support. Here G' is a generalized derivative of G and :(\cd)^{k}: is the k--th order Wick power.
