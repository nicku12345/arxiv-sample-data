We study the object formally defined as \gamma\big([0,t]^{2}\big)=\int\int_{[0,t]^{2}} | X_{s}- X_{r}|^{-\sigma} dr ds-E\int\int_{[0,t]^{2}} | X_{s}- X_{r}|^{-\sigma} dr ds, where X_{t} is the symmetric stable processes of index 0<\beta\le 2 in R^{d}. When \beta\le\sigma<\displaystyle\min \Big\{{3\over 2}\beta, d\Big\}, this has to be defined as a limit, in the spirit of renormalized self-intersection local time. We obtain results about the large deviations and laws of the iterated logarithm for \gamma. This is applied to obtain results about stable processes in random potentials.
