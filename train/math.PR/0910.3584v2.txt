Spider walks are systems of interacting particles. The particles move independently as long as their movement do not violate some given rules describing the relative position of the particles; moves that violate the rules are not realized. The goal of this paper is to study qualitative properties, as recurrence, transience, ergodicity, and positive rate of escape of these Markov processes.
