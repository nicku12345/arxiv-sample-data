Let r: S\times S\to \bb R_+ be the jump rates of an irreducible random walk on a finite set S, reversible with respect to some probability measure m. For \alpha >1, let g: \bb N\to \bb R_+ be given by g(0)=0, g(1)=1, g(k) = (k/k-1)^\alpha, k\ge 2. Consider a zero range process on S in which a particle jumps from a site x, occupied by k particles, to a site y at rate g(k) r(x,y). Let N stand for the total number of particles. In the stationary state, as N\uparrow\infty, all particles but a finite number accumulate on one single site. We show in this article that in the time scale N^{1+\alpha} the site which concentrates almost all particles evolves as a random walk on S whose transition rates are proportional to the capacities of the underlying random walk.
