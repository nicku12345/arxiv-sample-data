Consider the infinite rate mutually catalytic branching process (IMUB) constructed in [Infinite rate mutually catalytic branching in infinitely many colonies. Construction, characterization and convergence (2008) Preprint] and [Ann. Probab. 38 (2010) 479-497]. For finite initial conditions, we show that only one type survives in the long run if the interaction kernel is recurrent. On the other hand, under a slightly stronger condition than transience, we show that both types can coexist.
