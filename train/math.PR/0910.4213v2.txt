Anticipated backward stochastic differential equations, studied the first time in 2007, are equations of the following type: {tabular}{rlll} -dY_t &=& f(t, Y_t, Z_t, Y_{t+\delta(t)}, Z_{t+\zeta(t)})dt-Z_tdB_t,  &  t\in[0, T]; Y_t &=& \xi_t,  & t\in[T, T+K]; Z_t &=& \eta_t,  & t\in[T, T+K]. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition under which the comparison theorem holds for multidimensional anticipated backward stochastic differential equations with generators independent of the anticipated term of Z.
