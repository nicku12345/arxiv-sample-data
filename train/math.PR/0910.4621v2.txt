Following Baurdoux and Kyprianou [2] we consider the McKean stochastic game, a game version of the McKean optimal stopping problem (American put), driven by a spectrally negative Levy process. We improve their characterisation of a saddle point for this game when the driving process has a Gaussian component and negative jumps. In particular we show that the exercise region of the minimiser consists of a singleton when the penalty parameter is larger than some threshold and 'thickens' to a full interval when the penalty parameter drops below this threshold. Expressions in terms of scale functions for the general case and in terms of polynomials for a specific jump-diffusion case are provided.
