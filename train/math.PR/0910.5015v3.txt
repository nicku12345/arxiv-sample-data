Let M_n be the number of steps of the loop-erasure of a simple random walk on \mathbb{Z}^2 from the origin to the circle of radius n. We relate the moments of M_n to Es(n), the probability that a random walk and an independent loop-erased random walk both started at the origin do not intersect up to leaving the ball of radius n. This allows us to show that there exists C such that for all n and all k=1,2,...,\mathbf{E}[M_n^k]\leq C^kk!\mathbf{E}[M_n]^k and hence to establish exponential moment bounds for M_n. This implies that there exists c>0 such that for all n and all \lambda\geq0, \[\mathbf{P}\{M_n>\lambda\mathbf{E}[M_n]\}\leq2e^{-c\lambda}.\] Using similar techniques, we then establish a second moment result for a specific conditioned random walk which enables us to prove that for any \alpha<4/5, there exist C and c'>0 such that for all n and \lambda>0, \[\mathbf{P}\{M_n<\lambda^{-1}\mathbf{E}[M_n]\}\leq Ce^{-c'\lambda ^{\alpha}}.\]
