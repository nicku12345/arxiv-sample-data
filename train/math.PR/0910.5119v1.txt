Let \alpha \in (0,2) and consider the operator \sL given by \[ \sL f(x)=\int[ f(x+h)-f(x)-1_{(|h|\leq 1)}h\cdot \grad f(x)]\frac{n(x,h)}{|h|^{d+\alpha}} \d h, \] where the term 1_{(|h|\leq 1)}h\cdot \grad f(x) is not present when \alpha \in (0,1). Under some suitable assumptions on the kernel n(x,h), we prove a Krylov-type inequality for processes associated with \sL. As an application of the inequality, we prove the existence of a solution to the martingale problem for \sL without assuming any continuity of n(x,h).
