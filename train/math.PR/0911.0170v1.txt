We construct and study a discrete time model describing the conflict interaction between two complex systems with non-trivial internal structures. The external conflict interaction is based on the model of alternative interaction between a pair of non-annihilating opponents. The internal conflict dynamics is similar to the one of a predator-prey model. We show that the typical trajectory of the complex system converges to an asymptotic attractive cycle. We propose an interpretation of our model in terms of migration processes.
