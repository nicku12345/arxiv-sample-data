In this paper we introduce a new class of L\'evy processes which we call hypergeometric-stable L\'evy processes, because they are obtained from symmetric stable processes through several transformations and where the Gauss hypergeometric function plays an essential role. We characterize the L\'evy measure of this class and obtain several useful properties such as the Wiener Hopf factorization, the characteristic exponent and some associated exit problems.
