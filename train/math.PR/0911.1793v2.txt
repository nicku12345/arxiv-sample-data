Suppose \Pi is an exchangeable random partition of the positive integers and \Pi_n is its restriction to \{1, ..., n\}. Let K_n denote the number of blocks of \Pi_n, and let K_{n,r} denote the number of blocks of \Pi_n containing r integers. We show that if 0 < \alpha < 1 and K_n/(n^{\alpha} \ell(n)) converges in probability to \Gamma(1-\alpha), where \ell is a slowly varying function, then K_{n,r}/(n^{\alpha} \ell(n)) converges in probability to \alpha \Gamma(r - \alpha)/r!. This result was previously known when the convergence of K_n/(n^{\alpha} \ell(n)) holds almost surely, but the result under the hypothesis of convergence in probability has significant implications for coalescent theory. We also show that a related conjecture for the case when K_n grows only slightly slower than n fails to be true.
