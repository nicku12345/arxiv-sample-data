We study a branching random walk on \r with an absorbing barrier. The position of the barrier depends on the generation. In each generation, only the individuals born below the barrier survive and reproduce. Given a reproduction law, Biggins et al. \cite{BLSW91} determined whether a linear barrier allows the process to survive. In this paper, we refine their result: in the boundary case in which the speed of the barrier matches the speed of the minimal position of a particle in a given generation, we add a second order term a n^{1/3} to the position of the barrier for the n^\mathrm{th} generation and find an explicit critical value a_c such that the process dies when aa_c. We also obtain the rate of extinction when a < a_c and a lower bound on the surviving population when a > a_c.
