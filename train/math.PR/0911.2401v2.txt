We study critical branching random walks (BRWs) U^{(n)} on~\mathbb{Z}_{+} where for each n, the displacement of an offspring from its parent has drift~2\beta/\sqrt{n} towards the origin and reflection at the origin. We prove that for any~\alpha>1, conditional on survival to generation~[n^{\alpha}], the maximal displacement is asymptotically equivalent to (\alpha-1)/(4\beta)\sqrt{n}\log n. We further show that for a sequence of critical BRWs with such displacement distributions, if the number of initial particles grows like~yn^{\alpha} for some y>0 and \alpha>1, and the particles are concentrated in~[0,O(\sqrt{n})], then the measure-valued processes associated with the BRWs, under suitable scaling converge to a measure-valued process, which, at any time~t>0, distributes its mass over~\mathbb{R}_+ like an exponential distribution.
