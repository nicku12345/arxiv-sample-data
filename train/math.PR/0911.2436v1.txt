In this paper, we consider modeling time-dependent multi-server queues that include abandonments and retrials. For the performance analysis of those, fluid and diffusion models called "strong approximations" have been widely used in the literature. Although they are proven to be asymptotically exact, their effectiveness as approximations in critically loaded regimes needs to be investigated. To that end, we find that existing fluid and diffusion approximations might be either inaccurate under simplifying assumptions or computationally intractable. To address that concern, this paper focuses on developing a methodology by adjusting the fluid and diffusion models so that they significantly improve the estimation accuracy. We illustrate the accuracy of our adjusted models by performing a number of numerical experiments.
