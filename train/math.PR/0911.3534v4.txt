Let us consider a solution of the time-inhomogeneous stochastic differential equation driven by a Brownian motion with drift coefficient b(t,x)=\rho\,{\rm sgn}(x)|x|^\alpha/t^\beta. This process can be viewed as a distorted Brownian motion in a potential, possibly singular, depending on time. After obtaining results on existence and uniqueness of solution, we study its asymptotic behaviour and made a precise description, in terms of parameters \rho,\alpha and \beta, of the recurrence, transience and convergence. More precisely, asymptotic distributions, iterated logarithm type laws and rates of transience and explosion are proved for such processes.
