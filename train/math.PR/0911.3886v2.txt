We study recurrence properties and the validity of the (weak) law of large numbers for (discrete time) processes which, in the simplest case, are obtained from simple symmetric random walk on \Z by modifying the distribution of a step from a fresh point. If the process is denoted as \{S_n\}_{n \ge 0}, then the conditional distribution of S_{n+1} - S_n given the past through time n is the distribution of a simple random walk step, provided S_n is at a point which has been visited already at least once during [0,n-1]. Thus in this case P\{S_{n+1}-S_n = \pm 1|S_\ell, \ell \le n\} = 1/2. We denote this distribution by P_1. However, if S_n is at a point which has not been visited before time n, then we take for the conditional distribution of S_{n+1}-S_n, given the past, some other distribution P_2. We want to decide in specific cases whether S_n returns infinitely often to the origin and whether (1/n)S_n \to 0 in probability. Generalizations or variants of the P_i and the rules for switching between the P_i are also considered.
