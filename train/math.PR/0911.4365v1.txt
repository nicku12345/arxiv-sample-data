Is this paper we study penalisations of diffusions satisfying some technical conditions, generalizing a result obtained by Najnudel, Roynette and Yor. If one of these diffusions has probability distribution \mathbb{P}, then our result can be described as follows: for a large class of families of probability measures (\mathbb{Q}_t)_{t \geq 0}, each of them being absolutely continuous with respect to \mathbb{P}, there exists a probability \mathbb{Q}_{\infty} such that for all events \Lambda depending only on the canonical trajectory up to a fixed time, \mathbb{Q}_t (\Lambda) tends to \mathbb{Q}_{\infty} (\Lambda) when t goes to infinity. In the cases we study here, the limit measure \mathbb{Q}_{\infty} is absolutely continous with respect to a sigma-finite measure \mathcal{Q}, which does not depend on the choice of the family of probabilities (\mathbb{Q}_t)_{t \geq 0}, but only on \mathbb{P}. The relation between \mathbb{P} and \mathcal{Q} is obtained in a very general framework by the authors of this paper.
