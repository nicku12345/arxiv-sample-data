A version of the saddle point method is developed, which allows one to describe exactly the asymptotic behavior of distribution densities of Levy driven stochastic integrals with deterministic kernels. Exact asymptotic behavior is established for (a) the transition probability density of a real-valued Levy process; (b) the transition probability density and the invariant distribution density of a Levy driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; (c) the distribution density of the fractional Levy motion.
