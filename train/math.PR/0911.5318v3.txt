We collect several observations that concern variable-length coding of two-sided infinite sequences in a probabilistic setting. Attention is paid to images and preimages of asymptotically mean stationary measures defined on subsets of these sequences. We point out sufficient conditions under which the variable-length coding and its inverse preserve asymptotic mean stationarity. Moreover, conditions for preservation of shift-invariant \sigma-fields and the finite-energy property are discussed and the block entropies for stationary means of coded processes are related in some cases. Subsequently, we apply certain of these results to construct a stationary nonergodic process with a desired linguistic interpretation.
