We consider a model for gene regulatory networks that is a modification of Kauffmann's (1969) random Boolean networks. There are three parameters: n = the number of nodes, r = the number of inputs to each node, and p = the expected fraction of 1's in the Boolean functions at each node. Following a standard practice in the physics literature, we use a threshold contact process on a random graph on n nodes, in which each node has in degree r, to approximate its dynamics. We show that if r\ge 3 and r \cdot 2p(1-p)>1, then the threshold contact process persists for a long time, which correspond to chaotic behavior of the Boolean network. Unfortunately, we are only able to prove the persistence time is \ge \exp(cn^{b(p)}) with b(p)>0 when r\cdot 2p(1-p)> 1, and b(p)=1 when (r-1)\cdot 2p(1-p)>1.
