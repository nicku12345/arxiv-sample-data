Stein's method is applied to obtain a general Cramer-type moderate deviation result for dependent random variables whose dependence is defined in terms of a Stein identity. A corollary for zero-bias coupling is deduced. The result is also applied to a combinatorial central limit theorem, a general system of binary codes, the anti-voter model on a complete graph, and the Curie-Weiss model. A general moderate deviation result for independent random variables is also proved.
