Let S_n be a centered random walk with a finite variance, and define the new sequence A_n:=\sum_{i=1}^n S_i, which we call an integrated random walk. We are interested in the asymptotics of p_N:=P(\min_{1 \le k \le N} A_k \ge 0) as N \to \infty. Sinai (1992) proved that p_N \asymp N^{-1/4} if S_n is a simple random walk. We show that p_N \asymp N^{-1/4} for some other types of random walks that include double-sided exponential and double-sided geometric walks, both not necessarily symmetric. We also prove that p_N \le c N^{-1/4} for lattice walks and for upper exponential walks, that are the walks such that Law (S_1 | S_1>0) is an exponential distribution.
