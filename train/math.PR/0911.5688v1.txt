Ito's construction of Markovian solutions to stochastic equations driven by a L\'evy noise is extended to nonlinear distribution dependent integrands aiming at the effective construction of linear and nonlinear Markov semigroups and the corresponding processes with a given pseudo-differential generator. It is shown that a conditionally positive integro-differential operator (of the L\'evy-Khintchine type) with variable coefficients (diffusion, drift and L\'evy measure) depending Lipschitz continuously on its parameters (position and/or its distribution) generates a linear or nonlinear Markov semigroup, where the measures are metricized by the Wasserstein-Kantorovich metrics. This is a nontrivial but natural extension to general Markov processes of a long known fact for ordinary diffusions.
