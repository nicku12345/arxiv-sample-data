Suppose X is a right process which is associated with a non-symmetric Dirichlet form (\mathcal{E},D(\mathcal{E})) on L^{2}(E;m). For u\in D(\mathcal{E}), we have Fukushima's decomposition: \tilde{u}(X_{t})-\tilde{u}(X_{0})=M^{u}_{t}+N^{u}_{t}. In this paper, we investigate the strong continuity of the generalized Feynman-Kac semigroup defined by P^{u}_{t}f(x)=E_{x}[e^{N^{u}_{t}}f(X_{t})]. Let Q^{u}(f,g)=\mathcal{E}(f,g)+\mathcal{E}(u,fg) for f,g\in D(\mathcal{E})_{b}. Denote by J_1 the dissymmetric part of the jumping measure J of (\mathcal{E},D(\mathcal{E})). Under the assumption that J_1 is finite, we show that (Q^{u},D(\mathcal{E})_{b}) is lower semi-bounded if and only if there exists a constant \alpha_0\ge 0 such that \|P^{u}_{t}\|_2\leq e^{\alpha_0 t} for every t>0. If one of these conditions holds, then (P^{u}_{t})_{t\geq0} is strongly continuous on L^{2}(E;m). If X is equipped with a differential structure, then this result also holds without assuming that J_1 is finite.
