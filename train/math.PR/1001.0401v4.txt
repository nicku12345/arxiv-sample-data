This article deals with the numerical resolution of Markovian backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with drivers of quadratic growth with respect to z and bounded terminal conditions. We first show some bound estimates on the process Z and we specify the Zhang's path regularity theorem. Then we give a new time discretization scheme with a non uniform time net for such BSDEs and we obtain an explicit convergence rate for this scheme.
