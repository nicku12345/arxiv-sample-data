Let (\mathbf{W,W'}) be an exchangeable pair of vectors in \mathbb{R}^k. Suppose this pair satisfies \beas E(\mathbf{W}'|\mathbf{W})=(I_k-\Lambda)\mathbf{W}+\mathbf{R(W)}. \enas If ||\mathbf{W-W'}||_2\le K and \mathbf{R(W)}=0, then concentration of measure results of following form is proved for all \mathbf{w}\succeq 0 when the moment generating function of \mathbf{W} is finite. \beas P(\mathbf{W}\succeq\mathbf{w}),P(\mathbf{W}\preceq -\mathbf{w})\le \exp(-\frac{||\mathbf{w}||_2^2}{2K^2\nu_1}), \enas for an explicit constant \nu_1, where \succeq stands for coordinate wise \ge ordering.   This result is applied to examples like complete non degenerate U-statistics. Also, we deal with the example of doubly indexed permutation statistics where \mathbf{R(W)}\neq 0 and obtain similar concentration of measure inequalities. Practical examples from doubly indexed permutation statistics include Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistic and random intersection of two graphs. Both these two examples are used in nonparametric statistical testing. We conclude the paper with a multivariate generalization of a recent concentration result due to Ghosh and Goldstein \cite{cnm} involving bounded size bias couplings.
