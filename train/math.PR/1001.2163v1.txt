We establish a heavy-traffic limit theorem on convergence in distribution for the number of customers in a many-server queue when the number of servers tends to infinity. No critical loading condition is assumed. Generally, the limit process does not have trajectories in the Skorohod space. We give conditions for the convergence to hold in the topology of compact convergence. Some new results for an infinite server are also provided.
