Let {Z_{n},n\geq 0}  be a critical branching process in random environment and let T be its moment of extinction. Under the annealed approach we prove, as n\to \infty , a limit theorem for the number of particles in the process at moment n given T=n+1 and a functional limit theorem for the properly scaled process {Z_{nt},\delta \leq t\leq 1-\delta}  given T=n+1 and \delta \in (0,1/2).
