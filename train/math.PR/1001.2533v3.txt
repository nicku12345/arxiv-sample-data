A spider consists of several, say N, particles. Particles can jump independently according to a random walk if the movement does not violate some given restriction rules. If the movement violates a rule it is not carried out. We consider random walk in random environment (RWRE) on \Z as underlying random walk. We suppose the environment \omega=(\omega_x)_{x \in \Z} to be elliptic, with positive drift and nestling, so that there exists a unique positive constant \kappa such that \E[((1-\omega_0)/\omega_0)^{\kappa}]=1. The restriction rules are kept very general; we only assume transitivity and irreducibility of the spider. The main result is that the speed of a spider is positive if \kappa/N>1 and null if \kappa/N<1. In particular, if \kappa/N <1 a spider has null speed but the speed of a (single) RWRE is positive.
