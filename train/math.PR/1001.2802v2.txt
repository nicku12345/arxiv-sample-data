In this article, a sublinear expectation induced by G-expectation is introduced, which is called G-evaluation for convenience. As an application, we prove that any \xi\in L^\beta_G(\Omega_T) with some \beta>1 the decomposition theorem holds and any \beta>1 integrable symmetric G-martingale can be represented as an It\hat{o}'s integral w.r.t G-Brownian motion. As a byproduct, we prove a regular property for G-martingale: Any G-martingale \{M_t\} has a quasi-continuous version
