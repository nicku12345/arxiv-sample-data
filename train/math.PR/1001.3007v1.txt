We consider It\^o SDE \d X_t=\sum_{j=1}^m A_j(X_t) \d w_t^j + A_0(X_t) \d t on \R^d. The diffusion coefficients A_1,..., A_m are supposed to be in the Sobolev space W_\text{loc}^{1,p} (\R^d) with p>d, and to have linear growth; for the drift coefficient A_0, we consider two cases: (i) A_0 is continuous whose distributional divergence \delta(A_0) w.r.t. the Gaussian measure \gamma_d exists, (ii) A_0 has the Sobolev regularity W_\text{loc}^{1,p'} for some p'>1. Assume \int_{\R^d} \exp\big[\lambda_0\bigl(|\delta(A_0)| + \sum_{j=1}^m (|\delta(A_j)|^2 +|\nabla A_j|^2)\bigr)\big] \d\gamma_d<+\infty for some \lambda_0>0, in the case (i), if the pathwise uniqueness of solutions holds, then the push-forward (X_t)_# \gamma_d admits a density with respect to \gamma_d. In particular, if the coefficients are bounded Lipschitz continuous, then X_t leaves the Lebesgue measure \Leb_d quasi-invariant. In the case (ii), we develop a method used by G. Crippa and C. De Lellis for ODE and implemented by X. Zhang for SDE, to establish the existence and uniqueness of stochastic flow of maps.
