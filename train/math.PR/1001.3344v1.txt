In this article, we study the numerical approximation of stochastic differential equations driven by a multidimensional fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurst parameter greater than 1/3. We introduce an implementable scheme for these equations, which is based on a second order Taylor expansion, where the usual Levy area terms are replaced by products of increments of the driving fBm. The convergence of our scheme is shown by means of a combination of rough paths techniques and error bounds for the discretisation of the Levy area terms.
