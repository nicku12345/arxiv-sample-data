We analyze the relaxation time of a ferromagnetic d dimensional growth model on the lattice. The model is characterized by d param- eters which represent the activation energies of a site, depending on the number of occupied nearest neighbours. This model is a natural generalisation of the model studied by Dehghanpour and Schonmann [DS97a], where the activation energy of a site with more than two occupied neighbours is zero.
