Consider the high-order heat-type equation \partial u/\partial t=\pm \partial^N u/\partial x^N for an integer N>2 and introduce the related Markov pseudo-process (X(t))_{t\ge 0}. In this paper, we study the sojourn time T(t) in the interval [0,+\infty) up to a fixed time t for this pseudo-process. We provide explicit expressions for the joint distribution of the couple (T(t),X(t)).
