If X is a stable process of index \alpha\in(0,2) whose L\'{e}vy measure has density cx^{-\alpha-1} on (0,\infty), and S_1=\sup_{0<t\leq1}X_t, it is known that P(S_1>x)\backsim A\alpha ^{-1}x^{-\alpha} as x\to\infty and P(S_1\leq x)\backsim B\alpha^{-1}\rho^{-1}x^{\alpha\rho} as x\downarrow0. [Here \rho =P(X_1>0) and A and B are known constants.] It is also known that S_1 has a continuous density, m say. The main point of this note is to show that m(x)\backsim Ax^{-(\alpha+1)} as x\to\infty and m(x)\backsim Bx^{\alpha\rho-1} as x\downarrow0. Similar results are obtained for related densities.
