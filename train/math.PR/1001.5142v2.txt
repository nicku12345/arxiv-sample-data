In the paper the rescaled occupation time fluctuation process of a certain empirical system is investigated. The system consists of particles evolving independently according to \alpha-stable motion in R^d, \alpha<d<2\alpha. The particles split according to the binary critical branching law with intensity V>0. We study how the limit behaviour of the fluctuations of the occupation time depends on the \emph{initial particle configuration}. We obtain a functional central limit theorem for a vast class of infinitely divisible distributions. Our findings extend and put in a unified setting results which previously seemed to be disconnected. The limit processes form a one dimensional family of long-range dependance centred Gaussian processes.
