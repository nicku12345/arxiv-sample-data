This paper is devoted to the study of numerical approximation schemes for a class of parabolic equations on (0, 1) perturbed by a non-linear rough signal. It is the continuation of [8, 7], where the existence and uniqueness of a solution has been established. The approach combines rough paths methods with standard considerations on discretizing stochastic PDEs. The results apply to a geometric 2-rough path, which covers the case of the multidimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index H \textgreater{} 1/3.
