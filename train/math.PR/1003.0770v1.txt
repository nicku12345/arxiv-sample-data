In this note, we give an original convergence result for products of independent random elements of motion group. Then we consider dynamic random walks which are inhomogeneous Markov chains whose transition probability of each step is, in some sense, time dependent. We show, briefly, how Central Limit theorem and Local Limit theorems can be derived from the classical case and provide new results when the rotations are mutually commuting. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first investigation of dynamic random walks on the motion group.
