We prove a large deviation principle result for solutions of abstract stochastic evolution equations perturbed by small Levy noise. We use general large deviations theorems of Varadhan and Bryc, viscosity solutions of integro-partial differential equations in Hilbert spaces, and deterministic optimal control methods. The Laplace limit is identified as a viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of an associated control problem. We also establish exponential moment estimates for solutions of stochastic evolution equations driven by Levy noise. General results are applied to stochastic hyperbolic equations perturbed by subordinated Wiener process.
