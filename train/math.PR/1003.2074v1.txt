We study a model of the motion by mean curvature of an (1+1) dimensional interface in a 2D Brownian velocity field. For the well-posedness of the model we prove existence and uniqueness for certain degenerate nonlinear stochastic evolution equations in the variational framework of Krylov Rozovskii, replacing the standard coercivity assumption by a Lyapunov type condition. Ergodicity is established for the case of additive noise, using the lower bound technique for Markov semigroups by Komorowski, Peszat and Szarek
