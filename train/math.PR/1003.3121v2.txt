We study the asymptotic behaviour of a d-dimensional self-interacting random walk X_n (n = 1,2,...) which is repelled or attracted by the centre of mass G_n = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i of its previous trajectory. The walk's trajectory (X_1,...,X_n) models a random polymer chain in either poor or good solvent. In addition to some natural regularity conditions, we assume that the walk has one-step mean drift directed either towards or away from its current centre of mass G_n and of magnitude \| X_n - G_n \|^{-\beta} for \beta \geq 0. When \beta <1 and the radial drift is outwards, we show that X_n is transient with a limiting (random) direction and satisfies a super-diffusive law of large numbers: n^{-1/(1+\beta)} X_n converges almost surely to some random vector. When \beta \in (0,1) there is sub-ballistic rate of escape. For \beta \geq 0 we give almost-sure bounds on the norms \|X_n\|, which in the context of the polymer model reveal extended and collapsed phases. Analysis of the random walk, and in particular of X_n - G_n, leads to the study of real-valued time-inhomogeneous non-Markov processes Z_n on [0,\infty) with mean drifts at x given approximately by \rho x^{-\beta} - (x/n), where \beta \geq 0 and \rho \in \R. The study of such processes is a time-dependent variation on a classical problem of Lamperti; moreover, they arise naturally in the context of the distance of simple random walk on \Z^d from its centre of mass, for which we also give an apparently new result. We give a recurrence classification and asymptotic theory for processes Z_n just described, which enables us to deduce the complete recurrence classification (for any \beta \geq 0) of X_n - G_n for our self-interacting walk.
