A small world is obtained from the d-dimensional torus of size 2L adding randomly chosen connections between sites, in a way such that each site has exactly one random neighbour in addition to its deterministic neighbours. We study the asymptotic behaviour of the meeting time T_L of two random walks moving on this small world and compare it with the result on the torus. On the torus, in order to have convergence, we have to rescale T_L by a factor C_1L^2 if d=1, by C_2L^2\log L if d=2 and C_dL^d if d\ge3. We prove that on the small world the rescaling factor is C^\prime_dL^d and identify the constant C^\prime_d, proving that the walks always meet faster on the small world than on the torus if d\le2, while if d\ge3 this depends on the probability of moving along the random connection. As an application, we obtain results on the hitting time to the origin of a single walk and on the convergence of coalescing random walk systems on the small world.
