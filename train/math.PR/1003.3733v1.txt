An intrinsic multitype branching structure within the transient (1;R)-RWRE is revealed. The branching structure enables us to specify the density of the absolutely continuous invariant measure for the environments seen from the particle and reprove the LLN with an drift explicitly in terms of the environment, comparing with the results in Br\'emont (2002).
