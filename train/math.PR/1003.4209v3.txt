We study the probability distribution of the area and the number of vertices of random polygons in a convex set K\subset\mathbb{R}^2. The novel aspect of our approach is that it yields uniform estimates for all convex sets K\subset\mathbb{R}^2 without imposing any regularity conditions on the boundary \partial K. Our main result is a central limit theorem for both the area and the number of vertices, settling a well-known conjecture in the field. We also obtain asymptotic results relating the growth of the expectation and variance of these two functionals.
