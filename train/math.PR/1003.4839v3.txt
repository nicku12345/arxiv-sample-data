We show that the conjecture of Kannan, Lov\'{a}sz, and Simonovits on isoperimetric properties of convex bodies and log-concave measures, is true for log-concave measures of the form \rho(|x|_B)dx on \mathbb{R}^n and \rho(t,|x|_B) dx on \mathbb{R}^{1+n}, where |x|_B is the norm associated to any convex body B already satisfying the conjecture. In particular, the conjecture holds for convex bodies of revolution.
