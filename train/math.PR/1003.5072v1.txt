We derive sharp, local and dimension dependent hypercontractive bounds on the Markov kernel of a large class of diffusion semigroups. Unlike the dimension free ones, they capture refined properties of Markov kernels, such as trace estimates. They imply classical bounds on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup and a dimensional and refined (transportation) Talagrand inequality when applied to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Hypercontractive bounds on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup driven by a non-diffusive L\'evy semigroup are also investigated. Curvature-dimension criteria are the main tool in the analysis.
