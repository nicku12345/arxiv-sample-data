Let (X_t,t\geq 0) be a random walk on \mathbb{Z}^d. Let  l_T(x)= \int_0^T \delta_x(X_s)ds the local time at the state x and  I_T= \sum\limits_{x\in\mathbb{Z}^d} l_T(x)^q  the q-fold self-intersection local time (SILT). In \cite{Castell} Castell proves a large deviations principle for the SILT of the simple random walk in the critical case q(d-2)=d. In the supercritical case q(d-2)>d, Chen and M\"orters obtain in \cite{ChenMorters} a large deviations principle for the intersection of q independent random walks, and Asselah obtains in \cite{Asselah5} a large deviations principle for the SILT with q=2. We extend these results to an \alpha-stable process (i.e. \alpha\in]0,2]) in the case where q(d-\alpha)\geq d.
