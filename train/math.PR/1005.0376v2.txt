Consider a random walk in an i.i.d. uniformly elliptic environment in dimensions larger than one. In 2002, Sznitman introduced for each \gamma\in(0,1) the ballisticity condition (T)_{\gamma} and the condition (T') defined as the fulfillment of (T)_{\gamma} for each \gamma\in(0,1). Sznitman proved that (T') implies a ballistic law of large numbers. Furthermore, he showed that for all \gamma\in (0.5,1), (T)_{\gamma} is equivalent to (T'). Recently, Berger has proved that in dimensions larger than three, for each \gamma\in (0,1), condition (T)_{\gamma} implies a ballistic law of large numbers. On the other hand, Drewitz and Ram\'{{\i}}rez have shown that in dimensions d\ge2 there is a constant \gamma_d\in(0.366,0.388) such that for each \gamma\in(\gamma_d,1), condition (T)_{\gamma} is equivalent to (T'). Here, for dimensions larger than three, we extend the previous range of equivalence to all \gamma\in(0,1). For the proof, the so-called effective criterion of Sznitman is established employing a sharp estimate for the probability of atypical quenched exit distributions of the walk leaving certain boxes. In this context, we also obtain an affirmative answer to a conjecture raised by Sznitman in 2004 concerning these probabilities. A key ingredient for our estimates is the multiscale method developed recently by Berger.
