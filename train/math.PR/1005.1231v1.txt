This paper proposes another constant that can be associated with Fibonacci sequence. In this work, we look at the probability distributions generated by the linear convolution of Fibonacci sequence with itself, and the linear convolution of symmetrized Fibonacci sequence with itself. We observe that for a distribution generated by the linear convolution of the standard Fibonacci sequence with itself, the variance converges to 8.4721359... . Also, for a distribution generated by the linear convolution of symmetrized Fibonacci sequences, the variance converges in an average sense to 17.1942 ..., which is approximately twice that we get with common Fibonacci sequence.
