Consider n non-intersecting Brownian motions on \mathbb{R}, depending on time t \in [0,1], with m_i particles forced to leave from a_i at time t=0, 1\leq i\leq q, and n_j particles forced to end up at b_j at time t=1, 1\leq j\leq p. For arbitrary p and q, it is not known if the distribution of the positions of the non-intersecting Brownian particles at a given time 0<t<1, is the same as the joint distribution of the eigenvalues of a matrix ensemble. This paper proves the existence, for general p and q, of a partial differential equation (PDE) satisfied by the log of the probability to find all the particles in a disjoint union of intervals E=\cup_{i=1}^{r}[c_{2i-1},c_{2i}]\subset\mathbb{R} at a given time 0<t<1. The variables are the coordinates of the starting and ending points of the particles, and the boundary points of the set E. The proof of the existence of such a PDE, using Virasoro constraints and the multicomponent KP hierarchy, is based on the method of elimination of the unwanted partials; that this is possible is a miracle. Unfortunately we were unable to find its explicit expression. The case p=q=2 will be discussed in the last section.
