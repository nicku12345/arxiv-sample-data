Let (E, \| \cdot\|) be a Banach space such that, for some q\geq 2, the function x\mapsto \|x\|^q is of C^2 class and its first and second Fr\'{e}chet derivatives are bounded by some constant multiples of (q-1)-th power of the norm and (q-2)-th power of the norm and let S be a C_0-semigroup of contraction type on (E, \| \cdot\|). We consider the following stochastic convolution process \begin{align*} u(t)=\int_0^t\int_ZS(t-s)\xi(s,z)\,\tilde{N}(\mathrm{d} s,\mathrm{d} z), \;\;\; t\geq 0, \end{align*} where \tilde{N} is a compensated Poisson random measure on a measurable space (Z,\mathcal{Z}) and \xi:[0,\infty)\times\Omega\times Z\rightarrow E is an \mathbb{F}\otimes \mathcal{Z}-predictable function. We prove that there exists a c\`{a}dl\`{a}g modification a \tilde{u} of the process u which satisfies the following maximal inequality \begin{align*} \mathbb{E} \sup_{0\leq s\leq t} \|\tilde{u}(s)\|^{q^\prime}\leq C\ \mathbb{E} \left(\int_0^t\int_Z \|\xi(s,z) \|^{p}\,N(\mathrm{d} s,\mathrm{d} z)\right)^{\frac{q^\prime}{p}}, \end{align*} for all  q^\prime \geq q and 1<p\leq 2 with C=C(q,p).
