Aldous [(2007) Preprint] defined a gossip process in which space is a discrete N\times N torus, and the state of the process at time t is the set of individuals who know the information. Information spreads from a site to its nearest neighbors at rate 1/4 each and at rate N^{-\alpha} to a site chosen at random from the torus. We will be interested in the case in which \alpha<3, where the long range transmission significantly accelerates the time at which everyone knows the information. We prove three results that precisely describe the spread of information in a slightly simplified model on the real torus. The time until everyone knows the information is asymptotically T=(2-2\alpha/3)N^{\alpha/3}\log N. If \rho_s is the fraction of the population who know the information at time s and \varepsilon is small then, for large N, the time until \rho_s reaches \varepsilon is T(\varepsilon)\approx T+N^{\alpha/3}\log (3\varepsilon /M), where M is a random variable determined by the early spread of the information. The value of \rho_s at time s=T(1/3)+tN^{\alpha/3} is almost a deterministic function h(t) which satisfies an odd looking integro-differential equation. The last result confirms a heuristic calculation of Aldous.
