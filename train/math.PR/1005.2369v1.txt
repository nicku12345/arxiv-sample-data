Subordinating a random walk to a renewal process yields a continuous time random walk (CTRW) model for diffusion, including the possibility of anomalous diffusion. Transition densities of scaling limits of power law CTRWs have been shown to solve fractional Fokker-Planck equations. We consider limits of sequences of CTRWs which arise when both waiting times and jumps are taken from an infinitesimal triangular array. We identify two different limit processes X_t and Y_t when waiting times precede or follow jumps, respectively. In the limiting procedure, we keep track of the renewal times of the CTRWs and hence find two more limit processes. Finally, we calculate the joint law of all four limit processes evaluated at a fixed time t.
