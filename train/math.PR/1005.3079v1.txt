Let \Lambda be a connected closed region with smooth boundary contained in the d-dimensional continuous torus \bb T^d. In the discrete torus N^{-1} \bb T^d_N, we consider a nearest neighbor symmetric exclusion process where occupancies of neighboring sites are exchanged at rates depending on \Lambda in the following way: if both sites are in \Lambda or \Lambda^\complement, the exchange rate is one; If one site is in \Lambda and the other one is in \Lambda^\complement and the direction of the bond connecting the sites is e_j, then the exchange rate is defined as N^{-1} times the absolute value of the inner product between e_j and the normal exterior vector to \p\Lambda. We show that this exclusion type process has a non-trivial hydrodynamical behavior under diffusive scaling and, in the continuum limit, particles are not blocked or reflected by \partial\Lambda. Thus the model represents a system of particles under hard core interaction in the presence of a permeable membrane which slows down the passage of particles between two complementar regions.
