We show that if (X_s, s\geq 0) is a right-continuous process, Y_t=\int_0^t\d s X_s its integral process and \tau = (\tau_{\ell}, \ell \geq 0) a subordinator, then the time-changed process (Y_{\tau_{\ell}}, \ell\geq 0) allows to retrieve the information about (X_{\tau_{\ell}}, \ell\geq 0) when \tau is stable, but not when \tau is a gamma subordinator. This question has been motivated by a striking identity in law involving the Bessel clock taken at an independent inverse Gaussian variable.
