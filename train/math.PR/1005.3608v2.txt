We provide a suitable framework for the concept of finite quadratic variation for processes with values in a separable Banach space B using the language of stochastic calculus via regularizations, introduced in the case B= \R by the second author and P. Vallois. To a real continuous process X we associate the Banach valued process X(\cdot), called {\it window} process, which describes the evolution of X taking into account a memory \tau>0. The natural state space for X(\cdot) is the Banach space of continuous functions on [-\tau,0]. If X is a real finite quadratic variation process, an appropriated It\^o formula is presented, from which we derive a generalized Clark-Ocone formula for non-semimartingales having the same quadratic variation as Brownian motion. The representation is based on solutions of an infinite dimensional PDE.
