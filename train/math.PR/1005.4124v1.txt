Kipnis and Varadhan showed that for an additive functional, S_n say, of a reversible Markov chain the condition E(S_n^{2})/n \to \kappa \in (0,\infty) implies the convergence of the conditional distribution of S_n/\sqrt{E(S_n^{2}}), given the starting point, to the standard normal distribution. We revisit this question under the weaker condition, E(S_n^{2}) = n\ell(n), where \ell is a slowly varying function. It is shown by example that the conditional distribution of S_n/\sqrt{E(S_n^{2}}) need not converge to the standard normal distribution in this case; and sufficient conditions for convergence to a (possibly non-standard) normal distribution are developed.
