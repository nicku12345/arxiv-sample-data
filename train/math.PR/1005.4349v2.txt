Dzhaparidze and Spreij [5] showed that the quadratic variation of a semimartingale can be approximated using a randomized periodogram. We show that the same approximation is valid for a special class of continuous stochastic processes. This class contains both semimartingales and non-semimartingales. The motivation comes partially from the recent work by Bender et al. [2], where it is shown that the quadratic variation of the log-returns determines the hedging strategy.
