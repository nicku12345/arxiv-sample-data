Let (W,H,\mu) be the classical Wiener space, assume that U=I_W+u is an adapted perturbation of identity where the perturbation u is an equivalence class w.r.to the Wiener measure. We study several necessary and sufficient conditions for the almost sure invertibility of such maps. In particular the subclass of these maps who preserve the Wiener measure are characterized in terms of the corresponding innovation processes. We give the following application: let U be invertible and let \tau be stopping time. Define U^\tau as I_W+u^\tau where u^\tau is given by  u^\tau(t,w)=\int_0^t 1_{[0,\tau(w)]}(s)\dot{u}_s(w)ds\,.  We prove that U^\tau is also almost surely invertible. Note that this has immediate applications to stochastic differential equations.
