For a zero-delayed random walk on the real line, let \tau(x), N(x) and \rho(x) denote the first passage time into the interval (x,\infty), the number of visits to the interval (-\infty,x] and the last exit time from (-\infty,x], respectively. In the present paper, we provide ultimate criteria for the finiteness of exponential moments of these quantities. Moreover, whenever these moments are finite, we derive their asymptotic behaviour, as x \to \infty.
