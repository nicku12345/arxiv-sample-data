We consider a general polling model with N stations. The stations are served exhaustively and in cyclic order. Once a station queue falls empty, the server does not immediately switch to the next station. Rather, it waits at the station for the possible arrival of new work ("wait-and-see") and, in the case of this happening, it restarts service in an exhaustive fashion. The total time the server waits idly is set to be a fixed, deterministic parameter for each station. Switchover times and service times are allowed to follow some general distribution, respectively. In some cases, which can be characterised, this strategy yields strictly lower average queueing delay than for the exhaustive strategy, which corresponds to setting the "wait-and-see credit" equal to zero for all stations. This extends results of Pek\"oz (Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences 13 (1999)) and of Boxma et al. (Annals of Operations Research 112 (2002)). Furthermore, we give a lower bound for the delay for {\it all} strategies that allow the server to wait at the stations even though no work is present.
