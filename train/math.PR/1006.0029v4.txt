This paper considers extreme values attained by a centered, multidimensional Gaussian process X(t)= (X_1(t),\ldots,X_n(t)) minus drift d(t)=(d_1(t),\ldots,d_n(t)), on an arbitrary set T. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish the asymptotics of \[\log\mathbb P\left(\exists{t\in T}:\bigcap_{i=1}^n\left\{X_i(t)-d_i(t)>q_iu\right\}\right),\] for positive thresholds q_i>0, i=1,\ldots,n, and u\to\infty. Our findings generalize and extend previously known results for the single-dimensional and two-dimensional cases. A number of examples illustrate the theory.
