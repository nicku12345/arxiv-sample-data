We derive a functional central limit theorem (fclt) for normalised sums of a function of the partial sums of independent and identically distributed random variables. In particular, we show, using a technique presented in Huang and Zhang (Electron. Comm. Probab. 12 (2007), 51--56), that the result from Qi (Statist. Probab. Lett. 62 (2003), 93--100), for normalised products of partial sums, can be generalised in this fashion to a fclt.
