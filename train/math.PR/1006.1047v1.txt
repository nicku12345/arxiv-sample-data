A probability distribution \mu on \mathbb R ^d is selfdecomposable if its characteristic function \widehat\mu(z), z\in\mathbb R ^d, satisfies that for any b>1, there exists an infinitely divisible distribution \rho_b satisfying \widehat\mu(z) = \widehat\mu (b^{-1}z)\widehat\rho_b(z). This concept has been generalized to the concept of \alpha-selfdecomposability by many authors in the following way. Let \alpha\in\mathbb R. An infinitely divisible distribution \mu on \mathbb R ^d is \alpha-selfdecomposable, if for any b>1, there exists an infinitely divisible distribution \rho_b satisfying \widehat\mu(z) = \widehat \mu (b^{-1}z)^{b^{\alpha}}\widehat\rho_b(z). By denoting the class of all \alpha-selfdecomposable distributions on \mathbb R ^d by L^{\leftangle\alpha\rightangle}(\mathbb R ^d), we define in this paper a sequence of nested subclasses of L^{\leftangle\alpha\rightangle}(\mathbb R ^d), and investigate several properties of them by two ways. One is by using limit theorems and the other is by using mappings of infinitely divisible distributions.
