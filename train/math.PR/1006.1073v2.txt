For the partial sums (S_n) of independent random variables we define a stochastic process s_n(t):=(1/d_n)\sum_{k \le [nt]} ({S_k}/{k}-\mu) and prove that (1/{\log N})\sum_{n\le N}(1/n)\mathbf {I}\left\{s_n(t)\le x\right\} \to G_t(x)\quad \text{a.s.} if and only if (1/{\log N})\sum_{n\le N} (1/n)\mathbb{P}\left(s_n(t)\le x\right) \to G_t(x), for some sequence (d_n) and distribution G_t. We also prove an almost sure functional limit theorem for the product of partial sums of i.i.d. positive random variables attracted to an \alpha-stable law with \alpha\in (1,2].
