Consider the boundary case in a one-dimensional super-critical branching random walk. It is known that upon the survival of the system, the minimal position after n steps behaves in probability like {3\over 2} \log n when n\to \infty. We give a simple and self-contained proof of this result, based exclusively on elementary properties of sums of i.i.d. real-valued random variables.
