We study the asymptotic behavior of wavelet coefficients of random processes with long memory. These processes may be stationary or not and are obtained as the output of non--linear filter with Gaussian input. The wavelet coefficients that appear in the limit are random, typically non--Gaussian and belong to a Wiener chaos. They can be interpreted as wavelet coefficients of a generalized self-similar process.
