This paper develops asymptotic approximations of P(\int_Te^{f(t)}\,dt>b) as b\rightarrow\infty for a homogeneous smooth Gaussian random field, f, living on a compact d-dimensional Jordan measurable set T. The integral of an exponent of a Gaussian random field is an important random variable for many generic models in spatial point processes, portfolio risk analysis, asset pricing and so forth. The analysis technique consists of two steps: 1. evaluate the tail probability P(\int_{\Xi}e^{f(t)}\,dt>b) over a small domain \Xi depending on b, where \operatorname {mes}(\Xi)\rightarrow0 as b\rightarrow \infty and \operatorname {mes}(\cdot) is the Lebesgue measure; 2. with \Xi appropriately chosen, we show that P(\int_Te^{f(t)}\,dt>b)=(1+o(1))\operatorname{mes}(T)\times \operatorname{mes}^{-1}(\Xi)P(\int_{\Xi}e^{f(t)}\,dt>b).
