Stationary and isotropic iteration stable random tessellations are considered, which can be constructed by a random process of cell division. The collection of maximal polytopes at a fixed time t within a convex window W\subset{\Bbb R}^d is regarded and formulas for mean values, variances, as well as a characterization of certain covariance measures are proved. The focus is on the case d\geq 3, which is different from the planar one, treated separately in \cite{ST2}. Moreover, a multivariate limit theorem for the vector of suitably rescaled intrinsic volumes is established, leading in each component -- in sharp contrast to the situation in the plane -- to a non-Gaussian limit.
