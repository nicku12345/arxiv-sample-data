The objective of this paper is to extend an estimation method of parameters of the stable distributions in \rd to the regularly varying tails distributions in an arbitrary cone. The consistency and the asymptotic normality of estimators are proved. The sampling method of regrouping is modified to optimize the rate of convergence of estimators.
