Consider a system of particles performing branching Brownian motion with negative drift \mu = \sqrt{2 - \epsilon} and killed upon hitting zero. Initially there is one particle at x>0. Kesten showed that the process survives with positive probability if and only if \epsilon>0. Here we are interested in the asymptotics as \eps\to 0 of the survival probability Q_\mu(x). It is proved that if L= \pi/\sqrt{\epsilon} then for all x \in \R, \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} Q_\mu(L+x) = \theta(x) \in (0,1) exists and is a travelling wave solution of the Fisher-KPP equation. Furthermore, we obtain sharp asymptotics of the survival probability when x<L and L-x \to \infty. The proofs rely on probabilistic methods developed by the authors in a previous work. This completes earlier work by Harris, Harris and Kyprianou and confirms predictions made by Derrida and Simon, which were obtained using nonrigorous PDE methods.
