Let \{X_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}} be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables in \mathbb{Z}^d. Let S_k=X_1+...+X_k and Y_n(t) be the continuous process on [0,1] for which Y_n(k/n)=S_k/\sqrt{n} k=1,...,n and which is linearly interpolated elsewhere. The paper gives a generalization of results of Belkin, \cite{B72} on the weak limit laws of Y_n(t) conditioned to stay away from some small sets. In particular, it is shown that the diffusive limit of the random walk meander on \mathbb Z^d: d\ge 2 is the Brownian motion.
