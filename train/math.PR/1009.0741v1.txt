The following random process on \Z^4 is studied. At first visit to a site, the two first coordinates perform a (2-dimensional) simple random walk step. At further visits, it is the last two coordinates which perform a simple random walk step. We prove that this process is almost surely transient. The lower dimensional versions are discussed and various generalizations and related questions are proposed.
