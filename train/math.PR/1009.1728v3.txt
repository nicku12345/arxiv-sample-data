Given a sequence (M_{n},Q_{n})_{n\ge 1} of i.i.d. random variables with generic copy (M,Q) such that M is a regular d\times d matrix and Q takes values in \mathbb{R}^{d}, we consider the random difference equation (RDE) R_{n}=M_{n}R_{n-1}+Q_{n}, n\ge 1. Under suitable assumptions, this equation has a unique stationary solution R such that, for some \kappa>0 and some finite positive and continuous function K on S^{d-1}:=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}:|x|=1\},  \lim_{t \to \infty} t^{\kappa} P(xR>t)=K(x) for all x \in S^{d-1}  holds true. This result is originally due to Kesten and Le Page. The purpose of this article is to show how regeneration methods can be used to provide a much shorter argument (in particular for the positivity of K). It is based on a multidimensional extension of Goldie's implicit renewal theory.
