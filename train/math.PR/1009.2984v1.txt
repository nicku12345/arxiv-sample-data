One of the main uses of computers is to do statistical analysis of data. But, so far, the theory of statistics, and its noble mother, Probability theory, were all discovered and developed by lowly humans. No more! Computers can also develop probability theory (and statistics), and discover (and prove!) general theorems of much larger depth than those discovered by human-kind. Of course, at this time of writing, they still need these inferior humans to give them a head-start by teaching (i.e. programming) them to develop probability theory ab initio (only better!), but even this will soon be superfluous.
