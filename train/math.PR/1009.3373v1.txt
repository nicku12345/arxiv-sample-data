We give a representation of the solution for a stochastic linear equation of the form X_t=Y_t+\int_{(0,t]}X_{s-} \mathrm {d}{Z}_s where Z is a c\'adl\'ag semimartingale and Y is a c\'adl\'ag adapted process with bounded variation on finite intervals. As an application we study the case where Y and -Z are nondecreasing, jointly have stationary increments and the jumps of -Z are bounded by 1. Special cases of this process are shot-noise processes, growth collapse (additive increase, multiplicative decrease) processes and clearing processes. When Y and Z are, in addition, independent L\'evy processes, the resulting X is called a generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
