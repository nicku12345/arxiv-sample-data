In Dolera, Gabetta and Regazzini [Ann. Appl. Probab. 19 (2009) 186-201] it is proved that the total variation distance between the solution f(\cdot,t) of Kac's equation and the Gaussian density (0,\sigma^2) has an upper bound which goes to zero with an exponential rate equal to -1/4 as t\to+\infty. In the present paper, we determine a lower bound which decreases exponentially to zero with this same rate, provided that a suitable symmetrized form of f_0 has nonzero fourth cumulant \kappa_4. Moreover, we show that upper bounds like \bar{C}_{\delta}e^{-({1/4})t}\rho_{\delta}(t) are valid for some \rho_{\delta} vanishing at infinity when \int_{\mathbb{R}}|v|^{4+\delta}f_0(v)\,dv<+\infty for some \delta in [0,2[ and \kappa_4=0. Generalizations of this statement are presented, together with some remarks about non-Gaussian initial conditions which yield the insuperable barrier of -1 for the rate of convergence.
