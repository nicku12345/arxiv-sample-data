We show that a conditional characteristic function of generalized L\'evy stochastic areas can be viewed as a product a selfdecomposable distribution (i.e., L\'evy class L distribution) and its background driving characteristic function. This provides a stochastic interpretation for a ratio of some Bessel functions as well as examples of characteristic functions from van Dantzig class.
