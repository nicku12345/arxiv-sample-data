This is an addendum to the article of Qi Zhong cited above [arXiv:0705.2000]. It outlines how to apply the main result of that article to calculate the asymptotics of the expected energy of zeros of random polynomials on the Riemann sphere S^2 with respect to the log chordal distance \log [z, w]. The cited article did not calculate the asymptotic energy this way, but by an ad-hoc method, and the calculation contained some errors. The correct calculation here agrees (up to the stipulted remainder) with that of Armentano- Beltran-Shub.
