For a large class of absolutely continuous probabilities P it is shown that, for r>0, for n-optimal L^r(P)-codebooks \alpha_n, and any Voronoi partition V_{n,a} with respect to \alpha_n the local probabilities P(V_{n,a}) satisfy P(V_{a,n})\approx n^{-1} while the local L^r-quantization errors satisfy \int_{V_{n,a}}|x-a|^r dP(x)\approx n^{-(1+r/d)} as long as the partition sets V_{n,a} intersect a fixed compact set K in the interior of the support of P.
