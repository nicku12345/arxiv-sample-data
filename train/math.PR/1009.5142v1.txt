We extend results of Zeitouni-Zelditch on large deviations principles for zeros of Gaussian random polynomials s in one complex variable to certain non-Gaussian ensembles that we call P(\phi)_2 random polynomials. The probability measures are of the form e^{- S(f)} df where the actions S(f) are finite dimensional analgoues of those of P(\phi)_2 quantum field theory. The speed and rate function are the same as in the associated Gaussian case. As a corollary, we prove that the expected distribution of zeros in the P(\phi)_2 ensembles tends to the same equilibrium measure as in the Gaussian case.
