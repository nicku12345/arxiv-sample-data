Let \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_N be a M \times N random matrix defined by \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_N = \mathbf{B}_N + \sigma \mathbf{W}_N where \mathbf{B}_N is a uniformly bounded deterministic matrix and where \mathbf{W}_N is an independent identically distributed complex Gaussian matrix with zero mean and variance \frac{1}{N} entries. The purpose of this paper is to study the almost sure location of the eigenvalues \hat{\lambda}_{1,N} \geq ... \geq \hat{\lambda}_{M,N} of the Gram matrix {\boldsymbol \Sigma}_N {\boldsymbol \Sigma}_N^* when M and N converge to +\infty such that the ratio c_N = \frac{M}{N} converges towards a constant c > 0. The results are used in order to derive, using an alernative approach, known results concerning the behaviour of the largest eigenvalues of {\boldsymbol \Sigma}_N {\boldsymbol \Sigma}_N^* when the rank of \mathbf{B}_N remains fixed when M and N converge to +\infty.
