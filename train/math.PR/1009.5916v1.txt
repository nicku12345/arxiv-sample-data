In dimension d\geq3, we present a general assumption under which the renewal theorem established by Spitzer for i.i.d. sequences of centered nonlattice r.v. holds true. Next we appeal to an operator-type procedure to investigate the Markov case. Such a spectral approach has been already developed by Babillot, but the weak perturbation theorem of Keller and Liverani enables us to greatly weaken thehypotheses in terms of moment conditions. Our applications concern the v-geometrically ergodic Markov chains, the \rho-mixing Markov chains, and the iterative Lipschitz models, for which the renewal theorem of the i.i.d. case extends under the (almost) expected moment condition.
