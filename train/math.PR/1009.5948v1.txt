By proving an L^2-gradient estimate for the corresponding Galerkin approximations, the log-Harnack inequality is established for the semigroup associated to a class of stochastic Burgers equations. As applications, we derive the strong Feller property of the semigroup, the irreducibility of the solution, the entropy-cost inequality for the adjoint semigroup, and entropy upper bounds of the transition density.
