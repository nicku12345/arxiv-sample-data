We prove central and non-central limit theorems for the Hermite variations of the anisotropic fractional Brownian sheet W^{\alpha, \beta} with Hurst parameter (\alpha, \beta) \in (0,1)^2. When 0<\alpha \leq 1-\frac{1}{2q} or 0<\beta \leq 1-\frac{1}{2q} a central limit theorem holds for the renormalized Hermite variations of order q\geq 2, while for 1-\frac{1}{2q}<\alpha, \beta < 1 we prove that these variations satisfy a non-central limit theorem. In fact, they converge to a random variable which is the value of a two-parameter Hermite process at time (1,1).
