We consider two classes of random graphs: (a) Poissonian random graphs in which the n vertices in the graph have i.i.d.\ weights distributed as X, where \mathbb{E}(X) = \mu. Edges are added according to a product measure and the probability that a vertex of weight x shares and edge with a vertex of weight y is given by 1-e^{-xy/(\mu n)}. (b) A thinned configuration model in which we create a ground-graph in which the n vertices have i.i.d.\ ground-degrees, distributed as D, with \mathbb{E}(D) = \mu. The graph of interest is obtained by deleting edges independently with probability 1-p.   In both models the fraction of vertices in the largest connected component converges in probability to a constant 1-q, where q depends on X or D and p.   We investigate for which distributions X and D with given \mu and p, 1-q is maximized. We show that in the class of Poissonian random graphs, X should have all its mass at 0 and one other real, which can be explicitly determined. For the thinned configuration model D should have all its mass at 0 and two subsequent positive integers.
