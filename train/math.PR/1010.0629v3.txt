We are concerned with the supercritical contact process modified so that first infection occurs at a lower rate, it is known that the process survives with positive probability. Regarding the rightmost infected of the process started from one site infected and conditioned to survive, we specify a sequence of space-time points at which its behaviour regenerates and thus obtain the corresponding strong law and central limit theorem. We also extend complete convergence to this modified case.
