By the Cameron--Martin theorem, if a function f is in the Dirichlet space D, then B+f has the same a.s. properties as standard Brownian motion, B. In this paper we examine properties of B+f when f \notin D. We start by establishing a general 0-1 law, which in particular implies that for any fixed f, the Hausdorff dimension of the image and the graph of B+f are constants a.s. (This 0-1 law applies to any L\'evy process.) Then we show that if the function f is H\"older(1/2), then B+f is intersection equivalent to B. Moreover, B+f has double points a.s. in dimensions d\le 3, while in d\ge 4 it does not. We also give examples of functions which are H\"older with exponent less than 1/2, that yield double points in dimensions greater than 4. Finally, we show that for d \ge 2, the Hausdorff dimension of the image of B+f is a.s. at least the maximum of 2 and the dimension of the image of f.
