Using the framework of random walks in random scenery, Cohen and Samorodnitsky (2006) introduced a family of symmetric \alpha-stable motions called local time fractional stable motions. When \alpha=2, these processes are precisely fractional Brownian motions with 1/2<H<1. Motivated by random walks in alternating scenery, we find a "complementary" family of symmetric \alpha-stable motions which we call indicator fractional stable motions. These processes are complementary to local time fractional stable motions in that when \alpha=2, one gets fractional Brownian motions with 0<H<1/2.
