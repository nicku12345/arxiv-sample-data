We show that if \mathcal{X} is a complete separable metric space and \mathcal{C} is a countable family of Borel subsets of \mathcal{X} with finite VC dimension, then, for every stationary ergodic process with values in \mathcal{X}, the relative frequencies of sets C\in\mathcal{C} converge uniformly to their limiting probabilities. Beyond ergodicity, no assumptions are imposed on the sampling process, and no regularity conditions are imposed on the elements of \mathcal{C}. The result extends existing work of Vapnik and Chervonenkis, among others, who have studied uniform convergence for i.i.d. and strongly mixing processes. Our method of proof is new and direct: it does not rely on symmetrization techniques, probability inequalities or mixing conditions. The uniform convergence of relative frequencies for VC-major and VC-graph classes of functions under ergodic sampling is established as a corollary of the basic result for sets.
