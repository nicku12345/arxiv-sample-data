Consider random symmetric Toeplitz matrices T_{n}=(a_{i-j})_{i,j=1}^{n} with matrix entries a_{j}, j=0,1,2,..., being independent real random variables such that   \be \mathbb{E}[a_{j}]=0, \ \ \mathbb{E}[|a_{j}|^{2}]=1 \ \ \textrm{for}\,\ \ j=0,1,2,...,\ee (homogeneity of 4-th moments) \be{\kappa=\mathbb{E}[|a_{j}|^{4}],}\ee   \noindent and further (uniform boundedness)\be\sup\limits_{j\geq 0} \mathbb{E}[|a_{j}|^{k}]=C_{k}<\iy\ \ \ \textrm{for} \ \ \ k\geq 3.\ee   Under the assumption of a_{0}\equiv 0, we prove a central limit theorem for linear statistics of eigenvalues for a fixed polynomial with degree \geq 2. Without the assumption, the CLT can be easily modified to a possibly non-normal limit law. In a special case where a_{j}'s are Gaussian, the result has been obtained by Chatterjee for some test functions. Our derivation is based on a simple trace formula for Toeplitz matrices and fine combinatorial analysis. Our method can apply to other related random matrix models, including Hankel matrices and product of several Toeplitz matrices in a flavor of free probability theory etc. Since Toeplitz matrices are quite different from the Wigner and Wishart matrices, our results enrich this topic.
