The aim of this work is to extend and study a family of transformations between Laplace exponents of L\'evy processes which have been introduced recently in a variety of different contexts by Patie, Kyprianou and Patie, and, Gnedin, as well as in older work of Urbanik . We show how some specific instances of this mapping prove to be useful for a variety of applications.
