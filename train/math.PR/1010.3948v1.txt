Consider the sum Z = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \lambda_n (\eta_n - \mathbb{E}\eta_n), where \eta_n are i.i.d.~gamma random variables with shape parameter r > 0, and the \lambda_n's are predetermined weights. We study the asymptotic behavior of the tail \sum_{n=M}^\infty \lambda_n (\eta_n - \mathbb{E}\eta_n) which is asymptotically normal under certain conditions. We derive a Berry-Essen bound and Edgeworth expansions for its distribution function. We illustrate the effectiveness of these expansions on an infinite sum of weighted chi-squared distributions.
