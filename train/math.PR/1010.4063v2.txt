Suppose you and your friend both do n tosses of an unfair coin with probability of heads equal to \alpha. What is the behavior of the probability that you obtain at least d more heads than your friend if you make r additional tosses? We obtain asymptotic and monotonicity/convexity properties for this competing probability as a function of n, and demonstrate surprising phase transition phenomenons as parameters  d, r and \alpha vary. Our main tools are integral representations based on Fourier analysis.
