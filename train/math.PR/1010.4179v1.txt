In this note we analyze the relationship between the properties of von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions and expected utility functions. More precisely, we investigate which of the regularity and concavity assumptions usually imposed on the latter transfer to the former and vice versa. In particular we obtain that, in order for the expected utility functions to fulfill such classical properties, it is enough to assume them for the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions.
