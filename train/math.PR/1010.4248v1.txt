We derive a high-resolution formula for the quantization problem under Orlicz norm distortion. In this setting, the optimal point density solves a variational problem which comprises a function g:\mathbb{R}_+\to[0,\infty) characterizing the quantization complexity of the underlying Orlicz space. Moreover, asymptotically optimal codebooks induce a tight sequence of empirical measures. The set of possible accumulation points is characterized and in most cases it consists of a single element. In that case, we find convergence as in the classical setting.
