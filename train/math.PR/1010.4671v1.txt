We consider the model of a directed polymer pinned to a line of i.i.d. random charges, and focus on the interior of the delocalized phase. We first show that in this region, the partition function remains bounded. We then prove that for almost every environment of charges, the probability that the number of contact points in [0,n] exceeds c log(n) tends to 0 as n tends to infinity. Our proofs rely on recent results of Birkner, Greven, den Hollander (2010) and Cheliotis, den Hollander (2010).
