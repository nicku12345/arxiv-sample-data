We study the time that the simple exclusion process on the complete graph needs to reach equilibrium in terms of total variation distance. For the graph with n vertices and 1<<k<n/2 particles we show that the mixing time is of order (n/2)\log \min(k, \sqrt{n}), and that around this time, for any small positive epsilon the total variation distance drops from 1-epsilon to epsilon in a time window whose width is of order n (i.e. in a much shorter time). Our proof is purely probabilistic and self-contained.
