We consider the parabolic Anderson model (PAM) which is given by the equation \partial u/\partial t = \kappa\Delta u + \xi u with u\colon\, \Z^d\times [0,\infty)\to \R, where \kappa \in [0,\infty) is the diffusion constant, \Delta is the discrete Laplacian, and \xi\colon\,\Z^d\times [0,\infty)\to\R is a space-time random environment that drives the equation. The solution of this equation describes the evolution of a "reactant" u under the influence of a "catalyst" \xi. In the present paper we focus on the case where \xi is a system of n independent simple random walks each with step rate 2d\rho and starting from the origin. We study the \emph{annealed} Lyapunov exponents, i.e., the exponential growth rates of the successive moments of u w.r.t.\ \xi and show that these exponents, as a function of the diffusion constant \kappa and the rate constant \rho, behave differently depending on the dimension d. In particular, we give a description of the intermittent behavior of the system in terms of the annealed Lyapunov exponents, depicting how the total mass of u concentrates as t\to\infty. Our results are both a generalization and an extension of the work of G\"artner and Heydenreich 2006, where only the case n=1 was investigated.
