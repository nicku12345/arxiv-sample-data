In this paper, we define a new total order on R^N and use this order together with backward stochastic viability property(for short BSVP) to study the property of the generator of backward stochastic differential equation(for short BSDE) when the price of contingent claim can be represented by a BSDE in the no-arbitrage financial market. The main result is the necessary and sufficient condition for comparison theorem of multidimensional BSDEs under this order.
