We will give a proof of the following fact. If \mathfrak{A}_1 and \mathfrak{A}_2, \tilde \eta_1 and \tilde \eta_2, \xi_1 and \xi_2 are two examples of filtered probability spaces, time homogeneous compensated Poisson random measures, and progressively measurable Banach space valued processes such that the laws on L^p([0,T],{L}^{p}(Z,\nu ;E))\times \CM_I([0,T]\times Z) of the pairs (\xi_1,\eta_1) and (\xi_2,\eta_2) %, i=1,2, are equal, and u_1 and u_2 are the corresponding stochastic convolution processes, then the laws on  (\DD([0,T];X)\cap L^p([0,T];B)) \times L^p([0,T],{L}^{p}(Z,\nu ;E))\times \CM_I([0,T]\times Z) , where B \subset E \subset X, of the triples (u_i,\xi_i,\eta_i), i=1,2, are equal as well. By \DD([0,T];X) we denote the   Skorokhod space of X-valued processes.
