Let (Z_n) be a supercritical branching process in a random environment \xi. We study the convergence rates of the martingale W_n = Z_n/ E[Z_n| \xi] to its limit W. The following results about the convergence almost sur (a.s.), in law or in probability, are shown. (1) Under a moment condition of order p\in (1,2), W-W_n = o (e^{-na}) a.s. for some a>0 that we find explicitly; assuming only EW_1 \log W_1^{\alpha+1} < \infty for some \alpha >0, we have W-W_n = o (n^{-\alpha}) a.s.; similar conclusions hold for a branching process in a varying environment. (2) Under a second moment condition, there are norming constants a_n(\xi) (that we calculate explicitly) such that a_n(\xi) (W-W_n) converges in law to a non-degenerate distribution. (3) For a branching process in a finite state random environment, if W_1 has a finite exponential moment, then so does W, and the decay rate of P(|W-W_n| > \epsilon) is supergeometric.
