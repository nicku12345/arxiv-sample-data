For infinitely divisible distributions \rho on \mathbb{R}^d the stochastic integral mapping \Phi_f\rho is defined as the distribution of improper stochastic integral \int_0^{\infty-} f(s) dX_s^{(\rho)}, where f(s) is a non-random function and \{X_s^{(\rho)}\} is a L\'evy process on \mathbb{R}^d with distribution \rho at time 1. For three families of functions f with parameters, the limits of the nested sequences of the ranges of the iterations \Phi_f^n are shown to be some subclasses, with explicit description, of the class L_{\infty} of completely selfdecomposable distributions. In the critical case of parameter 1, the notion of weak mean 0 plays an important role. Examples of f with different limits of the ranges of \Phi_f^n are also given.
