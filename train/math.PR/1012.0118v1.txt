We consider a random walk S in the domain of attraction of a standard normal law Z, \textit{ie} there exists a positive sequence a_n such that S_n/a_n converges in law towards Z. The main result of this note is that the rescaled process (S_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}/a_n, t \geq 0) conditioned to stay non-negative, to start and to come back \textit{near the origin} converges in law towards the normalized brownian excursion.
