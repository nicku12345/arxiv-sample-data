In this paper, we reveal the branching structure for a non-homogeneous random walk with bounded jumps. The ladder time T_1, the first hitting time of [1,\infty) by the walk starting from 0, could be expressed in terms of a non-homogeneous multitype branching process. As an application of the branching structure,   we prove a law of large numbers of random walk in random environment with bounded jumps and specify the explicit invariant density for the Markov chain of ``the environment viewed from the particle" .The invariant density and the limit velocity could be expressed explicitly in terms of the environment.
