In this paper we introduce the well-balanced L\'{e}vy driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as a moving average process of the form X_t=\int \exp(-\lambda |t-u|)dL_u. In contrast to L\'{e}vy driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes the well-balanced form possesses continuous sample paths and an autocorrelation function which is decreasing not purely exponential but of the order \lambda |u|\exp(-\lambda |u|). Furthermore, depending on the size of \lambda it allows both for positive and negative correlation of increments. We indicate how the well-balanced Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process might be used as mean or volatility process in stochastic volatility models.
