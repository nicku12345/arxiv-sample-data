We study generalized branching random walks, which allow time dependence and local dependence between siblings. Under appropriate tail assumptions, we prove the tightness of F_n(\cdot-Med(F_n)), where F_n(\cdot) is the maxima distribution at time n and Med(F_n) is the median of F_n(\cdot). The main component in the argument is a proof of exponential decay of the right tail 1-F_n(\cdot-Med(F_n)).
