We consider transient nearest-neighbor random walks in random environment on Z. For a set of environments whose probability is converging to 1 as time goes to infinity, we describe the fluctuations of the hitting time of a level n, around its mean, in terms of an explicit function of the environment. Moreover, their limiting law is described using a Poisson point process whose intensity is computed. This result can be considered as the quenched analog of the classical result of Kesten, Kozlov and Spitzer [Compositio Math. 30 (1975) 145-168].
