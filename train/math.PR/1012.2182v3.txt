The paper bounds the number of tessellations with T-shaped vertices on a fixed set of k lines: tessellations are efficiently encoded, and algorithms retrieve them, proving injectivity. This yields existence of a completely random T-tessellation, as defined by Ki\^en Ki\^eu et al., and of its Gibbsian modifications. The combinatorial bound is sharp, but likely pessimistic in typical cases.
