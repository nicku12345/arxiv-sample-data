Consider a critical random multigraph \mathcal{G}_n with n vertices constructed by the configuration model such that its vertex degrees are independent random variables with the same distribution \nu (criticality means that the second moment of \nu is finite and equals twice its first moment). We specify the scaling limits of the ordered sequence of component sizes of \mathcal{G}_n as n tends to infinity in different cases. When \nu has finite third moment, the components sizes rescaled by n^{-2/3} converge to the excursion lengths of a Brownian motion with parabolic drift above past minima, whereas when \nu is a power law distribution with exponent \gamma\in(3,4), the components sizes rescaled by n^{-(\gamma -2)/(\gamma-1)} converge to the excursion lengths of a certain nontrivial drifted process with independent increments above past minima. We deduce the asymptotic behavior of the component sizes of a critical random simple graph when \nu has finite third moment.
