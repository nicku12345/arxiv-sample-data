This paper discusses a new notion of quadratic variation and covariation for Banach space valued processes (not necessarily semimartingales) and related It\^o formula. If \X and \Y take respectively values in Banach spaces B_{1} and B_{2} and \chi is a suitable subspace of the dual of the projective tensor product of B_{1} and B_{2} (denoted by (B_{1}\hat{\otimes}_{\pi}B_{2})^{\ast}), we define the so-called \chi-covariation of \X and \Y. If \X=\Y, the \chi-covariation is called \chi-quadratic variation. The notion of \chi-quadratic variation is a natural generalization of the one introduced by M\'etivier-Pellaumail and Dinculeanu which is too restrictive for many applications. In particular, if \chi is the whole space (B_{1}\hat{\otimes}_{\pi}B_{1})^{\ast} then the \chi-quadratic variation coincides with the quadratic variation of a B_{1}-valued semimartingale. We evaluate the \chi-covariation of various processes for several examples of \chi with a particular attention to the case B_{1}=B_{2}=C([-\tau,0]) for some \tau>0 and \X and \Y being \textit{window processes}. If X is a real valued process, we call window process associated with X the C([-\tau,0])-valued process \X:=X(\cdot) defined by X_t(y) = X_{t+y}, where y \in [-\tau,0]. The It\^o formula introduced here is an important instrument to establish a representation result of Clark-Ocone type for a class of path dependent random variables of type h=H(X_{T}(\cdot)), H:C([-T,0])\longrightarrow\R for not-necessarily semimartingales X with finite quadratic variation. This representation will be linked to a function u:[0,T]\times C([-T,0])\longrightarrow \mathbb{R} solving an infinite dimensional partial differential equation.
