We consider products of independent random matrices with independent entries. The limit distribution of the expected empirical distribution of eigenvalues of such products is computed. Let X^{(\nu)}_{jk},{}1\le j,r\le n, \nu=1,...,m be mutually independent complex random variables with \E X^{(\nu)}_{jk}=0 and \E {|X^{(\nu)}_{jk}|}^2=1. Let \mathbf X^{(\nu)} denote an n\times n matrix with entries [\mathbf X^{(\nu)}]_{jk}=\frac1{\sqrt{n}}X^{(\nu)}_{jk}, for 1\le j,k\le n.   Denote by \lambda_1,...,\lambda_n the eigenvalues of the random matrix \mathbf W:= \prod_{\nu=1}^m\mathbf X^{(\nu)} and define its empirical spectral distribution by  \mathcal F_n(x,y)=\frac1n\sum_{k=1}^n\mathbb I\{\re{\lambda_k}\le x,\im{\lambda_k\le y}\},  where \mathbb I\{B\} denotes the indicator of an event B.   We prove that the expected spectral distribution F_n^{(m)}(x,y)=\E \mathcal F_n^{(m)}(x,y) converges to the distribution function G(x,y) corresponding to the m-th power of the uniform distribution on the unit disc in the plane \mathbb R^2.
