We study the invariant measure of a discretized stochastic Allen-Cahn equation in d+1 dimensions in the low noise limit. We consider a cuboidal domain and impose the two stable phases as boundary conditions at two opposite faces. We then take a joint limit where the temperature and the mesh of the discretization go to zero while the size of the domain grows. Our main result is that the invariant measures concentrate exponentially fast around the minimizers of the free energy functional if the domain does not grow too fast.
