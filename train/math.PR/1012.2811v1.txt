Let L be a linear space of real bounded random variables on the probability space (\Omega,\mathcal{A},P_0). There is a finitely additive probability P on \mathcal{A}, such that P\sim P_0 and E_P(X)=0 for all X\in L, if and only if c\,E_Q(X)\leq\text{ess sup}(-X), X\in L, for some constant c>0 and (countably additive) probability Q on \mathcal{A} such that Q\sim P_0. A necessary condition for such a P to exist is \bar{L-L_\infty^+}\,\cap L_\infty^+=\{0\}, where the closure is in the norm-topology. If P_0 is atomic, the condition is sufficient as well. In addition, there is a finitely additive probability P on \mathcal{A}, such that P\ll P_0 and E_P(X)=0 for all X\in L, if and only if \text{ess sup}(X)\geq 0 for all X\in L.
