We present a unified approach to get explicit formulas for utility maximising strategies in Exponential Levy models. This approach is related to f-divergence minimal martingale measures and based on a new concept of preservation of the Levy property by f-divergence minimal martingale measures. For common f-divergences, i.e. functions which satisfy f"(x)= ax^ {\gamma},\, a>0, \, \gamma \in \mathbb R, we give the conditions for the existence of corresponding u_f- maximising strategies, as well as explicit formulas.
