We consider a class of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations also having a stochastic perturbation on the boundary and we show that when the diffusion rate is much larger than the rate of reaction, it is possible to replace the SPDE by a suitable one-dimensional stochastic differential equation. This replacement is possible under the assumption of spectral gap for the diffusion and is a result of averaging in the fast spatial transport. We also study the fluctuations around the averaged motion.
