For biased random walk on the infinite cluster in supercritical i.i.d.\ percolation on \Z^2, where the bias of the walk is quantified by a parameter \beta>1, it has been conjectured (and partly proved) that there exists a critical value \beta_c>1 such that the walk has positive speed when \beta<\beta_c and speed zero when \beta>\beta_c. In this paper, biased random walk on the infinite cluster of a certain translation invariant percolation process on \Z^2 is considered. The example is shown to exhibit the opposite behavior to what is expected for i.i.d.\ percolation, in the sense that it has a critical value \beta_c such that, for \beta<\beta_c, the random walk has speed zero, while, for \beta>\beta_c, the speed is positive. Hence the monotonicity in \beta that is part of the conjecture for i.i.d.\ percolation cannot be extended to general translation invariant percolation processes.
