In this paper, we compute the Laplace transform of occupation times (of the negative half-line) of spectrally negative L\'evy processes. Our results are extensions of known results for standard Brownian motion and jump-diffusion processes. The results are expressed in terms of the so-called scale functions of the spectrally negative L\'evy process and its Laplace exponent. Applications to insurance risk models are also presented.
