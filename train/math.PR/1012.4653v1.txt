We consider a discrete-time version of the parabolic Anderson model. This may be described as a model for a directed (1+d)-dimensional polymer interacting with a random potential, which is constant in the deterministic direction and i.i.d. in the d orthogonal directions. The potential at each site is a positive random variable with a polynomial tail at infinity. We show that, as the size of the system diverges, the polymer extremity is localized almost surely at one single point which grows ballistically. We give an explicit characterization of the localization point and of the typical paths of the model.
