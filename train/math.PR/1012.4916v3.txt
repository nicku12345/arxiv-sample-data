We consider a time inhomogeneous strong Markov process (\xi_t)_{t\ge 0} taking values in a Polish state space whose semigroup has a T-periodic structure. We give simple conditions which imply ergodicity of the grid chain (\xi_{kT})_{k\in \mathbb{N}_0} In case of d-dimensional possibly degenerate diffusions, the conditions are stated in terms of drift and diffusion coefficient of the process.
