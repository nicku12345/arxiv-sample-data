At each point of a Poisson point process of intensity \lambda in the hyperbolic place, center a ball of bounded random radius. Consider the probability P_r that from a fixed point, there is some direction in which one can reach distance r without hitting any ball. It is known \cite{BJST} that if \lambda is strictly smaller than a critical intensity \lambda_{gv} then P_r does not go to 0 as r\to \infty. The main result in this note shows that in the case \lambda=\lambda_{gv}, the probability of reaching distance larger than r decays essentially polynomial, while if \lambda>\lambda_{gv}, the decay is exponential. We also extend these results to various related models.
