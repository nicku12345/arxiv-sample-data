In \cite{[K]}, Kaimanovich defined an augmented rooted tree (X, E) corresponding to the Sierpinski gasket K, and showed that the Martin boundary of the simple random walk \{Z_n\} on it is homeomorphic to K. It is of interest to determine the hitting distributions v_{{\bf x}}(\cdot) = {\mathbb{P}}_{{\bf x}}\{\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} Z_n \in \cdot\} induced on K. Using a reflection principle based on the symmetries of K, we show that if the walk starts at the root of (X, E), the hitting distribution is exactly the normalized Hausdorff measure \mu on K. In particular, each v_{{\bf x}}, {\bf x} \in X, is absolutely continuous with respect to \mu. This answers a question of Kaimanovich [K, Problem 4.14]. The argument can be generalized to other symmetric self-similar sets.
