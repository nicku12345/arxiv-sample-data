Some equivalent gradient and Harnack inequalities of a diffusion semigroup are presented for the curvature-dimension condition of the associated generator. As applications, the first eigenvalue, the log-Harnack inequality, the heat kernel estimates, and the HWI inequality are derived by using the curvature-dimension condition. The transportation inequality for diffusion semigroups is also investigated.
