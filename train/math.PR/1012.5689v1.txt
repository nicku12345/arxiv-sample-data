Exponential convergence rates in the L^2-tail norm and entropy are characterized for the second quantization semigroups by using the corresponding base Dirichlet form. This supplements the well known result on the L^2-exponential convergence rate of second quantization semigroups. As applications, birth-death type processes on Poisson spaces and the path space of L\'evy processes are investigated.
