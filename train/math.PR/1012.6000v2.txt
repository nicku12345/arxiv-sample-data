In this paper we obtain the central limit theorem for triangular arrays of non-homogeneous Markov chains under a condition imposed to the maximal coefficient of correlation. The proofs are based on martingale techniques and a sharp lower bound estimate for the variance of partial sums. The results complement an important central limit theorem of Dobrushin based on the contraction coefficient.
