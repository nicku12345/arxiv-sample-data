We consider waves propagating in a randomly layered medium with long-range correlations. An example of such a medium is studied in \citeMS and leads, in particular, to an asymptotic travel time described in terms of a fractional Brownian motion. Here we study the asymptotic transmitted pulse under very general assumptions on the long-range correlations. In the framework that we introduce in this paper, we prove in particular that the asymptotic time-shift can be described in terms of non-Gaussian and/or multifractal processes.
