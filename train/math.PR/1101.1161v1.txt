Let \{X_n\} be a Markov chain with transition probability p_{ij}=a_{j-(i-1)^+},\forall i,j\ge 0, where a_j=0 provided j<0, a_0>0, a_0+a_1<1 and \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n=1. Let \mu=\sum_{n=1}^\infty na_n. It's known that \{X_n\} is positive recurrent when \mu<1; is null recurrent when \mu=1; and is transient when \mu>1. In this paper, we shall discuss the first returning speed and the last exit speed more precisely by means of \{a_n\}
