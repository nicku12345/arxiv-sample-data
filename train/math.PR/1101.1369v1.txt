We introduce and analyze multilevel Monte Carlo algorithms for the computation of \mathbb {E}f(Y), where Y=(Y_t)_{t\in[0,1]} is the solution of a multidimensional L\'{e}vy-driven stochastic differential equation and f is a real-valued function on the path space. The algorithm relies on approximations obtained by simulating large jumps of the L\'{e}vy process individually and applying a Gaussian approximation for the small jump part. Upper bounds are provided for the worst case error over the class of all measurable real functions f that are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the supremum norm. These upper bounds are easily tractable once one knows the behavior of the L\'{e}vy measure around zero. In particular, one can derive upper bounds from the Blumenthal--Getoor index of the L\'{e}vy process. In the case where the Blumenthal--Getoor index is larger than one, this approach is superior to algorithms that do not apply a Gaussian approximation. If the L\'{e}vy process does not incorporate a Wiener process or if the Blumenthal--Getoor index \beta is larger than \frac{4}{3}, then the upper bound is of order \tau^{-({4-\beta})/({6\beta})} when the runtime \tau tends to infinity. Whereas in the case, where \beta is in [1,\frac{4}{3}] and the L\'{e}vy process has a Gaussian component, we obtain bounds of order \tau^{-\beta/(6\beta-4)}. In particular, the error is at most of order \tau^{-1/6}.
