Let X be a stationary process with finite state-space A. Bressaud et al. recently provided a sufficient condition for the natural filtration of X to be standard when A has size 2. Their condition involves the conditional laws p(\cdot|x) of X_0 conditionally on the whole past (X_k)_{k \le -1}=x and controls the strength of the influence of the "old" past of the process on its present X_0. It involves the maximal gaps between p(\cdot|x) and p(\cdot|y) for infinite sequences x and y which coincide on their n last terms. In this paper, we first show that a slightly stronger result holds for any finite state-space. Then, we provide sufficient conditions for standardness based on average gaps instead of maximal gaps.
