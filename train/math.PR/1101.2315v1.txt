Using the approach of the splitting method developed by I. Gy\"ongy and N. Krylov for parabolic quasi linear equations, we study the speed of convergence for general complex-valued stochastic evolution equations. The approximation is given in general Sobolev spaces and the model considered here contains both the parabolic quasi-linear equations under some (non strict) stochastic parabolicity condition as well as linear Schr\"odinger equations
