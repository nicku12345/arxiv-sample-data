In this paper, Hunt's hypothesis (H) and Getoor's conjecture for L\'{e}vy processes are revisited. Let X be a L\'{e}vy process on \mathbf{R}^n with L\'{e}vy-Khintchine exponent (a,A,\mu). {First, we show that if A is non-degenerate then X satisfies (H). Second, under the assumption that \mu({\mathbf{R}^n\backslash \sqrt{A}\mathbf{R}^n})<\infty, we show that X satisfies (H) if and only if the equation  \sqrt{A}y=-a-\int_{\{x\in {\mathbf{R}^n\backslash \sqrt{A}\mathbf{R}^n}:\,|x|<1\}}x\mu(dx),\ y\in \mathbf{R}^n,  has at least one solution. Finally, we show that if X is a subordinator and satisfies (H) then its drift coefficient must be 0.}
