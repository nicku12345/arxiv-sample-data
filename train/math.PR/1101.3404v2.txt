We investigate Lyapunov exponents of Brownian motion in a nonnegative Poissonian potential V. The Lyapunov exponent depends on the potential V and our interest lies in the decay rate of the Lyapunov exponent if the potential V tends to zero. In our model the random potential V is generated by locating at each point of a Poisson point process with intensity \nu a bounded compactly supported nonnegative function W. We show that for sequences of potentials V_n for which \nu_n \|W_n\|_1 \sim D/n for some constant D > 0 (n \to \infty), the decay rates to zero of the quenched and annealed Lyapunov exponents coincide and equal c n^{-1/2} where the constant c is computed explicitly. Further we are able to estimate the quenched Lyapunov exponent norm from above by the corresponding norm for the averaged potential.
