We discuss asymptotic properties of a family of discrete probability measures which may be used to model particle configurations with a wall on a set of discrete nodes. The correlations are shown to be determinantal and are expressed in terms of discrete orthogonal polynomials. As an application we study random tilings of the half-hexagon or, equivalently, configurations of non-intersecting lattice paths above a wall, so called water melons.
