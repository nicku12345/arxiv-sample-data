The theory of integration over infinite-dimensional spaces is known to encounter serious difficulties. Categorical ideas seem to arise naturally on the path to a remedy. Such an approach was suggested and initiated by Segal in his pioneering article \cite{segal}. In our paper we follow his ideas from a different perspective, slightly more categorical, and strongly inspired by the point-free topology.   First, we develop a general (point-free) concept of measurability (extending the standard Lebesgue integration when applying to the classical \sigma-algebra). Second (and here we have a major difference from the classical theory), we prove that every finite-additive function \mu with values in [0,1] can be extended to a measure on an abstract \sigma-algebra; this correspondence is functorial and yields uniqueness. As an example we show that the Segal space can be characterized by completely canonical data. Furthermore, from our results it follows that a satisfactory point-free integration arises everywhere where we have a finite-additive probability function on a Boolean algebra.
