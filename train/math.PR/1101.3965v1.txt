We consider the area A=\int_0^{\infty}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} X_i(t)\right) \d t of a self-similar fragmentation process \X=(\X(t), t\geq 0) with negative index. We characterize the law of A by an integro-differential equation. The latter may be viewed as the infinitesimal version of a recursive distribution equation that arises naturally in this setting. In the case of binary splitting, this yields a recursive formula for the entire moments of A which generalizes known results for the area of the Brownian excursion.
