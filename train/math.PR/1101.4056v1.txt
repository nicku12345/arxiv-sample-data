Let \{X_1, X_2, ... \} be a sequence of dependent heavy-tailed random variables with distributions F_1, F_2,... on (-\infty,\infty), and let \tau be a nonnegative integer-valued random variable independent of the sequence \{X_k, k \ge 1\}. In this framework, we study the asymptotic behavior of the tail probabilities of the quantities X_{(n)} = \max_{1\le k \le n} X_k, S_n =\sum_{k=1}^n X_k and S_{(n)}=\max_{1\le k\le n} S_k for n>1, and for those of their randomized versions X_{(\tau)}, S_{\tau} and S_{(\tau)}. We also consider applications of the results obtained to some commonly-used risk processes.
