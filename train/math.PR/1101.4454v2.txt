Let h be a three times partially differentiable function on R^n, let X=(X_1,\dots,X_n) be a collection of real-valued random variables and let Z=(Z_1,\dots,Z_n) be a multivariate Gaussian vector. In this article, we develop Stein's method to give error bounds on the difference E h(X) - E h(Z) in cases where the coordinates of X are not necessarily independent, focusing on the high dimensional case n\to\infty. In order to express the dependency structure we use Stein couplings, which allows for a broad range of applications, such as classic occupancy, local dependence, Curie-Weiss model etc. We will also give applications to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and last passage percolation on thin rectangles.
