We consider the regularity of sample paths of Volterra processes. These processes are defined as stochastic integrals  M(t)=\int_{0}^{t}F(t,r)dX(r), \ \ t \in \mathds{R}_{+},  where X is a semimartingale and F is a deterministic real-valued function. We derive the information on the modulus of continuity for these processes under regularity assumptions on the function F and show that M(t) has "worst" regularity properties at times of jumps of X(t). We apply our results to obtain the optimal H\"older exponent for fractional L\'{e}vy processes.
