This is a continuation of the expository article \cite{krp} with some new remarks. Let S_n denote the set of all Gaussian states in the complex Hilbert space L^2 (\mathbb{R}^n), K_n the convex set of all momentum and position covariance matrices of order 2n in Gaussian states and let \mathcal{G}_n be the group of all unitary operators in L^2 (\mathbb{R}^n) conjugations by which leave S_n invariant. Here we prove the following results. K_n is a closed convex set for which a matrix S is an extreme point if and only if S=\frac{1}{2} L^{T} L for some L in the symplectic group Sp (2n, \mathbb{R}). Every element in K_n is of the form \frac{1}{2} (L^{T} L + M^{T} M) for some L,M in Sp (2n, \mathbb{R}). Every Gaussian state in L^2 (\mathbb{R}^n) can be purified to a Gaussian state in L^2 (\mathbb{R}^{2n}). Any element U in the group \mathcal{G}_n is of the form U = \lambda W ({\bm {\alpha}}) \Gamma (L) where \lambda is a complex scalar of modulus unity, {\bm {\alpha}} \in \mathbb{C}^n, L \in Sp (2n, \mathbb{R}), W({\bm {\alpha}}) is the Weyl operator corresponding to {\bm {\alpha}}  and \Gamma (L) is a unitary operator which implements the Bogolioubov automorphism of the Lie algebra generated by the canonical momentum and position observables induced by the symplectic linear transformation L.
