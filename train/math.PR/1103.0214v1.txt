We consider a random N-step polymer under the influence of an attractive interaction with the origin and derive a limit law -- after suitable shifting and norming -- for the length of the longest excursion towards the Gumbel distribution. The embodied law of large numbers in particular implies that the longest excursion is of order \log N long. The main tools are taken from extreme value theory and renewal theory.
