In this paper we study the supremum functional M_t=\sup_{0\le s\le t}X_s, where X_t, t\ge0, is a one-dimensional L\'{e}vy process. Under very mild assumptions we provide a simple, uniform estimate of the cumulative distribution function of M_t. In the symmetric case we find an integral representation of the Laplace transform of the distribution of M_t if the L\'{e}vy-Khintchin exponent of the process increases on (0,\infty).
