Discretely sampled variance and volatility swaps trade actively in OTC markets. To price these swaps, the continuously sampled approximation is often used to simplify the computations. The purpose of this paper is to study the conditions under which this approximation is valid. Our first set of theorems characterize the conditions under which the discretely sampled swap values are finite, given the values of the continuous approximations exist. Surprisingly, for some otherwise reasonable price processes, the discretely sampled swap prices do not exist, thereby invalidating the approximation. Examples are provided. Assuming further that both swap values exist, we study sufficient conditions under which the discretely sampled values converge to their continuous counterparts. Because of its popularity in the literature, we apply our theorems to the 3/2 stochastic volatility model. Although we can show finiteness of all swap values, we can prove convergence of the approximation only for some parameter values.
