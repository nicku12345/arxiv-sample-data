T. E. Harris was a pioneer par excellence in many fields of probability theory. In this paper, we give a brief survey of the many fundamental contributions of Harris to the theory of branching processes, starting with his doctoral work at Princeton in the late forties and culminating in his fundamental book "The Theory of Branching Processes," published in 1963.
