In this paper we are concerned with the stochastic partial differential equations of super-fast diffusion processes describing behavior of plasma dX(t)-{\Delta}ln(X(t)+1)dt=\surd(Q)dW(t), in (0,T)\timesO, where O is a bounded open subset of R. We define a strong solution adequate to the properties of the natural logarithm and we prove the corresponding existence and uniqueness result.
