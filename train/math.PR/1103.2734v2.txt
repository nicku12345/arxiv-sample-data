We analyze combinatorial optimization problems over a pair of random point sets of equal cardinal. Typical examples include the matching of minimal length, the traveling salesperson tour constrained to alternate between points of each set, or the connected bipartite r-regular graph of minimal length. As the cardinal of the sets goes to infinity, we investigate the convergence of such bipartite functionals.
