We prove a law of large numbers for a class of \Z^d-valued random walks in dynamic random environments, including non-elliptic examples. We assume for the random environment a mixing property called \emph{conditional cone-mixing} and that the random walk tends to stay inside wide enough space-time cones. The proof is based on a generalization of a regeneration scheme developed by Comets and Zeitouni for static random environments and adapted by Avena, den Hollander and Redig to dynamic random environments. A number of one-dimensional examples are given. In some cases, the sign of the speed can be determined.
