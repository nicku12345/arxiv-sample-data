We show that any strictly quasi-regular generalized Dirichlet form that satisfies the mild structural condition D3 is associated to a Hunt process, and that the associated Hunt process can be approximated by a sequence of multivariate Poisson processes. This also gives a new proof for the existence of a Hunt process associated to a strictly quasi-regular generalized Dirichlet form that satisfies SD3 and extends all previous results.
