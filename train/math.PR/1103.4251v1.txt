We study the exit time \tau=\tau_{(0,\infty)} for 1-dimensional strictly stable processes and express its Laplace transform at t^\alpha as the Laplace transform of a positive random variable with explicit density. Consequently, \tau satisfies some multiplicative convolution relations. For some stable processes, e.g. for the symmetric \frac23-stable process, explicit formulas for the Laplace transform and the density of \tau are obtained as an application.
