Random walks in random scenery are processes defined by Z_n:=\sum_{k=1}^n\xi_{X_1+...+X_k}, where (X_k,k\ge 1) and (\xi_y,y\in{\mathbb Z}^d) are two independent sequences of i.i.d. random variables with values in {\mathbb Z}^d and \mathbb R respectively. We suppose that the distributions of X_1 and \xi_0 belong to the normal basin of attraction of stable distribution of index \alpha\in(0,2] and \beta\in(0,2]. When d=1 and \alpha\ne 1, a functional limit theorem has been established in \cite{KestenSpitzer} and a local limit theorem in \cite{BFFN}. In this paper, we establish the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions and a local limit theorem when \alpha=d (i.e. \alpha = d=1 or \alpha=d=2) and \beta \in (0,2]. Let us mention that functional limit theorems have been established in \cite{bolthausen} and recently in \cite{DU} in the particular case where \beta=2 (respectively for \alpha=d=2 and \alpha=d=1).
