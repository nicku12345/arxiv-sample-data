This note continues paper of Denisov and Wachtel (2010), where we have constructed a k-dimensional random walk conditioned to stay in the Weyl chamber of type A. The construction was done under the assumption that the original random walk has k-1 moments. In this note we continue the study of killed random walks in the Weyl chamber, and assume that the tail of increments is regularly varying of index \alpha<k-1. It appears that the asymptotic behaviour of random walks is different in this case. We determine the asymptotic behaviour of the exit time, and, using thisinformation, construct a conditioned process which lives on a partial compactification of the Weyl chamber.
