Let X be a \mu-symmetric Hunt process on a LCCB space E. For an open set G \subseteq E, let \tau_G be the exit time of X from G and A^G be the generator of the process killed when it leaves G. Let r:[0,\infty[\to[0,\infty[ and R (t) = \int_0^t r(s) ds.   We give necessary and sufficient conditions for \E_{\mu} R (\tau_G)<\infty in terms of the behavior near the origin of the spectral measure of -A^G.   When r(t)=t^l, l>0, by means of this condition we derive the Nash inequality for the killed process.   In the case of one-dimensional diffusions, this permits to show that the existence of moments of order l for \tau_G implies the Nash inequality of order p=\frac{l+2}{l+1} for the whole process. The associated rate of convergence of the semi-group in L^2(\mu) is bounded by t^{-(l+1)}.   For diffusions in dimension greater than one, we obtain the Nash inequality of the same order under an additional non-degeneracy condition (local Poincar\'e inequality). Finally, we show for general Hunt processes that the Nash inequality giving rise to a convergence rate of order t^{-(l+1)} of the semi-group, implies the existence of moments of order l+1 -\epsilon for \tau_G, for all  \epsilon>0.
