We consider the solution to the parabolic Anderson model with homogeneous initial condition in large time-dependent boxes. We derive stable limit theorems, ranging over all possible scaling parameters, for the rescaled sum over the solution depending on the growth rate of the boxes. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions for a strong law of large numbers.
