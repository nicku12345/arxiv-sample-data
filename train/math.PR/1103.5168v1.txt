We show that various identities from [1] and [3] involving Gould-Hopper polynomials can be deduced from the real but also complex orthogonal invariance of multivariate Gaussian distributions. We also deduce from this principle a useful stochastic representation for the inner product of two non-centered Gaussian vectors and two non-centered Gaussian matrices. [1] J. Daboul, S. S.
