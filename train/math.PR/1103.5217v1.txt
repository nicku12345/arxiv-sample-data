We consider multitype branching processes arising in the study of random laminations of the disk. We classify these processes according to their subcritical or supercritical behavior and provide Kolmogorov-type estimates in the critical case corresponding to the random recursive lamination process of [1]. The proofs use the infinite dimensional Perron-Frobenius theory and quasi-stationary distributions.
