We consider a system of independent branching random walks on \R which start off a Poisson point process with intensity of the form e_{\lambda}(du)=e^{-\lambda u}du, where \lambda\in\R is chosen in such a way that the overall intensity of particles is preserved. Denote by \chi the cluster distribution and let \phi be the log-Laplace transform of the intensity of \chi. If \lambda\phi'(\lambda)>0, we show that the system is persistent (stable) meaning that the point process formed by the particles in the n-th generation converges as n\to\infty to a non-trivial point process \Pi_{e_{\lambda}}^{\chi} with intensity e_{\lambda}. If \lambda\phi'(\lambda)<0, then the branching population suffers local extinction meaning that the limiting point process is empty. We characterize (generally, non-stationary) point processes on \R which are cluster-invariant with respect to the cluster distribution \chi as mixtures of the point processes \Pi_{ce_{\lambda}}^{\chi} over c>0 and \lambda\in K_{\text{st}}, where K_{\text{st}}=\{\lambda\in\R: \phi(\lambda)=0, \lambda\phi'(\lambda)>0\}.
