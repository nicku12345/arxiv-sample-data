Multivariate random fields whose distributions are invariant under operator-scalings in both time-domain and state space are studied. Such random fields are called operator-self-similar random fields and their scaling operators are characterized. Two classes of operator-self-similar stable random fields X=\{X(t), t \in \R^d\} with values in \R^m are constructed by utilizing homogeneous functions and stochastic integral representations.
