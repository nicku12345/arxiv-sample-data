In this paper we investigate Gaussian queues in the light-traffic and in the heavy-traffic regime. The setting considered is that of a centered Gaussian process X\equiv\{X(t):t\in\mathbb R\} with stationary increments and variance function \sigma^2_X(\cdot), equipped with a deterministic drift c>0, reflected at 0: \[Q_X^{(c)}(t)=\sup_{-\infty<s\le t}(X(t)-X(s)-c(t-s)).\] We study the resulting stationary workload process Q^{(c)}_X\equiv\{Q_X^{(c)}(t):t\ge0\} in the limiting regimes c\to 0 (heavy traffic) and c\to\infty (light traffic). The primary contribution is that we show for both limiting regimes that, under mild regularity conditions on the variance function, there exists a normalizing function \delta(c) such that Q^{(c)}_X(\delta(c)\cdot)/\sigma_X(\delta(c)) converges to a non-trivial limit in C[0,\infty).
