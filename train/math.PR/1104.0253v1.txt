We consider a meanfield system of interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions with selection and rare mutation on the geographic space \{1,2,...,N\}. The type 1 has fitness 0, type 2 has fitness 1 and (rare) mutation occurs from type 1 to 2 at rate m...N^{-1}, selection is at rate s>0. The system starts in the state concentrated on type 1, the state of low fitness. We investigate this system for N \to \infty on the original and large time scales.   We show that for some \alpha \in (0,s) at times \alpha^{-1} \log N+t, t \in \R, N \to \infty the emergence of type 2 (positive global type-2 intensity) at a global level occurs, while at times \alpha^{-1} \log N+t_N, with t_N \to \infty we get fixation on type 2 and on the other hand with t_N \to -\infty as N \to \infty asymptotically only type 1 is present.   We describe the transition from emergence to fixation in the time scale \alpha^{-1} \log N+t, t \in \R in the limit N \to \infty by a McKean-Vlasov random entrance law. This entrance law behaves for t \to -\infty like ^\ast\CW e^{-\alpha |t|} for a positive random variable ^\ast \CW. The formation of small droplets of type-2 dominated sites in times o(\log N), or \gamma...\log N, \gamma \in (0,\alpha^{-1}) is described in the limit N \to \infty by a measure-valued process following a stochastic equation driven by Poissonian type noise which we identify explicitly. The total mass of this limiting (N \to \infty) droplet process grows like \CW^\ast e^{\alpha t} as t \to \infty. We prove that exit behaviour from the small time scale equals the entrance behaviour in the large time scale, namely   \CL[^\ast\CW] =\CL[\CW^\ast].
