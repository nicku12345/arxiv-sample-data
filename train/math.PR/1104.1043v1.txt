For a hyperbolic Brownian motion on the Poincar\'e half-plane \mathbb{H}^2, starting from a point of hyperbolic coordinates z=(\eta, \alpha) inside a hyperbolic disc U of radius \bar{\eta}, we obtain the probability of hitting the boundary \partial U at the point (\bar \eta,\bar \alpha). For \bar{\eta} \to \infty we derive the asymptotic Cauchy hitting distribution on \partial \mathbb{H}^2 and for small values of \eta and \bar \eta we obtain the classical Euclidean Poisson kernel. The exit probabilities \mathbb{P}_z\{T_{\eta_1}<T_{\eta_2}\} from a hyperbolic annulus in \mathbb{H}^2 of radii \eta_1 and \eta_2 are derived and the transient behaviour of hyperbolic Brownian motion is considered. Similar probabilities are calculated also for a Brownian motion on the surface of the three dimensional sphere.   For the hyperbolic half-space \mathbb{H}^n we obtain the Poisson kernel of a ball in terms of a series involving Gegenbauer polynomials and hypergeometric functions. For small domains in \mathbb{H}^n we obtain the n-dimensional Euclidean Poisson kernel. The exit probabilities from an annulus are derived also in the n-dimensional case.
