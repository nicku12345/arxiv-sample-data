We show that for a typical coordinate projection of a subgaussian class of functions, the infimum over signs \inf_{(\epsilon_i)}{\sup_{f\in F}}|{\sum_{i=1}^k\epsilon_i}f(X_i)| is asymptotically smaller than the expectation over signs as a function of the dimension k, if the canonical Gaussian process indexed by F is continuous. To that end, we establish a bound on the discrepancy of an arbitrary subset of \mathbb {R}^k using properties of the canonical Gaussian process the set indexes, and then obtain quantitative structural information on a typical coordinate projection of a subgaussian class.
