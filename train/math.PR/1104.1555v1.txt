We study the problem of finding an universal estimation scheme h_n:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}, n=1,2,... which will satisfy \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}{\frac{1}{t}}\sum_{i=1}^t|h_ i(X_0,X_1,...,X_{i-1})-E(X_i|X_0,X_1,...,X_{i-1})|^p=0 a.s. for all real valued stationary and ergodic processes that are in L^p. We will construct a single such scheme for all 1<p\le\infty, and show that for p=1 mere integrability does not suffice but L\log^+L does.
