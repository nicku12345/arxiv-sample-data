We prove that uniform random quadrangulations of the sphere with n faces, endowed with the usual graph distance and renormalized by n^{-1/4}, converge as n\to\infty in distribution for the Gromov-Hausdorff topology to a limiting metric space. We validate a conjecture by Le Gall, by showing that the limit is (up to a scale constant) the so-called {\em Brownian map}, which was introduced by Marckert & Mokkadem and Le Gall as the most natural candidate for the scaling limit of many models of random plane maps. The proof relies strongly on the concept of {\em geodesic stars} in the map, which are configurations made of several geodesics that only share a common endpoint and do not meet elsewhere.
