We consider moments of the return times (or first hitting times) in a discrete time discrete space Markov chain. It is classical that the finiteness of the first moment of a return time of one state implies the finiteness of the first moment of the first return time of any other state. We extend this statement to moments with respect to a function f, where f satisfies a certain, best possible condition. This generalizes results of K. L. Chung (1954) who considered the functions f(n)=n^p and wondered "[...] what property of the power n^p lies behind this theorem [...]" (see Chung (1967), p. 70). We exhibit that exactly the functions that do not increase exponentially -- neither globally nor locally -- fulfill the above statement.
