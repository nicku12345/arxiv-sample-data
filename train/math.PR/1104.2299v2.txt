The Bernoulli sieve is the infinite "balls-in-boxes" occupancy scheme with random frequencies P_k=W_1...W_{k-1}(1-W_k), where (W_k)_{k\in\mn} are independent copies of a random variable W taking values in (0,1). Assuming that the number of balls equals n, let L_n denote the number of empty boxes within the occupancy range. The paper proves that, under a regular variation assumption, L_n, properly normalized without centering, weakly converges to a functional of an inverse stable subordinator. Proofs rely upon the observation that (\log P_k) is a perturbed random walk. In particular, some results for general perturbed random walks are derived. The other result of the paper states that whenever L_n weakly converges (without normalization) the limiting law is mixed Poisson.
