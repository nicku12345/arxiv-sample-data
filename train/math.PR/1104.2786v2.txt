Let  \{X_j, j\in \Z\} be a Gaussian stationary sequence having a spectral function F of infinite type. Then for all n and z\ge 0, \P\Big\{\sup_{j=1}^n |X_j|\le z \Big\}\le \Big(\int_{-z/\sqrt{G(f)}}^{z/\sqrt{G(f)}} e^{-x^2/2}\frac{\dd x}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \Big)^n, where  G(f) is the geometric mean of the Radon Nycodim derivative of the absolutely continuous part f of F. The proof uses properties of finite Toeplitz forms. Let  \{X(t), t\in \R\} be a sample continuous stationary Gaussian process with covariance function \g(u) .   We also show that there exists an absolute constant K such that for all T>0, a>0 with T\ge \e(a), \P\Big\{\sup_{0\le s,t\le T} |X(s)-X(t)|\le a\Big\} \le \exp \Big \{-{KT \over \e(a) p(\e(a))}\Big\}   , where \e (a)= \min\big\{b>0: \d (b)\ge a\big\}, \d (b)=\min_{u\ge 1}\{\sqrt{2(1-\g((ub))}, u\ge 1\}, and    p(b) = 1+\sum_{j=2}^\infty {|2\g (jb)-\g ((j-1)b)-\g ((j+1)b)| \over 2(1-\g(b))}. The proof is based on some decoupling inequalities arising from Brascamp-Lieb inequality. Both approaches are developed and compared on examples. Several other related results are established.
