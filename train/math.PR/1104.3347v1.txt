We investigate the second order asymptotic behavior of trimmed sums T_n=\frac 1n \sum_{i=\kn+1}^{n-\mn}\xin, where \kn, \mn are sequences of integers, 0\le \kn < n-\mn \le n, such that \min(\kn, \mn) \to \infty, as \nty, the \xin's denote the order statistics corresponding to a sample X_1,...,X_n of n i.i.d. random variables. In particular, we focus on the case of slightly trimmed sums with vanishing trimming percentages, i.e. we assume that \max(\kn,\mn)/n\to 0, as \nty, and heavy tailed distribution F, i.e. the common distribution of the observations F is supposed to have an infinite variance.   We derive optimal bounds of Berry -- Esseen type of the order O\bigl(r_n^{-1/2}\bigr), r_n=\min(\kn,\mn), for the normal approximation to T_n and, in addition, establish one-term expansions of the Edgeworth type for slightly trimmed sums and their studentized versions.   Our results supplement previous work on first order approximations for slightly trimmed sums by Csorgo, Haeusler and Mason (1988) and on second order approximations for (Studentized) trimmed sums with fixed trimming percentages by Gribkova and Helmers (2006, 2007).
