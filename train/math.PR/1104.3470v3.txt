We study the renormalized real sample covariance matrix H=X^TX/\sqrt{MN}-\sqrt{M/N} with N/M\rightarrow0 as N, M\rightarrow \infty in this paper. And we always assume M=M(N). Here X=[X_{jk}]_{M\times N} is an M\times N real random matrix with i.i.d entries, and we assume \mathbb{E}|X_{11}|^{5+\delta}<\infty with some small positive \delta. The Stieltjes transform m_N(z)=N^{-1}Tr(H-z)^{-1} and the linear eigenvalue statistics of H are considered. We mainly focus on the asymptotic expansion of \mathbb{E}\{m_N(z)\} in this paper. Then for some fine test function, a central limit theorem for the linear eigenvalue statistics of H is established. We show that the variance of the limiting normal distribution coincides with the case of a real Wigner matrix with Gaussian entries.
