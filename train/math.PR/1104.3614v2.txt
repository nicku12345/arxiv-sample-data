Consider a symmetric unitary random matrix V=(v_{ij})_{1 \le i,j \le N} from a circular orthogonal ensemble. In this paper, we study moments of a single entry v_{ij}. For a diagonal entry v_{ii} we give the explicit values of the moments, and for an off-diagonal entry v_{ij} we give leading and subleading terms in the asymptotic expansion with respect to a large matrix size N. Our technique is to apply the Weingarten calculus for a Haar-distributed unitary matrix.
