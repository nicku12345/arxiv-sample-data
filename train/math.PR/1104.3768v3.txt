Let W denote d-dimensional Brownian motion. We find an explicit formula for the essential supremum of Hausdorff dimension of W(E)\cap F, where E\subset(0,\infty) and F\subset \mathbf {R}^d are arbitrary nonrandom compact sets. Our formula is related intimately to the thermal capacity of Watson [Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. (3) 37 (1978) 342-362]. We prove also that when d\ge2, our formula can be described in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of E\times F, where E\times F is viewed as a subspace of space time.
