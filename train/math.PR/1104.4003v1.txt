We study a generalization of the evolution model proposed by Guiol, Machado and Schinazi (arXiv:0909.2108). In our model, at each moment of time a random number of species is either born or removed from the system; the species to be removed are those with the lower fitnesses, fitnesses being some numbers in [0,1]. We show that under some conditions, a set of species approaches (in some sense) a sample from a uniform distribution on [f,1] for some f\in [0,1), and that the total number of species forms a recurrent process in most other cases.
