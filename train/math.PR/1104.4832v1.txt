We study the universality of the eigenvalue statistics of the covariance matrices \frac{1}{n}M^* M where M is a large p\times n matrix obeying condition \bf{C1}. In particular, as an application, we prove a variant of universality results regarding the smallest singular value of M_{p,n}. This paper is an extension of the results in \cite{tvcovariance} from the bulk of the spectrum up to the edge.
