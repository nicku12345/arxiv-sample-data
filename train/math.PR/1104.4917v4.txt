Let X be a locally compact Polish space and let m be a reference Radon measure on X. Let \Gamma_X denote the configuration space over X, that is, the space of all locally finite subsets of X. A point process on X is a probability measure on \Gamma_X. A point process \mu is called determinantal if its correlation functions have the form k^{(n)}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\det[K(x_i,x_j)]_{i,j=1,\ldots,n}. The function K(x,y) is called the correlation kernel of the determinantal point process \mu. Assume that the space X is split into two parts: X=X_1\sqcup X_2. A kernel K(x,y) is called J-Hermitian if it is Hermitian on X_1\times X_1 and X_2\times X_2, and K(x,y)=-\overline{K(y,x)} for x\in X_1 and y\in X_2. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition of existence of a determinantal point process with a J-Hermitian correlation kernel K(x,y).
