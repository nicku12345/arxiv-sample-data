This paper is a collection of recent results on discrete-time and continuous-time branching random walks. Some results are new and others are known. Many aspects of this theory are considered: local, global and strong local survival, the existence of a pure global survival phase and the approximation of branching random walks by means of multitype contact processes or spatially confined branching random walks. Most results are obtained using a generating function approach: the probabilities of extinction are seen as fixed points of an infinite dimensional power series. Throughout this paper we provide many nontrivial examples and counterexamples.
