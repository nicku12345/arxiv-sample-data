Given a sequence (M_{n},Q_{n})_{n\ge 1} of i.i.d.\ random variables with generic copy (M,Q) \in GL(d, \R) \times \R^d, we consider the random difference equation (RDE)  R_{n}=M_{n}R_{n-1}+Q_{n},  n\ge 1, and assume the existence of \kappa >0 such that  \lim_{n \to \infty}(\E{\norm{M_1 ... M_n}^\kappa})^{\frac{1}{n}} = 1 . We prove, under suitable assumptions, that the sequence S_n = R_1 + ... + R_n, appropriately normalized, converges in law to a multidimensional stable distribution with index \kappa. As a by-product, we show that the unique stationary solution R of the RDE is regularly varying with index \kappa, and give a precise description of its tail measure.
