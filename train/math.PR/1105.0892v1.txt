Asymptotic behaviour of conditional \alpha diversity for the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet partition model and for the normalized generalized Gamma model has been recently investigated in Favaro et al. (2009, 2011) with a view to possible applications in Bayesian treatment of species richness estimation. Here we generalize those results to the larger class of mixed Poisson-Kingman species sampling models driven by the stable subordinator (Pitman, 2003).
