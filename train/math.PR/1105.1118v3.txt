We generalize the exponential family of probability distributions. In our approach, the exponential function is replaced by a \varphi-function, resulting in a \varphi-family of probability distributions. We show how \varphi-families are constructed. In a \varphi-family, the analogue of the cumulant-generating function is a normalizing function. We define the \varphi-divergence as the Bregman divergence associated to the normalizing function, providing a generalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. A formula for the \varphi-divergence where the \varphi-function is the Kaniadakis' \kappa-exponential function is derived.
