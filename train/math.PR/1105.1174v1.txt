This paper considers stochastic population dynamics driven by Levy noise. The contributions of this paper lie in that (a) Using Khasminskii-Mao theorem, we show that the stochastic differential equation associated with the model has a unique global positive solution; (b) Applying an exponential martingale inequality with jumps, we discuss the asymptotic pathwise estimation of such model.
