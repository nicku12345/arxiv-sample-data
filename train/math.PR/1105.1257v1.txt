Let (W,H,\mu) be the classical Wiener space, assume that U_\la=I_W+u_\la is an adapted perturbation of identity where the perturbation u_\la is an H-valued map, defined up to \mu-equivalence classes, such that its Lebesgue density s\to \dot{u}_\la(s) is almost surely adapted to the canonical filtration of the Wiener space and depending measurably on a real parameter \la. Assuming some regularity for u_\la, its Sobolev derivative and integrability of the divergence of the resolvent operator of its Sobolev derivative, we prove the almost sure and L^p-regularity w.r. to \la of the estimation E[\dot{u}_\la(s)|\calU_\la(s)] and more generally of the conditional expectations of the type E[F\mid\calU_\la(s)] for nice Wiener functionals, where   (\calU_\la(s),s\in [0,1]) is the the filtration which is generated by U_\la. These results are applied to prove the invertibility of the adapted perturbations of identity, hence to prove the strong existence and uniqueness of functional SDE's; convexity of the entropy and the quadratic estimation error and finally to the information theory.
