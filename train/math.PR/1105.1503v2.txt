We consider a stochastic process Y defined by an integral in quadratic mean of a deterministic function f with respect to a Gaussian process X, which need not have stationary increments. For a class of Gaussian processes X, it is proved that sums of properly weighted powers of increments of Y over a sequence of partitions of a time interval converge almost surely. The conditions of this result are expressed in terms of the p-variation of the covariance function of X. In particular, the result holds when X is a fractional Brownian motion, a subfractional Brownian motion and a bifractional Brownian motion.
