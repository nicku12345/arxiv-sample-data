In this paper, we prove a result of equivalence in law between a diffusion conditioned with respect to partial observations and an auxiliary process. By partial observations we mean coordinates (or linear transformation) of the process at a finite collection of deterministic times. Apart from the theoritical interest, this result allows to simulate the conditioned diffusion through Monte Carlo's method, using the fact that the auxiliary process is easy to simulate.
