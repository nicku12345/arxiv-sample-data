By using the existing sharp estimates of density function for rotationally invariant symmetric \alpha-stable L\'{e}vy processes and rotationally invariant symmetric truncated \alpha-stable L\'{e}vy processes, we obtain that Harnack inequalities hold for rotationally invariant symmetric \alpha-stable L\'{e}vy processes with \alpha\in(0,2) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by rotationally invariant symmetric \alpha-stable L\'{e}vy process, while logarithmic Harnack inequalities are satisfied for rotationally invariant symmetric truncated \alpha-stable L\'{e}vy processes.
