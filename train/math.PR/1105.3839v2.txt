In this work we consider infinite dimensional extensions of some finite dimensional Gaussian geometric functionals called the Gaussian Minkowski functionals. These functionals appear as coefficients in the probability content of a tube around a convex set D\subset\mathbb{R}^k under the standard Gaussian law N(0,I_{k\times k}). Using these infinite dimensional extensions, we consider geometric properties of some smooth random fields in the spirit of [Random Fields and Geometry (2007) Springer] that can be expressed in terms of reasonably smooth Wiener functionals.
