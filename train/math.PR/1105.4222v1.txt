In this paper, stability theorems for stochastic differential equations and backward stochastic differential equations driven by G-Brownian motion are obtained. We show the existence and uniqueness of solutions to forward-backward stochastic differential equations driven by G-Brownian motion. Stability theorem for forward-backward stochastic differential equations driven by G-Brownian motion is also presented.
