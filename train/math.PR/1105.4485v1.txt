We consider the random walk among random conductances on Z^d. We assume that the conductances are independent, identically distributed and uniformly bounded away from 0 and infinity. We obtain a quantitative version of the central limit theorem for this random walk, which takes the form of a Berry-Esseen estimate with speed t^{-1/10} for d < 3, and speed t^{-1/5} otherwise, up to logarithmic corrections.
