Consider an independent site percolation model with parameter p \in (0,1) on \Z^d,\ d\geq 2 where there are only nearest neighbor bonds and long range bonds of length k parallel to each coordinate axis. We show that the percolation threshold of such model converges to p_c(\Z^{2d}) when k goes to infinity, the percolation threshold for ordinary (nearest neighbour) percolation on \Z^{2d}. We also generalize this result for models whose long range bonds have several lengths.
