We consider a random planar map M_n which is uniformly distributed over the class of all rooted q-angulations with n faces. We let \mathbf{m}_n be the vertex set of M_n, which is equipped with the graph distance d_\mathrm{gr}. Both when q\geq4 is an even integer and when q=3, there exists a positive constant c_q such that the rescaled metric spaces (\mathbf{m}_n,c_qn^{-1/4}d_\mathrm{gr}) converge in distribution in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, toward a universal limit called the Brownian map. The particular case of triangulations solves a question of Schramm.
