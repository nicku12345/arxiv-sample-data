We study for a class of symmetric L\'evy processes with state space \rn the transition density p_t(x) in terms of two one-parameter families of metrics, (d_t)_{t>0} and (\delta_t)_{t>0}. The first family of metrics describes the diagonal term p_t(0); it is induced by the characteristic exponent \psi of the L\'evy process by d_t(x,y)=\sqrt{t\psi(x-y)}. The second and new family of metrics \delta_t relates to \sqrt{t\psi} through the formula      \exp(-\delta_t^2(x,y))   = \Ff[\frac{e^{-t\psi}}{p_t(0)}](x-y)      where \Ff denotes the Fourier transform. Thus we obtain the following "Gaussian" representation of the transition density: p_t(x)=p_t(0) e^{-\delta_t^2(x,0)} where p_t(0) corresponds to a volume term related to \sqrt{t\psi} and where an "exponential" decay is governed by \delta_t^2. This gives a complete and new geometric, intrinsic interpretation of p_t(x).
