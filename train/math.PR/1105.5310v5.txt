Let (X,\p_x) be a continuous time Markov chain with finite or countable state space S and let T be its first passage time in a subset D of S. It is well known that if \mu is a quasi-stationary distribution relatively to T, then this time is exponentially distributed under \p_\mu. However, quasi-stationarity is not a necessary condition. In this paper, we determine more general conditions on an initial distribution \mu for T to be exponentially distributed under \p_\mu. We show in addition how quasi-stationary distributions can be expressed in terms of any initial law which makes the distribution of T exponential. We also study two examples in branching processes where exponentiality does imply quasi-stationarity.
