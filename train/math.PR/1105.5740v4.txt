We consider the simple random walk on random graphs generated by discrete point processes. This random graph has a random subset of a cubic lattice as the vertices and lines between any consecutive vertices on lines parallel to each coordinate axis as the edges. Under the assumption that discrete point processes are finitely dependent and stationary, we prove that the quenched invariance principle holds, that is, for almost every configuration of a point process, the path distribution of the walk converges weakly to that of a Brownian motion.
