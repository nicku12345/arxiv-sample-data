Asymptotic estimates of the hitting distribution of a long segment on the real axis for two dimensional random walks on {\bf Z}^2 of zero mean and finite variances are obtained: some are general and exhibit its apparent similarity to the corresponding Brownian density, while others are so detailed as to involve certain characteristics of the random walk.
