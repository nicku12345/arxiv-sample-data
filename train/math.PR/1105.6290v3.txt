We study a spin-flip model with Kac type interaction, in the presence of a random field given by i.i.d. bounded random variables. The system, spatially inhomogeneous, evolves according to a non conservative (Glauber) dynamics. We show an almost sure (with respect to the random field) large deviations principle for the empirical magnetizations of this process. The rate functional depends on the statistical properties of the external random field, it is lower semicontinuous with compact level sets.
