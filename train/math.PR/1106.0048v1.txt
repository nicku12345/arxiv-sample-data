A concentration of measure result is proved for the number of isolated vertices Y in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph model on n edges with edge probability p. When \mu and \sigma^2 denote the mean and variance of Y respectively, P((Y-\mu)/\sigma\ge t) admits a bound of the form e^{-kt^2} for some constant positive k under the assumption p \in (0,1) and np\rightarrow c \in (0,\infty) as n \rightarrow \infty. The left tail inequality  P(\frac{Y-\mu}{\sigma}\le -t)&\le& \exp(-\frac{t^2\sigma^2}{4\mu})  holds for all n \in {2,3,...},p \in (0,1) and t \ge 0. The results are shown by coupling Y to a random variable Y^s having the Y-size biased distribution, that is, the distribution characterized by E[Yf(Y)]=\mu E[f(Y^s)]  for all functions f for which these expectations exist.
