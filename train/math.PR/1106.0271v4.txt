We study large random dissections of polygons. We consider random dissections of a regular polygon with n sides, which are chosen according to Boltzmann weights in the domain of attraction of a stable law of index \theta\in(1,2]. As n goes to infinity, we prove that these random dissections converge in distribution toward a random compact set, called the random stable lamination. If \theta=2, we recover Aldous' Brownian triangulation. However, if \theta\in(1,2), large faces remain in the limit and a different random compact set appears. We show that the random stable lamination can be coded by the continuous-time height function associated to the normalized excursion of a strictly stable spectrally positive L\'{e}vy process of index \theta. Using this coding, we establish that the Hausdorff dimension of the stable random lamination is almost surely 2-1/\theta.
