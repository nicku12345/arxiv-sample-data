We consider a polling system: a queueing system of N\ge 1 queues with Poisson arrivals Q_1,...,Q_N visited in a cyclic order (with or without switchover times) by a single server. For this system we derive the probability generating function \mathscr Q(\cdot) of the joint queue length distribution at an arbitrary epoch in a stationary cycle, under no assumptions on service disciplines. We also derive the Laplace-Stieltjes transform \mathscr W(\cdot) of the joint workload distribution at an arbitrary epoch. We express \mathscr Q and \mathscr W in the probability generating functions of the joint queue length distribution at visit beginnings, {\mathscr V}_{b_i}(\cdot), and visit completions, {\mathscr V}_{c_i}(\cdot), at Q_i, i=1,...,N. It is well known that {\mathscr V}_{b_i} and {\mathscr V}_{c_i} can be computed in a broad variety of cases. Furthermore, we establish a workload decomposition result.
