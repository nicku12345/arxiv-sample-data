In this work, some regularity properties of mild solutions for a class of stochastic linear functional differential equations driven by infinite dimensional Wiener processes are considered. In terms of retarded fundamental solutions, we introduce a class of stochastic convolutions which naturally arise in the solutions and investigate their Yosida approximants. By means of the retarded fundamental solutions, we find conditions under which each mild solution permits a continuous modification. With the aid of Yosida approximation, we study two kinds of regularity properties, temporal and spatial ones, for the retarded solution processes. By employing a factorization method, we establish a retarded version of Burkholder-Davis-Gundy's inequality for stochastic convolutions.
