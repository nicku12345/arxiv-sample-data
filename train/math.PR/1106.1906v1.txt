In this work we study the solutions to some fractional higher-order equations. Special cases in which time-fractional derivatives take integer values are also examined and the explicit solutions are presented. Such solutions can be expressed by means of the transition laws of stable subordinators and their inverse processes. In particular we establish connections between fractional and higher-order equations.
