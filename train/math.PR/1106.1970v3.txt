Let G denote an infinite-dimensional Heisenberg-like group, which is a class of infinite-dimensional step 2 stratified Lie groups. We consider holomorphic functions on G that are square integrable with respect to a heat kernel measure which is formally subelliptic, in the sense that all appropriate finite dimensional projections are smooth measures. We prove a unitary equivalence between a subclass of these square integrable holomorphic functions and a certain completion of the universal enveloping algebra of the "Cameron-Martin" Lie subalgebra. The isomorphism defining the equivalence is given as a composition of restriction and Taylor maps.
