Smooth linear statistics of random permutation matrices, sampled under a general Ewens distribution, exhibit an interesting non-universality phenomenon. Though they have bounded variance, their fluctuations are asymptotically non-Gaussian but infinitely divisible. The fluctuations are asymptotically Gaussian for less smooth linear statistics for which the variance diverges. The degree of smoothness is measured in terms of the quality of the trapezoidal approximations of the integral of the observable.
