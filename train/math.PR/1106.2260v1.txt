We investigate a Bahadur-Kiefer type representation for the p-th empirical quantile corresponding to a sample of n i.i.d. random variables, when 0<p<1 is a sequence which, in particular, may tend to 0 or 1, i.e. we consider the case of intermediate sample quantiles. We obtain an 'in probability' version of the Bahadur -- Kiefer type representation for a \kn-th order statistic when r_n=\kn\wedge (n-k_n)\to \infty under some mild regularity conditions, and an 'almost sure' version under additional assumption that \log n/r_n\to 0, \nty. A representation for the sum of order statistics laying between the population p-quantile and the corresponding empirical quantile is also established.
