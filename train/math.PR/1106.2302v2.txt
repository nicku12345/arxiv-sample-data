Let B^H be a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index 0<H<1/2. In this paper we study the {\it generalized quadratic covariation} [f(B^H),B^H]^{(W)} defined by  [f(B^H),B^H]^{(W)}_t=\lim_{\epsilon\downarrow 0}\frac{2H}{\epsilon^{2H}}\int_0^t\{f(B^{H}_{s+\epsilon})-f(B^{H}_s)\}(B^{H}_{s+\epsilon}- B^{H}_s)s^{2H-1}ds,  where the limit is uniform in probability and x\mapsto f(x) is a deterministic function. We construct a Banach space {\mathscr H} of measurable functions such that the generalized quadratic covariation exists in L^2 and the Bouleau-Yor identity takes the form  [f(B^H),B^H]_t^{(W)}=-\int_{\mathbb {R}}f(x){\mathscr L}^{H}(dx,t)  provided f\in {\mathscr H}, where {\mathscr L}^{H}(x,t) is the weighted local time of B^H. This allows us to write the fractional It\^{o} formula for absolutely continuous functions with derivative belonging to {\mathscr H}. These are also extended to the time-dependent case.
