We study such important properties of f-divergence minimal martingale measure as Levy preservation property, scaling property, invariance in time property for exponential Levy models. We give some useful decomposition for f-divergence minimal martingale measures and we answer on the question which form should have f to ensure mentioned properties. We show that f is not necessarily common f-divergence. For common f-divergences, i.e. functions verifying f"(x) = ax^ {\gamma},\, a>0,\, \gamma \in \mathbb R, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of f-minimal martingale measure.
