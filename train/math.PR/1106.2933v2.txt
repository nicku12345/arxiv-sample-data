Let T=\mathbb R^d. Let a function Q:T^2\to\mathbb C satisfy Q(s,t)=\bar{Q(t,s)} and |Q(s,t)|=1. A generalized statistics is described by creation operators \partial_t^\dag and annihilation operators \partial_t, t\in T, which satisfy the Q-commutation relations. From the point of view of physics, the most important case of a generalized statistics is the anyon statistics, for which Q(s,t) is equal to q if s<t, and to \bar q if s>t. Here q\in\mathbb C, |q|=1. We start the paper with a detailed discussion of a Q-Fock space and operators (\partial_t^\dag,\partial_t)_{t\in T} in it, which satisfy the Q-commutation relations. Next, we consider a noncommutative stochastic process (white noise) \omega(t)=\partial_t^\dag+\partial_t+\lambda\partial_t^\dag\partial_t, t\in T. Here \lambda\in\mathbb R is a fixed parameter. The case \lambda=0 corresponds to a Q-analog of Brownian motion, while \lambda\ne0 corresponds to a (centered) Q-Poisson process. We study Q-Hermite (Q-Charlier respectively) polynomials of infinitely many noncommutatative variables (\omega(t))_{t\in T}. The main aim of the paper is to explain the notion of independence for a generalized statistics, and to derive corresponding L\'evy processes. To this end, we recursively define Q-cumulants of a field (\xi(t))_{t\in T}. This allows us to define a Q-L\'evy process as a field (\xi(t))_{t\in T} whose values at different points of T are Q-independent and which possesses a stationarity of increments (in a certain sense). We present an explicit construction of a Q-L\'evy process, and derive a Nualart-Schoutens-type chaotic decomposition for such a process.
