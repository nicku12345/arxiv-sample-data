We study the asymptotic behaviour of the probability that a stochastic process (Z_t)_{t \geq 0} does not exceed a constant barrier up to time T (the so called survival probability) when Z is the composition of two independent processes (X_t)_{t \in I} and (Y_t)_{t \geq 0}. To be precise, we consider (Z_t)_{t \geq 0} defined by Z_t = X \circ \abs{Y_t} when I = [0,\infty) and Z_t = X \circ Y_t when I = \mathbb{R}.   For continuous self-similar processes (Y_t)_{t \geq 0}, the rate of decay of survival probability for Z can be inferred directly from the survival probability of X and the index of self-similarity of Y. As a corollary, we obtain that the survival probability for iterated Brownian motion decays asymptotically like T^{-1/2}.   If Y is discontinuous, the range of Y possibly contains gaps which complicates the estimation of the survival probability. We determine the polynomial rate of decay for X being a L\'{e}vy process (possibly two-sided if I = \mathbb{R}) and Y being a L\'{e}vy process or random walk under suitable moments conditions.
