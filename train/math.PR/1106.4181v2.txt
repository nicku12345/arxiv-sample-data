We study a general class of random walks driven by a uniquely ergodic Markovian environment. Under a coupling condition on the environment we obtain strong ergodicity properties and concentration inequalities for the environment as seen from the position of the walker, i.e the environment process. We also obtain ergodicity of the uniquely ergodic measure of the environment process as well as continuity as a function of the jump rates of the walker.   As a consequence we obtain several limit theorems, such as law of large numbers, Einstein relation, central limit theorem and concentration properties for the position of the walker.
