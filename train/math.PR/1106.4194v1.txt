We study a class of Markovian systems of N elements taking values in [0,1] that evolve in discrete time t via randomized replacement rules based on the ranks of the elements. These rank-driven processes are inspired by variants of the Bak--Sneppen model of evolution, in which the system represents an evolutionary 'fitness landscape' and which is famous as a simple model displaying self-organized criticality. Our main results are concerned with long-time large-N asymptotics for the general model in which, at each time step, K randomly chosen elements are discarded and replaced by independent U[0,1] variables, where the ranks of the elements to be replaced are chosen, independently at each time step, according to a distribution \kappa_N on \{1,2,...,N\}^K. Our main results are that, under appropriate conditions on \kappa_N, the system exhibits threshold behaviour at s^* \in [0,1], where s^* is a function of \kappa_N, and the marginal distribution of a randomly selected element converges to U[s^*, 1] as t \to \infty and N \to \infty. Of this class of models, results in the literature have previously been given for special cases only, namely the 'mean-field' or 'random neighbour' Bak--Sneppen model. Our proofs avoid the heuristic arguments of some of the previous work and use Foster--Lyapunov ideas. Our results extend existing results and establish their natural, more general context. We derive some more specialized results for the particular case where K=2. One of our technical tools is a result on convergence of stationary distributions for families of uniformly ergodic Markov chains on increasing state-spaces, which may be of independent interest.
