We study the extremes of a sequence of random variables (R_n) defined by the recurrence R_n=M_nR_{n-1}+q, n\ge1, where R_0 is arbitrary, (M_n) are iid copies of a non--degenerate random variable M, 0\le M\le1, and q>0 is a constant. We show that under mild and natural conditions on M the suitably normalized extremes of (R_n) converge in distribution to a double exponential random variable. This partially complements a result of de Haan, Resnick, Rootz\'en, and de Vries who considered extremes of the sequence (R_n) under the assumption that \P(M>1)>0.
