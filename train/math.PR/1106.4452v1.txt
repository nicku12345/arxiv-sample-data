In this paper we consider heavy tailed Markov renewal processes and we prove that, suitably renormalised, they converge in law towards the \ga-stable regenerative set. We then apply these results to the strip wetting model which is a random walk S constrained above a wall and rewarded or penalized when it hits the strip [0,\infty) \times [0,a] where a is a given positive number. The convergence result that we establish allows to characterize the scaling limit of this process at criticality.
