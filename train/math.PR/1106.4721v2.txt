Consider on a manifold the solution X of a stochastic differential equation driven by a L\'evy process without Brownian part. Sufficient conditions for the smoothness of the law of X_t are given, with particular emphasis on noncompact manifolds. The result is deduced from the case of affine spaces by means of a localisation technique. The particular cases of Lie groups and homogeneous spaces are discussed.
