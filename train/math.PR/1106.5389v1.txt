This paper is concerned with the behaviour of a L\'{e}vy process when it crosses over a positive level, u, starting from 0, both as u becomes large and as u becomes small. Our main focus is on the time, \tau_u, it takes the process to transit above the level, and in particular, on the {\it stability} of this passage time; thus, essentially, whether or not \tau_u behaves linearly as u\dto 0 or u\to\infty. We also consider conditional stability of \tau_u when the process drifts to -\infty, a.s. This provides information relevant to quantities associated with the ruin of an insurance risk process, which we analyse under a Cram\'er condition.
