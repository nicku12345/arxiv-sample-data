We consider random walks in strong-mixing random Gibbsian environments in \mathbb{Z}^d, d\ge 2. Based on regeneration arguments, we will first provide an alternative proof of Rassoul-Agha's conditional law of large numbers (CLLN) for mixing environment Rassoul-Agha (2005). Then, using coupling techniques, we show that there is at most one nonzero limiting velocity in high dimensions (d\ge 5).
