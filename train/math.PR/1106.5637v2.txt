Let G be a Lie Group with a left invariant connection \nabla^{G}. Denote by \g the Lie algebra of G, which is equipped with a connection \nabla^{\g}. Our main is to introduce the concept of the It\^o exponential and the It\^o logarithm, which take in account the geometry of the Lie group G and the Lie algebra \g. This definition characterize directly the martingales in G with respect to the left invariant connection \nabla^{G}. Further, if any \nabla^{\g} geodesic in \g is send in a \nabla^{G} geodesic we can show that the It\^o exponential and the It\^o logarithm are the same that the stochastic exponential and the stochastic logarithm due to M. Hakim-Dowek and D. L\'epingle in [10]. Consequently, we have a Campbell-Hausdorf formula. From this formula we show that the set of affine maps from (M,\nabla^{G}) into (G,\nabla^{G}) is a subgroup of the Loop group. As in general, the Lie algebra is considered as smooth manifold with a flat connection, we show a Campbell-Hausdorf formula for a flat connection on \g and a bi-invariant connection on G. To this main we introduce the definition of the null quadratic variation property. To end, we use the Campbell-Hausdorff formula to show that a product of harmonic maps with value in G is a harmonic map.
