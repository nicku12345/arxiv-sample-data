In this paper we obtain a new family of identities for random measures on the unit ball of a separable Hilbert space which arise as the asymptotic analogues of the Gibbs measures in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and p-spin models and which are known to satisfy the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities. We give several applications of the new identities to structural results for such measures.
