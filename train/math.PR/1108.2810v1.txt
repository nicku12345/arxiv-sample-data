This paper can be thought of as a remark of \cite{llw}, where the authors studied the eigenvalue distribution \mu_{X_N} of random block Toeplitz band matrices with given block order m. In this note we will give explicit density functions of \lim\limits_{N\to\infty}\mu_{X_N} when the bandwidth grows slowly. In fact, these densities are exactly the normalized one-point correlation functions of m\times m Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE for short). The series \{\lim\limits_{N\to\infty}\mu_{X_N}|m\in\mathbb{N}\} can be seen as a transition from the standard normal distribution to semicircle distribution. We also show a similar relationship between GOE and block Toeplitz band matrices with symmetric blocks.
