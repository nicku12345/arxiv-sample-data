Given a Brownian Motion W, in this paper we study the asymptotic behavior, as \eps \to 0, of the quadratic covariation between f (\eps W) and W in the case in which f is not smooth. Among the main features discovered is that the speed of the decay in the case f \in C^\alpha is polynomial in \eps and not exponential as expected. We use a recent representation as a backward- forward It\^o integral of [f (\eps W), W] to prove an \eps-dependent approximation scheme which is of independent interest. We get the result by providing estimates to this approximation.
