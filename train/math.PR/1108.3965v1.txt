In this paper we prove that every random variable of the form F(M_T) with F:\real^d \to\real a Borelian map and M a d-dimensional continuous Markov martingale with respect to a Markov filtration \mathcal{F} admits an exact integral representation with respect to M, that is, without any orthogonal component. This representation holds true regardless any regularity assumption on F. We extend this result to Markovian quadratic growth BSDEs driven by M and show they can be solved without an orthogonal component. To this end, we extend first existence results for such BSDEs under a general filtration and then obtain regularity properties such as differentiability for the solution process.
