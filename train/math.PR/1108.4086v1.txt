By a classical result of Gray, Neuhoff and Shields (1975) the \bar\varrho distance between stationary processes is identified with an optimal stationary coupling problem of the corresponding stationary measures on the infinite product spaces. This is a modification of the optimal coupling problem from Monge--Kantorovich theory. In this paper we derive some general classes of examples of optimal stationary couplings which allow to calculate the \bar\varrho distance in these cases in explicit form. We also extend the \bar\varrho distance to random fields and to general nonmetric distance functions and give a construction method for optimal stationary \bar c-couplings. Our assumptions need in this case a geometric positive curvature condition.
