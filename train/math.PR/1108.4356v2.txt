We analyse the behaviour of supercritical super-Brownian motion with a barrier through the pathwise backbone embedding of Berestycki et al. (2011). In particular, by considering existing results for branching Brownian motion due to Harris et al. (2006) and Maillard [arxiv:1004.1426], we obtain, with relative ease, conclusions regarding the growth in the right most point in the support, analytical properties of the associated one-sided FKPP equation as well as the distribution of mass on the exit measure associated with the barrier.
