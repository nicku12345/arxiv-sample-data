In this article, we study the approximation of a probability measure \mu on \mathbb{R}^{d} by its empirical measure \hat{\mu}_{N} interpreted as a random quantization. As error criterion we consider an averaged p-th moment Wasserstein metric. In the case where 2p<d, we establish refined upper and lower bounds for the error, a high-resolution formula. Moreover, we provide a universal estimate based on moments, a so-called Pierce type estimate. In particular, we show that quantization by empirical measures is of optimal order under weak assumptions.
