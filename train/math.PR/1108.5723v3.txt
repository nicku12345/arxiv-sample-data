Let the nodes of a Poisson point process move independently in \R^d according to Brownian motions. We study the isolation time for a target particle that is placed at the origin, namely how long it takes until there is no node of the Poisson point process within distance r of it. In the case when the target particle does not move, we obtain asymptotics for the tail {probability} which are tight up to constants in the exponent in dimension d\geq 3 and tight up to logarithmic factors in the exponent for dimensions d=1,2. In the case when the target particle is allowed to move independently of the Poisson point process, we show that the best strategy for the target to avoid isolation is to stay put.
