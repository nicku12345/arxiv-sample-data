We consider the voter model on Z, starting with all 1's to the left of the origin and all 0's to the right of the origin. It is known that if the associated random walk kernel p has zero mean and a finite r-th moment for any r>3, then the evolution of the boundaries of the interface region between 1's and 0's converge in distribution to a standard Brownian motion (B_t)_{t>0} under diffusive scaling of space and time. This convergence fails when p has an infinite r-th moment for any r<3, due to the loss of tightness caused by a few isolated 1's appearing deep within the regions of all 0's (and vice versa) at exceptional times. In this note, we show that as long as p has a finite second moment, the measure-valued process induced by the rescaled voter model configuration is tight, and converges weakly to the measure-valued process 1_{x<B_t}dx, t>0.
