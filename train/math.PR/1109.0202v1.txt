In this expository paper we describe the pathwise behaviour of the integral functional \int_0^t f(Y_u)\,\dd u for any t\in[0,\zeta], where \zeta is (a possibly infinite) exit time of a one-dimensional diffusion process Y from its state space, f is a nonnegative Borel measurable function and the coefficients of the SDE solved by Y are only required to satisfy weak local integrability conditions. Two proofs of the deterministic characterisation of the convergence of such functionals are given: the problem is reduced in two different ways to certain path properties of Brownian motion where either the Williams theorem and the theory of Bessel processes or the first Ray-Knight theorem can be applied to prove the characterisation.
