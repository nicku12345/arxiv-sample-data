In this article, we give some existence and smoothness results for the law of the solution to a stochastic heat equation driven by a finite dimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H>1/2. Our results rely on recent tools of Young integration for convolutional integrals combined with stochastic analysis methods for the study of laws of random variables defined on a Wiener space.
