Let \mathbf X=(X_{jk}) denote a Hermitian random matrix with entries X_{jk}, which are independent for 1\le j\le k. We consider the rate of convergence of the empirical spectral distribution function of the matrix \mathbf X to the semi-circular law assuming that \mathbf E X_{jk}=0, \mathbf E X_{jk}^2=1 and that the distributions of the matrix elements X_{jk} have a uniform sub exponential decay in the sense that there exists a constant \varkappa>0 such that for any 1\le j\le k\le n and any t\ge 1 we have  \Pr\{|X_{jk}|>t\}\le \varkappa^{-1}\exp\{-t^{\varkappa}\}.  By means of a recursion argument it is shown that the Kolmogorov distance between the empirical spectral distribution of the Wigner matrix \mathbf W=\frac1{\sqrt n}\mathbf X and the semicircular law is of order O(n^{-1}\log^b n) with some positive constant b>0.
