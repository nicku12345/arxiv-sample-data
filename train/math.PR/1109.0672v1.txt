In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem of semi-linear degenerate backward stochastic partial differential equations (BSPDEs in short) under general settings without technical assumptions on the coefficients. For the solution of semi-linear degenerate BSPDE, we first give a proof for its existence and uniqueness, as well as regularity. Then the connection between semi-linear degenerate BSPDEs and forward backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs in short) is established, which can be regarded as an extension of Feynman-Kac formula to non-Markov frame.
