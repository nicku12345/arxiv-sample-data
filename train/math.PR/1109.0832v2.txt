We study nearest neighbor random walks on fixed environments of \mathbb{Z} composed of two point types : (1/2,1/2) and (p,1-p) for p>1/2. We show that for every environment with density of p drifts bounded by \lambda we have \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{X_n}{n}\leq (2p-1)\lambda, where X_n is a random walk on the environment. In addition up to some integer effect the environment which gives the best speed is given by equally spaced drifts.
