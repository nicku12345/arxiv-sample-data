In this article, we analyze a system modeling bacteriophage treatments for infections in a noisy context. In the small noise regime, we show that after a reasonable amount of time the system is close to a sane equilibrium (which is a relevant biologic information) with high probability. Mathematically speaking, our study hinges on concentration techniques for delayed stochastic differential equations.
