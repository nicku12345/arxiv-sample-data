In this paper we focus on the pathwise stability of mild solutions for a class of stochastic partial differential equations which are driven by switching-diffusion processes with jumps. In comparison to the existing literature, we show that: (i) the criterion to guarantee pathwise stability does not rely on the moment stability of the system; (ii) the sample Lyapunov exponent obtained is generally smaller than that of the counterpart driven by a Wiener process; (iii) due to the Markovian switching the overall system can become pathwise exponentially stable although some subsystems are not stable.
