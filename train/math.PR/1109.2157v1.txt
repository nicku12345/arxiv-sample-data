Let X= \{X(t), t \in \R^N\} be a Gaussian random field with values in \R^d defined by \[ X(t) = \big(X_1(t),..., X_d(t)\big),\qquad t \in \R^N, \] where X_1, ..., X_d are independent copies of a real-valued, centered, anisotropic Gaussian random field X_0 which has stationary increments and the property of strong local nondeterminism. In this paper we determine the exact Hausdorff measure function for the range X([0, 1]^N).   We also provide a sufficient condition for a Gaussian random field with stationary increments to be strongly locally nondeterministic. This condition is given in terms of the spectral measures of the Gaussian random fields which may contain either an absolutely continuous or discrete part. This result strengthens and extends significantly the related theorems of Berman (1973, 1988), Pitt (1978) and Xiao (2007, 2009), and will have wider applicability beyond the scope of the present paper.
