We show that the existence of a martingale approximation of a stationary process depends on the choice of the filtration. There exists a stationary linear process which has a martingale approximation with respect to the natural filtration, but no approximation with respect to a larger filtration with respect to wich it is adapted and regular. There exists a stationary process adapted, regular, and having a martingale approximation with respect to a given filtration but not (regular and having a martingale approximation) with respect to the natural filtration.
