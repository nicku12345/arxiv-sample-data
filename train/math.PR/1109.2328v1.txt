For \kappa\in(0,4], a family of annulus SLE(\kappa;\Lambda) processes were introduced in [14] to prove the reversibility of whole-plane SLE(\kappa). In this paper we prove that those annulus SLE(\kappa;\Lambda) processes satisfy a restriction property, which is similar to that for chordal SLE(\kappa). Using this property, we construct n\ge 2 curves crossing an annulus such that, when any n-1 curves are given, the last curve is a chordal SLE(\kappa) trace.
