For a Gaussian process X and smooth function f, we consider a Stratonovich integral of f(X), defined as the weak limit, if it exists, of a sequence of Riemann sums. We give covariance conditions on X such that the sequence converges in law. This gives a change-of-variable formula in law with a correction term which is an It\^o integral of f"' with respect to a Gaussian martingale independent of X. The proof uses Malliavin calculus and a central limit theorem from [10]. This formula was known for fBm with H=1/6 [9]. We extend this to a larger class of Gaussian processes.
