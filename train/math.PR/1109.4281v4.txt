Suppose that \CG is a finite, connected graph and X is a lazy random walk on \CG. The lamplighter chain X^\diamond associated with X is the random walk on the wreath product \CG^\diamond = \Z_2 \wr \CG, the graph whose vertices consist of pairs (f,x) where f is a labeling of the vertices of \CG by elements of \Z_2 and x is a vertex in \CG. There is an edge between (f,x) and (g,y) in \CG^\diamond if and only if x is adjacent to y in \CG and f(z) = g(z) for all z \neq x,y. In each step, X^\diamond moves from a configuration (f,x) by updating x to y using the transition rule of X and then sampling both f(x) and f(y) according to the uniform distribution on \Z_2; f(z) for z \neq x,y remains unchanged. We give matching upper and lower bounds on the uniform mixing time of X^\diamond provided \CG satisfies mild hypotheses. In particular, when \CG is the hypercube \Z_2^d, we show that the uniform mixing time of X^\diamond is \Theta(d 2^d). More generally, we show that when \CG is a torus \Z_n^d for d \geq 3, the uniform mixing time of X^\diamond is \Theta(d n^d) uniformly in n and d. A critical ingredient for our proof is a concentration estimate for the local time of random walk in a subset of vertices.
