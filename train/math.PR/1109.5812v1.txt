Let \bX=\{X_n\}_{n\geq 1} and \bY=\{Y_n\}_{n\geq 1} be two independent random sequences. We obtain rates of convergence to the normal law of randomly weighted self-normalized sums  \psi_n(\bX,\bY)=\sum_{i=1}^nX_iY_i/V_n,\quad V_n=\sqrt{Y_1^2+...+Y_n^2}.  These rates are seen to hold for the convergence of a number of important statistics, such as for instance Student's t-statistic or the empirical correlation coefficient.
