We introduce a new partial order on the class of stochastically monotone Markov kernels having a given stationary distribution \pi on a given finite partially ordered state space \mathcal{X}. When K\preceq L in this partial order we say that K and L satisfy a comparison inequality. We establish that if K_1,\ldots,K_t and L_1,\ldots,L_t are reversible and K_s\preceq L_s for s=1,\ldots,t, then K_1\cdots K_t\preceq L_1\cdots L_t. In particular, in the time-homogeneous case we have K^t\preceq L^t for every t if K and L are reversible and K\preceq L, and using this we show that (for suitable common initial distributions) the Markov chain Y with kernel K mixes faster than the chain Z with kernel L, in the strong sense that at every time t the discrepancy - measured by total variation distance or separation or L^2-distance - between the law of Y_t and \pi is smaller than that between the law of Z_t and \pi. Using comparison inequalities together with specialized arguments to remove the stochastic monotonicity restriction, we answer a question of Persi Diaconis by showing that, among all symmetric birth-and-death kernels on the path \mathcal{X}=\{0,\ldots,n\}, the one (we call it the uniform chain) that produces fastest convergence from initial state 0 to the uniform distribution has transition probability 1/2 in each direction along each edge of the path, with holding probability 1/2 at each endpoint.
