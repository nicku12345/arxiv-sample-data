Since the seminal work of Dawson and Perkins, mutually catalytic versions of super-processes have been studied frequently. In this article we combine two approaches extending their ideas: the approach of adding correlations to the driving noise of the system is combined with the approach of obtaining new processes by letting the branching rate tend to infinity. We introduce infinite rate symbiotic branching processes which surprisingly can be interpreted as generalized voter processes with additional strength of opinions. Since many of the arguments go along the lines of known proofs this article is written as a review article.
