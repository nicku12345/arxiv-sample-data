By solving a control problem and using Malliavin calculus, explicit derivative formula is derived for the semigroup P_t generated by the Gruschin type operator on \R^{m}\times \R^{d}: L (x,y)=\ff 1 2 \bigg\{\sum_{i=1}^m \pp_{x_i}^2 +\sum_{j,k=1}^d (\si(x)\si(x)^*)_{jk} \pp_{y_j}\pp_{y_k}\bigg\},\ \ (x,y)\in \R^m\times\R^d, where \si\in C^1(\R^m; \R^d\otimes\R^d) might be degenerate. In particular, if \si(x) is comparable with |x|^{l}I_{d\times d} for some l\ge 1 in the sense of (\ref{A4}), then for any p>1 there exists a constant C_p>0 such that |\nn P_t f(x,y)|\le \ff{C_p (P_t |f|^p)^{1/p}}{\ss{t}\land \ss{t(|x|^2+t)^l}},\ \ t>0, f\in \B_b(\R^{m+d}), (x,y)\in \R^{m+d}, which implies a new Harnack type inequality for the semigroup. A more general model is also investigated.
