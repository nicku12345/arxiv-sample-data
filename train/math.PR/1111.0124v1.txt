For a general Multidimensional L\'{e}vy process (satisfying some moment conditions), we introduce the Multidimensional power jump processes and the related Multidimensional Teugels martingales. Furthermore, we orthogonalize the Multidimensional Teugels martingales by applying Gram-Schmidt process. We give a chaotic representation for every square integral random variable in terms of these orthogonalized Multidimensional Teugels martingales. The predictable representation with respect to the same set of Multidimensional orthogonalized martingales of square integrable random variables and of square integrable martingales is an easy consequence of the chaotic representation.
