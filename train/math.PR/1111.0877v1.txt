We study the range of a planar random walk on a randomly oriented lattice, already known to be transient. We prove that the expectation of the range grows linearly, in both the quenched (for a.e. orientation) and annealed ("averaged") cases. We also express the rate of growth in terms of the quenched Green function and eventually prove a weak law of large numbers in the (non-Markovian) annealed case.
