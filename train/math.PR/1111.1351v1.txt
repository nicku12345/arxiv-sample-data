We study the local semicircle law for Gaussian \beta-ensembles at the edge of the spectrum. We prove that at the almost optimal level of n^{-2/3+\epsilon}, the local semicircle law holds for all \beta \geq 1 at the edge. The proof of the main theorem relies on the calculation of the moments of the tridiagonal model of Gaussian \beta-ensembles up to the p_n-moment where p_n = O(n^{2/3-\epsilon}). The result is the analogous to the result of Sinai and Soshnikov for Wigner matrices, but the combinatorics involved in the calculations are different.
