Let (X_{i}, \mathcal{F}_{i})_{i\geq 1} be a sequence of supermartingale differences and let S_k=\sum_{i=1}^k X_i. We give an exponential moment condition under which P(\max_{1\leq k \leq n} S_k \geq n)=O(\exp\{-C_1 n^{\alpha}\}), n\rightarrow \infty, where \alpha \in (0, 1) is given and C_{1}>0 is a constant. We also show that the power \alpha is optimal under the given condition. In particular, when \alpha=1/3, we recover an inequality of Lesigne and Voln\'{y}.
