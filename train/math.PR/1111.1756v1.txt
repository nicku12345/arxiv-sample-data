Let G be a multiplicative subsemigroup of the general linear group \Gl(\mathbb{R}^d) which consists of matrices with positive entries such that every column and every row contains a strictly positive element. Given a G--valued random matrix A, we consider the following generalized multidimensional affine equation R\stackrel{\mathcal{D}}{=}\sum_{i=1}^N A_iR_i+B, where N\ge2 is a fixed natural number, A_1,...,A_N are independent copies of A, B\in\mathbb{R}^d is a random vector with positive entries, and R_1,...,R_N are independent copies of R\in\mathbb{R}^d, which have also positive entries. Moreover, all of them are mutually independent and \stackrel{\mathcal{D}}{=} stands for the equality in distribution. We will show with the aid of spectral theory developed by Guivarc'h and Le Page and Kesten's renewal theorem, that under appropriate conditions, there exists \chi>0 such that \P(\{<R, u>>t\})\asymp t^{-\chi}, as t\to\8, for every unit vector u\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1} with positive entries.
