In a recent work, we proved that under diffusive scaling, the collection of rightmost infinite open paths in a supercritical oriented percolation configuration on the space-time lattice Z^2 converges in distribution to the Brownian web. In that proof, the FKG inequality played an important role in establishing a density bound, which is a part of the convergence criterion for the Brownian web formulated by Fontes et al (2004). In this note, we illustrate how an alternative convergence criterion formulated by Newman et al (2005) can be verified in this case, which involves a dual density bound that can be established without using the FKG inequality. This alternative approach is in some sense more robust. We will also show that the spatial density of the collection of rightmost infinite open paths starting at time 0 decays asymptotically in time as c/\sqrt{t} for some c>0.
