We prove a general theorem to bound the total variation distance between the distribution of an integer valued random variable of interest and an appropriate discretized normal distribution. We apply the theorem to 2-runs in a sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, the number of vertices with a given degree in the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph, and the uniform multinomial occupancy model.
