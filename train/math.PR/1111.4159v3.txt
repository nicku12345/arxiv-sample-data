Let (\xi_1,\eta_1),(\xi_2,\eta_2),... be a sequence of i.i.d.\ copies of a random vector (\xi,\eta) taking values in \R^2, and let S_n := \xi_1+...+\xi_n. The sequence (S_{n-1} + \eta_n)_{n \geq 1} is then called perturbed random walk.   We study random quantities defined in terms of the perturbed random walk: \tau(x), the first time the perturbed random walk exits the interval (-\infty,x], N(x), the number of visits to the interval (-\infty,x], and \rho(x), the last time the perturbed random walk visits the interval (-\infty,x]. We provide criteria for the a.s.\ finiteness and for the finiteness of exponential moments of these quantities. Further, we provide criteria for the finiteness of power moments of N(x) and \rho(x).
