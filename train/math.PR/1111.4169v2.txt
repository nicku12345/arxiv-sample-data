For a Borel set A and a homogeneous Poisson point process \eta in \R^d of intensity \lambda >0, define the Poisson--Voronoi approximation  A_\eta of A as a union of all Voronoi cells with nuclei from \eta lying in A. If A has a finite volume and perimeter we find an exact asymptotic of \E\Vol(A\Delta A_\eta) as \lambda\to\infty where \Vol is the Lebesgue measure. Estimates for all moments of \Vol(A_\eta) and \Vol(A\Delta A_\eta) together with their asymptotics for large \lambda are obtained as well.
