Consider the stochastic heat equation \partial_t u = (\frac{\varkappa}{2})\Delta u+\sigma(u)\dot{F}, where the solution u:=u_t(x) is indexed by (t,x)\in (0, \infty)\times\R^d, and \dot{F} is a centered Gaussian noise that is white in time and has spatially-correlated coordinates. We analyze the large-|x| fixed-t behavior of the solution u in different regimes, thereby study the effect of noise on the solution in various cases. Among other things, we show that if the spatial correlation function f of the noise is of Riesz type, that is f(x)\propto \|x\|^{-\alpha}, then the "fluctuation exponents" of the solution are \psi for the spatial variable and 2\psi-1 for the time variable, where \psi:=2/(4-\alpha). Moreover, these exponent relations hold as long as \alpha\in(0, d\wedge 2); that is precisely when Dalang's theory implies the existence of a solution to our stochastic PDE. These findings bolster earlier physical predictions.
