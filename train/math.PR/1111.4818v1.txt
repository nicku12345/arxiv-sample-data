We consider continuous-time random interlacements on a transient weighted graph. We prove an identity in law relating the field of occupation times of random interlacements at level u to the Gaussian free field on the weighted graph. This identity is closely linked to the generalized second Ray-Knight theorem, and uniquely determines the law of occupation times of random interlacements at level u.
