We study harmonic functions on random environments with particular emphasis on the case of the infinite cluster of supercritical percolation on \mathbb{Z}^d. We prove that the vector space of harmonic functions growing at most linearly is (d+1)-dimensional almost surely. Further, there are no nonconstant sublinear harmonic functions (thus implying the uniqueness of the corrector). A main ingredient of the proof is a quantitative, annealed version of the Avez entropy argument. This also provides bounds on the derivative of the heat kernel, simplifying and generalizing existing results. The argument applies to many different environments; even reversibility is not necessary.
