In this work infinitely divisible cylindrical probability measures on arbitrary Banach spaces are introduced. The class of infinitely divisible cylindrical probability measures is described in terms of their characteristics, a characterisation which is not known in general for infinitely divisible Radon measures on Banach spaces. Further properties of infinitely divisible cylindrical measures such as continuity are derived. Moreover, the result on the classification enables us to conclude new results on genuine Levy measures on Banach spaces.
