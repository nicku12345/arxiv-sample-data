The paper deals with convergence of solutions of a class of stochastic differential equations driven by infinite-dimensional semimartingales. The infinite-dimensional semimartingales considered in the paper are Hilbert-space valued. The theorems presented generalize the convergence result obtained by Wong and Zakai for stochastic differential equations driven by linear interpolations of a finite-dimensional Brownian motion. In particular, a general form of the correction factor is derived. Examples are given illustrating the use of the theorems to obtain other kinds of approximation results.
