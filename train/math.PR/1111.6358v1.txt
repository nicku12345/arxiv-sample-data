Let M_n= \fsu X1n be a sum of independent random variables such that  X_k\leq 1, \E X_k =0 and \E X_k^2=\s_k^2 for all k. Hoeffding 1963, Theorem 3, proved that \P{M_n \geq nt}\leq H^n(t,p),\quad H(t,p)= \bgl(1+qt/p\bgr)^{p +qt} \bgl({1-t}\bgr)^{q -qt} with q=\ffrac 1{1+\s^2},\quad p=1-q, \quad \s^2 =\ffrac {\s_1^2+...+\s_n^2}n,\quad 0<t<1. Bentkus 2004 improved Hoeffding's inequalities using binomial tails as upper bounds. Let \ga_k =\E X_k^3/\s_k^3 and  \vk_k= \E X_k^4/\s_k^4 stand for the skewness and kurtosis of X_k. In this paper we prove (improved) counterparts of the Hoeffding inequality replacing \s^2 by certain functions of \fs \ga 1n respectively \fs \vk 1n. Our bounds extend to a general setting where X_k are martingale differences, and they can combine the knowledge of skewness and/or kurtosis and/or variances of ~X_k. Up to factors bounded by e^2/2 the bounds are final. All our results are new since no inequalities incorporating skewness or kurtosis control so far are known.
