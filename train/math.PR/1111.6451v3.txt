We consider measure-valued processes X=(X_t) that solve the following martingale problem: for a given initial measure X_0, and for all smooth, compactly supported test functions \varphi, \begin{eqnarray*}X_t(\varphi )=X_0(\varphi)+\frac{1}{2}\int _0^tX_s(\Delta \varphi )\,ds+\theta \int_0^tX_s(\varphi )\,ds\\{}-\int_0^tX_s(L_s\varphi )\,ds+M_t(\varphi ).\end{eqnarray*} Here L_s(x) is the local time density process associated with X, and M_t(\varphi ) is a martingale with quadratic variation [M(\varphi )]_t=\int_0^tX_s(\varphi ^2)\,ds. Such processes arise as scaling limits of SIR epidemic models. We show that there exist critical values \theta_c(d)\in(0,\infty) for dimensions d=2,3 such that if \theta>\theta_c(d), then the solution survives forever with positive probability, but if \theta<\theta_c(d), then the solution dies out in finite time with probability 1. For d=1 we prove that the solution dies out almost surely for all values of \theta. We also show that in dimensions d=2,3 the process dies out locally almost surely for any value of \theta; that is, for any compact set K, the process X_t(K)=0 eventually.
