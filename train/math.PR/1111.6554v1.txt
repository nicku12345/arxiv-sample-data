By a modification of the method that was applied in (Korolev and Shevtsova, 2010), here the inequalities \Delta_n\leq0.3328(\beta_3+0.429)/\sqrt{n} and \Delta_n\leq0.33554(\beta_3+0.415)/\sqrt{n} are proved for the uniform distance \Delta_n between the standard normal distribution function and the distribution function of the normalized sum of an arbitrary number n\geq1 of independent identically distributed random variables with zero mean, unit variance and finite third absolute moment \beta_3. The first of these two inequalities improves one that was proved in (Korolev and Shevtsova, 2010), and as well sharpens the best known upper estimate for the absolute constant C_0 in the classical Berry--Esseen inequality to be C_0<0.4756, since 0.3328(\beta_3+0.429)\leq0.3328\cdot1.429\beta_3<0.4756\beta_3 by virtue of the condition \beta_3\geq1. The second of these inequalities is also a structural improvement of the classical Berry--Esseen inequality, and as well sharpens the upper estimate for C_0 still more to be C_0<0.4748.
