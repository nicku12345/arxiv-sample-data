A noise is a kind of homomorphism from a Boolean algebra of domains to the lattice of \sigma-fields. Leaving aside the homomorphism we examine its image, a Boolean algebra of \sigma-fields. The largest extension of such Boolean algebra of \sigma-fields, being well-defined always, is a complete Boolean algebra if and only if the noise is classical, which answers an old question of J. Feldman.
