We provide several characterizations to identify Strong envelop (for bounded measurable process) and Strong super-martingale (for non-negative right upper semi-continuous process of the class \Dc). As examples of application, we prove existence and uniqueness of reflected backward stochastic differential equation with lower barrier (RBSDB in short) in two cases: i). the obstacle is a measurable bounded process; ii). the obstacle is a right upper semicontinuous optional process of class \Dc.
