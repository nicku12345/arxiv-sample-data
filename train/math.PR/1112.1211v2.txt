We study some conformally invariant dynamic ways to construct the Conformal Loop Ensembles with simple loops introduced in earlier papers by Sheffield, and by Sheffield and Werner. One outcome is a conformally invariant way to measure a distance of a CLE(4) loop to the boundary "within" the CLE(4), when one identifies all points of each loop.
