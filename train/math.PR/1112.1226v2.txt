The Olkin-Baker functional equation is closely related to the celebrated Lukacs characterization of the gamma distribution. Its deeper understanding is essential to settle a challenging question of multivariate extensions of the Lukacs theorem. In this paper, first, we provide a new approach to the additive Olkin-Baker equation which holds almost everywhere on (0,\infinity)^2 (with respect to the Lebesgue measure on R^2) under measurability assumption. Second, this new approach is adapted to the case when unknown functions are allowed to be non-measurable and the complete solution is given in such a general case. Third, the Olkin-Baker equation holding outside of a set from proper linearly invariant ideal of subsets of R^2 is considered.
