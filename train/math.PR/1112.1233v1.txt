We consider affine Markov processes taking values in convex cones. In particular, we characterize all affine processes taking values in an irreducible symmetric cone in terms of certain L\'evy-Khintchine triplets. This is the complete classification of affine processes on these conic state spaces, thus extending the theory of Wishart processes on positive semidefinite matrices, as put forward by Bru (1991).
