We establish a general sufficient condition for a sequence of Galton Watson branching processes in varying environment to converge weakly. This condition extends previous results by allowing offspring distributions to have infinite variance, which leads to a new and subtle phenomena when the process goes through a bottleneck and also in terms of time scales. Our assumptions are stated in terms of pointwise convergence of a triplet of two real-valued functions and a measure. The limiting process is characterized by a backwards ordinary differential equation satisfied by its Laplace exponent, which generalizes the branching equation satisfied by continuous state branching processes. Several examples are discussed, namely branching processes in random environment, Feller diffusion in varying environment and branching processes with catastrophes.
