The limiting distribution of eigenvalues of N x N random matrices has many applications. One of the most studied ensembles are real symmetric matrices with independent entries iidrv; the limiting rescaled spectral measure (LRSM) \widetilde{\mu} is the semi-circle. Studies have determined the LRSMs for many structured ensembles, such as Toeplitz and circulant matrices. These have very different behavior; the LRSM for both have unbounded support. Given a structured ensemble such that (i) each random variable occurs o(N) times in each row and (ii) the LRSM exists, we introduce a parameter to continuously interpolate between these behaviors. We fix a p in [1/2, 1] and study the ensemble of signed structured matrices by multiplying the (i,j)-th and (j,i)-th entries of a matrix by a randomly chosen epsilon_ij in {1, -1}, with Prob(epsilon_ij = 1) = p (i.e., the Hadamard product). For p = 1/2 we prove that the limiting signed rescaled spectral measure is the semi-circle. For all other p, the limiting measure has bounded (resp., unbounded) support if \widetilde{\mu} has bounded (resp., unbounded) support, and converges to \widetilde{\mu} as p -> 1. Notably, these results hold for Toeplitz and circulant matrix ensembles.   The proofs are by the Method of Moments. The analysis involves the pairings of 2k vertices on a circle. The contribution of each in the signed case is weighted by a factor depending on p and the number of vertices involved in at least one crossing. These numbers appear in combinatorics and knot theory. The number of configurations with no vertices involved in a crossing is well-studied, and are the Catalan numbers. We prove similar formulas for configurations with up to 10 vertices in at least one crossing. We derive a closed-form expression for the expected value and determine the asymptotics for the variance for the number of vertices in at least one crossing.
