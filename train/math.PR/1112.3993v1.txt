This article determines the asymptotics of the expected Riesz s-energy of the zero set of a Gaussian random systems of polynomials of degree N as the degree N tends to infinity in all dimensions and codimensions. The asymptotics are proved more generally for sections of any positive line bundle over any compact Kaehler manifold. In comparison with the results on energies of zero sets in one complex dimension due to Qi Zhong (arXiv:0705.2000) (see also [arXiv:0705.2000]), the zero sets have higher energies than randomly chosen points in dimensions > 2 due to clumping of zeros.
