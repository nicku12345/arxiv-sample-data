The Gamma-Dirichlet structure corresponds to the decomposition of the gamma process into the independent product of a gamma random variable and a Dirichlet process. This structure allows us to study the properties of the Dirichlet process through the gamma process and vice versa. In this article, we begin with a brief review of existing results concerning the Gamma-Dirichlet structure. New results are obtained for the large deviations of the jump sizes of the gamma process and the quasi-invariance of the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. The laws of the gamma process and the Dirichlet process are the respective reversible measures of the measure-valued branching diffusion with immigration and the Fleming-Viot process with parent independent mutation. We view the relation between these two classes of measure-valued processes as the dynamical Gamma-Dirichlet structure. Other results of this article include the derivation of the transition function of the Fleming-Viot process with parent independent mutation from the transition function of the measure-valued branching diffusion with immigration, and the establishment of the reversibility of the latter. One of these is related to an open problem by Ethier and Griffiths and the other leads to an alternative proof of the reversibility of the Fleming-Viot process.
