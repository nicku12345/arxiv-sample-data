Martingale solutions of stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in 2D and 3D possibly unbounded domains, driven by the L\'evy noise consisting of the compensated time homogeneous Poisson random measure and the Wiener process are considered. Using the classical Faedo-Galerkin approximation and the compactness method we prove existence of a martingale solution. We prove also the compactness and tighness criteria in a certain space contained in some spaces of c\`adl\`ag functions, weakly c\`adl\`ag functions and some Fr\'echet spaces. Moreover, we use a version of the Skorokhod Embedding Theorem for nonmetric spaces.
