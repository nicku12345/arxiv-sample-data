The best known lower and upper bounds on the mixing time for the random-to-random insertions shuffle are (1/2-o(1))n\log n and (2+o(1))n\log n. A long standing open problem is to prove that the mixing time exhibits a cutoff. In particular, Diaconis conjectured that the cutoff occurs at 3/4n\log n. Our main result is a lower bound of t_n = (3/4-o(1))n\log n, corresponding to this conjecture.   Our method is based on analysis of the positions of cards yet-to-be-removed. We show that for large n and t_n as above, there exists f(n)=\Theta(\sqrt{n\log n}) such that, with high probability, under both the measure induced by the shuffle and the stationary measure, the number of cards within a certain distance from their initial position is f(n) plus a lower order term. However, under the induced measure, this lower order term is strongly influenced by the number of cards yet-to-be-removed, and is of higher order than for the stationary measure.
