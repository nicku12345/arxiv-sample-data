An algorithm for perfect simulation from the unique solution of the distributional fixed point equation Y=_d UY + U(1-U) is constructed, where Y and U are independent and U is uniformly distributed on [0,1]. This distribution comes up as a limit distribution in the probabilistic analysis of the Quickselect algorithm. Our simulation algorithm is based on coupling from the past with a multigamma coupler. It has four lines of code.
