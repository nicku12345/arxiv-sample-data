In this note, we introduce the notion of \alpha-IDT processes which is obtained from a slight and fundamental modification of the IDT property. Several examples of \alpha-IDT processes are given and Gaussian processes which are \alpha-IDT are characterized. A kind example of this Gaussian \alpha-IDT is the standard fractional Brownian motion. Also, we invest some links between the \alpha-IDT property, with selfdecomposability, temporal selfdecomposability, stability and self similarity.
