Consider \mathbb{G} the progressive enlargement of a filtration \mathbb{F} with a random time \tau. Assuming that, in \mathbb{F}, the martingale representation property holds, we examine conditions under which the martingale representation property holds also in \mathbb{G}. A general methodology is developed in this paper, with results covering every known (classical or recent) examples.
