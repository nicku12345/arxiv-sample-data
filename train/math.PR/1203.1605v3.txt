We show that the distribution of (a suitable rescaling of) a single eigenvalue gap \lambda_{i+1}(M_n)-\lambda_i(M_n) of a random Wigner matrix ensemble in the bulk is asymptotically given by the Gaudin-Mehta distribution, if the Wigner ensemble obeys a finite moment condition and matches moments with the GUE ensemble to fourth order. This is new even in the GUE case, as prior results establishing the Gaudin-Mehta law required either an averaging in the eigenvalue index parameter i, or fixing the energy level u instead of the eigenvalue index.   The extension from the GUE case to the Wigner case is a routine application of the Four Moment Theorem. The main difficulty is to establish the approximate independence of the eigenvalue counting function N_{(-\infty,x)}(\tilde M_n) (where \tilde M_n is a suitably rescaled version of M_n) with the event that there is no spectrum in an interval [x,x+s], in the case of a GUE matrix. This will be done through some general considerations regarding determinantal processes given by a projection kernel.
