The asymptotic shape theorem for the contact process in random environment gives the existence of a norm \mu on \Rd such that the hitting time t(x) is asymptotically equivalent to \mu(x) when the contact process survives. We provide here exponential upper bounds for the probability of the event \{\frac{t(x)}{\mu(x)}\not\in [1-\epsilon,1+\epsilon]\}; these bounds are optimal for independent random environment. As a special case, this gives the large deviation inequality for the contact process in a deterministic environment, which, as far as we know, has not been established yet.
