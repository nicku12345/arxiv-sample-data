We give a Dirichlet form approach for the construction of a distorted Brownian motion in E := [0;\infty)^n, n\in\mathbb{N}, where the behavior on the boundary is determined by the competing effects of reflection from and pinning at the boundary. The problem is formulated in an L^2-setting with underlying measure \mu=\varrho m. Here \varrho is a positive density, integrable with respect to the measure m and fulfilling the Hamza condition. The measure m is such that the boundary of E is not of m-measure zero. A reference measure of this type is needed in order to give meaning to the so-called Wentzell boundary condition which is in literature typical for modeling such kind of boundary behavior. In providing a Skorokhod decomposition of the constructed process we are able to justify that the stochastic process is solving the underlying stochastic differential equation weakly in the sense of N. Ikeda and Sh. Watanabe for quasi every starting point. At the boundary the constructed process indeed is governed by the competing effects of reflection and pinning. In order to obtain the Skorokhod decomposition we need \varrho to be continuously differentiable on E, which is equivalent to continuity of the logarithmic derivative of \varrho. Furthermore, we assume that the logarithmic derivative of \varrho is square integrable with respect to \mu. We do not need that the logarithmic derivative of \varrho is Lipschitz continuous. In particular, our considerations enable us to construct a dynamical wetting model (also known as Ginzburg-Landau dynamics) on a bounded set D_N\subset\mathbb{Z}^d under mild assumptions on the underlying pair interaction potentials in all dimensions d\in\mathbb{N}. In dimension d=2 this model describes the motion of an interface resulting from wetting of a solid surface by a fluid.
