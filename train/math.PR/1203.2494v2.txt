Branching processes and Fleming-Viot processes are two main models in stochastic population theory. Incorporating an immigration in both models, we generalize the results of Shiga (1990) and Birkner et al. (2005) which respectively connect the Feller diffusion with the classical Fleming-Viot process and the alpha-stable continuous state branching process with the Beta(2-alpha, alpha)-generalized Fleming-Viot process. In a recent work, a new class of probability-measure valued processes, called M-generalized Fleming-Viot processes with immigration, has been set up in duality with the so-called M-coalescents. The purpose of this article is to investigate the links between this new class of processes and the continuous-state branching processes with immigration. In the specific case of the \alpha-stable branching process conditioned to be never extinct, we get that its genealogy is given, up to a random time change, by a Beta(2-alpha, alpha-1)-coalescent.
