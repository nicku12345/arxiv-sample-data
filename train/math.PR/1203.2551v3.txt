In extreme value statistics, the peaks-over-threshold method is widely used. The method is based on the generalized Pareto distribution characterizing probabilities of exceedances over high thresholds in \mathbb {R}^d. We present a generalization of this concept in the space of continuous functions. We call this the generalized Pareto process. Differently from earlier papers, our definition is not based on a distribution function but on functional properties, and does not need a reference to a related max-stable process. As an application, we use the theory to simulate wind fields connected to disastrous storms on the basis of observed extreme but not disastrous storms. We also establish the peaks-over-threshold approach in function space.
