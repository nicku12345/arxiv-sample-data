Let B be a bifractional Brownian motion with parameters H\in (0, 1) and K\in(0,1]. For any n\geq1, set Z_n =\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\big[n^{2HK}(B_{(i+1)/n}-B_{i/n})^2-\E((B_{i+1}-B_{i})^2)\big]. We use the Malliavin calculus and the so-called Stein's method on Wiener chaos introduced by Nourdin and Peccati \cite{NP09} to derive, in the case when 0<HK\leq3/4, Berry-Ess\'een-type bounds for the Kolmogorov distance between the law of the correct renormalization V_n of Z_n and the standard normal law. Finally, we study almost sure central limit theorems for the sequence V_n.
