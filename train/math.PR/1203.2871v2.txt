Bobkov (J. Theoret. Probab. 18(2) (2005) 399-412) investigated an approximate de Finetti representation for probability measures, on product measurable spaces, which are symmetric under permutations of coordinates. One of the main results of that paper was an explicit approximation bound for permanents of complex rectangular matrices, which was shown by a somewhat complicated induction argument. In this paper, we indicate how to avoid the induction argument using an (asymptotic) expansion. Our approach makes it possible to give new explicit higher order approximation bounds for such permanents and in turn for the probability measures mentioned above.
