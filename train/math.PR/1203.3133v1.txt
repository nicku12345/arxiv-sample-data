For the fundamental solutions of heat-type equations of order n we give a general stochastic representation in terms of damped oscillations with generalized gamma distributed parameters. By composing the pseudo-process X_n related to the higher-order heat-type equation with positively skewed stable r.v.'s T^j_{1/3}, j=1,2, ..., n we obtain genuine r.v.'s whose explicit distribution is given for n=3 in terms of Cauchy asymmetric laws. We also prove that X_3(T^1_{1/3}(...(T^n_{(1/3)}(t))...)) has a stable asymmetric law.
