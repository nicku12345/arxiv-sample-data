Using a generalization of the skew-product representation of planar Brownian motion and the analogue of Spitzer's celebrated asymptotic Theorem for stable processes due to Bertoin and Werner, for which we provide a new easy proof, we obtain some limit Theorems for the exit time from a cone of stable processes of index \alpha\in(0,2). We also study the case t\rightarrow0 and we prove some Laws of the Iterated Logarithm (LIL) for the (well-defined) winding process associated to our planar stable process.
