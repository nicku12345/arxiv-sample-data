We study the scaling limit of the spectrum of the \beta-Jacobi ensemble at the soft-edge and hard-edge for general values of \beta. We show that the limiting point processes correspond respectively to the stochastic Airy and Bessel point processes introduced in Ramirez-Rider-Virag and Ramirez-Rider.
