We study the global fluctuations for linear statistics of the form \sum_{i=1}^n f(\lambda_i) as n \rightarrow \infty, for C^1 functions f, and \lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n being the eigenvalues of a (general) \beta-Jacobi ensemble, for which tridiagonal models were given by Killip and Nenciu as well as Edelman and Sutton. The fluctuation from the mean (\sum_{i=1}^n f(\lambda_i) - \Exp \sum_{i=1}^n f(\lambda_i)) is given asymptotically by a Gaussian process.   We compute the covariance matrix for the process and show that it is diagonalized by a shifted Chebyshev polynomial basis; in addition, we analyze the deviation from the predicted mean for polynomial test functions, and we obtain a law of large numbers.
