Let X,X_1,...,X_n be independent identically distributed random variables. In this paper we study the behavior of the concentration functions of the weighted sums \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}a_k X_k with respect to the arithmetic structure of coefficients a_k. Such concentration results recently became important in connection with investigations about singular values of random matrices. In this paper we formulate and prove some refinements of a result of Vershynin (R. Vershynin, Invertibility of symmetric random matrices, arXiv:1102.0300. (2011). Published in Random Structures and Algorithms, v. 44, no. 2, 135--182 (2014)).
