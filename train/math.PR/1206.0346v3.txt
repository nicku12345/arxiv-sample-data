We consider in this paper the collection of near maxima of the discrete, two dimensional Gaussian free field in a box with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We provide a rough description of the geometry of the set of near maxima, estimates on the gap between the two largest maxima, and an estimate for the right tail up to a multiplicative constant on the law of the centered maximum.
