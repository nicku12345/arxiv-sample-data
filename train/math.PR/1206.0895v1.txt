The random field Curie-Weiss model is derived from the classical Curie-Weiss model by replacing the deterministic global magnetic field by random local magnetic fields. This opens up a new and interestingly rich phase structure. In this setting, we derive moderate deviations principles for the random total magnetization S_n, which is the partial sum of (dependent) spins. A typical result is that under appropriate assumptions on the distribution of the local external fields there exist a real number m, a positive real number \lambda, and a positive integer k such that (S_n-nm)/n^{\alpha} satisfies a moderate deviations principle with speed n^{1-2k(1-\alpha)} and rate function \lambda x^{2k}/(2k)!, where 1-1/(2(2k-1)) < \alpha < 1.
