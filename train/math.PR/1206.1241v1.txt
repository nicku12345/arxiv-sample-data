The goal of this paper is to derive a formula for the finite dimensional joint characteristic function (the Fourier transform of the finite dimensional distribution) of the coupled process {(W_{t},L_{t}^{A}):t\in \lbrack 0,\infty)}, where \{W_{t}:t\in \lbrack 0,\infty)} is a d-dimensional Brownian motion and \{L_{t}^{A}:t\in \lbrack 0,\infty)} is the generalized d-dimensional L\acute{e}vy's stochastic area process associated to a d\times d matrix A. Here A need not be skew-symmetric, and in our computation we allow A to vary. The problem finally reduces to the solution of a recursive system of symmetric matrix Riccati equations and a system of independent first order linear matrix ODEs. As an example, the two dimensional L\'{e}vy's stochastic area process is studied in detail.
