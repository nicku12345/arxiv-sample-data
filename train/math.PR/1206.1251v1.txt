We consider the rate of piecewise constant approximation to a locally stationary process X(t),t\in [0,1], having a variable smoothness index \alpha(t). Assuming that \alpha(\cdot) attains its unique minimum at zero and satisfies the regularity condition, we propose a method for construction of observation points (composite dilated design) and find an asymptotics for the integrated mean square error, where a piecewise constant approximation X_n is based on N(n)\sim n observations of X. Further, we prove that the suggested approximation rate is optimal, and then show how to find an optimal constant.
