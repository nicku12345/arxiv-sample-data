We consider a finite range symmetric exclusion process on the integer lattice in any dimension. We interpret it as a non-elliptic time-dependent random conductance model by setting conductances equal to one over the edges with end points occupied by particles of the exclusion process and to zero elsewhere. We prove a law of large number and a central limit theorem for the random walk driven by such a dynamical field of conductances by using the Kipnis-Varhadan martingale approximation. Unlike the tagged particle in the exclusion process, which is in some sense similar to this model, this random walk is diffusive even in the one-dimensional nearest-neighbor case.
