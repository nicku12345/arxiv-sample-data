It is shown that some convolution semigroups of infinitely divisible measures are invariant under the random integral mappings I^{h,r}_{(a,b]} defined in (\star) below. The converse implication is specified for the semigroups of generalized s-selfdecomposable and selfdecomposable distributions. Some application are given to the moving average fractional L\'evy process (MAFLP).
