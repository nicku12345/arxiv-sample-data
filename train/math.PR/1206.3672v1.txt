We study couplings q^\bullet of two equivariant random measures \lambda^\bullet and \mu^\bullet on a Riemannian manifold (M,d,m). Given a cost function we ask for minimizers of the mean transportation cost per volume. In case the minimal/optimal cost is finite and \lambda^\omega\ll m we prove that there is a unique equivariant coupling minimizing the mean transportation cost per volume. Moreover, the optimal coupling is induced by a transportation map, q^\bullet=(id,T)_*\lambda^\bullet. We show that the optimal transportation map can be approximated by solutions to classical optimal transportation problems on bounded regions. In case of L^p-cost the optimal transportation cost per volume defines a metric on the space of equivariant random measure with unit intensity.
