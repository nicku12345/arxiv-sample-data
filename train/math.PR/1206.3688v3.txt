We present a new proof of the extended arc-sine law related to Walsh's Brownian motion, known also as Brownian spider. The main argument mimics the scaling property used previously, in particular by D. Williams in the 1-dimensional Brownian case, which can be generalized to the multivariate case. A discussion concerning the time spent positive by a skew Bessel process is also presented.
