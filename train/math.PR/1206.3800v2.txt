Consider compound Poisson processes with negative drift and no negative jumps, which converge to some spectrally positive L\'evy process with non-zero L\'evy measure. In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the local time process, in the spatial variable, of these processes killed at two different random times: either at the time of the first visit of the L\'evy process to 0, in which case we prove results at the excursion level under suitable conditionings; or at the time when the local time at 0 exceeds some fixed level. We prove that finite-dimensional distributions converge under general assumptions, even if the limiting process is not c\`adl\`ag. Making an assumption on the distribution of the jumps of the compound Poisson processes, we strengthen this to get weak convergence. Our assumption allows for the limiting process to be a stable L\'evy process with drift.   These results have implications on branching processes and in queueing theory, namely, on the scaling limit of binary, homogeneous Crump-Mode-Jagers processes and on the scaling limit of the Processor-Sharing queue length process.
