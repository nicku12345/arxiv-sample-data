We study the asymptotic behavior of a class of stochastic dynamics on interlacing particle configurations (also known as Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns). Examples of such dynamics include, in particular, a multi-layer extension of TASEP and particle dynamics related to the shuffling algorithm for domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. We prove that the process of reflected interlacing Brownian motions introduced by Warren in \cite{W} serves as a universal scaling limit for such dynamics.
