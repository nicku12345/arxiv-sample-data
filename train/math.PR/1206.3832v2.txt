The dynamic entropic repulsion for the Ginzburg-Landau \nabla\phi interface model was discussed in [Deuschel-N. 2007] and the asymptotics of the height of the interface was identified. This paper studies a similar problem for two interfaces on the wall which are interacting with one another by the exclusion rule. Each leading order of the asymptotics of height is \sqrt{\log t} as t\to\infty for the system on \integer^d,\,d\ge3, \log t for the system on \integer^2. The coefficient of the leading term for each interface is also identified.
