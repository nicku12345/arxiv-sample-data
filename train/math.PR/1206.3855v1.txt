We study the convergence of a drift implicit scheme for one-dimensional SDEs that was considered by Alfonsi for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process. Under general conditions, we obtain a strong convergence of order 1. In the CIR case, Dereich, Neuenkirch and Szpruch have shown recently a strong convergence of order 1/2 for this scheme. Here, we obtain a strong convergence of order 1 under more restrictive assumptions on the CIR parameters.
