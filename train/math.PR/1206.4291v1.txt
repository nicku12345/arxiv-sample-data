Let {S_t^H, t \geq 0}  be a linear combination of a Brownian motion and of an independent sub-fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index 0 < H < 1. Its main properties are studied and it is shown that S^H  can be considered as an intermediate process between a sub-fractional Brownian motion and a mixed fractional Brownian motion. Finally, we determine the values of H for which S^H is not a semi-martingale.
