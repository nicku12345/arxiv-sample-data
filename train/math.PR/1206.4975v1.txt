Let K \subset \R^d be a smooth convex set and let \P_\la be a Poisson point process on \R^d of intensity \la. The convex hull of \P_\la \cap K is a random convex polytope K_\la. As \la \to \infty, we show that the variance of the number of k-dimensional faces of K_\la, when properly scaled, converges to a scalar multiple of the affine surface area of K. Similar asymptotics hold for the variance of the number of k-dimensional faces for the convex hull of a binomial process in K.
