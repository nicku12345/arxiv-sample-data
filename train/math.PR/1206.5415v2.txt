We consider Gaussian Besov spaces obtained by real interpolation and Riemann-Liouville operators of fractional integration on the Gaussian space and relate the fractional smoothness of a functional to the regularity of its heat extension. The results are applied to study an approximation problem in L_p for 2\le p<\infty for stochastic integrals with respect to the d-dimensional (geometric) Brownian motion.
