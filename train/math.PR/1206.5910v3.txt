In this article we get simple explicit formulas for \Exp\sup_{s\leq t}X(s) where X is a spectrally positive or negative L\'evy process with infinite variation. As a consequence we derive a generalization of the well-known formula for the supremum distribution of Wiener process that is we obtain \Prob(\sup_{s\leq t}Z_{\alpha}(s)\geq u)=\alpha \Prob(Z_{\alpha}(t)\geq u) for u\geq 0 where Z_{\alpha} is a spectrally negative L\'evy process with 1<\alpha\leq 2 which also stems from Kendall's identity for the first crossing time. Our proof uses a formula for the supremum distribution of a spectrally positive L\'evy process which follows easily from the elementary Seals formula.
