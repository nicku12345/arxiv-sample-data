We give recurrence and transience criteria for two cases of time-homogeneous Markov chains on the real line with transition kernel p(x,dy)=f_x(y-x)dy, where f_x(y) are probability densities of symmetric distributions and, for large |y|, have a power-law decay with exponent \alpha(x)+1, with \alpha(x)\in(0,2). If f_x(y) is the density of a symmetric \alpha-stable distribution for negative x and the density of a symmetric \beta-stable distribution for non-negative x, where \alpha,\beta\in(0,2), then the chain is recurrent if and only if \alpha+\beta\geq2. If the function x\longmapsto f_x is periodic and if the set \{x:\alpha(x)=\alpha_0:=\inf_{x\in\R}\alpha(x)\} has positive Lebesgue measure, then, under a uniformity condition on the densities f_x(y) and some mild technical conditions, the chain is recurrent if and only if \alpha_0\geq1.
