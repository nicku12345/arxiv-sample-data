This paper features a comparison inequality for the densities of the moment measures of super-Brownian motion. These densities are defined recursively for each n \ge 1 in terms of the Poisson and Green's kernels, hence can be analyzed using the techniques of classical potential theory. When n = 1, the moment density is equal to the Poisson kernel, and the comparison is simply the classical inequality of Harnack. For n > 1 we find that the constant in the comparison inequality grows at most exponentially with n. We apply this to a class of X-harmonic functions H^\nu of super-Brownian motion, introduced by Dynkin. We show that for a.e. H^\nu in this class, H^\nu(\mu)<\infty for every \mu.
