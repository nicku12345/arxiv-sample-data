Let (Y_n) be a sequence of i.i.d. \mathbb Z-valued random variables with law \mu. The reflected random walk (X_n) is defined recursively by X_0=x \in \mathbb N_0, X_{n+1}=|X_n+Y_{n+1}|. Under mild hypotheses on the law \mu, it is proved that, for any  y \in \mathbb N_0, as n \to +\infty, one gets \mathbb P_x[X_n=y]\sim C_{x, y} R^{-n} n^{-3/2} when \sum_{k\in \mathbb Z} k\mu(k) >0 and \mathbb P_x[X_n=y]\sim C_{y} n^{-1/2} when \sum_{k\in \mathbb Z} k\mu(k) =0, for some constants R, C_{x, y} and C_y >0.
