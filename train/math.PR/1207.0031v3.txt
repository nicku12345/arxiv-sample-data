We consider random n\times n matrices of the form (XX*+YY*)^{-1/2}YY*(XX*+YY*)^{-1/2}, where X and Y have independent entries with zero mean and variance one. These matrices are the natural generalization of the Gaussian case, which are known as MANOVA matrices and which have joint eigenvalue density given by the third classical ensemble, the Jacobi ensemble. We show that, away from the spectral edge, the eigenvalue density converges to the limiting density of the Jacobi ensemble even on the shortest possible scales of order 1/n (up to \log n factors). This result is the analogue of the local Wigner semicircle law and the local Marchenko-Pastur law for general MANOVA matrices.
