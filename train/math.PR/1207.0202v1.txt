We investigate the long-time evolution of branching diffusion processes (starting with a single particle) in inhomogeneous media. The qualitative behavior of the processes depends on the intensity of the branching. We analyze the super-critical case, when the total number of particles growing exponentially with positive probability. We study the asymptotics of the number of particles in different regions of space and describe the growth of the region occupied by the particles.
