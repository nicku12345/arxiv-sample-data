The d-dimensional Lambda-Fleming-Viot generator acting on functions g(x), with x being a vector of d allele frequencies, can be written as a Wright-Fisher generator acting on functions g with a modified random linear argument of x induced by partitioning occurring in the Lambda-Fleming-Viot process. The eigenvalues and right polynomial eigenvectors are easy to see from this representation. The two-dimensional process, which has a one-dimensional generator, is considered in detail. A non-linear equation is found for the Green's function. In a model with genic selection a proof is given that there is a critical selection value such that if the selection coefficient is greater or equal to the critical value then fixation, when the boundary 1 is hit, has probability 1 beginning from any non-zero frequency. This is an analytic proof different from proofs by Der, Epstein and Plotkin (2011) and Foucart (2013). When fixation is not certain the fixation probability can be computed from an algorithm in the paper. An application in the infinitely-many-alleles Lambda-Fleming-Viot process is finding an interesting identity for the frequency spectrum of alleles that is based on size-biassing. The moment dual process in the Fleming-Viot process is the usual Lambda-coalescent tree back in time. The Wright-Fisher representation using a different set of polynomials g_n(x) as test functions produces a dual death process which has a similarity to the Kingman coalescent and decreases by units of one. The eigenvalues of the process are analogous to the Jacobi polynomials when expressed in terms of g_n(x), playing the role of x^n. E[g_n(X)] under the stationary distribution when there is mutation is analogous to the n th moment in a Beta distribution. There is a version g_n(X), when X and n are d-dimensional, and even an intriguing Ewens' sampling formula analogy when d tends to infinity.
