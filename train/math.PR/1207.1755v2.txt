We focus on the existence and its characterization of limit for a certain critical branching random walks in time-space random environment in 1 dimension which was introduced by Birkner et.al. Each particle performs simple random walk on \mathbb{Z} and branching mechanism depends on the time-space site. The weak limit points of this measure valued processes are characterized as a solution of the non-trivial martingale problem and called super-Brownian motions in random environment by Mytnik.
