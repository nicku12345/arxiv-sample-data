We consider a centered random walk with finite variance and investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the probability that the area under this walk remains positive up to a large time n. Assuming that the moment of order 2+\delta is finite, we show that the exact asymptotics for this probability are n^{-1/4}. To show these asymptotics we develop a discrete potential theory for the integrated random walk.
