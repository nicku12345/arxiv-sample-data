Let us consider a signed measure \Qv and a probability measure \Pv such that \Qv<<\Pv. Let D be the density of \Qv with respect to \Pv. H represents the set of zeros of D, \bar{g}=0\vee\sup{H}. In this paper, we shall consider two classes of nonnegative processes of the form X_{t}=N_{t}+A_{t}. The first one is the class of semimartingales where ND is a cadlag local martingale and A is a continuous and non-decreasing process such that (dA_{t}) is carried by H\cup\{t: X_{t}=0\}. The second one is the case where N and A are null on H and A_{.+\bar{g}} is a non-decreasing, continuous process such that (dA_{t+\bar{g}}) is carried by   \{t: X_{t+\bar{g}}=0\}. We shall show that these classes are extensions of the class (\sum) defined by A.Nikeghbali \cite{nik} in the framework of stochastic calculus for signed measures.
