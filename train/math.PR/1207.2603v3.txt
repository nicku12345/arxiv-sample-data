Let u be the solution to the following stochastic evolution equation (1) du(t,x)& = &A u(t,x) dt + B \sigma(u(t,x)) dL(t),\quad t>0; u(0,x) = x taking values in an Hilbert space \HH, where L is a \RR valued L\'evy process, A:H\to H an infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup, \sigma:H\to \RR bounded from below and Lipschitz continuous, and B:\RR\to H a possible unbounded operator. A typical example of such an equation is a stochastic Partial differential equation with boundary L\'evy noise. Let \CP=(\CP_t)_{t\ge 0} %{\CP_t:0\le t<\infty} the corresponding Markovian semigroup.   We show that, if the system (2) du(t) = A u(t)\: dt + B v(t),\quad t>0 u(0) = x is approximate controllable in time T>0, then under some additional conditions on B and A, for any x\in H the probability measure \CP_T^\star \delta_x is positive on open sets of H. Secondly, as an application, we investigate under which condition on %\HH and on the L\'evy process L and on the operator A and B the solution of Equation [1] is asymptotically strong Feller, respective, has a unique invariant measure. We apply these results to the damped wave equation driven by L\'evy boundary noise.
