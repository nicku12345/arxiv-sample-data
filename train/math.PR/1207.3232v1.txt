Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold, N\in \NN and p\ge 1. We prove that almost everywhere on x=(x_1,...,x_N)\in M^N for Lebesgue measure in M^N, the measure \di \mu(x)=\f1N\sum_{k=1}^N\d_{x_k} has a unique p-mean e_p(x). As a consequence, if X=(X_1,...,X_N) is a M^N-valued random variable with absolutely continuous law, then almost surely \mu(X(\om)) has a unique p-mean. In particular if (X_n)_{n\ge 1} is an independent sample of an absolutely continuous law in M, then the process e_{p,n}(\om)=e_p(X_1(\om),..., X_n(\om)) is well-defined. Assume M is compact and consider a probability measure \nu in M. Using partial simulated annealing, we define a continuous semimartingale which converges to the set of minimizers of the integral of distance at power p with respect to \nu. When the set is a singleton, it converges to the p-mean.
