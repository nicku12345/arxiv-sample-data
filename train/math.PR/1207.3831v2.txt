It is known that the so-called Bercovici-Pata bijection can be explained in terms of certain Hermitian random matrix ensembles (M_{d})_{d\geq1} whose asymptotic spectral distributions are free infinitely divisible. We investigate Hermitian L\'{e}vy processes with jumps of rank one associated to these random matrix ensembles introduced in [6] and [10]. A sample path approximation by covariation processes for these matrix L\'{e}vy processes is obtained. As a general result we prove that any d\times d complex matrix subordinator with jumps of rank one is the quadratic variation of an \mathbb{C}^{d}-valued L\'{e}vy process. In particular, we have the corresponding result for matrix subordinators with jumps of rank one associated to the random matrix ensembles (M_{d})_{d\geq1}
