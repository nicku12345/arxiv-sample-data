In the present paper, we consider the linear autoregressive model in \rr,  X_{k,n}=\theta_n X_{k,n-1}+\xi_k, k=0,1,...,n, n\ge 1 where \theta_n\in [0,1) is unknown, (\xi_k)_{k\in\zz} is a sequence of centered i.i.d. r.v. valued in \rr representing the noise. When \theta_n\to 1, the moderate deviations principle for empirical covariance is discussed and as statistical applications we provide the moderate deviation estimates of the least square and the Yule-Walker estimators of the parameter \theta_n.
