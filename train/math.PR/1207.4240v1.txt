In this paper we study the limiting distribution of the k smallest gaps between eigenvalues of three kinds of random matrices -- the Ginibre ensemble, the Wishart ensemble and the universal unitary ensemble. All of them follow a Poissonian ansatz. More precisely, for the Ginibre ensemble we have a global result in which the k-th smallest gap has typical length n^{-3/4} with density x^{4k-1}e^{-x^4} after normalization. For the Wishart and the universal unitary ensemble, it has typical length n^{-4/3} and has density x^{3k-1}e^{-x^3} after normalization.
