In this paper, we consider a data matrix X\in\mathbb{C}^{N\times M} where all the columns are i.i.d. samples being N dimensional complex Gaussian of mean zero and covariance \Sigma\in\mathbb{C}^{N\times N}. Here the population matrix \Sigma is of finite rank perturbation of the identity matrix. This is the "spiked population model" first proposed by Johnstone in \cite{21}. As M, N\to\infty but M/N = \gamma\in(1, \infty), we first establish in this paper the asymptotic distribution of the smallest eigenvalue of the sample covariance matrix S:= XX^*/M. It also exhibits a phase transition phenomenon proposed in \cite{1} --- the local fluctuation will be the generalized Tracy-Widom or the generalized Gaussian to be defined in the paper. Moreover we prove that the largest and the smallest eigenvalue are asymptotically independent as M, N\to\infty.
