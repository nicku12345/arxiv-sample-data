In this paper we continue our work on adiabatic time of time-inhomogeneous Markov chains first introduced in Kovchegov (2010) and Bradford and Kovchegov (2011). Our study is an analog to the well-known Quantum Adiabatic (QA) theorem which characterizes the quantum adiabatic time for the evolution of a quantum system as a result of applying of a series of Hamilton operators, each is a linear combination of two given initial and final Hamilton operators, i.e. \mathbf{H}(s) = (1-s)\mathbf{H_0} + s\mathbf{H_1}. Informally, the quantum adiabatic time of a quantum system specifies the speed at which the Hamiltonian operators changes so that the ground state of the system at any time s will always remain \epsilon-close to that induced by the Hamilton operator \mathbf{H}(s) at time s. Analogously, we derive a sufficient condition for the stable adiabatic time of a time-inhomogeneous Markov evolution specified by applying a series of transition probability matrices, each is a linear combination of two given irreducible and aperiodic transition probability matrices, i.e., \mathbf{P_{t}} = (1-t)\mathbf{P_{0}} + t\mathbf{P_{1}}. In particular we show that the stable adiabatic time t_{sad}(\mathbf{P_{0}}, \mathbf{P_{1}}, \epsilon) = O (t_{mix}^{4}(\epsilon \slash 2) \slash \epsilon^{3}),  where t_{mix} denotes the maximum mixing time over all \mathbf{P_{t}} for 0 \leq t \leq 1.
