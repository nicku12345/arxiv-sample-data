Let Q_{\lambda}(t,y)  be the number of people present at time t with y units of remaining service time in an infinite server system with arrival rate equal to \lambda>0. In the presence of a non-lattice renewal arrival process and assuming that the service times have a continuous distribution, we obtain a large deviations principle for Q_{\lambda}(\cdot) /\lambda under the topology of uniform convergence on [0,T]\times\lbrack0,\infty). We illustrate our results by obtaining the most likely path, represented as a surface, to ruin in life insurance portfolios, and also we obtain the most likely surfaces to overflow in the setting of loss queues.
