We consider n\times n Hermitian matrices with i.i.d. entries X_{ij} whose tail probabilities \mathbb {P}(|X_{ij}|\geq t) behave like e^{-at^{\alpha}} for some a>0 and \alpha \in(0,2). We establish a large deviation principle for the empirical spectral measure of X/\sqrt{n} with speed n^{1+\alpha /2} with a good rate function J(\mu) that is finite only if \mu is of the form \mu=\mu_{\mathrm{sc}}\boxplus\nu for some probability measure \nu on \mathbb {R}, where \boxplus denotes the free convolution and \mu_{\mathrm{sc}} is Wigner's semicircle law. We obtain explicit expressions for J(\mu_{\mathrm{sc}}\boxplus\nu) in terms of the \alphath moment of \nu. The proof is based on the analysis of large deviations for the empirical distribution of very sparse random rooted networks.
