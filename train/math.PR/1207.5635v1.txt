Interacting urns with exponential reinforcement were introduced and studied in Launay (2011). As its parameter \rho tends to \iy, this reinforcement mechanism converges to the "generalized" reinforcement, in which the probability of draw may be 0 or 1 for some of the colors, depending on the current configuration. For a single urn, the generalized reinforcement is easy to analyse. We introduce and study the generalized interacting urn model with two or more urns and two colors. Our results concern the law of the so-called non-conformist urns, and answer in the asymptotic sense one of the open questions from the above mentioned paper.
