In June 2012 on a conference in Bielefeld, after the author made the presentation of his theory of nonlinear Markov processes, Tom Kurtz asked him whether his methods would allow to get well-posedness for nonlinear McKean-Vlasov type diffusions with coefficients depending on the distribution via the median. The present paper is the answer to this question. The aim here is not to find the weakest possible conditions for the affirmative answer, but a sensible general result with a quick and transparent proof.
