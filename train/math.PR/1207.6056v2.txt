We investigate dual mechanisms for interacting particle systems. Generalizing an approach of Alkemper and Hutzenthaler in the case of coalescing duals, we show that a simple linear transformation leads to a moment duality of suitably rescaled processes. More precisely, we show how dualities of interacting particle systems of the form H(A,B)=q^{|A\cap B|}, A,B\subset\{0,1\}^N, q\in[-1,1), are rescaled to yield moment dualities of rescaled processes. We discuss in particular the case q=-1, which explains why certain population models with balancing selection have an annihilating dual process. We also consider different values of q, and answer a question by Alkemper and Hutzenthaler.
