We describe the onset of condensation in the simple model for the balance between selection and mutation given by Kingman in terms of a scaling limit theorem. Loosely speaking, this shows that the wave moving towards genes of maximal fitness has the shape of a gamma distribution. We conjecture that this wave shape is a universal phenomenon that can also be found in a variety of more complex models, well beyond the genetics context, and provide some further evidence for this.
