Extensions of the fractional Brownian fields are constructed over a complete Riemannian manifold. This construction is carried out for the full range of the Hurst parameter \alpha\in(0,1). In particular, we establish existence, distributional scaling (self-similiarity), stationarity of the increments, and almost sure H\"{o}lder continuity of sample paths. Stationary counterparts to these fields are also constructed.
