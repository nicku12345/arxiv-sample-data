Let B_s be a d-dimensional Brownian motion and \omega(dx) be an independent Poisson field on \mathbb{R}^d. The almost sure asymptotics for the logarithmic moment generating function [\log\math bb{E}_0\exp\biggl{\pm\theta\int_0^t\bar{V}(B_s) ds\biggr}\qquad (t\to\infty)] are investigated in connection with the renormalized Poisson potential of the form [\bar{V}(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}{\frac{1}{|y-x|^p}}[\omega(dy)-dy],\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^d.] The investigation is motivated by some practical problems arising from the models of Brownian motion in random media and from the parabolic Anderson models.
