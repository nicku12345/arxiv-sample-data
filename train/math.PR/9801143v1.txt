The Dirichlet form associated with the intrinsic gradient on Poisson space is known to be quasi-regular on the complete metric space \ddot\Gamma= \{Z_+-valued Radon measures on \IR^d\}. We show that under mild conditions, the set \ddot\Gamma\setminus\Gamma is \e-exceptional, where \Gamma is the space of locally finite configurations in \IR^d, that is, measures \gamma\in\ddot\Gamma satisfying \sup_{x\in\IR^d}\gamma(\{x\})\leq 1. Thus, the associated diffusion lives on the smaller space \Gamma. This result also holds for Gibbs measures with superstable interactions.
