Strong and Markov uniqueness problems in L^2 for Dirichlet operators on rigged Hilbert spaces are studied. An analytic approach based on a--priori estimates is used. The extension of the problem to the L^p-setting is discussed. As a direct application essential self--adjointness and strong uniqueness in L^p is proved for the generator (with initial domain the bounded smooth cylinder functions) of the stochastic quantization process for Euclidean quantum field theory in finite volume \Lambda \subset \R^2.
