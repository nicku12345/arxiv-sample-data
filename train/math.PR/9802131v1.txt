We consider an L^2-Wasserstein type distance \rho on the configuration space \Gamma_X over a Riemannian manifold X, and we prove that \rho-Lipschitz functions are contained in a Dirichlet space associated with a measure on \Gamma_X satisfying some general assumptions. These assumptions are in particular fulfilled by a large class of tempered grandcanonical Gibbs measures with respect to a superstable lower regular pair potential. As an application we prove a criterion in terms of \rho for a set to be exceptional. This result immediately implies, for instance, a quasi-sure version of the spatial ergodic theorem. We also show that \rho is optimal in the sense that it is the intrinsic metric of our Dirichlet form.
