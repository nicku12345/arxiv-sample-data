The growth exponent \alpha for loop-erased or Laplacian random walk on the integer lattice is defined by saying that the expected time to reach the sphere of radius n is of order n^\alpha. We prove that in two dimensions, the growth exponent is strictly greater than one. The proof uses a known estimate on the third moment of the escape probability and an improvement on the discrete Beurling projection theorem.
