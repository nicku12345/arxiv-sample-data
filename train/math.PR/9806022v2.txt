Let (f_n) be a mean zero vector valued martingale sequence. Then there exist vector valued functions (d_n) from [0,1]^n such that int_0^1 d_n(x_1,...,x_n) dx_n = 0 for almost all x_1,...,x_{n-1}, and such that the law of (f_n) is the same as the law of (sum_{k=1}^n d_k(x_1,...,x_k)) . Similar results for tangent sequences and sequences satisfying condition (C.I.) are presented. We also present a weaker version of a result of McConnell that provides a Skorohod like representation for vector valued martingales.
