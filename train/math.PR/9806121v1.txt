\def\R{\mathbb R}   We give a characterization of G-regularity for super-Brownian motion and the Brownian snake. More precisely, we define a capacity on E=(0,\infty)\times \R^d, which is not invariant by translation. We then prove that the hitting probability of a Borel set A\subset E for the graph of the Brownian snake starting at (0,0) is comparable, up to multiplicative constants, to its capacity. This implies that super-Brownian motion started at time 0 at the Dirac mass \delta_0 hits immediately A (that is (0,0) is G-regular for A^c) if and only if its capacity is infinite. As a direct consequence, if Q\subset E is a domain such that (0,0)\in \partial Q, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence on Q of a positive solution of \partial_t u+{1/2}\Delta u =2u^2 which blows up at (0,0). We also give an estimation of the hitting probabilities for the support of super-Brownian motion at fixed time. We prove that if d\geq 2, the support of super-Brownian motion is intersection-equivalent to the range of Brownian motion.
