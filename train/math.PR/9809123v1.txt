Fractional Brownian motion belongs to a class of long memory Gaussian processes that can be represented as linear functionals of an infinite dimensional Markov process. This representation leads naturally to: - An efficient algorithm to approximate the process. - An infinite dimensional ergodic theorem which applies to functionals of the type integral_0^t phi(V_h(s)) ds  where V_h(s)=integral_0^t h(t-u) dB_u and B is a standard Brownian motion.
