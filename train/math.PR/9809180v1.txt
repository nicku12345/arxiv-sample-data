For a symmetric \alpha-stable process X on \RR^n with 0<\alpha <2, n\geq 2 and a domain D \subset \RR^n, let L^D be the infinitesimal generator of the subprocess of X killed upon leaving D. For a Kato class function q, it is shown that L^D+q is intrinsic ultracontractive on a H\"older domain D of order 0. This is then used to establish the conditional gauge theorem for X on bounded Lipschitz domains in \RR^n. It is also shown that the conditional lifetimes for symmetric stable process in a H\"older domain of order 0 are uniformly bounded.
