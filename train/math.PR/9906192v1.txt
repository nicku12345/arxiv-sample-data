We prove a weak law of large numbers for a tagged particle in a totally asymmetric exclusion process on the one-dimensional lattice. The particles are allowed to take long jumps but not pass each other. The object of the paper is to illustrate a special technique for proving such theorems. The method uses a coupling that mimics the Hopf-Lax formula from the theory of viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
