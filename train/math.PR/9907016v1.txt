L\'evy processes on bialgebras are families of infinitely divisible representations. We classify the generators of L\'evy processes on the compact forms of the quantum algebras U_q(g), where g is a simple Lie algebra. Then we show how the processes themselves can be reconstructed from their generators and study several classical stochastic processes that can be associated to these processes.
