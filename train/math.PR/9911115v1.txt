The weak solution of Tanaka's SDE is not a function of the driving Brownian motion, and therefore it has no Wiener chaos expansion. However in some sense explained here it has a generalised chaos expansion involving infinite products of stochastic differentials accumulating at the minimum of the Brownian path. This is related to the existence of a non-classical noise richer than the usual white noise.
