Using a contraction procedure, we construct a twist operator that satisfies a shifted cocycle condition, and leads to the Jordanian quasi-Hopf U_{h;y}(sl(2)) algebra. The corresponding universal {\cal R}_{h}(y) matrix obeys a Gervais-Neveu-Felder equation associated with the U_{h;y}(sl(2)) algebra. For a class of representations, the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation may be expressed as a compatibility condition for the algebra of the Lax operators.
