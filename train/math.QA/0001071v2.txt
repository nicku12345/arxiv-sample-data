The Wakimoto construction for the quantum affine algebra U_q(\hat{sl}_2) admits a reduction to the q-deformed parafermion algebras. We interpret the latter theory as a free field realization of the Andrews-Baxter-Forrester models in regime II. We give multi-particle form factors of some local operators on the lattice and compute their scaling limit, where the models are described by a massive field theory with Z_k symmetric minimal scattering matrices.
