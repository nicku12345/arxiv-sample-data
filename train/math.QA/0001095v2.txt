We classify coproducts on matrix algebra in terms of solutions to some modification of pentagon equation. The construction of Baaj and Skandalis describing finite dimensional unitary solutions of pentagon equation is extended to the non-unitary case. We establish the relation between Hopf-Galois algebras and solutions to modified pentagon equation.
