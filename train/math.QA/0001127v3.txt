Let k be a field of characteristic zero, \g a k-Lie algebra, e:S\g@>>>U\g the symmetrization map. The PBW quantization is the one parameter family of associative products:  x\star_t y=\sum_{p=0}^\infty B_p(x,y)t^p\qquad (t\in k)  where B_p is the homogeneous component of degree -p of the map B:S\g\otimes_kS\g@>>>S\g, B(x,y)=e^{-1}(exey). In this paper we give an explicit formula for B. As an application, we prove that for each p\ge 0, B_p is a bidifferential operator of order \le p.
