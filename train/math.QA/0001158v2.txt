In a remarkable variety of contexts appears the modular data associated to finite groups. And yet, compared to the well-understood affine algebra modular data, the general properties of this finite group modular data has been poorly explored. In this paper we undergo such a study. We identify some senses in which the finite group data is similar to, and different from, the affine data. We also consider the data arising from a cohomological twist, and write down, explicitly in terms of quantities associated directly with the finite group, the modular S and T matrices for a general twist, for what appears to be the first time in print.
