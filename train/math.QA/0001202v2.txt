The renormalization of quantum field theory twists the antipode of a noncocommutative Hopf algebra of rooted trees, decorated by an infinite set of primitive divergences. The Hopf algebra of undecorated rooted trees, {\cal H}_R, generated by a single primitive divergence, solves a universal problem in Hochschild cohomology. It has two nontrivial closed Hopf subalgebras: the cocommutative subalgebra {\cal H}_{\rm ladder} of pure ladder diagrams and the Connes-Moscovici noncocommutative subalgebra {\cal H}_{\rm CM} of noncommutative geometry. These three Hopf algebras admit a bigrading by n, the number of nodes, and an index k that specifies the degree of primitivity. In each case, we use iterations of the relevant coproduct to compute the dimensions of subspaces with modest values of n and k and infer a simple generating procedure for the remainder. The results for {\cal H}_{\rm ladder} are familiar from the theory of partitions, while those for {\cal H}_{\rm CM} involve novel transforms of partitions. Most beautiful is the bigrading of {\cal H}_R, the largest of the three. Thanks to Sloane's {\tt superseeker}, we discovered that it saturates all possible inequalities. We prove this by using the universal Hochschild-closed one-cocycle B_+, which plugs one set of divergences into another, and by generalizing the concept of natural growth beyond that entailed by the Connes-Moscovici case. We emphasize the yet greater challenge of handling the infinite set of decorations of realistic quantum field theory.
