Constrained hamiltonian structure of noncommutative gauge theory for the gauge group U(1) is discussed. Constraints are shown to be first class, although, they do not give an Abelian algebra in terms of Poisson brackets. The related BFV-BRST charge gives a vanishing generalized Poisson bracket by itself due to the associativity of *-product. Equivalence of noncommutative and ordinary gauge theories is formulated in generalized phase space by using BFV-BRST charge and a solution is obtained. Gauge fixing is discussed.
