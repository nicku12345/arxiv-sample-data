Given a ring A and an A-coring \cC we study when the forgetful functor from the category of right \cC-comodules to the category of right A-modules and its right adjoint -\otimes_A\cC are separable. We then proceed to study when the induction functor -\otimes_A\cC is also the left adjoint of the forgetful functor. This question is closely related to the problem when A\to {}_A{\rm Hom}(\cC,A) is a Frobenius extension.   We introduce the notion of a Galois coring and analyse when the tensor functor over the subring of A fixed under the coaction of \cC is an equivalence. We also comment on possible dualisation of the notion of a coring.
