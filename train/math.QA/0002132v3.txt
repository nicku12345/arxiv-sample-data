The trigonometric KZ equations associated with a Lie algebra \g depend on a parameter \lambda\in\h where \h\subset\g is the Cartan subalgebra. We suggest a system of dynamical difference equations with respect to \lambda compatible with the KZ equations. The dynamical equations are constructed in terms of intertwining operators of \g-modules.
