In this note we introduce the notion of T^*-extension T^*{\mathfrak g} of a Lie superalgebra {\mathfrak g}, i.e. an extension of {\mathfrak g} by its dual space {\mathfrak g}^*. The natural pairing induces on T^*{\mathfrak g} an even supersymmetric nondegenerate bilinear form B which is invariant (B([X,Y],Z)=B(X,[Y,Z]) for all X,Y,Z \in T^*{\mathfrak g}), i.e. the structure of a quadratic (or metrised or orthogonal) Lie superalgebra. These extensions can be classified by the third even scalar cohomology group of {\mathfrak g}. Moreover, we show that all finite-dimensional quadratic Lie superalgebras {\mathfrak a}={\mathfrak a}_{\bar{0}} \oplus {\mathfrak a}_{\bar{1}} which are either nilpotent, or solvable and such that [{\mathfrak a}_{\bar{1}},{\mathfrak a}_{\bar{1}}]\subset [{\mathfrak a}_{\bar{0}},{\mathfrak a}_{\bar{0}}] can be constructed by means of a T^*-extension in the case of an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.
