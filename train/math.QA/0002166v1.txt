The paper begins by giving an algebraic structure on a set of coset representatives for the left action of a subgroup on a group. From this we construct a non-trivially associated tensor category. Also a double construction is given, and this allows the construction of a non-trivially associated braided tensor category. In this category we explicitly reconstruct a braided Hopf algebra, whose representations comprise the category itself.
