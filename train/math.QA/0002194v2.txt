Several Clifford algebras that are covariant under the action of a Lie algebra g can be deformed in a way consistent with the deformation of Ug into a quantum group (or into a triangular Hopf algebra) U_qg, i.e. so as to remain covariant under the action of U_qg. In this report, after recalling these facts, we review our results regarding the formal realization of the elements of such ``q-deformed'' Clifford algebras as ``functions'' (polynomials) in the generators of the undeformed ones; in particular, the intruiging interplay between the original and the q-deformed symmetry. Finally, we briefly illustrate their dramatic consequences on the representation theories of the original and of the q-deformed Clifford algebra, and mention how these results could turn out to be useful in quantum physics.
