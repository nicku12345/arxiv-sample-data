Following the approach of Budzy\'nski and Kondracki, we define covariant differential algebras and connections on locally trivial quantum principal fibre bundles. We also consider covariant derivatives, connection forms and curvatures and explore the relations between these notions. As an example, a U(1) quantum principal bundle over a glued quantum sphere and a connection in this bundle is constructed. This connection may be interpreted as a q-deformed Dirac monopole.
