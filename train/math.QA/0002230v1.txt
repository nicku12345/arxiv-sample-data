If P, B, H are the algebras of the total space, the base space, and the structure group of a locally trivial principal fibre bundle (QPFB), left (right) gauge transformations are defined as automorphisms of the left (right) B-module P which are adapted to the coaction of the Hopf algebra H and to the covering related to the local trivializations. Covariant derivatives on a QPFB are always transformed into covariant derivatives. This is true for connections only for special choices of the differential structure on H and/or if one restricts to algebra automorphisms. There are analogues of the classical formulas relating local connection forms and their gauge transforms.
