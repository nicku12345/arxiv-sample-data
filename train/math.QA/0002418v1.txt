We study the Lie algebra structure of the Onsager algebra from the ideal theoretic point of view. A structure theorem of ideals in the Onsager algebra is obtained with the connection to the finite-dimensional representations. We also discuss the solvable algebra aspect of the Onsager algebra through the formal Lie algebra theory.
