We express the difference between Poisson bracket and deformed bracket for Kontsevich deformation quantization on any Poisson manifold by means of second derivative of the formality quasi-isomorphism. The counterpart on star products of the action of formal diffeomorphisms on Poisson formal bivector fields is also investigated.
