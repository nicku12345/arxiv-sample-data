The algebraic structure on the subspace of the quasi-primary vectors given by the projection of the (n) products of a conformal superalgebra is formulated. As an application the complete list of simple physical conformal superalgebras is given. The list contains a one-parameter family of superconformal algebras with 4 supercharges that is simple for general values.
