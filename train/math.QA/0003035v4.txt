This work identifies a class of moves on knots which translate to m-equivalences of the associated p-fold branched cyclic covers, for a fixed m and any p (with respect to the Goussarov-Habiro filtration.) These moves are applied to give a flexible (if specialised) construction of knots for which the Casson-Walker-Lescop invariant (for example) of their p-fold branched cyclic covers may be readily calculated, for any choice of p. In the second part of this paper, these operations are illustrated by some theorems concerning the relationship of knot invariants obtained from finite type three-manifold invariants, via the branched cyclic covering construction, with the finite type theory of knots.
