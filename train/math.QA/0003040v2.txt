An elliptic two-parameter deformation of the (universal enveloping superalgebra of) affine Lie superalgebra osp(1|2)^{(1)} is proposed in terms of free boson realization. This deformed superalgebra is shown to fit in the framework of infinite Hopf family of superalgebras, a generalization of the infinite Hopf family of algebras proposed earlier by the authors. The trigonometric and rational degenerations are briefly discussed.
