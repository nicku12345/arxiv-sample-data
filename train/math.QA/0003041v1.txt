We propose a rational quantum deformed nonlocal currents in the homogenous space SU(2)_k/U(1), and in terms of it and a free boson field a representation for the Drinfeld currents of Yangian double at a general level k=c is obtained. In the classical limit \hbar \to 0, the quantum nonlocal currents become SU(2)_k parafermion, and the realization of Yangian double becomes the parafermion realization of SU(2)_k current algebra.
