Using \star-product on Co-adjoint orbits (K-orbits) of the \MD_4- groups we obtain quantum half-planes, quantum hyperbolic cylinders, quantum hyperbolic paraboloids...via Fedosov deformation quantization. From this we have corresponding unitary representations of the \MD_4- groups. Particularly, for groups \G_{4,2,3(\phi)}; \G_{4,2,4}; \G_{4,3,4(\phi)} and  \G_{4,4,1} , which are neither nilpotent nor exponential, we obtain the explicit formulas.
