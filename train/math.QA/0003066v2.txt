An explicit quantization is given of certain skew-symmetric solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter, yielding a family of R-matrices which generalize to higher dimensions the Jordanian R-matrices. Three different approaches to their construction are given: as twists of degenerations of the Shibukawa-Ueno Yang-Baxter operators on meromorphic functions; as boundary solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation; via a vertex-IRF transformation from solutions to the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation.
