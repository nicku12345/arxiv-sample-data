The explicit expressions of the representation functions (D-functions) for Jordanian quantum group SL_h(2) are obtained by combination of tensor operator technique and Drinfeld twist. It is shown that the D-functions can be expressed in terms of Jacobi polynomials as the undeformed D-functions can. Some of the important properties of the D-functions for SL_h(2) such as Winger's product law, recurrence relations, RTT type relations are also presented.
