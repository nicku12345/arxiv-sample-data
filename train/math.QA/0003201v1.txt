We compute the braiding for the `principal gradation' of U_q(\hat{{\it sl}_2}) for |q|=1 from first principles, starting from the idea of a rigid braided tensor category. It is not necessary to assume either the crossing or the unitarity condition from S-matrix theory. We demonstrate the uniqueness of the normalisation of the braiding under certain analyticity assumptions, and show that its convergence is critically dependent on the number-theoretic properties of the number \tau in the deformation parameter q=e^{2\pi i\tau}. We also examine the convergence using probability, assuming a uniform distribution for q on the unit circle.
