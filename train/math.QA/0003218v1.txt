On every split supermanifold equipped with the Rothstein even super-Poisson bracket we construct a deformation quantization by means of a Fedosov-type procedure. In other words, the supercommutative algebra of all smooth sections of the dual Grassmann algebra bundle of an arbitrarily given vector bundle E (equipped with a fibre metric) over a symplectic manifold M will be deformed by a series of bidifferential operators having first order supercommutator proportional to the Rothstein superbracket. Moreover, we discuss two constructions related to the above result, namely the quantized BRST-cohomology for a locally free Hamiltonian Lie group action (together with H.-C.Herbig and S.Waldmann) and the classical BRST cohomology in the general coistropic (or reducible) case without using a `ghosts of ghosts' scheme (together with H.-C.Herbig).
