Given a dynamical twist for a finite dimensional Hopf algebra we construct two weak Hopf algebras, using methods of Xu and Etingof-Varchenko, and show that they are dual to each other. We generalize the theory of dynamical quantum groups to the case when the quantum parameter q is a root of unity. These objects turn out to be self-dual -- which is a fundamentally new property, not satisfied by the usual Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups.
