We study fusion rings for degenerate minimal models (p=q case) for N=0 and N=1 (super)conformal algebras. We consider a distinguished family of modules at the level c=1 and c=3/2 and show that the corresponding fusion rings are isomorphic to the representation rings for {\mathfrak sl}(2, {\bf C}) and {\mathfrak osp}(1|2) respectively.
