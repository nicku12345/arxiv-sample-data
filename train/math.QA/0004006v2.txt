The category O of BGG can be thought of as a category of sheaves over the flag variety F in the sense that the algebra E of self-extensions of the trivial object of O is isomorphic to the cohomology algebra of the flag variety. A deformation of O' - giving rise to a "new" algebra E' - can be thought of as a (possibly noncommutative) deformation F' of F. The mythic variety F', being a deformation of F, should have the same homotopy type as F, and E' should therefore be isomorphic to E.
