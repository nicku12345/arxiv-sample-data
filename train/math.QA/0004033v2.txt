Recently, the R-matrix of the symplecto-orthogonal quantum superalgebra U_q(spo(2n|2m)) in the vector representation has been calculated. In the present work, this R-matrix is used to introduce the corresponding quantum supergroup SPO_q(2n|2m) and to construct an SPO_q(2n|2m)-covariant quantum Weyl superalgebra.
