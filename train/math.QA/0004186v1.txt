Following V. Drinfeld and G. Olshansky, we construct Manin triples (\fg, \fa, \fa^*) such that \fg is different from Drinfeld's doubles of \fa for several series of Lie superalgebras \fa which have no even invariant bilinear form (periplectic, Poisson and contact) and for a remarkable exception. Straightforward superization of suitable Etingof--Kazhdan's results guarantee then the uniqueness of q-quantization of our Lie bialgebras. Our examples give solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation in the cases when the classical YB equation has no solutions. To find explicit solutions is a separate (open) problem. It is also an open problem to list (\`a la Belavin-Drinfeld) all solutions of the {\it classical} YB equation for the Poisson superalgebras \fpo(0|2n) and the exceptional Lie superalgebra \fk(1|6) which has a Killing-like supersymmetric bilinear form but no Cartan matrix.
