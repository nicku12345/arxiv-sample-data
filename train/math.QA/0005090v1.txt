For a Hecke operator R, one defines the matrix bialgebra \E_R, which is considered as the function algebra on the quantum space of endomorphisms of the quantum space associated to R. One generalizes this notion, defining the function algebra \M_{RS} on the quantum space of homomorphisms of two quantum spaces associated to two Hecke operators R and S respectively. \M_{RS} can be considered as a quantum analogue (or a deformation) of the function algebra on the variety of matrices of a certain degree. We provide two realiztions of \M_{RS} as a quotient algebra and as a subalgebra of a tensor algebra, whence derive interesting informations about \M_{RS}, for instance the Koszul property, a formula for computing the Poincar\'e series. On \M_{RS} coact the bialgebras \E_R and \E_S. We study the two-sided ideals in \M_{RS}, invariant with respect to these actions, in particular, the determinantal ideals. We prove analogies of the fundamental theorems on invariant theory for these quantum groups and quantum hom-spaces.
