Let k(S^2_q) be the "coordinate ring" of a quantum sphere. We introduce the cotangent module on the quantum sphere as a one-sided k(S^2_q)-module and show that there is no Yang-Baxter type operator converting it into a k(S^2_q)-bimodule which would be a flatly deformed object w.r.t. its classical counterpart. This implies non-flatness of any covariant differential calculus on the quantum sphere making use of the Leibniz rule. Also, we introduce the cotangent and tangent modules on generic quantum orbits and discuss some related problems of "braided geometry".
