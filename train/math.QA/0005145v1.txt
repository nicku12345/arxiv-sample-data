We show that the quantum affine algebra U_{q}(A_{1}^{(1)}) and the quantum affine superalgebra U_{q}(C(2)^{(2)}) admit a unified description. The difference between them consists in the phase factor which is equal to 1 for U_{q}(A_{1}^{(1)}) and it is equal to -1 for U_{q}(C(2)^{(2)}). We present such a description for the actions of the braid group, for the construction of Cartan-Weyl generators and their commutation relations, as well for the extremal projector and the universal R-matrix. We give also a unified description for the 'new realizations' of these algebras together with explicit calculations of corresponding R-matrices.
