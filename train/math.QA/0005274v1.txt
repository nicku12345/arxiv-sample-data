In this paper we continue the study of representation theory of formal distribution Lie superalgebras initiated in q-alg/9706030. We study finite Verma-type conformal modules over the N=2, N=3 and the two N=4 superconformal algebras and also find explicitly all singular vectors in these modules. From our analysis of these modules we obtain a complete list of finite irreducible conformal modules over the N=2, N=3 and the two N=4 superconformal algebras.
