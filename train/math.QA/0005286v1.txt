One of the four well-known series of simple Lie algebras of Cartan type is the series of Lie algebras of Special type, which are divergence-free Lie algebras associated with polynomial algebras and the operators of taking partial derivatives, connected with volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. In this paper, we determine the structure space of the divergence-free Lie algebras associated with pairs of a commutative associative algebra with an identity element and its finite-dimensional commutative locally-finite derivation subalgebra such that the commutative associative algebra is derivation-simple with respect to the derivation subalgebra.
