A 3-dimensional homotopy quantum field theory (HQFT) can be described as a TQFT for surfaces and 3-cobordisms endowed with homotopy classes of maps into a given space. For a group \pi, we introduce a notion of a modular crossed \pi-category and show that such a category gives rise to a 3-dimensional HQFT with target space K(\pi,1). This includes numerical invariants of 3-dimensional \pi-manifolds and a 2-dimensional homotopy modular functor. We also introduce and discuss a parallel notion of a quasitriangular crossed Hopf \pi-coalgebra.
