In the theory of symmetric Jack polynomials the coefficients in the expansion of the pth elementary symmetric function e_p(z) times a Jack polynomial expressed as a series in Jack polynomials are known explicitly. Here analogues of this result for the non-symmetric Jack polynomials E_\eta(z) are explored. Necessary conditions for non-zero coefficients in the expansion of e_p(z) E_\eta(z) as a series in non-symmetric Jack polynomials are given. A known expansion formula for z_i E_\eta(z) is rederived by an induction procedure, and this expansion is used to deduce the corresponding result for the expansion of \prod_{j=1, j\ne i}^N z_j E_\eta(z), and consequently the expansion of e_{N-1}(z) E_\eta(z). In the general p case the coefficients for special terms in the expansion are presented.
