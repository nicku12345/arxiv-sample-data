In GT/0006019 oriented quantum algebras were motivated and introduced in a natural categorical setting. Invariants of knots and links can be computed from oriented quantum algebras, and this includes the Reshetikhin-Turaev theory for Ribbon Hopf algebras. Here we continue the study of oriented quantum algebras from a more algebraic perspective, and develop a more detailed theory for them and their associated invariants.
