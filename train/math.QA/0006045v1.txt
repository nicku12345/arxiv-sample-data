The purpose of the present paper is to introduce and explore two surprises that arise when we apply a standard procedure to study the number of finite type invariants of 3-manifolds introduced independently by M. Goussarov and K. Habiro based on surgery on claspers, Y-graphs or clovers, \cite{Gu,Ha,GGP}. One surprise is that the upper bounds depend on a bit more than a choice of generators for H_1. A complementary surprise a curious brane relation (in two flavors, open and closed) which shows that the upper bounds are in a certain sense independent of the choice of generators of H_1.
