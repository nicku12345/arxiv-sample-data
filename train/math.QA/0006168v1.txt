A quasi-Poisson manifold is a G-manifold equipped with an invariant bivector field whose Schouten bracket is the trivector field generated by the invariant element in \wedge^3 \g associated to an invariant inner product. We introduce the concept of the fusion for such manifolds, and we relate quasi-Poisson manifolds to the previously introduced quasi-Hamiltonian manifolds with group-valued moment maps.
