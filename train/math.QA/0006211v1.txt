For transcendental values of q the quantum tangent spaces of all left-covariant first order differential calculi of dimension less than four on the quantum group \SLq 2 are given. All such differential calculi \Gamma  are determined and investigated for which the left-invariant differential one-forms \omega (u^1_2), \omega (u^2_1) and \omega (u^1_1-u^2_2) generate \Gamma  as a bimodule and the universal higher order differential calculus has the same dimension as in the classical case. Important properties (cohomology spaces, *-structures, braidings, generalized Lie brackets) of these calculi are examined as well.   Keywords: quantum groups, noncommutative differential calculus, quantum tangent space
