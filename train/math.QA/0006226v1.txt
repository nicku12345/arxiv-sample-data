Let A be a cosemisimple Hopf *-algebra with antipode S and let \Gamma be a left-covariant first order differential *-calculus over A such that \Gamma is self-dual and invariant under the Hopf algebra automorphism S^2. A quantum Clifford algebra \Cl(\Gamma,\sigma,g) is introduced which acts on Woronowicz' external algebra \Gamma^\wedge. A minimal left ideal of \Cl(\Gamma,\sigma,g) which is an A-bimodule is called a spinor module. Metrics on spinor modules are investigated. The usual notion of a linear left connection on \Gamma is extended to quantum Clifford algebras and also to spinor modules. The corresponding Dirac operator and connection Laplacian are defined. For the quantum group SL_q(2) and its bicovariant 4D_\pm-calculi these concepts are studied in detail. A generalization of Bochner's theorem is given. All invariant differential operators over a given spinor module are determined. The eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are computed.
