Let k be a subring of the field of rational functions in x, v, s which contains x^{\pm 1}, v^{\pm 1}, s^{\pm 1}. If M is an oriented 3-manifold, let S(M) denote the Homflypt skein module of M over k. This is the free k-module generated by isotopy classes of framed oriented links in M quotiented by the Homflypt skein relations: (1) x^{-1}L_{+}-xL_{-}=(s-s^{-1})L_{0}; (2) L with a positive twist =(xv^{-1})L; (3) L\sqcup O=(\frac{v-v^{-1}}{s-s^{-1}})L where O is the unknot. We give two bases for the relative Homflypt skein module of the solid torus with 2 points in the boundary. The first basis is related to the basis of S(S^1\times D^2) given by V. Turaev and also J. Hoste and M. Kidwell; the second basis is related to a Young idempotent basis for S(S^1\times D^2) based on the work of A. Aiston, H. Morton and C. Blanchet. We prove that if the elements s^{2n}-1, for n a nonzero integer, and the elements s^{2m}-v^{2}, for any integer m, are invertible in k, then S(S^{1} \times S^2)=k-torsion module \oplus k. Here the free part is generated by the empty link \phi. In addition, if the elements s^{2m}-v^{4}, for m an integer, are invertible in k, then S(S^{1} \times S^2) has no torsion. We also obtain some results for more general k.
