A fundamental problem in the theory of Hopf algebras is the classification and explicit construction of finite-dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebras over C. These Hopf algebras constitute a very important class of Hopf algebras, introduced by Drinfeld (e.g. the quantum double of a Hopf algebra). However, this intriguing problem turns out to be extremely hard and it is still widely open. One can hope that resolving the problem in the triangular case would contribute to the understanding of the general case. There is no complte classification of finite-dimensional triangular Hopf algebras yet. However, the problem was solved in the semisimple case by Etingof and the author, in the minimal triangular pointed case by the author, and more generally for triangular Hopf algebras with the Chevalley property by Andruskiewitsch, Etingof and the author. The purpose of this paper is to report on all of this progress, and to explain in full details the mathematics and ideas involved in this theory. The classification in the semisimple case relies on Deligne's theorem on Tannakian categories and on Movshev's theory in an essential way. We explian Movshev's theory in details, and refer the reader to math.QA/0007147 for a detailed discussion of the first aspect. We also discuss the existence of grouplike elements in quasitriangular semisimple Hopf algebras, and the representation theory of cotriangular semisimple Hopf algebras. We conclude the paper with a list of related open problems.
