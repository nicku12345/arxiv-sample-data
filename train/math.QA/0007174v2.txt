We show that the braided tensor product algebra A_1\underline{\otimes}A_2 of two module algebras A_1, A_2 of a quasitriangular Hopf algebra H is equal to the ordinary tensor product algebra of A_1 with a subalgebra of A_1\underline{\otimes}A_2 isomorphic to A_2, provided there exists a realization of H within A_1. In other words, under this assumption we construct a transformation of generators which `decouples' A_1, A_2 (i.e. makes them commuting). We apply the theorem to the braided tensor product algebras of two or more quantum group covariant quantum spaces, deformed Heisenberg algebras and q-deformed fuzzy spheres.
