The nontrivial subspaces with primitive coproducts are found in the deformed universal enveloping algebras. They can form carrier spaces for additional Jordanian twists. The latter can be used to construct sequences of twists for algebras whose root systems contain long series of roots. The corresponding twist for the so(5) algebra is given explicitly.
