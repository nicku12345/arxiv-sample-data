Let A be a star product on a symplectic manifold (M,\omega_0), \frac{1}{t}[\omega] its Fedosov class, where \omega is a deformation of \omega_0. We prove that for a complex polarization of \omega there exists a commutative subalgebra, O, in A that is isomorphic to the algebra of functions constant along the polarization.   Let F(A) consists of elements of A whose commutator with O belongs to O. Then, F(A) is a Lie algebra which is an O-extension of the Lie algebra of derivations of O. We prove a formula which relates the class of this extension, the Fedosov class, and the Chern class of P.
