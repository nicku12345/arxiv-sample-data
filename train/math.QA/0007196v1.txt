It is well known that if two finite groups have the same symmetric tensor categories of representations over C, then they are isomorphic. We study the following question: when do two finite groups G1,G2 have the same tensor categories of representations over C (without regard for the commutativity constraint). We call two groups with such property isocategorical. We give an example of two groups which are isocategorical but not isomorphic: the affine symplectic group of a vector space over the field of two elements, and an appropriate "affine pseudosymplectic group" introduced by R.Griess (containing the "pseudosymplectic group" of A.Weil). On the other hand, we give a classification of groups isocategorical to a given group. In particular, we show that if G has no nontrivial normal subgroups of order 2^{2m} then any group isocategorical to G must actually be isomorphic to G. The proofs use the theory of triangular Hopf algebras. We also apply the notion of isocategorical groups to studying the question: when are two triangular semisimple Hopf algebras isomorphic as Hopf algebras?
