Two restricted C[q,q^{-1}]-forms of the well known q-boson algebra are introduced and the corresponding restricted q-Fock spaces defined. All of the irreducible highest weight representations, including the infinite dimensional ones, of U_\epsilon ^{res}(sl_2) of type 1 are constructed through the restricted q-Fock spaces.
