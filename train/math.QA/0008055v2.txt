A new non-standard deformation of all types of classical Lie algebras is constructed by means of Drinfel'd twist based on a six dimensional subalgebra. This is an extension of extended twists introduced by Kulish et al. For the algebra M_3 = so(3,2), a relation to a known non-standard deformation is discussed.
