In this paper, we first present a classification theorem of infinite-dimensional simple Novikov algebras over an algebraically closed field with characteristic 0. Then we classify all the irreducible modules of a certain infinite-dimensional simple Novikov algebras with an idempotent element whose left action is locally finite.
