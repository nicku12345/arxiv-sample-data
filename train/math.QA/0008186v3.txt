We study relations between different kinds of non-commutative spheres which have appeared in the context of ADS/CFT correspondences recently, emphasizing the connections between spaces that have manifest quantum group symmetry and spaces that have manifest classical symmetry. In particular we consider the quotient SU_q(2)/U(1) at roots of unity, and find its relations with the fuzzy sphere with manifest classical SU(2) symmetry. Deformation maps between classical and quantum symmetry, the U_q(SU(2)) module structure of quantum spheres and the structure of indecomposable representations of U_q(SU(2)) at roots of unity conspire in an interesting way to allow the relation between manifestly U_q(SU(2) symmetric spheres and manifestly U(SU(2)) symmetric spheres. The relation suggests that a subset of field theory actions on the q-sphere are equivalent to actions on the fuzzy sphere. The results here are compatible with the proposal that quantum spheres at roots of unity appear as effective geometries which account for finite N effects in the ADS/CFT correspondence.
