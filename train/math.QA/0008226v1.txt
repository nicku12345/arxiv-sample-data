We present an integral formula for the universal R-matrix of quantum affine algebra with 'Drinfeld comultiplication'. We show that the properties of the universal R-matrix follow from the factorization properties of the cycles in proper configuration spaces. For general g we conjecture that such cycles exist and unique. For U_q(\hat{sl}_2) describe precisely the cycles and present a new simple expression for the universal R-matrix as a result of calculation of corresponding integrals.
