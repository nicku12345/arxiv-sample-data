The main aim of this paper is to introduce some examples of non-compact locally compact quantum groups to a non-specialized audience. The major importance of these examples is their simplicity. Other examples as the quantum E(2) group of Woronowicz are much more difficult to construct. We will make use of the bicrossed product construction to obtain our examples. This construction dates back to Kac, Takeuchi and Majid. It was also considered by Baaj & Skandalis.
