The study of the pentagon (fusion) equation leds to the Structure and the Classification theorem for finite dimenasional Hopf algebras: there exists a one to one correspondence between the set of types of n-dimensional Hopf algebtras and the set of the orbits of the resticted Jordan action GL_n(k) \times M_n(k)\otimes M_n(k) \to M_n(k) \otimes M_nk (u, R) \to (u\otimes u)R (u\otimes u)^{-1}, the representatives of wich are invertible solutions of length n of the pentagon equation.
