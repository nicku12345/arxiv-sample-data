With the known group relations for the elements (a,b,c,d) of a quantum matrix T as input a general solution of the RTT relations is sought without imposing the Yang - Baxter constraint for R or the braid equation for \hat{R} = PR. For three biparametric deformatios, GL_{(p,q)}(2), GL_{(g,h)}(2) and GL_{(q,h)}(1/1), the standard,the nonstandard and the hybrid one respectively, R or \hat{R} is found to depend, apart from the two parameters defining the deformation in question, on an extra free parameter K,such that only for two values of K, given explicitly for each case, one has the braid equation. Arbitray K corresponds to a class (conserving the group relations independent of K) of the MQYBE or modified quantum YB equations studied by Gerstenhaber, Giaquinto and Schak. Various properties of the triparametric \hat{R}(K;p,q), \hat{R}(K;g,h) and \hat{R}(K;q,h) are studied. In the larger space of the modified braid equation (MBE) even \hat{R}(K;p,q) can satisfy \hat{R}^2 = 1 outside braid equation (BE) subspace. A generalized, K- dependent, Hecke condition is satisfied by each 3-parameter \hat{R}. The role of K in noncommutative geometries of the (K;p,q),(K;g,h) and (K;q,h) deformed planes is studied. K is found to introduce a "soft symmetry breaking", preserving most interesting properties and leading to new interesting ones. Further aspects to be explored are indicated.
