A cyclic cohomology theory adapted to Hopf algebras has been introduced recently by Connes and Moscovici. In this paper, we consider this object in the homological framework, in the spirit of Loday-Quillen and Karoubi's work on the cyclic homology of associative algebras. In the case of group algebras, we interpret the decomposition of the classical cyclic homology of a group algebra in terms of this homology. We also compute both cyclic homologies for truncated quiver algebras.
