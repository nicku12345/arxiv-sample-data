In this paper, we compute the cyclic homology of the Taft algebras and of their Auslander algebras. Given a Hopf algebra \Lambda, the Grothendieck groups of projective \Lambda -modules and of all \Lambda -modules are endowed with a ring structure, which in the case of the Taft algebras is commutative (\cite{C2}, \cite{G}). We also describe the first Chern character for these algebras.
