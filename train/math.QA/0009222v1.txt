Rozansky and Witten proposed a 3-dimensional sigma-model whose target space is a hyperk\"ahler manifold. They conjectured that this theory has an associated TQFT, with Hilbert spaces given by certain cohomology groups of the hyperk\"ahler manifold. On the other hand, there is a certain modified TQFT constructed by Murakami and Ohtsuki using the universal quantum invariant. We explain how the Rozansky-Witten TQFT can be obtained from the latter by applying a `hyperk\"ahler weight system'.
