The aim of this paper is to define two link invariants satisfying cubic skein relations. In the hierarchy of polynomial invariants determined by explicit skein relations they are the next level of complexity after Jones, HOMFLY, Kauffman and Kuperberg's G_2 quantum invariants. Our method consists in the study of Markov traces on a suitable tower of quotients of cubic Hecke algebras extending Jones approach.
