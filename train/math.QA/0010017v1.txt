The spectral sequence constructed by V.A.Vassiliev computes the homology of the spaces of non-compact knots in {\bf R}^d, d\ge 3. In this work the first term of this spectral sequence is described in terms of the homology of the Hochschild complex for the Poisson algebras operad, if d is odd (resp. for the Gerstenhaber algebras operads, if d is even). In particular the bialgebra of chord diagrams arises as some subspace of this homology (in this case d=3). Also a simplification for the calculation of the Vassiliev spectral sequence in the first term is provided.
