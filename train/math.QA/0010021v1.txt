We propose a construction of quantum hypergroups using conditional expectations on compact quantum groups. Using this construction, we describe several series of non-trivial finite-dimensional quantum hypergroups via conditional expectations of Delsart type on non-trivial Kac algebras obtained by twisting of the finite groups.
