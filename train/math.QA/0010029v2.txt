The covariant descripion is constructed for the Wick-type symbols on symplectic manifolds by means of the Fedosov procedure. The geometry of the manifolds admitting this symbol is explored. The superextended version of the Wick-type star-product is introduced and a possible application of the construction to the noncommutative field theory is discussed.
