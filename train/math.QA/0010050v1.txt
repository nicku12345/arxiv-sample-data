A two-parameter quantum deformation of the affine Lie super algebra osp(2|2)^{(2)} is introduced and studied in some detail. This algebra is the first example associated with nonsimply-laced and twisted root systems of a quantum current algebra with the structure of a so-called infinite Hopf family of (super)algebras. A representation of this algebra at c=1 is realized in the product Fock space of two commuting sets of Heisenberg algebras.
