For a quantum Lie algebra \Gamma, let \Gamma^\wedge be its exterior extension (the algebra \Gamma^\wedge is canonically defined). We introduce a differential on the exterior extension algebra \Gamma^\wedge which provides the structure of a complex on \Gamma^{\wedge}. In the situation when \Gamma is a usual Lie algebra this complex coincides with the "standard complex". The differential is realized as a commutator with a (BRST) operator Q in a larger algebra \Gamma^\wedge[\Omega], with extra generators canonically conjugated to the exterior generators of \Gamma^{\wedge}. A recurrent relation which defines uniquely the operator Q is given.
