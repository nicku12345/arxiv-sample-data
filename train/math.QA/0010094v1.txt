The functions on a lattice generated by the integer degrees of q^2 are considered, 0<q<1. The q^2-translation operator is defined. The multiplicators and the q^2-convolutors are defined in the functional spaces which are dual with respect to the q^2-Fourier transform. The q^2-analog of convolution of two q^2-distributions is constructed. The q^2-analog of an arbitrary (non integer) order derivative is introduced
