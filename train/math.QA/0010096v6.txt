We consider a deformation of three dimensional BF theory by means of the antifield BRST formalism. Possible deformations for the action and the gauge symmetries are analyzed. We find a new class of gauge theories which include nonabelian BF theory, higher dimensional nonlinear gauge theory and topological membrane theory.
