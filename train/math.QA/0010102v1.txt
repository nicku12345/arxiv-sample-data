We consider Wilson loop observables for Chern-Simons theory at large N and its topological string dual and extend the previous checks for this duality to the case of links. We find an interesting structure involving representation/spin degeneracy of branes ending on branes which features in the large N dual description of Chern-Simons theory. This leads to a refinement of the integer invariants for links and knots. We illustrate our results with explicit computations on the Chern-Simons side.
