The modified q-Bessel functions and the q-Bessel-Macdonald functions of the first and second kind are introduced. Their definition is based on representations as power series. Recurrence relations, the q-Wronskians, asymptotic decompositions and q-integral representations are received. In addition, the q-Bessel-Macdonald function of kind 3 is determined by its q-integral representation.
