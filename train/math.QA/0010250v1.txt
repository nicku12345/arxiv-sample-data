We study the q-Clifford algebras Cl_q(N,c), called FRT-Clifford algebras, introduced by Faddeev, Reshetikhin and Takhtajan. It is shown that Cl_q(N,c) acts on the q-exterior algebra \Lambda(O_q^N). Moreover, explicit formulas for the embedding of U_q(so_N) into Cl_q(N,c) and its relation to the vector and spin representations of U_q(so_N) are given and proved.   Key Words: q-Clifford algebra, Drinfeld-Jimbo algebra, spin representation
