Let g be a semi-simple simply-connected Lie algebra and let U_\ell be the corresponding quantum group with divided powers, where \ell is an even order root of unity. Let in addition u_\ell\subset U_\ell be the corresponding "small" quantum group.   In this paper we establish the following relation between the categories of representations of U_\ell and u_\ell: We show that the category of u_\ell-modules is naturally equivalent to the category of U_\ell-modules, which have a {\it Hecke eigen-property} with respect to representations lifted by means of the quantum Frobenius map U_\ell\ti U(\check g), where g is the Langlands dual Lie algebra.   This description allows to express the regular linkage class in the category u_\ell-mod in terms of perverse sheaves on the affine flag variety with a Hecke eigen-property. Moreover, it can serve as a basis to the program to understand the connection between the category u_\ell-mod and the category of representations of the corresponding affine algebra at the critical level.
