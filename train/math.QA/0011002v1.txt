The little q-Jacobi function transform depends on three parameters. An explicit expression as a sum of two very-well-poised 8W7-series is derived for the dual transmutation kernel (a kind of non-symmetric Poisson kernel) relating little q-Jacobi function transforms for different parameter sets. A product formula for the dual transmutation kernel is obtained. For the inverse transform the transmutation kernel is given as a 3\phi2-series, and a product formula as a finite sum is derived. The transmutation kernel gives rise to intertwining operators for the second order hypergeometric q-difference operator, which generalise the intertwining operators arising from a Darboux factorisation.
