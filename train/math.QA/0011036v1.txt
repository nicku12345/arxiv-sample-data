Bialgebroids, separable bialgebroids, and weak Hopf algebras are compared from a categorical point of view. Then properties of weak Hopf algebras and their applications to finite index and finite depth inclusions of von Neumann algebras are shortly reviewed. A hint is given at a duality between bialgebroid actions and abstract inclusions in 2-categories.
