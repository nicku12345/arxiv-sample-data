The role of automorphisms of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras in conformal field theory is examined. Two main types of applications are discussed; they are related to the enhancement and reduction of symmetry, respectively. The structures one encounters also appear in other areas of physics and mathematics. In particular, they lead to two conjectures on the sub-bundle structure of chiral blocks, and they are instrumental in the study of conformally invariant boundary conditions.
