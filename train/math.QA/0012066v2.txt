We consider the physical implications of various choices of the three-momentum basis in the kappa-deformed Poincare algebra. In particular, we find that the energy dependence of the velocity of a kappa-particle leads to unexpected features in kappa-deformed kinematics. We also discuss the notion of kappa-deformed dynamics, and as a tool example we investigate the motion of a kappa-deformed particle under the action of a constant force.
