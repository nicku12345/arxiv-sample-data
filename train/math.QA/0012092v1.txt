Let {\goth g} be a semi-simple complex Lie algebra, {\goth g}={\goth n^-}\oplus{\goth h}\oplus{\goth n} its triangular decomposition. Let U({\goth g}), resp. U_q({\goth g}), be its enveloping algebra, resp. its quantized enveloping algebra.   This article gives a quantum approach to the combinatorics of (classical) harmonic elements and Kostant's generalized exponents for {\goth \g}. On the one hand, we give specialization results concerning harmonic elements, central elements of U_q({\goth g}), and the Joseph and Letzter's decomposition. For {\goth g}={\goth sl}_{n+1}, we describe the specialization of quantum harmonic space in the {\math N}-filtered algebra U({\goth sl}_{n+1}) as the materialization of a theorem of Lascoux-Leclerc-Thibon. This enables us to study a Joseph-Letzter decomposition in the algebra U({\goth sl}_{n+1}). On the other hand, we prove that highest weight harmonic elements can be calculated in terms of the dual of Lusztig's canonical base. In the simply laced case, we parametrize a base of \n-invariants of minimal primitive quotients by the set \co of integral points of a convex cone.
