We define an action of the braid group (associated with a simple Lie algebra) on the space of n-tuples of power series in an indeterminate u, with constant term zero.   Using this, we give a sufficient condition for a tensor product of finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras to be cyclic on the tensor product of highest weight vectors. In particular, this proves a generalization of a recently established conjecture of Akasaka and Kashiwara (see qa/0010293 and qa/0006084).
