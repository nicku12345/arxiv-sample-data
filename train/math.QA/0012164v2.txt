An equivalence between Lu's bialgebroids, Xu's bialgebroids with an anchor and Takeuchi's \times_{A}-bialgebras is explicitly proven. A new class of examples of bialgebroids is constructed. A (formal) dual of a bialgebroid, termed bicoalgebroid, is defined. A weak Hopf algebra is shown to be an example of such a bicoalgebroid.
