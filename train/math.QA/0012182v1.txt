We show that the truncation of twisted Yangians are isomorphic to finite W-algebras based on orthogonal or symplectic algebras. This isomorphism allows us to classify all the finite dimensional irreducible representations of the quoted W-algebras. We also give an R-matrix for these W-algebras, and determine their center.
