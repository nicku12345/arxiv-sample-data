The quantum Ito formula has so far been proved for regular (bounded) quantum semimartingales We give three different extensions to classes of essentially self-adjoint (unbounded) quantum semimartingales.   The first extension is to quantum semimartingales whose integrands have chaos matrices controlled by certain scalar matrices   The second extension is to perturbations of classical, possibly unbounded, quantum semimartingales by bounded quantum semimartingales   The third extension is obtained by perturbing an essentially self-adjoint quantum semimartingale satisfying the quantum Duhamel formula by a regular quantum semimartingle.
