We briefly report on our result that the braided tensor product algebra of two module algebras A_1,A_2 of a quasitriangular Hopf algebra H is equal to the ordinary tensor product algebra of H_1 with a subalgebra isomorphic to A_2 and commuting with A_1, provided there exists a realization of H within A_1. As applications of the theorem we consider the braided tensor product algebras of two or more quantum group covariant quantum spaces or deformed Heisenberg algebras.
