We find certain functional identities for the Gauss q-power function of a sum of q-commuting variables. Then we use these identities to obtain two-parameter twists of the quantum affine algebra U_q (\hat{sl}_2) and of the Yangian Y(sl_2). We determine the corresponding deformed trigonometric and rational quantum R-matrices, which then are used in the computation of deformed XXX and XXZ Hamiltonians.
