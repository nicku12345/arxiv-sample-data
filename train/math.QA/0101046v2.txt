We classify dynamical twists in group algebras of finite groups. Namely, we set up a bijective correspondence between gauge equivalence classes of dynamical twists (which are solutions of a certain non-linear functional equation) and isomorphism classes of ``dynamical data'' described in purely group theoretical terms. This generalizes the classification of usual twists obtained by Movshev and Etingof-Gelaki.
