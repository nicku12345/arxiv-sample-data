We derive an explicit expression for the Haar integral on the quantized algebra of regular functions C_q[K] on the compact real form K of an arbitrary simply connected complex simple algebraic group G. This is done in terms of the irreducible *-representations of the Hopf *-algebra C_q[K]. Quantum analogs of the measures on the symplectic leaves of the standard Poisson structure on K which are (almost) invariant under the dressing action of the dual Poisson algebraic group K^* are also obtained. They are related to the notion of quantum traces for representations of Hopf algebras. As an application we define and compute explicitly quantum analogs of the Harish-Chandra c-functions associated to the elements of the Weyl group of G.
