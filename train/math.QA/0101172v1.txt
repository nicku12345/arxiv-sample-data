We determine an explicit expression for the Ricci tensor of a K-manifold, that is of a compact Kaehler manifold M with vanishing first Betti number, on which a semisimple group G of biholomorphic isometries acts with an orbit of codimension one. We also prove that the Kaehler form and the Ricci form of M are uniquely determined by two special curves with values in g = Lie(G), say Z, Z': R \to g = Lie(G) and we show how the curve Z' is determined by the curve Z. These results are used in another work with F. Podesta', where new examples of non-homogeneous compact Kaehler-Einstein manifolds with positive first Chern class are constructed.
