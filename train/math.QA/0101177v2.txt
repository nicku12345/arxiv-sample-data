We study some generalized instanton algebras which are required to describe `instantonic complex rank 2 bundles'. The spaces on which the bundles are defined are not prescribed from the beginning but rather are obtained from some natural requirements on the instantons. They turn out to be quantum 4-spheres S^4_q, with q\in\IC, and the instantons are described by self-adjoint idempotents e. We shall also clarify some issues related to the vanishing of the first Chern-Connes class ch_1(e) and on the use of the second Chern-Connes class ch_2(e) as a volume form.
