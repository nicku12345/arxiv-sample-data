We study (non-abelian) extensions of a given super Lie algebra, identify a cohomological obstruction to the existence, parallel to the known one for Lie algebras. An analogy to the setting of covariant exterior derivatives, curvature, and the Bianchi identity in differential geometry is spelled out.
