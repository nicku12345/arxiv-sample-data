We show that, if there exists a realization of a Hopf algebra H in a H-module algebra A, then one can split their cross-product into the tensor product algebra of A itself with a subalgebra isomorphic to H and commuting with A. This result applies in particular to the algebra underlying inhomogeneous quantum groups like the Euclidean ones, which are obtained as cross-products of the quantum Euclidean spaces R_q^N with the quantum groups of rotation U_qso(N) of R_q^N, for which it has no classical analog.
