We study the nonstandard q-deformation U'_q({\rm so}_4) of the universal enveloping algebra U({\rm so}_4) obtained by deforming the defining relations for skew-symmetric generators of U({\rm so}_4). This algebra is used in quantum gravity and algebraic topology. We construct a homomorphism \phi of U'_q({\rm so}_4) to the certain nontrivial extension of the Drinfeld--Jimbo quantum algebra U_q({\rm sl}_2)^{\otimes 2} and show that this homomorphism is an isomorphism. By using this homomorphism we construct irreducible finite dimensional representations of the classical type and of the nonclassical type for the algebra U'_q({\rm so}_4). It is proved that for q not a root of unity each irreducible finite dimensional representation of U'_q({\rm so}_4) is equivalent to one of these representations. We prove that every finite dimensional representation of U'_q({\rm so}_4) for q not a root of unity is completely reducible. It is shown how to construct (by using the homomorphism \phi) tensor products of irreducible representations of U'_q({\rm so}_4). (Note that no Hopf algebra structure is known for U'_q({\rm so}_4).) These tensor products are decomposed into irreducible constituents.
