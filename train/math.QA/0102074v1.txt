These notes are a short review of the q-deformed fuzzy sphere S^2_{q,N}, which is a ``finite'' noncommutative 2-sphere covariant under the quantum group U_q(su(2)). We discuss its real structure, differential calculus and integration for both real q and q a phase, and show how actions for Yang-Mills and Chern- Simons-like gauge theories arise naturally. It is related to D-branes on the SU(2)_k WZW model for q = exp(\frac{i \pi}{k+2}).
