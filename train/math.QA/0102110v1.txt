This is a short summary of the paper hep-th/9910037. An algebra of functions on q-deformed Anti-de Sitter space AdS_q^D is defined for q a root of unity, which is covariant under U_q(so(2,D-1)). The scalar fields have an intrinsic high- energy cutoff, and arise most naturally on products of the quantum AdS space with a classical sphere. Hilbert spaces of scalar fields are constructed.
