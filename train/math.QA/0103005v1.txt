We present a general vertex operator construction based on the Fock space for an affine Lie algebras of type A. This construction allows us to give a unified treatment for both the homogeneous and principle realizations of the affine Lie algebras \hat{gl}_N as well as for some extended affine Lie algebras coordinatized by certain quantum tori.
