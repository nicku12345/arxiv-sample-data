In this article, we give geometric constructions of tensor products in various categories using quiver varieties. More precisely, we introduce a lagrangian subvariety \Zl in a quiver variety, and show the following results:   (1) The homology group of \Zl is a representation of a symmetric Kac-Moody Lie algebra \mathfrak g, isomorphic to the tensor product V(\lambda_1)\otimes...\otimes V(\lambda_N) of integrable highest weight modules.   (2) The set of irreducible components of \Zl has a structure of a crystal, isomorphic to that of the q-analogue of V(\lambda_1)\otimes...\otimes V(\lambda_N).   (3) The equivariant K-homology group of \Zl is isomorphic to the tensor product of universal standard modules of the quantum loop algebra \Ul, when \mathfrak g is of type ADE.   We also give a purely combinatorial description of the crystal of (2). This result is new even when N=1.
