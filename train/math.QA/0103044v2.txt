This paper is primarily intended as an introduction for the mathematically inclined to some of the rich algebraic combinatorics arising in for instance CFT. It is essentially self-contained, apart from some of the background motivation and examples which are included to give the reader a sense of the context. The theory is still a work-in-progress, and emphasis is given here to several open questions and problems.
