This is the second paper in a series to study regular representations for vertex operator algebras. In this paper, given a module W for a vertex operator algebra V, we construct, out of the dual space W^{*}, a family of canonical (weak) V\otimes V-modules called {\cal{D}}_{Q(z)}(W) parametrized by a nonzero complex number z. We prove that for V-modules W,W_{1} and W_{2}, a Q(z)-intertwining map of type {W'\choose W_{1}W_{2}} in the sense of Huang and Lepowsky exactly amounts to a V\otimes V-homomorphism from W_{1}\otimes W_{2} to {\cal{D}}_{Q(z)}(W) and that a Q(z)-tensor product of V-modules W_{1} and W_{2} in the sense of Huang and Lepowsky amounts to a universal from W_{1}\otimes W_{2} to the functor {\cal{F}}_{Q(z)}, where {\cal{F}}_{Q(z)} is a functor from the category of V-modules to the category of weak V\otimes V-modules defined by {\cal{F}}_{Q(z)}(W)={\cal{D}}_{Q(z)}(W') for a V-module W. Furthermore, Huang-Lepowsky's P(z) and Q(z)-tensor functors for the category of V-modules are extended to functors T_{P(z)} and T_{Q(z)} from the category of V\otimes V-modules to the category of V-modules. It is proved that functors {\cal{F}}_{P(z)} and {\cal{F}}_{Q(z)} are right adjoints of T_{P(z)} and T_{Q(z)}, respectively.
