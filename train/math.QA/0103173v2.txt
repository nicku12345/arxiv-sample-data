This paper illustrates the combinatorial approach to vertex algebra - study of vertex algebras presented by generators and relations. A necessary ingredient of this method is the notion of free vertex algebra. Borcherds \cite{bor} was the first to note that free vertex algebras do not exist in general. The reason for this is that vertex algebras do not form a variety of algebras, because the locality axiom (see sec 2 below) is not an identity. However, a certain subcategory of vertex algebras, obtained by restricting the order of locality of generators, has a universal object, which we call the free vertex algebra corresponding to the given locality bound. In [J. of Algebra, 217(2):496-527] some free vertex algebras were constructed and in certain special cases their linear bases were found. In this paper we generalize this construction and find linear bases of an arbitrary free vertex algebra.   It turns out that free vertex algebras are closely related to the vertex algebras corresponding to integer lattices. The latter algebras play a very important role in different areas of mathematics and physics. Here we explore the relation between free vertex algebras and lattice vertex algebras in much detail. These results comply with the use of the word "free" in physical literature refering to some elements of lattice vertex algebras, like in "free field", "free bozon" or "free fermion".   Among other things, we find a nice presentation of lattice vertex algebras in terms of generators and relations, thus giving an alternative construction of these algebras without using vertex operators. We remark that our construction works in a very general setting; we do not assume the lattice to be positive definite, neither non-degenerate, nor of a finite rank.
