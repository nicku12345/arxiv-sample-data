We construct a Dirac operator on the quantum sphere S^2_q which is covariant under the action of SU_q(2). It reduces to Watamuras' Dirac operator on the fuzzy sphere when q\to 1. We argue that our Dirac operator may be useful in constructing SU_q(2) invariant field theories on S^2_q following the Connes-Lott approach to noncommutative geometry.
