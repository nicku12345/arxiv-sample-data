Coideal subalgebras of the quantized enveloping algebra are surveyed, with selected proofs included. The first half of the paper studies generators, Harish-Chandra modules, and associated quantum homogeneous spaces. The second half discusses various well known quantum coideal subalgebras and the implications of the abstract theory on these examples. The focus is on the locally finite part of the quantized enveloping algebra, analogs of enveloping algebras of nilpotent Lie subalgebras, and coideals used to form quantum symmetric pairs. The last family of examples is explored in detail. Connections are made to the construction of quantum symmetric spaces.
