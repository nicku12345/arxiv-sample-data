This paper examines various kinds of subspaces of the non-commutative spaces that are modelled on quasi-projective commutative schemes. It is shown how intersections and unions of weakly closed subspaces, closed subspaces, their weakly open and open complements, behave. Intersections with effective divisors are also examined, and so are closed points.
