We obtain a presentation of Schur algebras (and q-Schur algebras) by generators and relations which is compatible with the usual presentation of the enveloping algebra (quantized enveloping algebra) corresponding to the Lie algebra gl(n) of n x n matrices. We also find several new bases of Schur algebras and their corresponding integral forms.
