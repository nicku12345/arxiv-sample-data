Consider the Kontsevich \star-product on the symmetric algebra of a finite dimensional Lie algebra \mathfrak g, regarded as the algebra of distributions with support 0 on \mathfrak g. In this paper, we extend this \star-product to distributions satisfying an appropriate support condition. As a consequence, we prove a long standing conjecture of Kashiwara-Vergne on the convolution of germs of invariant distributions on the Lie group G.
