Let R be the set of isomorphism classes of ideals in the Weyl algebra A=A_{1}, and let C be the set of isomorphism classes of triples (V; X, Y), where V is a finite-dimensional (complex) vector space, and X, Y are endomorphisms of V such that [X,Y]+I has rank 1. Following a suggestion of L. Le Bruyn, we define a map \theta: R \to C by appropriately extending an ideal of A to a sheaf over a quantum projective plane, and then using standard methods of homological algebra. We prove that \theta is inverse to a bijection \omega: C \to R constructed in \cite{BW} by a completely different method. The main step in the proof is to show that \theta is equivariant with respect to natural actions of the group G=Aut(A) on R and C: for that we have to study also the extensions of an ideal to certain weighted quantum projective planes. Along the way, we find an elementary description of \theta.
