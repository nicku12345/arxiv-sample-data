We introduce ``virtual'' crystals of the affine types g=D_{n+1}^{(2)}, A_{2n}^{(2)} and C_n^{(1)} by naturally extending embeddings of crystals of types B_n and C_n into crystals of type A_{2n-1}. Conjecturally, these virtual crystals are the crystal bases of finite dimensional U_q'(g)-modules associated with multiples of fundamental weights. We provide evidence and in some cases proofs of this conjecture. Recently, fermionic formulas for the one dimensional configuration sums associated with tensor products of the finite dimensional U_q'(g)-modules were conjectured by Hatayama et al. We provide proofs of these conjectures in specific cases by exploiting duality properties of crystals and rigged configuration techniques. For type A_{2n}^{(2)} we also conjecture a new fermionic formula coming from a different labeling of the Dynkin diagram.
