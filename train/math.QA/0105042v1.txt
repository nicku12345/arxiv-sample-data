In the present paper we investigate a new class of infinite-dimensional modules over the hyperalgebra of a semi-simple algebraic group in positive chararacteristic called quasi-Verma modules. We provide a purely algebraic construction of the global Grothendieck-Cousin complex corresponding to the standard line bumdle {\mathcal L}(\lambda) on the Flag variety of the algebraic group stratified by Schubert cells. We prove that the complex consists of direct sums of quasi-Verma modules for the highest weights of the form w\cdot\lambda for various elements w of the Weyl group.
