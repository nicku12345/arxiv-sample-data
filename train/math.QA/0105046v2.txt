The fusion products of admissible representations of the su(2) WZW model at the fractional level k=-4/3 are analysed. It is found that some fusion products define representations for which the spectrum of L_0 is not bounded from below. Furthermore, the fusion products generate representations that are not completely reducible and for which the action of L_0 is not diagonalisable. The complete set of representations that is closed under fusion is identified, and the corresponding fusion rules are derived.
