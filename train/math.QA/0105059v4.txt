We discuss ways that the ring of coefficients for a TQFT can be reduced if one restricts somewhat the allowed cobordisms. When we apply these methods to a TQFT associated to SO(3) at an odd prime p, we obtain a functor from a somewhat restricted cobordism category to the category of free finitely generated modules over a ring of cyclotomic integers :Z [zeta_{2p}], if p \equiv -1 mod{4}, and Z [zeta_{4p}], if p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}, where zeta_k is a primitive kth root of unity. We study the quantum invariants of prime power order simple cyclic covers of 3-manifolds. We define new invariants arising from strong shift equivalence and integrality. Similar results are obtained for some other TQFTs but the modules are only guaranteed to be projective.
