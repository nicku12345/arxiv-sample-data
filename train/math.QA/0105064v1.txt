We investigate a generalization of Hopf algebra \mathfrak{sl}_{q}(2) by weakening the invertibility of the generator K, i.e. exchanging its invertibility KK^{-1}=1 to the regularity K\overline{K}K=K. This leads to a weak Hopf algebra w\mathfrak{sl}_{q}(2) and a J-weak Hopf algebra v\mathfrak{sl}_{q}(2) which are studied in detail. It is shown that the monoids of group-like elements of w\mathfrak{sl}_{q}(2) and v\mathfrak{sl}_{q}(2) are regular monoids, which supports the general conjucture on the connection betweek weak Hopf algebras and regular monoids. Moreover, from w\mathfrak{sl}_{q}(2) a quasi-braided weak Hopf algebra \overline{U}_{q}^{w} is constructed and it is shown that the corresponding quasi-R-matrix is regular R^{w}\hat{R}^{w}R^{w}=R^{w}.
