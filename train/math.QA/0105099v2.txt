In CJKLS quandle cohomology is used to produce invariants for particular embeddings of codimension two; 2-cocycles give to invariants for (classical) knots and 3-cocycles give rise to invariants for knotted surfaces. This is done by way of a notion of coloring of a diagram. Also, these invariants have the form of state-sums (or partition functions) used in Statistical Mechanics.   By a careful analysis of these colorings of diagrams we are able to come up with new invariants which correspond to calculation of the partition function at finite temperatures.
