A quantum solvable algebra is an iterated q-skew extension of a commutative algebra. We get finite statification of prime spectrum for quantum solvable algebras obeying some natural conditions. We prove that for any prime ideal I the skew field of fractions Fract(R/I) is isomorphic to the skew field of fractions of an algebra of twisted polynomials (Quantum Gel'fand-Kirillov Conjecture).
