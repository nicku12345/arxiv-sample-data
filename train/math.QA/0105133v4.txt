Consider the infinite dimensional flag manifold LK/T corresponding to the simple Lie group K of rank l and with maximal torus T. We show that, for K of type A, B or C, if we endow the space H^*(LK/T)\otimes \bR[q_1,...,q_{l+1}] (where q_1,...,q_{l+1} are multiplicative variables) with an \bR[\{q_j\}]-bilinear product satisfying some simple properties analogous to the quantum product on QH^*(K/T), then the isomorphism type of the resulting ring is determined by the integrals of motion of a certain periodic Toda lattice system, in exactly the same way as the isomorphism type of QH^*(K/T) is determined by the integrals of motion of the non-periodic Toda lattice (see the theorem of Kim). This is a generalization of a theorem of Guest and Otofuji.
