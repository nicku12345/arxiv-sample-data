The Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type A acts on tensor product space of the natural representation of the quantum superalgebra U_q(gl(m,n)). We show this action of the Hecke algebra and the action of U_q(gl(m,n)) on the same space determine commuting actions of each other. Together with this result and Gyoja's q-analogue of the Young symmetrizer, we construct a highest weight vector of each irreducible summmand of the tensor product space.
