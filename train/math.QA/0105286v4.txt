We consider a deformation of the BF theory in any dimension by means of the antifield BRST formalism. Possible consistent interaction terms for the action and the gauge symmetries are analyzed and we find a new class of topological gauge theories. Deformations of the world volume BF theory are considered as possible deformations of the topological open membrane. Therefore if we consider these theories on open membranes, we obtain noncommutative structures of the boundaries of open membranes, and we propose a generalization of the path integral representation of the star deformation.
