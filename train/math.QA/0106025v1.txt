We introduce and study generalized Umemura polynomials U_{n,m}^{(k)}(z,w;a,b) which are the natural generalization of the Umemura polynomials U_n(z,w;a,b) related to the Painleve VI equation. We show that if either a=b, or a=0, or b=0, then polynomials U_{n,m}^{(0)}(z,w;a,b) generate solutions to the Painleve VI equation. We give new proof of Noumi-Okada-Okamoto-Umemura conjecture, and describe connections between polynomials U_{n,m}^{(0)}(z,w;a,0) and certain Umemura polynomials U_k(z,w;\alpha,\beta). Finally we show that after appropriate rescaling, Umemura's polynomials U_k(z,w;a,b) satisfy the Hirota-Miwa bilinear equations.
