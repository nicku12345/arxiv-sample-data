We construct Wakimoto modules for twisted affine Lie algebras, and interpret the construction in terms of vertex algebras and their twisted modules. Using the Wakimoto realization, we prove the Kac-Kazhdan conjecture on the characters of irreducible modules with generic critical highest weights in the twisted case. We provide explicit formulas for the twisted fields in the case of the twisted affine algebra A^{(2)}_{2}.
