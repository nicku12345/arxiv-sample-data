We introduce and study a general concept of integral of a threetuple (H, A, C), where H is a Hopf algebra acting on a coalgebra C and coacting on an algebra A. In particular, quantum integrals associated to Yetter-Drinfel'd modules are defined. Let A be an H-bicomodule algebra, ^H {\cal YD}_A be the category of (generalized) Yetter-Drinfel'd modules and B the subalgebra of coinvariants of the Verma structure of A. We introduce the concept of quantum Galois extensions and we prove the affineness criterion in a quantum version.
