We show that for each semi-Riemannian locally symmetric space the curvature tensor gives rise to a rational solution r of the classical Yang-Baxter equation with spectral parameter. For several Riemannian globally symmetric spaces M such as real, complex and quaternionic Grassmann manifolds we explicitly compute solutions R of the quantum Yang Baxter equations (represented in the tangent spaces of M) which generalize the quantum R-matrix found by Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov in 1979.
