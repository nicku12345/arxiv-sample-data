We develop a theory of measures, differential forms and Fourier tramsforms on some infinite-dimensional real vector spaces by generalizing the following two constructions:   (a) The construction of the semiinfinite wedge power of a Tate vector space V. Recall that it is obtained as a certain double inductive limit of the exterior algebras of finite-dimensional subquotients of V.   (b) The construction of the space of measures on a nonarchimedean local field K with maximal ideal M as a double projective limit of the spaces of measures (=functions) on finite subquotients M^i/M^j of K.
