Let \bar{Pr} denote the ideal spanned by the characters of projective modules in the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite dimensional modules over the small quantum group u_l. We show that \bar{Pr} admits a description completely parallel to that of the Verlinde algebra of the fusion category, restricted over u_l, with the character of the Steinberg module playing the role of the identity.
