Pulling back the weight system associated with the spinor representation of the Lie algebra so(7) by the universal Vassiliev-Kontsevich invariant yields a numerical link invariant with values in formal power series. Computing some skein relations satisfied by this invariant, I derive a recursive algorithm for its evaluation. The values of this invariant belong to the ring Z[W,W^{-1}] of Laurent polynomials in one variable.
