Ordinary theta-functions can be considered as holomorphic sections of line bundles over tori. We show that one can define generalized theta-functions as holomorphic elements of projective modules over noncommutative tori (theta-vectors). The theory of these new objects is not only more general, but also much simpler than the theory of ordinary theta-functions. It seems that the theory of theta-vectors should be closely related to Manin's theory of quantized theta-functions, but we don't analyze this relation.
