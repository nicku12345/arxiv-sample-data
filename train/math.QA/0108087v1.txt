Classical contact Lie algebras are the fundamental algebraic structures on the manifolds of contact elements of configuration spaces in classical mechanics. In this paper, we determine the structure of the currently largest known category of contact simple Lie algebras introduced earlier by the second author. These algebras are in general not finitely-graded.
