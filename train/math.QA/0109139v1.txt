We introduce the notion of Lie algebras with plus-minus pairs as well as regular plus-minus pairs. These notions deal with certain factorizations in universal enveloping algebras. We show that many important Lie algebras have such pairs and we classify, and give a full treatment of, the three dimensional Lie algebras with plus-minus pairs.
