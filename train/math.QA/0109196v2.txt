Recall (math.QA/9812151) that the exponent of a finite-dimensional complex Hopf algebra H is the order of the Drinfeld element u of the Drinfeld double D(H) of H. Recall also that while this order may be infinite, the eigenvalues of u are always roots of unity (math.QA/9812151, Theorem 4.8); i.e., some power of u is always unipotent. We are thus naturally led to define the quasi-exponent of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H to be the order of unipotency of u.   The goal of the paper is to create a theory of quasi-exponent, which would be parallel to the theory of the exponent developed in math.QA/9812151. In particular, we give two other equivalent definitions of the quasi-exponent, and prove that it is invariant under twisting. Furthermore, we prove that the quasi-exponent of a finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebra H is equal to the exponent of the group G(H) of grouplike elements of H. (In particular, the order of the squared antipode of H divides exp(G(H)).) As an application, we find that if H is obtained by twisting the quantum group at root of unity U_q(g) then the order of any grouplike element in H divides the order of q.
