Following the ideas of our previous works math.QA/0008232 (joint with Andruskiewitsch) and math.QA/0101049, we study families of triangular Hopf algebras obtained by twisting finite supergroups by a twist lying entirely in the odd part. These families are parametrized by data (G,V,u,B), where G is a finite group, V its finite dimensional representation, u a central element of G of order 2 acting by -1 on V, and B an element of S^2V. We fix the discrete data G,V,u, and find the set of isomorphism classes of the members of the family as Hopf algebras, in terms of the continuous parameter B. This set is often infinite, which provides examples of nontrivial continuous families of triangular Hopf algebras. The lowest dimension in which such a family occurs is 32, in which case we get 3 families which are dual to the 3 families of pointed Hopf algebras of dimension 32 constructed recently by Grana. Furthermore, we show that if (S^2V)^G=0 then such continuous families are nontrivial not only up to a Hopf algebra isomorphism, but also up to twisting of the multiplication. Thus, they provide counterexamples to Masuoka's weakened Kaplansky's 10th conjecture, which claims that up to twisting, there are finitely many types of Hopf algebras in each dimension. Finally, we study the algebra structure of the duals of our families, and show they are direct sums of Clifford algebras. Since there are finitely many types of Clifford algebras in each dimension, this allows us to construct nontrivial families of rigid tensor structures on the abelian category of modules over a finite dimensional algebra, with a fixed Grothendieck ring.
