This is a survey on pointed Hopf algebras over algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0. We propose to classify pointed Hopf algebras A by first determining the graded Hopf algebra \gr A associated to the coradical filtration of A. The A_{0}-coinvariants elements form a braided Hopf algebra R in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over the coradical A_{0} = \ku \Gamma, \Gamma the group of group-like elements of A, and \gr A \simeq R # A_{0}. We call the braiding of the primitive elements of R the infinitesimal braiding of A. If this braiding is of Cartan type \cite{AS2}, then it is often possible to determine R, to show that R is generated as an algebra by its primitive elements and finally to compute all deformations or liftings, that is pointed Hopf algebras such that \gr A \simeq R # \ku \Gamma. In the last Chapter, as a concrete illustration of the method, we describe explicitly all finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras A with abelian group of group-likes G(A) and infinitesimal braiding of type A_{n} (up to some exceptional cases). In other words, we compute all the liftings of type A_n; this result is our main new contribution in this paper.
