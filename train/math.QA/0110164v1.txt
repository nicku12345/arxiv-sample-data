We study a class of algebras with non-Lie commutation relations whose symplectic leaves are surfaces of revolution: a cylinder or a torus. Over each of such surfaces we introduce a family of complex structures and Hilbert spaces of antiholomorphic sections in which the irreducible Hermitian representations of the original algebra are realized. The reproducing kernels of these spaces are expressed in terms of the Riemann theta-function and its modifications. They generate quantum K\"ahler structures on the surface and the corresponding quantum reproducing measures. We construct coherent transforms intertwining abstract representations of an algebra with irreducible representations, and these transforms are also expressed via the theta-function.
