The aim of this paper is to give a group theoretical interpretation of the three types of Bessel-Jackson functions. We consider a family of quantum Lorentz groups and a family of quantum Lobachevsky spaces. For three members of quantum Lobachevsky spaces the Casimir operators give rise to the two-body relativistic open Toda lattice Hamiltonians. Their eigen-functions are the modified Bessel-Jackson functions of three types. We construct the principal series of unitary irreducible representations of the quantum Lorentz groups. Special matrix elements in the irreducible spaces are the Bessel-Macdonald-Jackson functions. They are the wave functions of the two-body relativistic open Toda lattice. We obtain integral representations for these functions.
