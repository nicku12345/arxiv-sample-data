This is a continuation of the paper "Modular tensor categories and orbifold theories", arXiv:math.QA/0104242. It discusses orbifold models of conformal filed theory, or, in mathematical language, question of constructing the category of representations of the fixed point algebra V^G for a given vertex operator algebra V with an action of a finite group G. The previous paper gave a proof of well-known conjecture of Dijkgraaf-Vafa-Verlinde-Verlinde giving a complete answer to this question in the holomorphic case (when V has a unique simple module, V itself) under the assumption that categories of rrepresentations of V, V^G are modular tensor categories. In the current paper, we give a partial answer in non-holomorphic case. In particular, we show that the category of representations of V^G is completely determined by the category of twisted V-modules together with the action of G on this category. Our approach is based on describing representations of V, V^G and relation between them in terms of tensor categories and avoids using the technique of VOAs as much as possible.
