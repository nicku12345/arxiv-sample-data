In this paper we show how to construct explicitly induced representations for bicrossproduct Hopf algebras with abelian kernels starting from one-dimensional characters of the commutative sector. We introduce this technique by means of two concrete physical examples: two quantum deformations of the (1+1) Galilei algebra.
