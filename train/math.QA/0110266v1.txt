We analyze the elements characterizing the theory of induced representations of   Lie groups, in order to generalize it to quantum groups. We emphasize the geometric and algebraic aspects of the theory, because they are more suitable for generalization in the framework of Hopf algebras. As an example, we present the induced representations of a quantum deformation of the extended Galilei algebra in (1+1) dimensions.
