We present a method to construct induced representations of quantum algebras having the structure of bicrossproduct. We apply this procedure to some quantum kinematical algebras in (1+1)--dimensions with this kind of structure: null-plane quantum Poincare algebra, non-standard quantum Galilei algebra and quantum kappa Galilei algebra.
