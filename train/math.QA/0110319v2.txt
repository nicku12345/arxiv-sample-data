Jiang-Hua Lu showed that any dynamical r-matrix for the pair (g,u) naturally induces a Poisson homogeneous structure on G/U. She also proved that if g is complex simple, u is its Cartan subalgebra and r is quasitriangular, then this correspondence is in fact 1-1. In the present paper we find some general conditions under which the Lu correspondence is 1-1. Then we apply this result to describe all triangular Poisson homogeneous structures on G/U for a simple complex group G and its reductive subgroup U containing a Cartan subgroup.
