We derive an explicit expression for an associative star product on non-commutative versions of complex Grassmannian spaces, in particular for the case of complex 2-planes. Our expression is in terms of a finite sum of derivatives. This generalises previous results for complex projective spaces and gives a discrete approximation for the Grassmannians in terms of a non-commutative algebra, represented by matrix multiplication in a finite-dimensional matrix algebra. The matrices are restricted to have a dimension which is precisely determined by the harmonic expansion of functions on the commutative Grassmannian, truncated at a finite level. In the limit of infinite-dimensional matrices we recover the commutative algebra of functions on the complex Grassmannians.
