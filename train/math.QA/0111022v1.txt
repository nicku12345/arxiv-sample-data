We introduce general q-deformed multiple polylogarithms which even in the dilogarithm case differ slightly from the deformation usually discussed in the literature. The merit of the deformation as suggested, here, is that q-deformed multiple polylogarithms define an algebra, then (as in the undeformed case). For the special case of q-deformed multiple zeta-values, we show that there exists even a noncommutative and noncocommutative Hopf algebra structure which is a deformation of the commutative Hopf algebra structure which one has in the classical case. Finally, we discuss the possible correspondence between q-deformed multiple polylogarithms and a noncommutative and noncocommutative self-dual Hopf algebra recently introduced by the author as a quantum analog of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group.
