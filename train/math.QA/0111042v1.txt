We study *-differential calculi over compact quantum groups in the sense of S.L. Woronowicz. Our principal results are the construction of a Hodge operator commuting with the Laplacian, the derivation of a corresponding Hodge decomposition of the calculus of forms, and, for Woronowicz' first calculus, the calculation of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian
