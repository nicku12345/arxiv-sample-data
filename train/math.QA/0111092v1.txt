In this note we give an explicit geometric description of some of the Nakajima's quiver varieties. More precisely, we show that the \Gamma-equivariant Hilbert scheme X^{\Gamma[n]} and the Hilbert scheme X_\Gamma^{[n]} (where X=\C^2, \Gamma\subset SL(\C^2) is a finite subgroup, and X_\Gamma is a minimal resolution of X/\Gamma) are quiver varieties for the affine Dynkin graph, corresponding to \Gamma via the McKay correspondence, the same dimension vectors, but different parameters \zeta (for earlier results in this direction see [4, 12, 13]). In particular, it follows that the varieties X^{\Gamma[n]} and X_\Gamma^{[n]} are diffeomorphic. Computing their cohomology (in the case \Gamma=\Z/d\Z) via the fixed points of (\C^*\times\C^*)-action we deduce the following combinatorial identity: the number UCY(n,d) of uniformly coloured in d colours Young diagrams consisting of nd boxes coincides with the number CY(n,d) of collections of d Young diagrams with the total number of boxes equal to n.
