The paper contains a systematic theory of the one-dimensional Double Hecke algebra, including applications to the difference Fourier transform, Macdonald's polynomials, Gaussian sums at roots of unity, and Verlinde algebras. The main result is the classification of finite-dimensional representations for generic q and at roots of unity.
