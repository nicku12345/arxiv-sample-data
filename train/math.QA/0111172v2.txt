In a representation theoretic approach a free q-relativistic wave equation must be such, that the space of solutions is an irreducible representation of the q-Poincare algebra. It is shown how this requirement uniquely determines the q-wave equations. As examples, the q-Dirac equation (including q-gamma matrices which satisfy a q-Clifford algebra), the q-Weyl equations, and the q-Maxwell equations are computed explicitly.
