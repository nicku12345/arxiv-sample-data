We investigate a class of algebras that provides multiparameter versions of both quantum symplectic space and quantum Euclidean 2n-space. These algebras encompass the graded quantized Weyl algebras, the quantized Heisenberg space, and a class of algebras introduced by Oh. We describe the structure of the prime and primitive ideals of these algebras. Other structural results include normal separation and catenarity.
