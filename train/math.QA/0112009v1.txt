We discuss relations between different integral formulae for solutions of the quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equation at level zero in the U_q(sl_2) case for |q|<1. Smirnov type formulae of M.Jimbo et al. are derived from the general approach of A.Varchenko and the author. The consideration is parallel to the qKZ equation in the rational sl_2 case done by A.Nakayashiki, S.Pakuliak and the author [q-alg/9712002].
