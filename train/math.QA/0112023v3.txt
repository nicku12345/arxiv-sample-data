We consider the sine-Gordon and affine Toda field theories on the half-line with classically integrable boundary conditions, and show that in the quantum theory a remnant survives of the bulk quantized affine algebra symmetry generated by non-local charges. The paper also develops a general framework for obtaining solutions of the reflection equation by solving an intertwining property for representations of certain coideal subalgebras of quantized affine algebras.
