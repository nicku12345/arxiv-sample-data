We determined the inner products of two conformal vectors with central charge 1/2 whose \tau-involutions generates S_3 if none of \tau-involutions are trivial. We also see that a subVA generated by such conformal vectors is a VOA with central charge 1/2+20/21 or 4/5+6/7 and has a Griess algebra of dimension three or four, respectively.
