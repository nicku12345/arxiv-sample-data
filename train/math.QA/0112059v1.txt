We introduce a construction of the differential calculus on the quantum supergroup GL_{p,q}(1| 1). We obtain two differential calculi, respectively, associated with the left and right Cartan-Maurer one-forms. We also obtain the quantum superalgebra of GL_{p,q}(1| 1). Although all of the structures we obtain are derived without an R matrix, they neverthless can be expressed using an R matrix.
