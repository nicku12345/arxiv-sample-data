The two parameter quantum deformation of 2x2 Grassmann matrices, Gr(2), and supermatrices, Gr(1| 1), are presented. Gr(2) whose matrix elements are all Grassmannian variables is called the superdual of the genel linear group GL(2), and Gr(1| 1) whose diagonal matrix elements are Grassmannian variables is called the superdual of the supergroup GL(1| 1) whose nondiagonal elements are Grassmannian. Noncentral dual superdeterminant for Grassmann supermatrices belonging to Gr_{p,q}(1| 1) is constructed. As with the 2x2 quantum matrices, the relations satisfied by the matrix elements of the Grassmann matrices are expressed in terms of an \hat{R}-matrix. The properties of nth power of a Grassmann supermatrix are given as an Appendix.
