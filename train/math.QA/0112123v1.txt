The differential calculus on the quantum supergroup GL_q(1| 1) was introduced by Schmidke {\it et al}. (1990 {\it Z. Phys. C} {\bf 48} 249). We construct a differential calculus on the quantum supergroup GL_q(1| 1) in a different way and we obtain its quantum superalgebra. The main structures are derived without an R-matrix. It is seen that the found results can be written with help of a matrix \hat{R}
