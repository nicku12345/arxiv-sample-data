A non-commutative differential calculus on the h-superplane is presented via a contraction of the q-superplane. An R-matrix which satisfies both ungraded and graded Yang-Baxter equations is obtained and a new deformation of the (1+1) dimensional classical phase space (the super-Heisenberg algebra) is introduced.
