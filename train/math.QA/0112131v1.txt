We introduce the notion of 321-avoiding permutations in the affine Weyl group W of type A_{n-1} by considering the group as a George group (in the sense of Eriksson and Eriksson). This enables us to generalize a result of Billey, Jockusch and Stanley to show that the 321-avoiding permutations in W coincide with the set of fully commutative elements; in other words, any two reduced expressions for a 321-avoiding element of W (considered as a Coxeter group) may be obtained from each other by repeated applications of short braid relations.   Using Shi's characterization of the Kazhdan--Lusztig cells in the group W, we use our main result to show that the fully commutative elements of W form a union of Kazhdan--Lusztig cells. This phenomenon has been studied by the author and J. Losonczy for finite Coxeter groups, and is interesting partly because it allows certain structure constants for the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of the associated Hecke algebra to be computed combinatorially.   We also show how some of our results can be generalized to a larger group of permutations, the extended affine Weyl group associated to GL_n({\Bbb C}).
