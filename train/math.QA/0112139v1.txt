We introduce a noncommutative differential calculus on the two-parameter h-superplane via a contraction of the (p,q)-superplane. We manifestly show that the differential calculus is covariant under GL_{h_1,h_2}(1| 1) transformations. We also give a two-parameter deformation of the (1+1)-dimensional phase space algebra.
