We introduce a two-parameter deformation of 2x2 matrices without imposing any condition on the matrices and give the universal R-matrix of the nonstandard quantum group which satisfies the quantum Yang-Baxter relation. Although in the standard two-parameter deformation the quantum determinant is not central, in the nonstandard case it is central. We note that the quantum group thus obtained is related to the quantum supergroup GL_{p,q}(1|1) by a transformation.
