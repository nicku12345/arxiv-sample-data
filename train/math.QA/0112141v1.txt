For a commutative algebra the shuffle product is a morphism of complexes. We generalize this result to the quantum shuffle product, associated to a class of non-commutative algebras (for example all the Hopf algebras). As a first application we show that the Hochschild-Serre identity is the dual statement of our result. In particular, we extend this identity to Hopf algebras. Secondly, we clarify the construction of a class of quasi-Hopf algebras.
