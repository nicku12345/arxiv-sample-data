We give an explicit formula for the exchange matrix correponding to the tensor product of two copies of the natural (standard) evaluation representation of the quantum group associated to the affine Lie algebra of sl(n+1). Then we calculate the gauge trasformations that transforms it into Felder's elliptic solution of the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation, for the proper parameters. All intermediate formulas are explicitly calculated.
