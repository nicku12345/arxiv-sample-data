We introduce a quantization of the graded algebra of functions on the canonical cone of an algebraic curve C, based on the theory of formal pseudodifferential operators. When C is a complex curve with Poincar\'e uniformization, we propose another, equivalent construction, based on the work of Cohen-Manin-Zagier on Rankin-Cohen brackets. We give a presentation of the quantum algebra when C is a rational curve, and discuss the problem of constructing algebraically "differential liftings".
