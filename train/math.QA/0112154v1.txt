Covariant first order differential calculus over quantum complex Grassmann manifolds is considered. It is shown by a Pusz-Woronowicz type argument that under restriction to calculi close to classical Kaehler differentials there exist exactly two such calculi for the homogeneous coordinate ring. Complexification and localization procedures are used to induce covariant first order differential calculi over quantum Grassmann manifolds. It is shown that these differential calculi behave in many respects as their classical counterparts. As an example the q-deformed Chern character of the tautological bundle is constructed.
