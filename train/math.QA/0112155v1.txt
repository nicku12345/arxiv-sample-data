For differential calculi over certain right coideal subalgebras of quantum groups the notion of quantum tangent space is introduced. In generalization of a result by Woronowicz a one to one correspondence between quantum tangent spaces and covariant first order differential calculi is established. This result is used to classify differential calculi over quantum Grassmann manifolds. It turns out that up to special cases in low dimensions there exists exactly one such calculus of classical dimension 2r(N-r).   Keywords: Quantum groups, quantum spaces, quantum Grassmann manifolds, differential calculus
