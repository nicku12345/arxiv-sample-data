We find an infinite number of noncommutative geometries which posses a differential structure. They generalize the two dimensional noncommutative plane, and have infinite dimensional representations. Upon applying generalized coherent states we are able to take the continuum limit, where we recover the punctured plane with non constant Poisson structures.
