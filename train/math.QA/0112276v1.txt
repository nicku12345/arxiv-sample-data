We construct commuting families in fraction fields of symmetric powers of algebras. The classical limit of this construction gives Poisson commuting families associated with linear systems. In the case of a K3 surface S, they correspond to lagrangian fibrations introduced by Beauville. When S is the canonical cone of an algebraic curve C, we construct commuting families of differential operators on symmetric powers of C, quantizing the Beauville systems.
