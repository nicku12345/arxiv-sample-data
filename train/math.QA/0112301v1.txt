The characteristic class of a star product on a symplectic manifold appears as the class of a deformation of a given symplectic connection, as described by Fedosov. In contrast, one usually thinks of the characteristic class of a star product as the class of a deformation of the Poisson structure (as in Kontsevich's work). In this paper, we present, in the symplectic framework, a natural procedure for constructing a star product by directly quantizing a deformation of the symplectic structure. Basically, in Fedosov's recursive formula for the star product with zero characteristic class, we replace the symplectic structure by one of its formal deformations in the parameter \hbar. We then show that every equivalence class of star products contains such an element. Moreover, within a given class, equivalences between such star products are realized by formal one-parameter families of diffeomorphisms, as produced by Moser's argument.
