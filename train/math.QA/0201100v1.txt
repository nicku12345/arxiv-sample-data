The noncommutative A-ideal of a knot is a generalization of the A-polynomial, defined using Kauffman bracket skein modules. In this paper we show that any knot that has the same noncommutative A-ideal as the (2,2p+1)-torus knot has the same colored Jones polynomials. This is a consequence of the orthogonality relation, which yields a recursive relation for computing all colored Jones polynomials of the knot.
