We bosonize certain components of level \ell U_q(\hat{sl}_2)-intertwiners of (\ell + 1)-dimensions. For \ell = 2, these intertwiners, after certain modification by bosonic vertex operators, are added to the algebra U_q(\hat{sl}_2) at level 2 to construct all irreducible highest weight representations of level 1 for the quantum affine algebra U_q(\hat{sp}_4).
