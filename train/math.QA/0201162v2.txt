We discuss a general theory of Lorentzian Kac--Moody algebras which should be a hyperbolic analogy of the classical theories of finite-dimensional semi-simple and affine Kac-Moody algebras. First examples of Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras were found by Borcherds. We consider general finiteness results about the set of Lorentzian Kac--Moody algebras and the problem of their classification. As an example, we give classification of Lorentzian Kac--Moody algebras of the rank three with the symmetry group which is an extended paramodular group. Perhaps, this is the first example when a large class of Lorentzian Kac--Moody algebras was classified. This paper is closely related with our papers math.AG/9810001, math.AG/0010329
