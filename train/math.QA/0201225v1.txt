In this paper, we study Riccati solutions of Painlev\'e equations from a view point of geometry of Okamoto-Painlev\'e pairs (S,Y). After establishing the correspondence between (rational) nodal curves on S-Y and Riccati solutions, we give the complete classification of the configurations of nodal curves on S-Y for each Okamoto-Painlev\'e pair (S, Y). As an application of the classification, we prove the non-existence of Riccati solutions of Painlev\'e equations of types P_{I}, P_{III}^{\tilde{D}_8} and P_{III}^{\tilde{D}_7}. We will also give a partial answer to the conjecture in (STT) and (T) that the dimension of the local cohomology H^1_{Y_{red}}(S,\Theta_S(-\log Y_{red})) is one.
