In this article we develop some aspects of the construction of new Hopf algebras found recently by Andruskiewitsch and Schneider. There the authors classified (under some slight restrictions) all pointed finite dimensional Hopf algebras with coradical (Z/p)^s. We contribute to this work by giving a closer description of the possible ``exotic'' linkings.
