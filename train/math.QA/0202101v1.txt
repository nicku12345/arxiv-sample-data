Unitary representations of kinematical symmetry groups of quantum systems are fundamental in quantum theory. We propose in this paper its generalization to quantum kinematical groups. Using the method, proposed by us in a recent paper (olmo01), to induce representations of quantum bicrossproduct algebras we construct the representations of the family of standard quantum inhomogeneous algebras U_\lambda(iso_{\omega}(2)). This family contains the quantum Euclidean, Galilei and Poincar\'e algebras, all of them in (1+1) dimensions. As byproducts we obtain the actions of these quantum algebras on regular co-spaces that are an algebraic generalization of the homogeneous spaces and q--Casimir equations which play the role of q--Schr\"odinger equations.
