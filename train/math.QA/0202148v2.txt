Let n be the maximal nilpotent subalgebra of a simple complex Lie algebra g. We introduce the notion of imaginary vector in the dual canonical basis of U_q(n), and we give examples of such vectors for types A_n (n\ge 5), B_n (n\ge 3), C_n (n\ge 3), D_n (n\ge 4), and all exceptional types. This disproves a conjecture of Berenstein and Zelevinsky about q-commuting products of vectors of the dual canonical basis. It also shows the existence of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of quantum affine algebras whose tensor square is not irreducible.
