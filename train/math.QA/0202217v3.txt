This article follows our previous work on Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We study the case of symmetric spaces. We recover, by using a Kontsevich's deformation of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, Rouviere's results on the convolution of invariant distributions, for solvable symmetric spaces and "very symmetric spaces".
