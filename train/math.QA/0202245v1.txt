It is shown that spin Calogero-Moser systems are completely integrable in a sense of degenerate integrability. Their Liouville tori have dimension less then half of the dimension of the phase space. It is also shown that rational spin Ruijsenaars systems are degenerately integrable and dual to spin Calogero- Moser systems in a sense that action-algle variables of one are angle-action variables of the other.
