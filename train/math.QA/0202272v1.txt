Let \mathcal{W}_N be a quantized Borel subalgebra of U_q(sl(2,\mc)), specialized at a primitive root of unity \omega = \exp(2i\pi/N) of odd order N >1. One shows that the 6j-symbols of cyclic representations of \mathcal{W}_N are representations of the canonical element of a certain extension of the Heisenberg double of \mathcal{W}_N. This canonical element is a twisted q-dilogarithm. In particular, one gives explicit formulas for these 6j-symbols, and one constructs partial symmetrizations of them, the c-6j-symboles. The latters are at the basis of the construction of the quantum hyperbolic invariants of 3-manifolds.
