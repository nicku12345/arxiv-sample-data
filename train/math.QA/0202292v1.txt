We construct a vertex representation for the quantum toroidal algebra through the quantum general linear algebra. Using a new realization of the quantum general linear algebra we construct vertex operators for root vectors on the basic representation of the affine Lie algebra gl_n and show that the simple generators give rise a realization of the quantum toroidal algebra with two parameters.
