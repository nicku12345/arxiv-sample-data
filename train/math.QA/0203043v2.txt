We couple three-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theory with BF theory and study deformations of the theory by means of the antifield BRST formalism. We analyze all possible consistent interaction terms for the action under physical requirements and find a new topological field theory in three dimensions with new nontrivial terms and a nontrivial gauge symmetry. We analyze the gauge symmetry of the theory and point out the theory has the gauge symmetry based on the Courant algebroid.
