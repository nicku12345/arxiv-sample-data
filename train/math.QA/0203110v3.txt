We propose an algebraic description of (untwisted) D-branes on compact group manifolds G using quantum algebras related to U_q(\mg). It reproduces the known characteristics of stable branes in the WZW models, in particular their configurations in G, energies as well as the set of harmonics. Both generic and degenerate branes are covered.
