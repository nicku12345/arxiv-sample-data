We classify indecomposable racks of order p^2 (p a prime). There are 2p^2 - 2p - 2 isomorphism classes, among which 2p^2 - 3p - 1 correspond to quandles. In particular, we prove that an indecomposable quandle of order p^2 is affine (=Alexander). One of the results yielding this classification is the computation of the quandle nonabelian second cohomology group of an indecomposable quandle of prime order; which turns out to be trivial, as in the abelian case.
