We analyze in detail projective modules over two-dimensional noncommutative tori and complex structures on these modules.We concentrate our attention on properties of holomorphic vectors in these modules; the theory of these vectors generalizes the theory of theta-functions. The paper is self-contained; it can be used also as an introduction to the theory of noncommutative spaces with simplest space of this kind thoroughly analyzed as a basic example.
