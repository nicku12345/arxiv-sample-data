Kerov, Kirillov, and Reshetikhin defined a bijection between highest weight vectors in the crystal graph of a tensor power of the vector representation, and combinatorial objects called rigged configurations, for type A^{(1)}_n. We define an analogous bijection for all nonexceptional affine types, thereby proving (in this special case) the fermionic formulas conjectured by Hatayama, Kuniba, Takagi, Tsuboi, Yamada, and the first author.
