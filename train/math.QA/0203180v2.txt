We study a class of noncommutative surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues which provide answers to several open questions in noncommutative projective geometry. Specifically, we give the first known graded algebras which are noetherian but not strongly noetherian, answering a question of Artin, Small, and Zhang. In addition, these examples are maximal orders and satisfy the \chi_1 condition but not \chi_i for i \geq 2, answering a questions of Stafford and Zhang and a question of Stafford and Van den Bergh. Finally, we show that these algebras have finite cohomological dimension.
