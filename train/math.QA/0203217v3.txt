For the quantum integer [n]_q = 1+q+...+q^{n-1} there is a natural polynomial multiplication *_q such that [m]_q *_q [n]_q = [mn]_q. This multiplication leads to the functional equation f_{mn}(q) = f_m(q)f_n(q^m), defined on a given sequence \mathcal(F)=\{f_n(q)\}_{n=1}^{\infty} of polynomials. This paper contains various results concerning the classification and construction of polynomial sequences that satisfy the functional equation, as well as a list of open problems that arise fromthe classification.
