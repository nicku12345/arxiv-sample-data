The main result of this paper is a combinatorial description of a basis of standard level 1 module for the twisted affine Lie algebra A_2^{(2)}. This description also gives two new combinatorial identities of G\"ollnitz (or Rogers--Ramanujan) type. Methods used through the paper are mainly developed by J. Lepowsky, R. L. Wilson, A. Meurman and M. Primc, and the crucial role in constructions plays a vertex operator algebra approach to standard representations of affine Lie algebras.
