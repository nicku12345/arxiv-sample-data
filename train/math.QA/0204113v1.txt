The theory of quandle (co)homology and cocycle knot invariants is rapidly being developed. We begin with a summary of these recent advances. One such advance is the notion of a dynamical cocycle.   We show how dynamical cocycles can be used to color knotted surfaces that are obtained from classical knots by twist-spinning. We also demonstrate relations between cocycle invariants and Alexander matrices.
