We study the coupling of the closed string to the open string in the topological B-model. These couplings can be viewed as gauge invariant observables in the open string field theory, or as deformations of the differential graded algebra describing the OSFT. This is interpreted as an intertwining map from the closed string sector to the deformation (Hochschild) complex of the open string algebra. By an explicit calculation we show that this map induces an isomorphism of Gerstenhaber algebras on the level of cohomology. Reversely, this can be used to derive the closed string from the open string. We shortly comment on generalizations to other models, such as the A-model.
