We give a detailed comparison between the notion of a weak Hopf algebra (also called a quantum groupoid by Nikshych and Vainerman), and that of a \times_R-bialgebra due to Takeuchi (and also called a bialgebroid or quantum (semi)groupoid by Lu and Xu). A weak bialgebra is the same thing as a \times_R-bialgebra in which R is Frobenius-separable. We extend the comparison to cover module and comodule theory, duality, and the question when a bialgebroid should be called a Hopf algebroid.
