Let \ag be an affine Lie algebra, and let \Ua be the quantum affine algebra introduced by Drinfeld and Jimbo. In [Kas94] Kashiwara introduced a \Ua-module V(\lambda), having a global crystal base for an integrable weight \lambda of level 0. We call it an {\it extremal weight module}.   In [\S13]{Kas00} Kashiwara gave a conjecture on the structure of extremal weight modules. We prove his conjecture when \ag is an untwisted affine Lie algebra of a simple Lie algebra \g of type ADE, using a result of Beck-Chari-Pressley [BCP].
