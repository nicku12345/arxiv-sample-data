For an untwisted affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra \tilde{\mathfrak g}, and a given positive integer level k, vertex operators x(z)=\sum x(n)z^{-n-1}, x\in\mathfrak g, generate a vertex operator algebra V. For the maximal root \theta and a root vector x_\theta of the corresponding finite-dimensional \mathfrak g, the field x_\theta(z)^{k+1} generates all annihilating fields of level k standard \tilde{\mathfrak g}-modules. In this paper we study the kernel of the normal order product map r(z)\otimes Y(v,z)\mapsto :r(z) Y(v,z): for v\in V and r(z) in the space of annihilating fields generated by the action of \tfrac{d}{dz} and \mathfrak g on x_\theta(z)^{k+1}. We call the elements of this kernel the relations for annihilating fields, and the main result is that this kernel is generated, in certain sense, by the relation x_\theta(z)\tfrac{d}{dz}(x_\theta(z)^{k+1})= (k+1)x_\theta(z)^{k+1}\tfrac{d}{dz}x_\theta(z). This study is motivated by Lepowsky-Wilson's approach to combinatorial Rogers-Ramanujan type identities, and many ideas used here stem from a joint work with Arne Meurman.
