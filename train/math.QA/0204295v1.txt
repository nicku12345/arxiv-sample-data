We prove that the reflection equation (RE) algebra \La_R associated with a finite dimensional representation of a quasitriangular Hopf algebra \Ha is twist-equivalent to the corresponding Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan (FRT) algebra. We show that \La_R is a module algebra over the twisted tensor square \twist{\Ha}{\Ha} and the double \D(\Ha). We define FRT- and RE-type algebras and apply them to the problem of equivariant quantization on Lie groups and matrix spaces.
