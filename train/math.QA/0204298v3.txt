Let G be a reductive Lie group, \g its Lie algebra, and M a G-manifold. Suppose \A_h(M) is a \U_h(\g)-equivariant quantization of the function algebra \A(M) on M. We develop a method of building \U_h(\g)-equivariant quantization on G-orbits in M as quotients of \A_h(M). We are concerned with those quantizations that may be simultaneously represented as subalgebras in \U^*_h(\g) and quotients of \A_h(M). It turns out that they are in one-to-one correspondence with characters of the algebra \A_h(M). We specialize our approach to the situation \g=gl(n,\C), M=\End(\C^n), and \A_h(M) the so-called reflection equation algebra associated with the representation of \U_h(\g) on \C^n. For this particular case, we present in an explicit form all possible quantizations of this type; they cover symmetric and bisymmetric orbits. We build a two-parameter deformation family and obtain, as a limit case, the \U(\g)-equivariant quantization of the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau bracket on symmetric orbits.
