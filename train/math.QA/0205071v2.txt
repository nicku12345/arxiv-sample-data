We study the structure constants of the class algebra R_Z(G_n) of the wreath products G_n associated to an arbitrary finite group G with respect to the basis of conjugacy classes. We show that a suitable filtration on R_Z(G_n) gives rise to the graded ring \mathcal G_G(n) with non-negative integer structure constants independent of n (some of which are computed), which are then encoded in a Farahat-Higman ring \mathcal G_G. The real conjugacy classes of G come to play a distinguished role, and is treated in detail in the case when G is a subgroup of SL_2(C). The above results provide new insight to the cohomology rings of Hilbert schemes of points on a quasi-projective surface.
