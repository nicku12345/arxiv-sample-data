We consider the crystal structure of the level zero extremal weight modules V(\lambda) using the crystal base of the quantum affine algebra constructed by Beck, Chari and Pressley. This approach yields an explicit form for the U^- extremal weight vectors in each connected component of the crystal of V(\lambda), which are given as Schur functions in the imaginary root vectors. We use this fact to demonstrate Kashiwara's conjectures regarding the crystal structure of V(\lambda).
