We introduce a quantum Minkowski space-time based on the quantum group SU(2)q extended by a degree operator and formulate a quantum version of the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equation. We construct solutions of the quantum equations using the classical ADHM linear data, and conjecture that, up to gauge transformations, our construction yields all the solutions. We also find a deformation of Penrose's twistor diagram, giving a correspondence between the quantum Minkowski space-time and the classical projective twistor space.
