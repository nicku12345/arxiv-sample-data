We study the standard angular momentum algebra [x_i,x_j]=i\lambda \epsilon_{ijk}x_k as a noncommutative manifold R^3_\lambda. We show that there is a natural 4D differential calculus and obtain its cohomology and Hodge * operator. We solve the spin 0 wave equation and some aspects of the Maxwell or electromagnetic theory including solutions for a uniform electric current density, and we find a natural Dirac operator. We embed R^3_\lambda inside a 4D noncommutative spacetime which is the limit q\to 1 of q-Minkowski space and show that R^3_\lambda has a natural quantum isometry group given by the quantum double D(U(su(2))) as a singular limit of the q-Lorentz group. We view \R^3_\lambda as a collection of all fuzzy spheres taken together. We also analyse the semiclassical limit via minimum uncertainty states |j,\theta,\phi> approximating classical positions in polar coordinates.
