Proposing a certain category of bialgebroid maps we show that the balanced depth 2 extensions appear as they were the finitary Galois extensions in the context of quantum groupoid actions, i.e., actions by finite bialgebroids, weak bialgebras or weak Hopf algebras. We comment on deformation of weak bialgebras, on half grouplike elements, on uniqueness of weak Hopf algebra reconstructions and discuss the example of separable field extensions.
