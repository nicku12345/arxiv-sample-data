Using the fusion product of the representations of the Lie algebra \mathfrak{sl}_2 we construct a set of the integrable highest weight \hat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}-modules L^D, depending on the vector D\in\mathbb{N}^{k+1}. In a special cases of D our modules are isomorphic to the irreducible \hat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}-modules L_{i,k}. We construct a basis of the L^D and study the decomposition of L^D on the irreducible components. We also write a formulas for the characters of L^D.
