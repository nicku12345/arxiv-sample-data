We study the Howe dualities involving the reductive dual pairs (O(d),spo(2m|2n)) and (Sp(d),osp(2m|2n)) on the (super)symmetric tensor of \C^d\otimes\C^{m|n}. We obtain complete decompositions of this space with respect to their respective joint actions. We also use these dualities to derive a character formula for these irreducible representations of spo(2m|2n) and osp(2m|2n) that appear in these decompositions.
