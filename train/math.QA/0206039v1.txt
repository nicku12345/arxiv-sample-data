A simple iterative procedure is suggested for the deformation quantization of (irregular) Poisson brackets associated to the classical Yang-Baxter equation. The construction is shown to admit a pure algebraic reformulation giving the Universal Deformation Formula (UDF) for any triangular Lie bialgebra. A simple proof of classification theorem for inequivalent UDF's is given. As an example the explicit quantization formula is presented for the quasi-homogeneous Poisson brackets on two-plane.
