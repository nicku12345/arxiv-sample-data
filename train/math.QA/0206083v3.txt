In this article we present formulae for q-integration on quantum spaces which could be of particular importance in physics, i.e. q-deformed Minkowski space and q-deformed Euclidean space in 3 or 4 dimensions. Furthermore, our formulae can be regarded as a generalization of Jackson's q-integral to 3 and 4 dimensions and provide a new possibility for an integration over the whole space being invariant under translations and rotations.
