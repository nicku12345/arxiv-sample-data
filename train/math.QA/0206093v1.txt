Modified braid equations satisfied by generalized {\hat R} matrices (for a {\em given} set of group relations obeyed by the elements of {\sf T} matrices ) are constructed for q-deformed quantum groups GL_q (N), SO_q (N) and Sp_q (N) with arbitrary values of N. The Baxterization of {\hat R} matrices, treated as an aspect complementary to the {\em modification} of the braid equation, is obtained for all these cases in particularly elegant forms. A new class of braid matrices is discovered for the quantum groups SO_{q}(N) and Sp_{q}(N). The {\hat R} matrices of this class, while being distinct from restrictions of the universal {\hat{\cal R}} matrix to the corresponding vector representations, satisfy the standard braid equation. The modified braid equation and the Baxterization are obtained for this new class of {\hat R} matrices. Diagonalization of the generalized {\hat R} matrices is studied. The diagonalizers are obtained explicitly for some lower dimensional cases in a convenient way, giving directly the eigenvalues of the corresponding {\hat R} matrices. Applications of such diagonalization are then studied in the context of associated covariantly quantized noncommutative spaces.
