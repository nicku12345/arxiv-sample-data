We study a monoid associated to complex semisimple Lie algebras, called the quantic monoid. Its monoid ring is shown to be isomorphic to a degenerate quantized enveloping algebra. Moreover, we provide normal forms and a straightening algorithm for this monoid. All these results are proved by a realization in terms of representations of quivers, namely as the monoid of generic extensions of a quiver with automorphism.
