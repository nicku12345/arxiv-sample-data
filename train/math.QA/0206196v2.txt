Minor typographical errors fixed. Cochran constructed many links with Alexander module that of the unlink and some nonvanishing Milnor invariants, using as input commutators in a free group and as an invariant the longitudes of the links. We present a different and conjecturally complete construction, that uses elementary properties of clasper surgery, and a different invariant, the tree-part of the LMO invariant. Our method also constructs links with trivial higher Alexander modules and nontrivial Milnor invariants.
