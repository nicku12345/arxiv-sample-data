We define the extremal projector of the q-boson Kashiwara algebra B_q(\ge) and study their basic properties. Applying their proerties to the representation theory of the category {\cal O}(B_q(\ge)), whose objects are ''upper bounded '' B_q(\ge)-modules, we obtain its semi-simplicity and the classification of simple modules.
