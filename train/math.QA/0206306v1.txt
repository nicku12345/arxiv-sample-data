We classify the simple infinite dimensional integrable modules with finite dimensional weight spaces over the quantized enveloping algebra of an untwisted affine algebra. We prove that these are either highest (lowest) weight integrable modules or simple submodules of a loop module of a finite-dimensional simple integrable module and describe the latter class. Their characters and crystal bases theory are discussed in a special case.
