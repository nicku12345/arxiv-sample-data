The HKR (Hennings-Kauffman-Radford) framework is used to construct invariants of 4-thickenings of 2-dimensional CW complexes under 2-deformations (1- and 2- handle slides and creations and cancellations of 1-2 handle pairs). The input of the invariant is a finite dimensional unimodular ribbon Hopf algebra A and an element in a quotient of its center, which determines a trace function on A. We study the subset T^4 of trace elements which define invariants of 4-thickenings under 2-deformations. In T^4 two subsets are identified : T^3, which produces invariants of 4-thickenings normalizable to invariants of the boundary, and T^2, which produces invariants of 4-thickenings depending only on the 2-dimensional spine and the second Whitney number of the 4-thickening. The case of the quantum sl(2) is studied in details. We conjecture that sl(2) leads to four HKR-type invariants and describe the corresponding trace elements. Moreover, the fusion algebra of the semisimple quotient of the category of representations of the quantum sl(2) is identified as a subalgebra of a quotient of its center.
