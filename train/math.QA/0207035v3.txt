We study actions of ``compact quantum groups'' on ``finite quantum spaces''. According to Woronowicz and to general \c^*-algebra philosophy these correspond to certain coactions v:A\to A\otimes H. Here A is a finite dimensional \c^*-algebra, and H is a certain special type of Hopf *-algebra. If v preserves a positive linear form \phi :A\to\c, a version of Jones' ``basic construction'' applies. This produces a certain \c^*-algebra structure on A^{\otimes n}, plus a coaction v_n :A^{\otimes n}\to A^{\otimes n}\otimes H, for every n. The elements x satisfying v_n(x)=x\otimes 1 are called fixed points of v_n. They form a \c^*-algebra Q_n(v). We prove that under suitable assumptions on v the graded union of the algebras Q_n(v) is a spherical \c^*-planar algebra.
