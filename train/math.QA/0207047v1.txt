A dynamical scheme of quantization of symplectic manifolds is described. It is based on intrinsic Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg type nonlinear evolutionary equations with multidimensional time running over the manifold. This is the restricted version of the original article to be published in ``Asymptotic Methods for Wave and Quantum Problems'' (M. Karasev, ed.), Advances in Math. Sci., AMS.
