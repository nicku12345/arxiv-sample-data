Let H be a finite-dimensional quasibialgebra. We show that H is a quasi-Hopf algebra if and only if the category of its finite-dimensional left modules is rigid if and only if a structure theorem for Hopf modules over H holds. We also show that a dual structure theorem for Hopf modules over a coquasibialgebra H holds if and only if the category of finite-dimensional right H-comodules is rigid; this is not equivalent to H being a coquasi-Hopf algebra.
