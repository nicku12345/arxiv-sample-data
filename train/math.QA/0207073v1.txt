We study Hochschild homology and cohomology for some polynomial algebras mixing both ``classical'' relations (XY-YX=1) and ``quantum'' relations (XY={\l}YX). More specifically, we prove that the algebra of differential operators on any quantum affine space (quantum Weyl algebra) have the same Hochschild homology, and satisfy the same duality relation, as the classical Weyl algebra does.
