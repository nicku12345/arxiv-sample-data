In this article we study a VOA with two Miyamoto involutions generating S_3. In \cite{M3}, Miyamoto showed that a VOA generated by two conformal vectors whose Miyamoto involutions generate an automorphism group isomorphic to S_3 is isomorphic to one of the four candidates he listed. We construct one of them and prove that our VOA is actually the same as \mathrm{VA}(e,f) studied by Miyamoto. We also show that there is an embedding into the moonshine VOA. Using our VOA, we can define the 3A-triality in the Monster.
