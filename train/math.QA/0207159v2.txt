The aim of this paper is to evaluate in terms of q-special functions the objects (intertwining map, fusion matrix, exchange matrix) related to the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (QDYBE) for infinite dimensional representations (Verma modules) of the quantized universal enveloping algebra of g=sl(2,C). This study is done in the framework of the exchange construction, which was initiated (for general semisimple g) by Etingof and Varchenko (math.QA/9801135} and surveyed by Etingof and Schiffmann (math.QA/9908064) and Etingof (math.QA/0207008). Special attention is paid to the shifted boundary introduced by Babelon, Bernard and Billey (q-alg/9511019) and to its coincidence (first observed by Rosengren) with Rosengren's generalized elements in U_q(sl(2)) for conjugation. The present paper extends in various aspects our earlier paper math.QA/0007086, which dealt with q=1.
