Continuing our research on extensions of locally compact quantum groups, we give a classification of all cocycle matched pairs of Lie algebras in small dimensions and prove that all of them can be exponentiated to cocycle matched pairs of Lie groups. Hence, all of them give rise to locally compact quantum groups by the cocycle bicrossed product construction. We also clarify the notion of an extension of locally compact quantum groups by relating it to the concept of a closed normal quantum subgroup and the quotient construction. Finally, we describe the infinitesimal objects of locally compact quantum quantum groups with 2 and 3 generators - Hopf *-algebras and Lie bialgebras.
