From the `cofree' cooperad T'(A[-1]) on a collection A together with a differential, we construct an L_\infty-algebra structure on the total space \bigoplus_nA(n) that descends to coinvariants. We use this construction to define an L_\infty-algebra controlling deformations of the operad P under Q from a cofibrant resolution for an operad Q, and an operad map Q\longrightarrow P. Starting from a diffent cofibrant resolution one obtains a quasi isomorohic L_\infty-algebra. This approach unifies Markl's cotangent cohomology of operads and the approaches to deformation of Q-algebras by Balavoine, and Kontsevich and Soibelman.
