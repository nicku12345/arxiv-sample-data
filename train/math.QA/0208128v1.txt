A q-analogue of Sudarshan's diagonal representation of the Quantum Mechanical density matrix is obtained using q-boson coherent states. Earlier result of Mehta and Sudarshan on the self reproducing property of rho(z',z) is also generalized and a self-consistent self-reproducing kernel {K-tilde}(z',z) is constructed.
