The m x n quantum grassmannian, G_q(m,n), is the subalgebra of the algebra of m x n quantum matrices that is generated by the maximal m x m quantum minors. Several properties of G_q(m,n) are established. In particular, a basis of G_q(m,n) is obtained, and it is shown that G_q(m,n) is a noetherian domain of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension m(n-m)+1. The algebra G_q(m,n) is identified as the subalgebra of coinvariants of a natural left coaction of the m x m quantum special linear group on the algebra of m x n quantum matrices and it is shown that G_q(m,n) is a maximal order.
