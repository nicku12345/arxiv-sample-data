Novikov algebras are algebras whose associators are left-symmetric and right multiplication operators are mutually commutative. A Gel'fand-Dorfman bialgebra is a vector space with a Lie algebra structure and a Novikov algebra structure, satisfying a certain compatibility condition. Such a bialgebraic structure corresponds to a certain Hamiltonian pairs in integrable systems. In this article, we present a construction of Gel'fand-Dorfman bialgebras from certain classical R-matrices on Lie algebras. In particular, we construct such R-matrices from certain abelian subalgebras of Lie algebras. As a result, we show that there exist nontrivial Novikov algebra structures on any finite-dimensional nonzero Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field with characteristic 0 or p>5 such that they form a Gel'fand-Dorfman bialgebra
