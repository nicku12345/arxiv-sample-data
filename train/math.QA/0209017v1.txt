We consider critical points of master functions associated with integral dominant weights of Kac-Moody algebras and introduce a generating procedure constructing new critical points starting from a given one. The set of all critical points constructed from a given one is called a population. We formulate a conjecture that a population is isomorphic to the flag variety of the Langlands dual Kac-Moody algebra and prove the conjecture for algebras sl_{N+1}, so_{2N+1}, and sp_{2N}.   We show that populations associated with a collection of integral dominant sl_{N+1}-weights are in one to one correspondence with intersection points of suitable Schubert cycles in a Grassmannian variety.
