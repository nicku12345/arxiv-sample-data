We construct via usual graph theory a class of associative dialgebras as well as a class of coassociative L-coalgebras. Tiling of the (n^2,1)-De bruijn graphs are also obtained and constructions of cubical trialgebras, (notion defined by J-L. Loday and M. Ronco) are given. We also obtain splitting of associative products into several ones.
