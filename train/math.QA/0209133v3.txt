Rosso and Green have shown how to embed the positive part U_q(n) of a quantum enveloping algebra U_q(g) in a quantum shuffle algebra. In this paper we study some properties of the image of the dual canonical basis B^* of U_q(n) under this embedding \Phi. This is motivated by the fact that when g is of type A_r, the elements of \Phi(B^*) are q-analogues of irreducible characters of the affine Iwahori-Hecke algebras attached to the groups GL(m) over a p-adic field.
