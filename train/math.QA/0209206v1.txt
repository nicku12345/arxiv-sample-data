This article is a contribution to the domain of (convergent) deformation quantization of symmetric spaces by use of Lie groups representation theory. We realize the regular representation of SL(2,\R) on the space of smooth functions on the Poincar\'e disc as a sub-representation of SL(2,\R) in the Weyl-Moyal star product algebra on \R^2. We indicate how it is possible to extend our construction to the general case of a Hermitian symmetric space of tube type.
