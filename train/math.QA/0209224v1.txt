Let A be an associative algebra with identity and with trace. We study the family of planar algebras on 1-boxes that arise from A in the work of Jones, but with the added assumption that the labels on the 1-boxes come from a discrete hypergroup in the sense of Sunder. This construction equips the algebra P_n^A with a canonical basis, \BB_n^A, which turns out to be a ``tabular'' basis. We examine special cases of this construction to exhibit a close connection between such bases and Kazhdan--Lusztig bases of Hecke algebras of types A, B, H or I.
