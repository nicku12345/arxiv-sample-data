The quantum Euclidean spheres, S_q^{N-1}, are (noncommutative) homogeneous spaces of quantum orthogonal groups, \SO_q(N). The *-algebra A(S^{N-1}_q) of polynomial functions on each of these is given by generators and relations which can be expressed in terms of a self-adjoint, unipotent matrix. We explicitly construct complete sets of generators for the K-theory (by nontrivial self-adjoint idempotents and unitaries) and the K-homology (by nontrivial Fredholm modules) of the spheres S_q^{N-1}. We also construct the corresponding Chern characters in cyclic homology and cohomology and compute the pairing of K-theory with K-homology. On odd spheres (i. e., for N even) we exhibit unbounded Fredholm modules by means of a natural unbounded operator D which, while failing to have compact resolvent, has bounded commutators with all elements in the algebra A(S^{N-1}_q).
