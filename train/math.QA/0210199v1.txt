We describe a locally trivial quantum principal U(1)-bundle over the quantum space S^2_{pq} which is a noncommutative analogue of the usual Hopf bundle. We also provide results concerning the structure of its total space algebra (irreducible *-representations and topological K-groups) and its Galois aspects (Galois property, existence of a strong connection, non-cleftness).
