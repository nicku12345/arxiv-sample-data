We propose an analytical approach to the Galois theory of singular regular linear q-difference systems. We use Tannaka duality along with Birkhoff's classification scheme with the connection matrix to define and describe their Galois groups. Then we describe \emph{fundamental subgroups} that give rise to a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence and to a density theorem of Schlesinger's type.
