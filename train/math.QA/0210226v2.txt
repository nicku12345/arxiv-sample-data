In a recent preprint, Brouder and Schmitt give a careful construction of a `renormalisation' Hopf algebra out of an arbitrary bialgebra. In this note, we point out that this is a special case of the construction of the cooperad of a bialgebra (Berger-Moerdijk) combined with the construction of a bialgebra from a cooperad (Frabetti-Van der Laan).
