For a given quasitriangular Hopf algebra \Ha we study relations between the braided group \tilde \Ha^* and Drinfeld's twist. We show that the braided bialgebra structure of \tilde \Ha^* is naturally described by means of twisted tensor powers of \Ha and their module algebras. We introduce universal solution to the reflection equation (RE) and deduce a fusion prescription for RE-matrices
