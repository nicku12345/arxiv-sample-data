We consider the structure of Jordan H-pseudoalgebras which are linearly finitely generated over a Hopf algebra H. There are two cases under consideration: H=U(\mathfrak h) and H=U(\mathfrak h)# \mathbb C[\Gamma ], where \mathfrak h is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over \mathbb C, \Gamma  is an arbitrary group acting on U(\mathfrak h) by automorphisms. We construct an analogue of the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction for finite Jordan pseudoalgebras and describe all simple ones.
