We introduce cell modules for the tabular algebras defined in a previous work (math.QA/0107230); these modules are analogous to the representations arising from left Kazhdan--Lusztig cells. The standard modules of the title are constructed in an elementary way by suitable tensoring of the cell modules. We show how a certain extended affine Hecke algebra of type A equipped with its Kazhdan--Lusztig basis is an example of a tabular algebra, and verify that in this case our standard modules coincide with other standard modules defined in the literature.
