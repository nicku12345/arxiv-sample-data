We show that the Newton polygon of a linear q-difference equation depends only on the corresponding q-difference module. We interpret the classical results of convergent factorisation of Adams-Birkhoff-Guenther in terms of the existence of a canonical filtration. Moreover, the associated graded module has excellent functorial (resp. tensorial) properties, whence its interest for classification (resp. for Galois theory).
