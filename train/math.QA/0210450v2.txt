We give a path model for a level zero extremal weight module over a quantum affine algebra. By using this result, we prove a branching rule for an extremal weight module with respect to a Levi subalgebra. Furthermore, we also show a decomposition rule of Littelmann type for the concatenation of path models for an integrable highest weight module and a level zero extremal weight module in the case where the extremal weight is minuscule.
