G.D. Birkhoff extended the classical Riemann-Hilbert problem for differential equations to the case of ``fuchsian'' linear q-difference systems with rational coefficients. He solved it in the generic case: the classifying object which he introduces is made up of the connection matrix P, together with the exponents at 0 and \infty. We follow his method in the general case, but treat symetrically 0 and \infty and use no ``wildly'' growing solutions. When q tends to 1, P tends to a locally constant matrix \tilde{P} such that the (finitely many) values \tilde{P}(a)^{-1}\tilde{P}(b) are the monodromy matrices of the limiting differential system (assumed to be non resonant at 0 and \infty) at the singularities on \mathbf{C}^{*}. This text is that of preprint 148 of the Laboratoire Emile Picard (february 1999). A shorter version was published by the Annales de l'Institut Fourier, 50, 4, (2000).
