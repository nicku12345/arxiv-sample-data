By considering spaces of directed Jacobi diagrams, we construct a diagrammatic version of the Etingof-Kazhdan quantization of complex semisimple Lie algebras. This diagrammatic quantization is used to provide a construction of a directed version of the Kontsevich integral, denoted Z_EK, in a way which is analogous to the construction of the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants from the R-matrices of the Drinfel'd-Jimbo quantum groups. Based on this analogy, we conjecture (and prove in a restricted sense) a formula for the value of the invariant Z_EK on the unknot. This formula is simpler than the Wheels formula of [BGRT], but the precise relationship between the two is yet unknown.
