We consider a class of homogeneous manifolds over a simple Lie group which appears in the problem of classification of homogeneous manifolds with reductive subgroups of maximal rank as stabilizer of a point. We prove that any manifold of this class possesses a Poisson bracket admitting a quantization invariant (equivariant) with respect to the corresponding quantum group.
