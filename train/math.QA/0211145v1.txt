For a matched pair of locally compact quantum groups, we construct the double crossed product as a locally compact quantum group. This construction generalizes Drinfeld's quantum double construction. We study C*-algebraic properties of these double crossed products and several links between double crossed products and bicrossed products. In an appendix, we study the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a weight under a quantum group action, following Yamanouchi and obtain, as a corollary, a new characterization of closed quantum subgroups.
