Let L be a lattice ordered effect algebra. We prove that the lattice uniformities on L which make uniformly continuous the operations \ominus and \oplus of L are uniquely determined by their system of neighbourhoods of 0 and form a distributive lattice. Moreover we prove that every such uniformity is generated by a family of weakly subadditive [0,+\infty]-valued functions on L.
