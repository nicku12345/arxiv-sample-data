We consider \hat{sl_2} spaces of coinvariants with respect to two kinds of ideals of the enveloping algebra U(sl_2\otimes\C[t]). The first one is generated by sl_2\otimes t^N, and the second one is generated by e\otimes P(t), f\otimes R(t) where P(t), R(t) are fixed generic polynomials. (We also treat a generalization of the latter.) Using a method developed in our previous paper, we give new fermionic formulas for their Hilbert polynomials in terms of the level-restricted Kostka polynomials and q-multinomial symbols. As a byproduct, we obtain a fermionic formula for the fusion product of sl_3-modules with rectangular highest weights, generalizing a known result for symmetric (or anti-symmetric) tensors.
