A new Hopf operad Ram is introduced, which contains both the well-known Poisson operad and the Bessel operad introduced previously by the author. Besides, a structure of cooperad R is introduced on a collection of algebras given by generators and relations which have some similarity with the Arnold relations for the cohomology of the type A hyperplane arrangement. A map from the operad Ram to the dual operad of R is defined which we conjecture to be a isomorphism.
