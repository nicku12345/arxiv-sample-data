L-Infinity structures have been a subject of recent interest in physics, where they occur in closed string theory and in gauge theory. This paper provides a class of easily constructible examples of L_n and L_{\infty} structures on graded vector spaces with three one-dimensional components. In particular, it demonstrates a way to classify ALL possible L_n and L_{\infty} structures on V = V_m \oplus V_{m+1} \oplus V_{m+2} when each of the three components is one-dimensional. Included are necessary and sufficient conditions under which a space with an L_3 structure is a differential graded Lie algebra. It is also shown that some of these d.g. Lie algebras possess a nontrivial L_n structure for higher n.
