We briefly review the construction of N=2 WZW models in terms of Manin triples. We analyse the restrictions which should be imposed on the gluing conditions of the affine currents in order to preserve half of the bulk supersymmetry. In analogy with the Kahler case there are two types of D-branes, A- and B-types which have a nice algebraic interpretation in terms of the Manin triple.
