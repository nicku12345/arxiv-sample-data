Let C be a symmetrizable generalized Cartan Matrix, and q an indeterminate. {\fg}(C) is the Kac-Moody Lie algebra and U=U_q({\fg}(C)) the associated quantum enveloping algebra over  k={\Bbb Q}(q). The quantum function algebra {\Bbb C}_{q}[G] is defined as a suitable U-bisubalgebra of the dual space \hom_{k}(U,k) which can be described using matrix elements of integrable U-modules. For \fg affine, the highest weight modules of C_q[G] are constructed and, assuming a minimality condition, their (unitarizable) irreducible quotients are shown to be in a 1-1 correspondence with the reduced elements of the Weyl group of {\frak g}(C). Further, these simple module are described in terms of the C_q[SL_2]-modules obtained by restriction, and they satisfy a Tensor Product theorem, similar to the finite type case.
