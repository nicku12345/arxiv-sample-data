Let \g be an affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra. Let \U^+ be the positive part of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum enveloping algebra associated to \g. We construct a basis of \U^+ which is related to the Kashiwara-Lusztig global crystal basis (or canonical basis) by an upper triangular matrix (with respect to an explicitly defined ordering) with 1's on the diagonal and with above diagonal entries in q_s^{-1} \Z[q_s^{-1}]. Using this construction we study the global crystal basis \B(\Um) of the modified quantum enveloping algebra defined by Lusztig. We obtain a Peter-Weyl like decomposition of the crystal \B(\Um) (Theorem 4.18), as well as an explicit description of two-sided cells of \B(\Um) and the limit algebra of \Um at q=0 (Theorem 6.45).
