We present a general framework for TQFT and related constructions using the language of monoidal categories. We construct a topological category C and an algebraic category D, both monoidal, and a TQFT functor is then defined as a certain type of monoidal functor from C to D. In contrast with the cobordism approach, this formulation of TQFT is closer in spirit to the classical functors of algebraic topology, like homology. The fundamental operation of gluing is incorporated at the level of the morphisms in the topological category through the notion of a gluing morphism, which we define. It allows not only the gluing together of two separate objects, but also the self-gluing of a single object to be treated in the same fashion. As an example of our framework we describe TQFT's for oriented 2D-manifolds, and classify a family of them in terms of a pair of tensors satisfying some relations.
