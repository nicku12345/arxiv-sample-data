We construct explicitly non-polynomial eigenfunctions of the difference operators by Macdonald in case t=q^k, k\in{\mathbb Z}. This leads to a new, more elementary proof of several Macdonald conjectures, first proved by Cherednik. We also establish the algebraic integrability of Macdonald operators at t=q^k (k\in {\mathbb Z}), generalizing the result of Etingof and Styrkas. Our approach works uniformly for all root systems including BC_n case and related Koornwinder polynomials. Moreover, we apply it for a certain deformation of A_n root system where the previously known methods do not work.
