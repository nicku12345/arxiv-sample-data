We propose a variant to the Etingof-Kazhdan construction of quantization functors. We construct the twistor J_\Phi associated to an associator \Phi using cohomological techniques. We then introduce a criterion ensuring that the ``left Hopf algebra'' of a quasitriangular QUE algebra is flat. We prove that this criterion is satisfied at the universal level. This provides a construction of quantization functors, equivalent to the Etingof-Kazhdan construction.
