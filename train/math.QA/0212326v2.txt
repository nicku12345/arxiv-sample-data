The main goal of this paper is to investigate the structure of Hopf algebras with the property that either its Jacobson radical is a Hopf ideal or its coradical is a subalgebra. In order to do that we define the Hochschild cohomology of an algebra in an abelian monoidal category. Then we characterize those algebras which have dimension less than or equal to 1 with respect to Hochschild cohomology. Now let us consider a Hopf algebra A such that its Jacobson radical J is a nilpotent Hopf ideal and H:=A/J is a semisimple algebra. By using our homological results, we prove that the canonical projection of A on H has a section which is an H-colinear algebra map. Furthermore, if H is cosemisimple too, then we can choose this section to be an (H,H)-bicolinear algebra morphism. This fact allows us to describe A as a `generalized bosonization' of a certain algebra R in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H. As an application we give a categorical proof of Radford's result about Hopf algebras with projections. We also consider the dual situation. In this case, many results that we obtain hold true for a large enough class of H-module coalgebras, where H is a cosemisimple Hopf algebra.
