We obtain the fermionic formulas for the characters of (k, r)-admissible configurations in the case of r=2 and r=3. This combinatorial object appears as a label of a basis of certain subspace W(\Lambda) of level-k integrable highest weight module of \hat{sl}_{r}. The dual space of W(\Lambda) is embedded into the space of symmetric polynomials. We introduce a filtration on this space and determine the components of the associated graded space explicitly by using vertex operators. This implies a fermionic formula for the character of W(\Lambda).
