For all k, we construct a bijection between the set of sequences of non-negative integers {\bf a}=(a_i)_{i\in{\bf Z}_{\geq0}} satisfying a_i+a_{i+1}+a_{i+2}\leq k and the set of rigged partitions (\lambda,\rho). Here \lambda=(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n) is a partition satisfying k\geq\lambda_1\geq...\geq\lambda_n\geq1 and \rho=(\rho_1,...,\rho_n)\in{\bf Z}_{\geq0}^n is such that \rho_j\geq\rho_{j+1} if \lambda_j=\lambda_{j+1}. One can think of \lambda as the particle content of the configuration {\bf a} and \rho_j as the energy level of the j-th particle, which has the weight \lambda_j. The total energy \sum_iia_i is written as the sum of the two-body interaction term \sum_{j<j'}A_{\lambda_j,\lambda_{j'}} and the free part \sum_j\rho_j. The bijection implies a fermionic formula for the one-dimensional configuration sums \sum_{\bf a}q^{\sum_iia_i}. We also derive the polynomial identities which describe the configuration sums corresponding to the configurations with prescribed values for a_0 and a_1, and such that a_i=0 for all i>N.
