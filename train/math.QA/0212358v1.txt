This paper explains the conjectured algebraic duality between genus zero Gromov-Witten theory and genus zero "Closed String topology". This duality in another perspective is discussed on page 87 of the book "Frobenius manifold, quantum cohomology, and moduli spaces" (by Yuri Manin). This paper also discusses Fulton MacPherson strata.
