We examine spaces of connected tri-/univalent graphs subject to local relations which are motivated by the theory of Vassiliev invariants. It is shown that the behaviour of ladder-like subgraphs is strongly related to the parity of the number of rungs: there are similar relations for ladders of even and odd lengths, respectively. Moreover, we prove that - under certain conditions - an even number of rungs may be transferred from one ladder to another.
