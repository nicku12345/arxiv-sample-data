A triangular quantum deformation of  osp(2/1)  from the classical r-matrix including an odd generator is presented with its full Hopf algebra structure. The deformation maps, twisting element and tensor operators are considered for the deformed  osp(2/1). It is also shown that its subalgebra generated by the Borel subalgebra is self-dual.
