In this paper we define a new class of the quantum integrable systems associated with the quantization of the cotangent bundle T^*(GL(N)) to the Lie algebra \frak{gl}_N. The construction is based on the Gelfand-Zetlin maximal commuting subalgebra in U(\frak{gl}_N). We discuss the connection with the other known integrable systems based on T^*GL(N). The construction of the spectral tower associated with the proposed integrable theory is given. This spectral tower appears as a generalization of the standard spectral curve for integrable system.
