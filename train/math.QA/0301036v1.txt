Using noncocommutative coproduct properties of the quantum algebras, we introduce and obtain, in a bipartite composite system, the Barut-Girardello coherent state for the q-deformed su_{q}(1,1) algebra. The quantum coproduct structure ensures this normalizable coherent state to be entangled. The entanglement disappears in the classical q \to 1 limit, giving rise to a factorizable state.
