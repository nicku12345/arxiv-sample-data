Fermionic-type character formulae are presented for charged irreduciblemodules of the graded parafermionic conformal field theory associated to the coset osp(1,2)_k/u(1). This is obtained by counting the weakly ordered `partitions' subject to the graded Z_k exclusion principle. The bosonic form of the characters is also presented.
