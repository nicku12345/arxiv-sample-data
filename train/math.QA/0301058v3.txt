Let H be a generic affine Hecke algebra (Iwahori-Matsumoto definition) over a polynomial algebra with a finite number of indeterminates over the ring of integers.   We prove the existence of an integral Bernstein-Lusztig basis related to the Iwahori-Matsumoto basis by a strictly upper triangular matrix, from which we deduce that the center Z of H is finitely generated and that H is a finite type Z-module (this was proved after inversion of the parameters by Bernstein-Lusztig), and we give some applications to the theory of H-modules where the parameters act by 0.   These results are related to the smooth p-adic or mod p representations of reductive p-adic groups. We introduce the supersingular modules of the affine Hecke algebra of GL(n) with parameter 0, probably analogues of the Barthel-Livne supersingular mod p representations of GL(2).
