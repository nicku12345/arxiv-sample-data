Two "quantum enveloping algebras", here denoted by U(R) and U^{\sim}(R), are associated in [FRTa] and [FRTb] to any Yang-Baxter operator R. The latter is only a bialgebra, in general; the former is a Hopf algebra.   In this paper, we study the pointed Hopf algebras U(R_Q), where R_Q is the Yang-Baxter operator associated with the multi-parameter deformation of GL_n supplied in [AST]; cf also [S,Re].   Some earlier results concerning these Hopf algebras U(R_Q) were obtained in [To,CLMT,CM]; a related (but different) Hopf algebra was studied in [DP].   The main new results obtained here concerning these quantum enveloping algebras are: 1)We list, in an extremely explicit form, those quantum enveloping algebras U(R_Q) which are finite-dimensional--let {\mathcal U} denote the collection of these. 2)We verify that the pointed Hopf algebras in {\mathcal U} are quasitriangular and of Cartan type A_n in the sense of Andruskiewich-Schneider.   3)We show that every U(R_Q) is a Hopf quotient of a double cross-product (hence, as asserted in 2), is quasitriangular if finite-dimensional.) 4) CAUTION: These Hopf algebras are NOT always cocycle twists of the standard 1-parameter deformation. This somewhat surprising fact is an immediate consequence of the data furnished here-- clearly a cocycle twist will not convert an infinite-dimensional Hopf algebra to a finite-dimensional one! Furthermore, these Hopf algebras in {\mathcal U} are (it is proved) not all cocycle twists of each other. 5)We discuss also the case when the quantum determinant is central in A(R_Q), so it makes sense to speak of a Q-deformation of the special linear group.
