The Fock space of m+p bosonic and n+q fermionic quantum oscillators forms a unitarizable module of the general linear superalgebra gl_{m+p|n+q}. Its tensor powers decompose into direct sums of infinite dimensional irreducible highest weight gl_{m+p|n+q}-modules. We obtain an explicit decomposition of any tensor power of this Fock space into irreducibles, and develop a character formula for the irreducible gl_{m+p|n+q}-modules arising in this way.
