Using the Ocneanu quantum geometry of ADE diagrams (and of other diagrams belonging to higher Coxeter-Dynkin systems), we discuss the classification of twisted partition functions for affine and minimal models in conformal field theory and study several examples associated with the WZW, Virasoro and W_{3} cases.
