The paper contains the computation of the noncommutative A-ideal of the figure-eight knot, a noncommutative generalization of the A-polynomial. We show that if a knot has the same noncommutative A-ideal as the figure-eight knot, then all colored Kauffman brackets are the same as those of the figure-eight knot.
