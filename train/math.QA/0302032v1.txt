We study q-integral representations of the q-gamma and the q-beta functions. This study leads to a very interesting q-constant. As an application of these integral representations, we obtain a simple conceptual proof of a family of identities for Jacobi triple product, including Jacobi's identity, and of Ramanujan's formula for the bilateral hypergeometric series.
