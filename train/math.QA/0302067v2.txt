We quantize the Alekseev-Meinrenken solution r to the classical dynamical Yang-Baxter equation, associated to a Lie algebra g with an element t in S^2(g)^g. Namely, we construct a dynamical twist J with nonabelian base in the sense of P. Xu, whose quasiclassical limit is r-t/2. This twist gives rise to a dynamical quantum R-matrix, and also provides a quantization of the quasi-Poisson manifold and Poisson groupoid associated to r. The twist J is obtained by an appropriate renormalization of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov associator for g, introduced by Drinfeld.
