Three examples of free field constructions for the vertex operators of the elliptic quantum group {\cal A}_{q,p}(\hat{sl}_2) are obtained. Two of these (for p^{1/2}=\pm q^{3/2},p^{1/2}=-q^2) are based on representation theories of the deformed Virasoro algebra, which correspond to the level 4 and level 2 Z-algebra of Lepowsky and Wilson. The third one (p^{1/2}=q^{3}) is constructed over a tensor product of a bosonic and a fermionic Fock spaces. The algebraic structure at p^{1/2}=q^{3}, however, is not related to the deformed Virasoro algebra. Using these free field constructions, an integral formula for the correlation functions of Baxter's eight-vertex model is obtained. This formula shows different structure compared with the one obtained by Lashkevich and Pugai.
