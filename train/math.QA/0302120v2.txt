We survey noncommutative spacetimes with coordinates being enveloping algebras of Lie algebras. We also explain how to do differential geometry on noncommutative spaces that are obtained from commutative ones via a Moyal-product type cocycle twist, such as the noncommutative torus, \theta-spaces and Clifford algebras. The latter are noncommutative deformations of the finite lattice (\Z_2)^n and we compute their noncommutative de Rham cohomology and moduli of solutions of Maxwell's equations. We exactly quantize noncommutative U(1)-Yang-Mills theory on \Z_2\times\Z_2 in a path integral approach.
