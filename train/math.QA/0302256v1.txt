We consider noncommutative line bundles associated with the Hopf fibrations of SUq(2) over all Podles spheres and with a locally trivial Hopf fibration of S^3_{pq}. These bundles are given as finitely generated projective modules associated via 1-dimensional representations of U(1) with Galois-type extensions encoding the principal fibrations of SUq(2) and S^3_{pq}. We show that the Chern numbers of these modules coincide with the winding numbers of representations defining them.
