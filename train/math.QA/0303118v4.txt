We show that untwisted respectively twisted conjugacy classes of a compact and simply connected Lie group which satisfy a certain integrality condition correspond naturally to irreducible highest weight representations of the corresponding affine Lie algebra. Along the way, review the classification of twisted conjugacy classes of a simply connected compact Lie group G and give a description of their stabilizers in terms of the Dynkin diagram of the corresponding twisted affine Lie algebra.
