Let V(\lambda) be the irreducible lowest weight U_q(D(N,1))-module with lowest weight \lambda. Assume \lambda = n_0\omega_0-\sum_{i=0}^{N}n_i\omega_i, where \omega_0 is the fundamental weight corresponding to the unique odd coroot h_0, and n_i are positive integers. V(\lambda) is called typical if n_0 \geq 0. In this paper, we construct polarizable crystal bases of V(\lambda) in the category {\cal O}_{int}, which is a class of integrable modules. We also describe the decomposition of the tensor product of typical representations into irreducible ones, using the generalized Littlewood-Richardson rule for U_q(D(N)).   We also present analogous results for the quantum superalgebra U_q(B(N,1)).
