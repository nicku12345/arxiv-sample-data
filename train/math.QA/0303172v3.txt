We prove a vanishing theorem of the cohomology arising from the two Quantized Drinfeld-Sokolov reductions (``+'' and ``-'' reduction) introduced by Feigin-Frenkel and Frenkel-Kac-Wakimoto. As a consequence, the vanishing conjecture of Frenkel-Kac-Wakimoto is proved for the ``-'' reduction and partially for the ``+'' reduction.
