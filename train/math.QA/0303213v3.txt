In this paper, we obtain a canonical central element \nu_H for each semi-simple quasi-Hopf algebra H over any field k and prove that \nu_H is invariant under gauge transformations. We show that if k is algebraically closed of characteristic zero then for any irreducible representation of H which affords the character \chi, \chi(\nu_H) takes only the values 0, 1 or -1, moreover if H is a Hopf algebra or a twisted quantum double of a finite group then \chi(\nu_H) is the corresponding Frobenius-Schur Indicator. We also prove an analog of a Theorem of Larson-Radford for split semi-simple quasi-Hopf algebra over any field k. Using this result, we establish the relationship between the antipode S, the values of \chi(\nu_H), and certain associated bilinear forms when the underlying field k is algebraically closed of characteristic zero.
