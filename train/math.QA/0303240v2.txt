A modular category is a braided category with some additional algebraic features. The interest of this concept is that it provides a Topological Quantum Field Theory in dimension 3. The Verlinde formulas associated with a modular category are the dimensions of the TQFT modules. We compute this formulas and discuss reductions and refinements for modular categories related with SU(N).Our main result is a splitting of the Verlinde formula, corresponding to a brick decomposition of the TQFT modules whose summands are indexed by spin structures modulo an even integer.We introduce the notion of a spin modular category, and give the proof of the decomposition theorem in this general context.
