Using twisted Fock spaces, we formulate and study two twisted versions of the n-point correlation functions of Bloch-Okounkov, and then identify them with q-expectation values of certain functions on the set of (odd) strict partitions. We find closed formulas for the 1-point functions in both cases in terms of Jacobi theta functions. These correlation functions afford several distinct interpretations.
