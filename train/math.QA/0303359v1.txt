In this paper we contribute to the classification of Hopf algebras of dimension pq, where p,q are distinct prime numbers. More precisely, we prove that if p and q are odd primes with p<q<2p+3, then any complex Hopf algebra of dimension pq is semisimple and hence isomorphic to either a group algebra or to the dual of a group algebra by the previous works math.QA/9801129 and math.QA/9801128.
