For a nondegenerate additive subgroup G of the n-dimensional vector space F^n over an algebraically closed field F of characteristic zero, there is an associative algebra and a Lie algebra of Weyl type W(G,n) spanned by all differential operators u D_1^{m_1}... D_n^{m_n} for u\in F[G] (the group algebra), and m_1,...,m_n \ge 0, where D_1, ...,D_n are degree operators. In this paper, it is proved that an irreducible quasifinite W(\Z,1)-module is either a highest or lowest weight module or else a module of the intermediate series; furthermore, a classification of uniformly bounded W(\Z,1)-modules is completely given. It is also proved that an irreducible quasifinite W(G,n)-module is a module of the intermediate series and a complete classification of quasifinite W(G,n)-modules is also given, if G is not isomorphic to \Z.
