In a paper by Xu, some simple Lie algebras of generalized Cartan type were constructed, using the mixtures of grading operators and down-grading operators. Among them, are the simple Lie algebras of generalized Witt type, which are in general nongraded and have no torus. In this paper, some representations of these simple Lie algebras of generalized Witt type are presented.
