For an (\epsilon,G)-color-commutative associative algebra A with an identity element over a field F of characteristic not 2, and for a color-commutative subalgebra D of color-derivations of A, denote by A[D] the associative subalgebra of {\rm End}(A) generated by A (regarding as operators on A via left multiplication) and D. It is easily proved that, as an associative algebra, A[D] is G-graded simple if and only if A is \G-graded D-simple. Suppose A is \G-graded D-simple. Then,   (a) A[D] is a free left A-module;   (b) as a Lie color algebra, the subquotient [A[D],A[D]]/Z(A[D])\cap[A[D],A[D]] is simple (except one minor case), where Z(A[D]) is the color center of A[D].   The structure of this subquotient is explicitly described.
