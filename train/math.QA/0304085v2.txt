Our main aim in this paper is to give a foundation of the theory of p-adic multiple zeta values. We introduce (one variable) p-adic multiple polylogarithms by Coleman's p-adic iterated integration theory. We define p-adic multiple zeta values to be special values of p-adic multiple polylogarithms. We consider the (formal) p-adic KZ equation and introduce the p-adic Drinfel'd associator by using certain two fundamental solutions of the p-adic KZ equation. We show that our p-adic multiple polylogarithms appear as coefficients of a certain fundamental solution of the p-adic KZ equation and our p-adic multiple zeta values appear as coefficients of the p-adic Drinfel'd associator. We show various properties of p-adic multiple zeta values, which are sometimes analogous to the complex case and are sometimes peculiar to the p-adic case, via the p-adic KZ equation.
