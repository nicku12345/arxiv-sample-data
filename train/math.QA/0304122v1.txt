It is shown that for a certain class of Yang-Baxter maps (or set-theoretical solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation) the Lax representation can be derived straight from the map itself. A similar phenomenon for 3D consistent equations on quad-graphs has been recently discovered by A. Bobenko and one of the authors, and by F. Nijhoff.
