The goal of this paper is to define a new class of objects which we call triple groups and to relate them with Cherednik's double affine Hecke algebras. This has as immediate consequences new descriptions of double affine Weyl and Artin groups, the double affine Hecke algebras as well as the corresponding elliptic objects. From the new descriptions we recover results of Cherednik on automorphisms of double affine Hecke algebras.
