In this paper we will study deformations of A-infinity algebras. We will also answer questions relating to Moore algebras which are one of the simplest nontrivial examples of an A-infinity algebra. We will compute the Hochschild cohomology of odd Moore algebras and classify them up to a unital weak equivalence. We will construct miniversal deformations of particular Moore algebras and relate them to the universal odd and even Moore algebras. Finally we will conclude with an investigation of formal one-parameter deformations of an A-infinity algebra.
