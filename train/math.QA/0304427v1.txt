A one parameter set of noncommutative complex algebras is given. These may be considered deformation quantisation algebras. The commutative limit of these algebras correspond to the algebra of polynomial functions over a manifold or variety. The topology of the manifold or variety depends on the parameter, varying from nothing, to a point, a sphere, a certain variety and finally a torus. The irreducible adjoint preserving representations of the noncommutative algebras are studied. As well as typical noncommutative sphere type representations and noncommutative torus type representations, a new object is discovered and called a Sphere-Torus.
