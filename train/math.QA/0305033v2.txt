A mass-like quantum Weyl-Poincare algebra is proposed to describe, after the identification of the deformation parameter with the Planck length, a new relativistic theory with two observer-independent scales (or DSR theory). Deformed momentum representation, finite boost transformations, range of rapidity, energy and momentum, as well as position and velocity operators are explicitly studied and compared with those of previous DSR theories based on kappa-Poincare algebra. The main novelties of the DSR theory here presented are the new features of momentum saturation and a new type of deformed position operators.
