A Dirac operator D on the standard Podles sphere is defined and investigated. It yields a spectral triple such that |D|^{-z} is of trace class for Re z>0. Commutators with the Dirac operator give the distinguished 2-dimensional covariant differential calculus on the standard Podles sphere. The twisted cyclic cocycle associated with the volume form of the differential calculus is expressed by means of the Dirac operator.
