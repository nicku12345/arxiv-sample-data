We develop the deformation theory of A_\infty algebras together with \infty inner products and identify a differential graded Lie algebra that controls the theory. This generalizes the deformation theories of associative algebras, A_\infty algebras, associative algebras with inner products, and A_\infty algebras with inner products.
