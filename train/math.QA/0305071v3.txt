A Dirac operator D on quantized irreducible generalized flag manifolds is defined. This yields a Hilbert space realization of the covariant first-order differential calculi constructed by I. Heckenberger and S. Kolb. All differentials df=i[D,f] are bounded operators. In the simplest case of Podles' quantum sphere one obtains the spectral triple found by L. Dabrowski and A. Sitarz.
