Braid matrices \hat{R}(\theta), corresponding to vector representations, are spectrally decomposed obtaining a ratio f_{i}(\theta)/f_{i}(-\theta) for the coefficient of each projector P_{i} appearing in the decomposition. This directly yields a factorization (F(-\theta))^{-1}F(\theta) for the braid matrix, implying also the relation \hat{R}(-\theta)\hat{R}(\theta)=I.This is achieved for GL_{q}(n),SO_{q}(2n+1),SO_{q}(2n),Sp_{q}(2n) for all n and also for various other interesting cases including the 8-vertex matrix.We explain how the limits \theta \to \pm \infty can be interpreted to provide factorizations of the standard (non-Baxterized) braid matrices. A systematic approach to diagonalization of projectors and hence of braid matrices is presented with explicit constructions for GL_{q}(2),GL_{q}(3),SO_{q}(3),SO_{q}(4),Sp_{q}(4) and various other cases such as the 8-vertex one. For a specific nested sequence of projectors diagonalization is obtained for all dimensions. In each factor F(\theta) our diagonalization again factors out all dependence on the spectral parameter \theta as a diagonal matrix. The canonical property implemented in the diagonalizers is mutual orthogonality of the rows. Applications of our formalism to the construction of L-operators and transfer matrices are indicated. In an Appendix our type of factorization is compared to another one proposed by other authors.
