Hecke symmetries generalize the usual tensor symmetry of vector spaces v\otimes w\arrow w\otimes v as well as the symmetry of vector superspaces. To a Hecke symmetry R there associates a quadratic algebra which can be interpreted as the function algebra upon a certain quantum space. This paper investigates the Poincare series of this quadratic algebra. We showthat it is a rational function with numerator and denominator being a reciprocal polynomial and a skew-reciprocal polynomial, respectively.
