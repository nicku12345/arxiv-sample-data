We establish a q-generalization of Gordon's theorem that the space of diagonal coinvariants has a quotient identified with a perfect representation of the rational double affine Hecke algebra. It leads to a simple proof of his theorem and relates it to the Weyl algebras at roots of unity. The universal double affine Hecke algebra and the corresponding universal double Dunkl operators acting in noncommutative polynomials in terms of two sets of variables are introduced.
