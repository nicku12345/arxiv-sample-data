The q-characters were introduced by Frenkel and mReshetikhin to study finite dimensional representations of the untwisted quantum affine algebra for q generic. The \epsilon-characters at roots of unity were constructed by Frenkel and Mukhin to study finite dimensional representations of various specializations of the quantum affine algebra at q^s=1. In the finite simply laced case Nakajima defined deformations of q-characters called q,t-characters, for q generic and also at roots of unity. The definition is combinatorial but the proof of the existence uses the geometric theory of quiver varieties which holds only in the simply laced case. In math.QA/0212257 we proposed an algebraic general (non necessarily simply laced) new approach to q,t-characters for q generic. In this paper we treat the root of unity case. Moreover we construct q-characters and q,t-characters for a large class of generalized Cartan matrices (including finite and affine cases except A_1^{(1)}, A_2^{(2)}) by extending our algebraic approach. In particular we generalize the construction of Nakajima's Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials at roots of unity to those cases. We also study properties of various objects used in this article : deformed screening operators at roots of unity, t-deformed polynomial algebras, bicharacters arising from symmetrizable Cartan matrices, deformation of the Frenkel-Mukhin's algorithm.
