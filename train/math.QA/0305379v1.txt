Recently, Kajihara gave a Bailey-type transformation relating basic hypergeometric series on the root system An, with different dimensions n. We give, with a new, elementary, proof, an elliptic analogue of this transformation. We also obtain further Bailey-type transformations as consequences of our result, some of which are new also in the case of basic and classical hypergeometric series.
