In this paper, we develop the crystal basis theory for quantum generalized Kac-Moody algebras. For a quantum generalized Kac-Moody algebra U_q(\mathfrak g), we first introduce the category \mathcal O_{int} of U_q(\mathfrak g)-modules and prove its semisimplicity. Next, we define the notion of crystal bases for U_q(\mathfrak g)-modules in the category \mathcal O_{int} and for the subalgebra U_q^-(\mathfrak g). We then prove the tensor product rule and the existence theorem for crystal bases. Finally, we construct the global bases for U_q(\mathfrak g)-modules in the category \mathcal O_{int} and for the subalgebra U_q^-(\mathfrak g).
