We develop a categorical approach to the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (DYBE) for arbitrary Hopf algebras. In particular, we introduce the notion of a dynamical extension of a monoidal category, which provides a natural environment for quantum dynamical R-matrices, dynamical twists, {\em etc}. In this context, we define dynamical associative algebras and show that such algebras give quantizations of vector bundles on coadjoint orbits. We build a dynamical twist for any pair of a reductive Lie algebra and their Levi subalgebra. Using this twist, we obtain an equivariant star product quantization of vector bundles on semisimple coadjoint orbits of reductive Lie groups.
