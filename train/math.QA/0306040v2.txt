We give a short summary of results and conjectures in the theory of dynamical quantum group related to the dynamical coboundary equation also known as IRF-Vertex transform. O.Babelon has shown that the dynamical twist F(x) of U_q(sl(2)) is a dynamical coboundary M(x) i.e F(x)M_1(xq^{h_2})M_2(x)=\Delta(M(x)). We give a new formula for this element M(x) as an infinite product and give a new proof of the coboundary relation. Our proof involves the quantum Weyl group element, giving possible hint for the generalization to higher rank case.
