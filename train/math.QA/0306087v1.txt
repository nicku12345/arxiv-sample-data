This note is to show the effectiveness of the notion of pseudoalgebra in the theory of conformal algebras. We adduce very simple construction of free associative conformal algebra and find its linear basis. There is no any new result but we hope that the technique could be useful for further development of the theory of conformal algebras and pseudoalgebras.
