A garland based on a manifold P is a finite set of manifolds homeomorphic to P with some of them glued together at marked points. Fix a manifold M and consider a space \NN of all smooth mappings of garlands based on P into M. We construct operations \bullet and [-,-] on the bordism groups \bor_*(\NN) that give \bor_*(\NN) the natural graded commutative assosiative and graded Lie algebra structures. We also construct two auto-homomorphisms \pr and \li of \bor_*(\NN) such that \pr(\li \alpha_1\bullet \li \alpha_2)= [\alpha_1, \alpha_2] for all \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \in \bor_*(\NN). If P is a boundary, then \pr \circ \li=0 and thus \Delta^2=0 for \Delta=\li \circ \pr. We show that under certain conditions the operations \Delta and \bullet give rise to Batalin-Vilkoviski and Gerstenhaber algebra structures on \bor_*(\NN). In a particular case when P=S^1, the algebra \bor_*(\NN) is related to the string-homology algebra constructed by Chas and Sullivan.
