A multiple generalization of elliptic hypergeometric series is investigated and a duality transformation for multiple hypergeometric series is proposed. Our duality transformation obtained from an identity arising from the Cauchy determinant formula for Weierstrass sigma functions, by spcialization of a particular form.
