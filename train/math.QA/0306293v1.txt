In this paper, we re-examine certain integrable modules of Chari-Presslely for an (untwisted) affine Lie algebra \hat{\g} by exploiting basic formal variable techniques. We define and study two categories {\mathcal{E}} and {\mathcal{C}} of \hat{\g}-modules using generating functions, where {\mathcal{E}} includes evaluation modules and {\mathcal{C}} unifies highest weight modules, evaluation modules and their tensor product modules, and we classify integrable irreducible \hat{\g}-modules in categories {\mathcal{E}} and {\mathcal{C}}.
