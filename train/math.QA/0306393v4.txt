We study the algebraic properties of the five-parameter family H(t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4;q) of double affine Hecke algebras of type C^\vee C_1. This family generalizes Cherednik's double affine Hecke algebras of rank 1. It was introduced by Sahi and studied by Noumi and Stokman as an algebraic structure which controls Askey-Wilson polynomials. We show that if q=1, then the spectrum of the center of H is an affine cubic surface C, obtained from a projective one by removing a triangle consisting of smooth points. Moreover, any such surface is obtained as the spectrum of the center of H for some values of parameters. This result allows one to give a simple geometric description of the action of an extension of PGL_2(\Bbb Z) by \Bbb Z on the center of H. When C is smooth, it admits a unique algebraic symplectic structure, and the spherical subalgebra eHe of the algebra H for q=e^\hbar provides its deformation quantization. Using that H^2(C,\Bbb C)=\Bbb C^5, we find that the Hochschild cohomology HH^2(H) (for q=e^\hbar) is 5-dimensional for generic parameter values. From this we deduce that the only deformations of H come from variations of parameters. This explains from the point of view of noncommutative geometry why one cannot add more parameters into the theory of Askey-Wilson polynomials. We also prove that the five-parameter family H(t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4;q) of algebras yields the universal deformation of q-Weyl algebra crossed with {\Bbb Z}_2 and the family of cubic surfaces C=C_{\underline{t}}, \underline{t}\in \CC^4_{\underline{t}} gives the universal deformation of the Poisson algebra \CC[X^{\pm 1},P^{\pm 1}]^{{\Bbb ZZ}_2}.
