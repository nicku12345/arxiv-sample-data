L-infinity morphisms are studied from the point of view of perturbative quantum field theory, as generalizations of Feynman expansions. The connection with the Hopf algebra approach to renormalization is exploited. Using the coalgebra structure (Forest Formula), the weights of the corresponding expansions are proved to be cycles of the DG-coalgebra of Feynman graphs.   The properties of integrals over configuration spaces (Feynman integrals) are investigated. The aim is to develop a cohomological approach in order to construct the coefficients of formality morphisms using an algebraic machinery, as an alternative to the analytical approach using integrals over configuration spaces.   The connection with a related TQFT is mentioned, supplementing the Feynman path integral interpretation of Kontsevich formula.
