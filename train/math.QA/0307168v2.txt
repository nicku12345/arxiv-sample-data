We realize the physical N-anyon Hilbert spaces, introduced previously via unitary representations of the group of diffeomorphisms of the plane, as N-fold braided-symmetric tensor products of the 1-particle Hilbert space. This perspective provides a convenient Fock space construction for nonrelativistic anyon quantum fields along the more usual lines of boson and fermion fields, but in a braided category. We see how essential physical information is thus encoded. In particular we show how the algebraic structure of our anyonic Fock space leads to a natural anyonic exclusion principle related to intermediate occupation number statistics, and obtain the partition function for an idealised gas of fixed anyonic vortices.
