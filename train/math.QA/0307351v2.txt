We study the quantum sphere C_q[S^2] as a quantum Riemannian manifold in the quantum frame bundle approach. We exhibit its 2-dimensional cotangent bundle as a direct sum \Omega^{0,1}\oplus\Omega^{1,0} in a double complex. We find the natural metric, volume form, Hodge * operator, Laplace and Maxwell operators. We show that the q-monopole as spin connection induces a natural Levi-Civita type connection and find its Ricci curvature and q-Dirac operator D. We find the possibility of an antisymmetric volume form quantum correction to the Ricci curvature and Lichnerowicz-type formulae for D^2. We also remark on the geometric q-Borel-Weil-Bott construction.
