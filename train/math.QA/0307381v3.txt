To each natural deformation quantization on a Poisson manifold M we associate a Poisson morphism from the formal neighborhood of the zero section of the cotangent bundle to M to the formal neighborhood of the diagonal of the product M x M~, where M~ is a copy of M with the opposite Poisson structure. We call it dequantization of the natural deformation quantization. Then we "dequantize" Fedosov's quantization.
