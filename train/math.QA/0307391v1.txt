We investigate the weak Hopf algebras of Li based on U_q[sl_n] and Sweedler's finite dimensional example. We give weak Hopf algebra isomorphisms between the weak generalisations of U_q[sl_n] which are ``upgraded'' automorphisms of U_q[sl_n] and hence give a classification of these structures as weak Hopf algebras. We also show how to decompose these examples into a direct sum which leads to unexpected isomorphisms between their algebraic structure.
