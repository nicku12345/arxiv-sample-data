A class of Poisson algebras considered as a Poisson version of the multiparameter quantized coordinate rings of symplectic and Euclidean 2n-spaces is constructed and the prime Poisson ideals and the symplectic ideals of these Poisson algebras are described. As a result, it is shown that the multiparameter quantized symplectic and Euclidean 2n-spaces are topological quotients of their classical spaces.
