Assume that S is a semigroup generated by \{x_1,...,x_n\}, and let \Uscr be the multiplicative free commutative semigroup generated by \{u_1,...,u_n\}. We say that S is of \emph{I-typ}e if there is a bijection v:\Uscr\r S such that for all a\in\Uscr, \{v(u_1a),... v(u_na)\}=\{x_1v(a),...,x_nv(a)\}. This condition appeared naturally in the work on Sklyanin algebras by John Tate and the second author. In this paper we show that the condition for a semigroup to be of I-type is related to various other mathematical notions found in the literature. In particular we show that semigroups of I-type appear in the study of the settheoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, in the theory of Bieberbach groups and in the study of certain skew binomial polynomial rings which were introduced by the first author.
