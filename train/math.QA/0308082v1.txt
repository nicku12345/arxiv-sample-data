We investigate the g_2-invariant bulk (1+1D, factorized) S-matrix constructed by Ogievetsky, using the bootstrap on the three-point coupling of the vector multiplet to constrain its CDD ambiguity. We then construct the corresponding boundary S-matrix, demonstrating it to be consistent with Y(g_2,a_1\times a_1) symmetry.
