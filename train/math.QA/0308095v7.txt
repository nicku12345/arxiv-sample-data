Braided m-Lie algebras induced by multiplication are introduced, which generalize Lie algebras, Lie color algebras and quantum Lie algebras. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the braided m-Lie algebras to be strict Jacobi braided Lie algebras are given. Two classes of braided m-Lie algebras are given, which are generalized matrix braided m-Lie algebras and braided m-Lie subalgebras of End_F M, where M is a Yetter-Drinfeld module over B with dim B< \infty  . In particular, generalized classical braided m-Lie algebras sl_{q, f}(GM_G(A), F) and osp_{q, t} (GM_G(A), M, F) of generalized matrix algebra GM_G(A) are constructed and their connection with special generalized matrix Lie superalgebra sl_{s, f}(GM_{{\bf Z}_2}(A^s), F) and orthosymplectic generalized matrix Lie super algebra osp_{s, t} (GM_{{\bf Z}_2}(A^s), M^s, F) are established. The relationship between representations of braided m-Lie algebras and their associated algebras are established.
