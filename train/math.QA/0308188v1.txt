We apply methods from strict quantization of solvable symmetric spaces to obtain universal deformation formulae for actions of every three-dimensional solvable Lie group. We also study compatible co-products by generalizing the notion of smash product in the context of Hopf algebras. We investigate in particular the dressing action of the `book' group on SU(2).
