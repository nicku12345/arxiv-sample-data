In this paper, we study and classify Hilbert space representations of cross product *-algebras of the quantized enveloping algebra U_q(e_2) with the coordinate algebras O(E_q(2)) of the quantum motion group and O(\C_q) of the complex plane, and of the quantized enveloping algebra U_q(su_{1,1}) with the coordinate algebras O(SU_q(1,1)) of the quantum group SU_q(1,1) and O(U_q) of the quantum disc. Invariant positive functionals and the corresponding Heisenberg representations are explicitely described.
