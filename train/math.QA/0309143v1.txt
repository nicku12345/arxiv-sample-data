We study sigma-models on noncommutative spaces, notably on noncommutative tori. We construct instanton solutions carrying a nontrivial topological charge q and satisfying a Belavin-Polyakov bound. The moduli space of these instantons is conjectured to consists of an ordinary torus endowed with a complex structure times a projective space CP^{q-1}.
