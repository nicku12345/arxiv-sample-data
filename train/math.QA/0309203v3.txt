This paper is a continuation of [KS]. We develop the results of [KS] principally in two directions. First, we generalize the main result of [KS], the connection between the solutions of the classical dynamical Yang-Baxter equation and Poisson homogeneous spaces of Poisson Lie groups. We hope that now we present this result in its natural generality. Secondly, we propose a partial quantization of the results of [KS].   [KS] E. Karolinsky and A.
