We observe that the von Neumann envelope of the quantum algebra of functions on the normalizer of thegroup \SU(1,1)\cong \SL(2,\mathbb R) in \SL(2,\mathbb C) via deformation quantization contains the von Neumann algebraic quantum normalizer of \SU(1,1) in the frame work of Waronowicz-Korogodsky. We then use the technique of reduction to the maximal subgroup to compute the K-theory, the periodic cyclic homology and the corresponding Chern-Connes character.
