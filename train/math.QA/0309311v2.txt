A problem of defining the quantum analogues for semi-classical twists in U(\mathfrak{g})[[t]] is considered. First, we study specialization at q=1 of singular coboundary twists defined in U_{q}(\mathfrak{g})[[t]] for \mathfrak{g} being a nonexceptional Lie algebra, then we consider specialization of noncoboundary twists when \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{3} and obtain q-deformation of the semi-classical twist introduced by Connes and Moscovici in noncommutative geometry.
