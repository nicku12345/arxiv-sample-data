The relation between crossed product and H-Galois extension in braided tensor category {\cal C} with equivalisers and coequivalisers is established. That is, it is shown that if there exist an equivaliser and a coequivaliser for any two morphisms in {\cal C}, then A = B #_\sigma H is a crossed product algebra if and only if the extension A/B is Galois, the canonical epic q: A\otimes A \to A\otimes_B A is split and A is isomorphic as left B-modules and right H-comodules to B\otimes H in {\cal C}.
