Let K denote a field and let V denote a vector space over K with finite positive dimension. By definition a Leonard pair on V is a pair of linear transformations A:V\to V and A^*:V\to V that satisfy the following two conditions:   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A^* is diagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is diagonal and the matrix representing A^* is irreducible tridiagonal.   There is a correspondence between Leonard pairs and a family of orthogonal polynomials consisting of the q-Racah and some related polynomials of the Askey scheme. In this paper we discuss a mild generalization of a Leonard pair which we call a tridiagonal pair. We will show how certain tridiagonal pairs are associated with finite dimensional modules for the quantum affine algebra U_q({\hat {sl}}_2).
