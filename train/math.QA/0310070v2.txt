Koszul property was generalized to homogeneous algebras of degree N>2 in [5], and related to N-complexes in [7]. We show that if the N-homogeneous algebra A is generalized Koszul, AS-Gorenstein and of finite global dimension, then one can apply the Van den Bergh duality theorem [23] to A, i.e., there is a Poincare duality between Hochschild homology and cohomology of A, as for N=2.
