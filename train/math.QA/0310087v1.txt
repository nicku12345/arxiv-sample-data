In this note, we give a description of the modular functor associated to the Chern-Simons theory with a finite group from the complex-analytic point of view, i.e. as a vector bundle with a flat connection on the moduli space of punctured curves. We show that it can be obtained from the trivial local system on the moduli space of "admissible G-covers" as a direct image under the forgetful map from moduli space of G-covers to the usual moduli space.
