Various aspects of the de Rham cohomology of Hopf algebras are discussed. In particular, it is shown that the de Rham cohomology of an algebra with the differentiable coaction of a cosemisimple Hopf algebra with trivial 0-th cohomology group, reduces to the de Rham cohomology of (co)invariant forms. Spectral sequences are discussed and the van Est spectral sequence for Hopf algebras is introduced. A definition of   Hopf-Lie algebra cohomology is also given.
