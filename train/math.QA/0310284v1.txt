Let V(\Lambda_i) (resp., V(-\Lambda_j)) be a fundamental integrable highest (resp., lowest) weight module of U_q(\hat{sl}_{2}). The tensor product V(\Lambda_i)\otimes V(-\Lambda_j) is filtered by submodules F_n=U_q(\hat{sl}_{2})(v_i\otimes \bar{v}_{n-i}), n\ge 0, n\equiv i-j\bmod 2, where v_i\in V(\Lambda_i) is the highest vector and \bar{v}_{n-i}\in V(-\Lambda_j) is an extremal vector. We show that F_n/F_{n+2} is isomorphic to the level 0 extremal weight module V(n(\Lambda_1-\Lambda_0)). Using this we give a functional realization of the completion of V(\Lambda_i)\otimes V(-\Lambda_j) by the filtration (F_n)_{n\geq0}. The subspace of V(\Lambda_i)\otimes V(-\Lambda_j) of sl_2-weight m is mapped to a certain space of sequences (P_{n,l})_{n\ge 0, n\equiv i-j\bmod 2,n-2l=m}, whose members P_{n,l}=P_{n,l}(X_1,...,X_l|z_1,...,z_n) are symmetric polynomials in X_a and symmetric Laurent polynomials in z_k, with additional constraints. When the parameter q is specialized to \sqrt{-1}, this construction settles a conjecture which arose in the study of form factors in integrable field theory.
