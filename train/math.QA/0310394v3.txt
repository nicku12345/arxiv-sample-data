We analyse the possibility of defining complex valued Knot invariants associated with infinite dimensional unitary representations of SL(2,R) and the Lorentz Group taking as starting point the Kontsevich Integral and the notion of infinitesimal character. This yields a family of knot invariants whose target space is the set of formal power series in C, which contained in the Melvin-Morton expansion of the coloured Jones polynomial. We verify that for some knots the series have zero radius of convergence and analyse the construction of functions of which this series are asymptotic expansions by means of Borel re-summation. Explicit calculations are done in the case of torus knots which realise an analytic extension of the values of the coloured Jones polynomial to complex spins. We present a partial answer in the general case.
