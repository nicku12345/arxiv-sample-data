Using combinatorics of Young walls, we give a new realization of arbitrary level irreducible highest weight crystals \mathcal{B}(\lambda) for quantum affine algebras of type A_n^{(1)}, B_n^{(1)}, C_n^{(1)}, A_{2n-1}^{(2)}, A_{2n}^{(2)}, and D_{n+1}^{(2)}. The irreducible highest weight crystals are realized as the affine crystals consisting of reduced proper Young walls. The notion of slices and splitting of blocks plays a crucial role in the constructions of crystal graphs.
