We compute the Hochschild homology of the crossed product \Bbb C[S_n]\ltimes A^{\otimes n} in terms of the Hochschild homology of the associative algebra A (over \Bbb C). It allows us to compute the Hochschild (co)homology of \Bbb C[W]\ltimes A^{\otimes n} where A is the q-Weyl algebra or any its degeneration and W is the Weyl group of type A_{n-1} or B_n. For a deformation quantization A_+ of an affine symplectic variety X we show that the Hochschild homology of S^n A, A=A_+[\hbar^{-1}] is additively isomorphic to the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology of S^nX with coefficients in \Bbb C((\hbar)). We prove that for X satisfying H^1(X,\Bbb C)=0 (or A\in VB(d)) the deformation of S^nX (\Bbb C[S_n]\ltimes A^{\otimes n}) which does not come from deformations of X (A) exists if and only if \dim X=2 (d=2). In particular if A is q-Weyl algebra (its trigonometric or rational degeneration) then the corresponding nontrivial deformations yield the double affine Hecke algebras of type A_{n-1} (its trigonometric or rational versions) introduced by Cherednik.
