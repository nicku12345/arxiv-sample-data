Extending a recently proposed procedure of construction of various elements of diffential geometry on noncommutative algebras, we obtain these structures on noncommutative superalgebras. As an example, a quantum superspace covariant under the action of super-Jordanian OSp_h(2/1) is studied. It is shown that there exist a two paramater family of torsionless connections, and the curvature computed from this family of connections is bilinear. It is also shown that the connections are not compatible with the metric.
