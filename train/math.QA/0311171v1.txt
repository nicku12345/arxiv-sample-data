It is shown that a Yang-Baxter system can be constructed from any entwining structure. It is also shown that, conversely, Yang-Baxter systems of certain type lead to entwining structures. Examples of Yang-Baxter systems associated to entwining structures are given, and a Yang-Baxter operator of Hecke type is defined for any bijective entwining map.
