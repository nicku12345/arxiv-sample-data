We construct some classes of dynamical r-matrices over a nonabelian base, and quantize some of them by constructing dynamical (pseudo)twists in the sense of Xu. This way, we obtain quantizations of r-matrices obtained in earlier work of the second author with Schiffmann and Varchenko. A part of our construction may be viewed as a generalization of the Donin-Mudrov nonabelian fusion construction. We apply these results to the construction of equivariant star-products on Poisson homogeneous spaces, which include some homogeneous spaces introduced by De Concini.
