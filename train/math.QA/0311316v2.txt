In this paper we realize the dynamical categories introduced in our previous paper as categories of modules over bialgebroids; we study the bialgebroids arising in this way. We define quasitriangular structure on bialgebroids and present examples of quasitriangular bialgebroids related to the dynamical categories. We show that dynamical twists over an arbitrary base give rise to bialgebroid twists.   We prove that the classical dynamical r-matrices over an arbitrary base manifold are in one-to-one correspondence with a special class of coboundary Lie bialgebroids.
