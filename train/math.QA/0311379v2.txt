We show that all possible categories of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over a quasi-Hopf algebra H are isomorphic. We prove also that the category \yd^{\rm fd} of finite dimensional left Yetter-Drinfeld modules is rigid and then we compute explicitly the canonical isomorphisms in \yd^{\rm fd}. Finally, we show that certain duals of H_0, the braided Hopf algebra introduced in \cite{bn,bpv}, are isomorphic as braided Hopf algebras if H is a finite dimensional triangular quasi-Hopf algebra.
