We generalize various properties of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over Hopf algebras to quasi-Hopf algebras. The dual of a finite dimensional Yetter-Drinfeld module is again a Yetter-Drinfeld module. The algebra H_0 in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules that can be obtained by modifying the multiplication in a proper way is quantum commutative. We give a Structure Theorem for Hopf modules in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules, and deduce the existence and uniqueness of integrals from it.
