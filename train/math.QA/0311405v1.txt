We motivate and prove a series of identities which form a generalization of the Euler's pentagonal number theorem, and are closely related to specialized Macdonald's identities for powers of the Dedekind \eta--function. More precisely, we show that what we call ``denominator formula'' for the Virasoro algebra has ``higher analogue'' for all c_{s,t}-minimal models. We obtain one identity per series which is in agreement with features of conformal field theory such as {\em fusion} and {\em modular invariance} that require all the irreducible modules of the series. In particular, in the case of c_{2,2k+1}--minimal models we give a new proof of a family of specialized Macdonald's identities associated with twisted affine Lie algebras of type A^{(2)}_{2k}, k \geq 2 (i.e., BC_k-affine root system) which involve (2k^2-k)-th powers of the Dedekind \eta-function. Our paper is in many ways a continuation of math.QA/0309201.
