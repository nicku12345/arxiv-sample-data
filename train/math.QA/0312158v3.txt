Local Weyl modules over two-dimensional currents with values in gl_r are deformed into spaces with bases related to parking functions. Using this construction we   1) propose a simple proof that dimension of the space of diagonal coinvariants is not less than the number of parking functions;   2) describe the limits of Weyl modules in terms of semi-infinite forms and find the limits of characters;   3) propose a lower bound and state a conjecture for dimensions of Weyl modules with arbitrary highest weights.   Also we express characters of deformed Weyl modules in terms of \rho-parking functions and the Frobenius characteristic map.
