A characterization of the space of symmetric Laurent polynomials of type (BC)_n which vanish on a certain set of submanifolds is given by using the Koornwinder-Macdonald polynomials. A similar characterization was given previously for symmetric polynomials of type A_n by using the Macdonald polynomials. We use a new method which exploits the duality relation. The method simplifies a part of the proof in the A_n case.
