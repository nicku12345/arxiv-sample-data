In this paper we study general quantum affinizations \U_q(\hat{\Glie}) of symmetrizable quantum Kac-Moody algebras and we develop their representation theory. We prove a triangular decomposition and we give a classication of (type 1) highest weight simple integrable representations analog to Drinfel'd-Chari-Pressley one. A generalization of the q-characters morphism, introduced by Frenkel-Reshetikhin for quantum affine algebras, appears to be a powerful tool for this investigation. For a large class of quantum affinizations (including quantum affine algebras and quantum toroidal algebras), the combinatorics of q-characters give a ring structure * on the Grothendieck group \text{Rep}(\U_q(\hat{\Glie})) of the integrable representations that we classified. We propose a new construction of tensor products in a larger category by using the Drinfel'd new coproduct (it can not directly be used for \text{Rep}(\U_q(\hat{\Glie})) because it involves infinite sums). In particular we prove that * is a fusion product (a product of representations is a representation).
