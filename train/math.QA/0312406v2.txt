Critical points of a master function associated to a simple Lie algebra \g come in families called the populations [MV1]. We prove that a population is isomorphic to the flag variety of the Langlands dual Lie algebra \g^t. The proof is based on the correspondence between critical points and differential operators called the Miura opers.   For a Miura oper D, associated with a critical point of a population, we show that all solutions of the differential equation DY=0 can be written explicitly in terms of critical points composing the population.
