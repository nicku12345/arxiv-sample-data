A new box ball system associated with an antisymmetric tensor crystal of the quantum affine algebra of type A is considered. This includes the so-called colored box ball system with capacity 1 as the simplest case. Infinite number of conserved quantities are constructed and the scattering rule of two olitons are given explicitly.
