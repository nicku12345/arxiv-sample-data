Let \Oq(G) be the algebra of quantized functions on an algebraic group G and \Oq(B) its quotient algebra corresponding to a Borel subgroup B of G. We define the category of sheaves on the "quantum flag variety of G" to be the \Oq(B)-equivariant \Oq(G)-modules and proves that this is a proj-category. We construct a category of equivariant quantum \mathcal{D}-modules on this quantized flag variety and prove the Beilinson-Bernsteins localization theorem for this category in the case when q is not a root of unity.
