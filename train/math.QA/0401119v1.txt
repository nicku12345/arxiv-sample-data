In this paper, we study G-equivariant tensor categories for a finite group G. These categories were introduced by Turaev under the name of G-crossed categories; the motivating example of such a category is the category of twisted modules over a vertex operator algebra V with a finite group of automorphisms G. We discuss the notion of "orbifold quotient" of such a category (in the example above, this quotient is the category of modules over the subalgebra of invariants V^G). We introduce an extended Verlinde algebra for a G-equivariant tensor category and give a simple description of the Verlinde algebra of the orbifold category in terms of the extended Verlinde algebra of the original category.   We define an analog of s,t matrices for the extended Verlinde algebra and show that if s is invertible, then these matrices define an action of SL_2(Z) on the extended Verlinde algebra. We also show that the s-matrix interchanges tensor product with a much simpler product ("convolution product"), which can be used to compute the tensor product multiplicities.
