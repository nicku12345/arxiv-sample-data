A basis of N^2 projectors, each an {N^2}\times{N^2} matrix with constant elements, is implemented to construct a class of braid matrices \hat{R}(\theta), \theta being the spectral parameter. Only odd values of N are considered here. Our ansatz for the projectors P_{\alpha} appearing in the spectral decomposition of \hat{R}(\theta) leads to exponentials exp(m_{\alpha}\theta) as the coefficient of P_{\alpha}. The sums and differences of such exponentials on the diagonal and the antidiagonal respectively provide the (2N^2 -1) nonzero elements of \hat{R}(\theta). One element at the center is normalized to unity. A class of supplementary constraints imposed by the braid equation leaves {1/2}(N+3)(N-1) free parameters m_{\alpha}. The diagonalizer of \hat{R}(\theta) is presented for all N. Transfer matrices t(\theta) and L(\theta) operators corresponding to our \hat{R}(\theta) are studied. Our diagonalizer signals specific combinations of the components of the operators that lead to a quadratic algebra of N^2 constant N\times N matrices. The \theta-dependence factors out for such combinations. \hat R(\theta) is developed in a power series in \theta. The basic difference arising for even dimensions is made explicit. Some special features of our \hat{R}(\theta) are discussed in a concluding section.
