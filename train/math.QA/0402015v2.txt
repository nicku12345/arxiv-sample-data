The modular envelope of a cyclic operad is the smallest modular operad containing it. A modular operad is constructed from moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces with boundary; this modular operad is shown to be the modular envelope of the A-infinity cyclic operad. This gives a new proof of the result of Harer-Mumford-Thurston-Penner-Kontsevich that a cell complex built from ribbon graphs is homotopy equivalent to the moduli space of curves.
