The aim of these notes is to introduce the quantum master equation \{S,S\}-2i\hbar\Delta S=0, and to show its relations to the theory of Lie algebras representations and to perturbative expansions of Gaussian integrals. The relations of the classical master equation \{S,S\}=0 with the BRST formalisms are also described. Being an introduction, only finite-dimensional examples will be considered.
