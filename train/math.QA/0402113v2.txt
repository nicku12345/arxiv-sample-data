We construct a family of BC_n-symmetric biorthogonal abelian functions generalizing Koornwinder's orthogonal polynomials, and prove a number of their properties, most notably analogues of Macdonald's conjectures. The construction is based on a direct construction for a special case generalizing Okounkov's interpolation polynomials. We show that these interpolation functions satisfy a collection of generalized hypergeometric identities, including new multivariate elliptic analogues of Jackson's summation and Bailey's transformation.
