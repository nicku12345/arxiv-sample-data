We prove some relations for the q-multiple zeta values (qMZV). They are q-analogues of the cyclic sum formula, the Ohno relation and the Ohno-Zagier relation for the multiple zeta values (MZV). We discuss the problem to determine the dimension of the space spanned by qMZV's over \Q, and present an application to MZV.
