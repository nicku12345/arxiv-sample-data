Quivers over a fixed base set form a monoidal category with tensor product given by pullback. The quantum Yang-Baxter equation, or more properly the braid equation, is investigated in this setting. A solution of the braid equation in this category is called a "solution" for short. Results of Etingof-Schedler-Soloviev, Lu-Yan-Zhu and Takeuchi on the set-theoretical quantum Yang-Baxter equation are generalized to the context of quivers, with groupoids playing the r\^ole of groups. The notion of "braided groupoid" is introduced. Braided groupoids are solutions and are characterized in terms of bijective 1-cocycles. The structure groupoid of a non-degenerate solution is defined; it is shown that it is braided groupoid. The reduced structure groupoid of a non-degenerate solution is also defined. Non-degenerate solutions are classified in terms of representations of matched pairs of groupoids. By linearization we construct star-triangular face models and realize them as modules over quasitriangular quantum groupoids introduced in recent papers by M. Aguiar, S. Natale and the author.
