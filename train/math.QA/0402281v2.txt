We propose quantum Painlev\'e systems of type A_l^{(1)}.   These systems, for l=1 and l\ge 2, should be regarded as quantizations of the second Painlev\'e equation and the differential systems with the affine Weyl group symmetries of type A_l^{(1)} studied by M. Noumi and Y. Yamada \cite{NYhigherorder}, respectively. These quantizations enjoy the affine Weyl group symmetries of type A_l^{(1)} as well as the Lax representations. The quantized systems of type A_1^{(1)} and type A_l^{(1)} (l= 2n) can be obtained as the continuous limits of the discrete systems constructed from the affine Weyl group symmetries of type A_2^{(1)} and A_{l+1}^{(1)}, respectively.
