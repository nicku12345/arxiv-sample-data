We study degenerations of the Belavin R-matrices via the infinite dimensional operators defined by Shibukawa-Ueno. We define a two-parameter family of generalizations of the Shibukawa-Ueno R-operators. These operators have finite dimensional representations which include Belavin's R-matrices in the elliptic case, a two-parameter family of twisted affinized Cremmer-Gervais R-matrices in the trigonometric case, and a two-parameter family of twisted (affinized) generalized Jordanian R-matrices in the rational case. We find finite dimensional representations which are compatible with the elliptic to trigonometric and rational degeneration. We further show that certain members of the elliptic family of operators have no finite dimensional representations. These R-operators unify and generalize earlier constructions of Felder and Pasquier, Ding and Hodges, and the authors, and illuminate the extent to which the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrices (and their rational forms) are degenerations of Belavin's R-matrix.
