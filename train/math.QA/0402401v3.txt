In this paper, we clarify the relation between Manin's quantum theta function and Schwarz's theta vector in comparison with the kq representation, which is equivalent to the classical theta function, and the corresponding coordinate space wavefunction. We first explain the equivalence relation between the classical theta function and the kq representation in which the translation operators of the phase space are commuting. When the translation operators of the phase space are not commuting, then the kq representation is no more meaningful. We explain why Manin's quantum theta function obtained via algebra (quantum tori) valued inner product of the theta vector is a natural choice for quantum version of the classical theta function (kq representation). We then show that this approach holds for a more general theta vector with constant obtained from a holomorphic connection of constant curvature than the simple Gaussian one used in the Manin's construction. We further discuss the properties of the theta vector and of the quantum theta function, both of which have similar symmetry properties under translation.
