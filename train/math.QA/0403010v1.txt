We study McKay's observation on the Monster simple group, which relates the 2A-involutions of the Monster simple group to the extended E_8 diagram, using the theory of vertex operator algebras (VOAs). We first consider the sublattices L of the E_8 lattice obtained by removing one node from the extended E_8 diagram at each time. We then construct a certain coset (or commutant) subalgebra U associated with L in the lattice VOA V_{\sqrt{2}E_8}. There are two natural conformal vectors of central charge 1/2 in U such that their inner product is exactly the value predicted by Conway. The Griess algebra of U coincides with the algebra described in Conway's paper. There is a canonical automorphism of U of order |E_8/L|. Such an automorphism can be extended to the Leech lattice VOA V_\Lambda and it is in fact a product of two Miyamoto involutions. In the sequel [LYY] to this article we shall develop the representation theory of U. It is expected that if U is actually contained in the Moonshine VOA V^\natural, the product of two Miyamoto involutions is in the desired conjugacy class of the Monster simple group.
