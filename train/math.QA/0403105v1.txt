Let U_q(\frak{g}) a the quantum affine algebra of type A_n^{(1)}, A_{2n-1}^{(2)}, A_{2n}^{(2)}, B_n^{(1)}, D_n^{(1)} and D_{n+1}^{(2)}, and let \mathcal{F}(\Lambda) be the Fock space representation for a level 1 dominant integral weight \Lambda. Using the crystal basis of \mathcal{F}(\Lambda) and its characterization in terms of abacus, we construct an explicit bijection between the set of weight vectors in \mathcal{F}(\Lambda)_{\lambda-m\delta} (m\geq 0) for a maximal weight \lambda and the set of certain ordered sequences of partitions. As a corollary, we obtain the string function of the basic representation V(\Lambda).
