We study the algebra U_{\zeta} obtained via Lusztig's `integral' form [Lu 1, 2] of the generic quantum algebra for the Lie algebra \frak {g=sl}_2 modulo the two-sided ideal generated by K^l-1. We show that U_{\zeta} is a smash product of the quantum deformation of the restricted universal enveloping algebra \bold u_{\zeta} of \frak g and the ordinary universal enveloping algebra U of \frak g, and we compute the primitive (= prime) ideals of \Uz. Next we describe a decomposition of \bold u_{\zeta} into the simple U- submodules, which leads to an explicit formula for the center and the indecomposable direct summands of \Uz. We conclude with a description of the lattice of cofinite ideals of \Uz in terms of a unique set of lattice generators.
