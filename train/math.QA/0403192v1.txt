We describe the crystal bases of the modified quantum algebras and give the explicit form of the highest (or lowest) weight vector of its connected component B_0(\lambda) containing the unit element for arbitrary rank 2 cases. We also present the explicit form of B_0(\lambda) containing the highest (or lowest) weight vector by the polyhedral realization method.
