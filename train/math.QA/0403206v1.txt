We study the Hall and composition algebras of an affine quiver. In the case of a cyclic quiver, we provide generators for the central polynomial algebra described by Schiffmann and prove that this is in fact the whole of the centre of the Hall algebra. For an affine quiver without oriented cycles, we obtain a structure theorem for the composition algebra refining the structure provided by Zhang.
