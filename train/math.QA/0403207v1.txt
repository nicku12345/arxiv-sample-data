Let \g be a finite dimensional complex Lie algebra and \l\subset \g a Lie subalgebra equipped with the structure of a factorizable quasitriangular Lie bialgebra. Consider the Lie group \Exp \l with the Semenov-Tjan-Shansky Poisson bracket as a Poisson Lie manifold for the double Lie bialgebra \D\l. Let \Nc_\l(0)\subset \l be an open domain parameterizing a neighborhood of the identity in \Exp \l by the exponential map. We present dynamical r-matrices with values in \g\wedge \g over the Poisson Lie base manifold \Nc_\l(0).
