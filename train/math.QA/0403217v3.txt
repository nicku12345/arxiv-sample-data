We consider two families of categories. The first is the family of semisimple quotients of H. Andersen's tilting module categories for quantum groups of Lie type B specialized at odd roots of unity. The second consists of categories constructed from a particular family of finite-dimensional quotients of the group algebra of Artin's braid group known as BMW-algebras of type BC. Our main result is to show that these families coincide as braided tensor categories using a recent theorem of Tuba and Wenzl. The morphism spaces in these categories can be equipped with a Hermitian form, and we are able to show that these categories are never unitary, and no braided tensor category sharing the Grothendieck semiring common to these families is unitarizable.
