The generalized Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for the finite dimensional irreducible representations of the general linear superalgebra are computed explicitly. Using the result we establish a one to one correspondence between the set of composition factors of an arbitrary r-fold atypical gl_{m|n}-Kac-module and the set of composition factors of some r-fold atypical gl_{r|r}-Kac-module. The result of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials is also applied to prove a conjectural character formula put forward by van der Jeugt et al in the late 80s. We simplify this character formula to cast it into the Kac-Weyl form, and derive from it a closed formula for the dimension of any finite dimensional irreducible representation of the general linear superalgebra.
