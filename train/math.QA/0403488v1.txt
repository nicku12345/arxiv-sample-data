To each natural star product on a Poisson manifold M we associate an antisymplectic involutive automorphism of the formal neighborhood of the zero section of the cotangent bundle of M. If M is symplectic, this mapping is shown to be the inverse mapping of the formal symplectic groupoid of the star product. The construction of the inverse mapping involves modular automorphisms of the star product.
