In this note, we consider the problem of constructing knot invariants from Yang-Baxter operators associated to (unitary associative) algebra structures.   We first compute the enhancements of these operators. Then, we conclude that Turaev's procedure to construct knot invariants, as modified by Murakami, invariably produces from those enhanced Yang-Baxter operators the Alexander polynomial.
