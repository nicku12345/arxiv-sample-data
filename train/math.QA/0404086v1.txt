Consider the complex matrix Lie superalgebra gl_{N|N} with the standard generators E_{ij} where i,j=-N,...,-1,1,...,N. Define an involutive automorphism \eta of gl_{N|N} by \eta(E_{ij})=E_{-i,-j}. The queer Lie superalgebra q_N is the fixed point subalgebra in gl_{N|N} relative to the automorphism \eta. Consider the twisted polynomial current Lie superalgebra g=\{X(t)\in\gl_{N|N}[t]:\eta(X(t))=X(-t)\}. The enveloping algebra U(g) of the Lie superalgebra g has a deformation, called the Yangian of q_N. For each M=1,2,... denote by A_N^M the centralizer of q_M\subset q_{N+M} in the superalgebra U(q_{N+M}). We describe the projective limit of the sequence of centralizer algebras A_N^1,A_N^2,... in terms of the Yangian of q_N.
