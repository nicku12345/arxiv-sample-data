We construct some new Integrable Systems (IS) both classical and quantum associated with elliptic algebras. Our constructions are partly based on the algebraic integrability mechanism given by the existence of commuting families in skew fields and partly - on the internal properties of the elliptic algebras and their representations. We give some examples to make an evidence how these IS are related to previously studied.
