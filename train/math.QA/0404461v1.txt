A bijective map r: X^2 \longrightarrow X^2, where X = \{x_1, ..., x_n \} is a finite set, is called a \emph{set-theoretic solution of the Yang-Baxter equation} (YBE) if the braid relation r_{12}r_{23}r_{12} = r_{23}r_{12}r_{23} holds in X^3. A non-degenerate involutive solution (X,r) satisfying r(xx)=xx, for all x \in X, is called \emph{square-free solution}. There exist close relations between the square-free set-theoretic solutions of YBE, the semigroups of I-type, the semigroups of skew polynomial type, and the Bieberbach groups, as it was first shown in a joint paper with Michel Van den Bergh.   In this paper we continue the study of square-free solutions (X,r) and the associated Yang-Baxter algebraic structures -- the semigroup S(X,r), the group G(X,r) and the k- algebra A(k, X,r) over a field k, generated by X and with quadratic defining relations naturally arising and uniquely determined by r. We study the properties of the associated Yang-Baxter structures and prove a conjecture of the present author that the three notions: a square-free solution of (set-theoretic) YBE, a semigroup of I type, and a semigroup of skew-polynomial type, are equivalent. This implies that the Yang-Baxter algebra A(k, X,r) is Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt type algebra, with respect to some appropriate ordering of X. We conjecture that every square-free solution of YBE is retractable, in the sense of Etingof-Schedler.
