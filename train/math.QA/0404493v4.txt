We give new solutions of the quantum conformal deformations of the full Maxwell equations in terms of deformations of the plane wave. We study the compatibility of these solutions with the conservation of the current. We also start the study of quantum linear conformal (Weyl) gravity by writing the corresponding q-deformed equations.
