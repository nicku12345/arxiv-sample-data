The Sklyanin algebra admits realizations by difference operators acting on theta functions. Sklyanin found an invariant metric for the action and conjectured an explicit formula for the corresponding reproducing kernel. We prove this conjecture, and also give natural biorthogonal and orthogonal bases for the representation space. Moreover, we discuss connections with elliptic hypergeometric series and integrals and with elliptic 6j-symbols.
