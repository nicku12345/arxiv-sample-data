Quadratic algebras associated to pseudo-roots of noncommutative polynomials have been introduced by I. Gelfand, Retakh, and Wilson in connection with studying the decompositions of noncommutative polynomials. Later they (with S. Gelfand and Serconek) shown that the Hilbert series of these algebras and their quadratic duals satisfy the necessary condition for Koszulity. It is proved in this note that these algebras are Koszul.
