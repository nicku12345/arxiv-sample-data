Quadratic relations of the intertwiners are given explicitly in two cases of chiral conformal field theory, and monomial bases of the representation spaces are constructed by using the Fourier components of the intertwiners. The two cases are the (p,p')-minimal series for the Virasoro algebra where 1<p'/p<2, and the level k integrable highest weight modules for the affine Lie algebra \hat{sl}_2.
