Recently, a class of transformations of R_q-matrices was introduced such that the q \to 1 limit gives explicit nonstandard R_h-matrices. The transformation matrix is singular as q \to 1. For the transformed matrix, the singularities, however, cancel yielding a well-defined construction. We have shown that our method can be implemented systematically on R_q matrices of all dimensions of U_q(sl(N)), U_Q(osp(1|2)) and U_q(sl(2|1)) algebras. Explicit constructions are presented for U_q(sl(2)), U_q(sl(3)), U_q(osp(1|2)) and U_q(sl(2|1)) algebras, while choosing R_q matrix for (fund. rep.) \otimes (arbitrary irrep.). Our method yields nonstadard deformations along with a nonlinear map of the h-Borel subalgebra on the corresponding classical Borel subalgebra, which can be easily extended to the whole algebra. Following this approach we explicitly construct here the nonstandard Jordanian quantum (super)algebras U_h(sl(2)), U_h(sl(3)), U_h(osp(1|2)) and U_h(sl(2|1)). These Hopf (super)algebras are equipped with a remarkably simpler coalgebraic structure. Generalizing our results on U_h(sl(3)), we give the higher dimensional Jordanian (super)algebras U_h(sl(N)) for all N. The universal R_h matrices are also given.
