In this paper, deformations of L_\infty-algebras are defined in such a way that the bases of deformations are L_\infty-algebras, as well. A universal and a semiuniversal deformation is constructed for L_\infty-algebras, whose cotangent complex admits a splitting. The paper also contains an explicit construction of a minimal L_\infty-structure on the homology H of a differential graded Lie algebra L and of an L_\infty-quasi-isomorphism between H and L.
