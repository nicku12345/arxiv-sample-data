In this paper we consider all possible generalizations of the B-type Hecke algebras, namely the cyclotomic and what we call 'generalized', and we construct Markov traces on each of them, so as to obtain all possible different levels of homfly-pt analogues in the solid torus related to the (Hecke) algebras of B-type.
