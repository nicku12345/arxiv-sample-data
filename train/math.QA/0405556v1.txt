We construct a dynamical reflection equation algebra, \tilde {\mathcal{K}}, via a dynamical twist of the ordinary reflection equation algebra. A dynamical version of the reflection equation is deduced as a corollary. We show that \tilde {\mathcal{K}} is a right comodule algebra over a dynamical analog of the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan algebra equipped with a structure of right bialgebroid. We introduce dynamical trace and use it for constructing central elements of \tilde {\mathcal{K}}.
