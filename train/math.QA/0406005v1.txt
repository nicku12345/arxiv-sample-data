We use monoidal category methods to study the noncommutative geometry of nonassociative algebras obtained by a Drinfeld-type cochain twist. These are the so-called quasialgebras and include the octonions as braided-commutative but nonassociative coordinate rings, as well as quasialgebra versions \CC_{q}(G) of the standard q-deformation quantum groups. We introduce the notion of ribbon algebras in the category, which are algebras equipped with a suitable generalised automorphism \sigma, and obtain the required generalisation of cyclic cohomology. We show that this \emph{braided cyclic cocohomology} is invariant under a cochain twist. We also extend to our generalisation the relation between cyclic cohomology and differential calculus on the ribbon quasialgebra. The paper includes differential calculus and cyclic cocycles on the octonions as a finite nonassociative geometry, as well as the algebraic noncommutative torus as an associative example.
