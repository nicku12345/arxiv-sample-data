We establish a connection between (degenerate) nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials and standard bases and dual standard bases of maximal parabolic modules of affine Hecke algebras. Along the way we prove a (weak) polynomiality result for coefficients of symmetric and nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials.
