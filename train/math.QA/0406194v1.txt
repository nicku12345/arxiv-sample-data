The two papers in this series analyze quantum invariant differential operators for quantum symmetric spaces in the maximally split case. In this paper, we complete the proof of a quantum version of Harish-Chandra's theorem: There is a Harish-Chandra map which induces an isomorphism between the ring of quantum invariant differential operators and a ring of Laurent polynomial invariants with respect to the dotted action of the restricted Weyl group. We find a particularly nice basis for the quantum invariant differential operators that provides a new interpretation of difference operators associated to Macdonald polynomials. Finally, we set the stage for a general quantum counterpart to noncompact zonal spherical functions.
