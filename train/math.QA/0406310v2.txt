Given a monoidal category C, an ordinary category M, and a monad T in M, the lifts in a strict sense of a fixed action of C on M to an action of C on the Eilenberg-Moore category of T-modules in M are in a bijective correspondence with certain families of natural transformations, indexed by the objects in the monoidal category C. These families are analogues of distributive laws between monads.
