In this paper we study a quantum analogue of a degenerate principal series of U_q \mathfrak{su}_{n,n}-modules (0<q<1) related to the Shilov boundary of the quantum n \times n-matrix unit ball. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the modules to be simple and unitarizable and investigate their equivalence.   These results are q-analogues of known classical results on reducibility and unitarizability of SU(n,n)-modules obtained by Johnson, Sahi, Zhang, Howe and Tan.
