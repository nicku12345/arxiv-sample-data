Let D be a simply laced Dynkin diagram of rank r whose affinization has the shape of a star (i.e., D4,E6,E7,E8). To such a diagram one can attach a group G whose generators correspond to the legs of the affinization, have orders equal to the leg lengths plus 1, and the product of the generators is 1. The group G is then a 2-dimensional crystallographic group: G=Z_l\ltimes Z^2, where l is 2,3,4, and 6, respectively. In this paper, we define a flat deformation H(t,q) of the group algebra C[G] of this group, by replacing the relations saying that the generators have prescribed orders by their deformations, saying that the generators satisfy monic polynomial equations of these orders with arbitrary roots (which are deformation parameters). The algebra H(t,q) for D4 is the Cherednik algebra of type C^\check C_1, which was studied by Noumi, Sahi, and Stokman, and controls Askey-Wilson polynomials. We prove that H(t,q) is the universal deformation of the twisted group algebra of G, and that this deformation is compatible with certain filtrations on C[G]. We also show that if q is a root of unity, then for generic t the algebra H(t,q) is an Azumaya algebra, and its center is the function algebra on an affine del Pezzo surface. For generic q, the spherical subalgebra eH(t,q)e provides a quantization of such surfaces. We also discuss connections of H(t,q) with preprojective algebras and Painlev\'e VI.
