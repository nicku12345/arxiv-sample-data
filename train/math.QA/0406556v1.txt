Let K denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over K with finite positive dimension. Consider a pair of linear transformations A:V\to V and A^*:V\to V that satisfy both conditions below:   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is diagonal, and the matrix representing A^* is irreducible tridiagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A^* is diagonal, and the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal.   Such a pair is called a Leonard pair on V. In this paper we introduce a mild generalization of a Leonard pair called a tridiagonal pair. A Leonard pair is the same thing as a tridiagonal pair such that for each transformation all eigenspaces have dimension one.
