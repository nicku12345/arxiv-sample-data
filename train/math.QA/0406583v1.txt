We study deformation quantization on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space W endowed with its canonical Poisson structure. The standard example of the Moyal star-product is made explicit and it is shown that it is well defined on a subalgebra of C^\infty(W). A classification of inequivalent deformation quantizations of exponential type, containing the Moyal and normal star-products, is also given.
