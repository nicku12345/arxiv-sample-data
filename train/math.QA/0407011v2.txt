We derive some new presentations for the Yangian associated to the Lie algebra gl_n(C) that are adapted to parabolic subalgebras. At one extreme, the presentation is just the usual RTT presentation, whilst at the other extreme it is a variation on Drinfeld's presentation. All these presentations play an important role in our subsequent article "Shifted Yangians and finite W-algebras".
