In the paper \cite{BK} we defined categories of equivariant quantum \mathcal{O}_q-modules and \mathcal{D}_q-modules on the quantum flag variety of G. We proved that the Beilinson-Bernstein localization theorem holds at a generic q. Here we prove that a derived version of this theorem holds at the root of unity case. Namely, the global section functor gives a derived equivalence between category of U_q-modules and \mathcal{D}_q-modules on the quantum flag variety.   For this we first prove that \mathcal{D}_q is an Azumaya algebra over an open subset ofthe cotangent bundle T^\star X of the classical (char 0) flag variety X. This way we get a derived equivalence between representations of U_q and certain \mathcal{O}_{T^\star X}-modules.   In the paper \cite{BMR} similar results were obtained for a Lie algebra \g_p in char p. Hence, representations of \g_p and of U_q (when q is a p'th root of unity) are related via the cotangent bundles T^\star X in char 0 and in char p, respectively.
