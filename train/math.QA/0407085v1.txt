In the classification of solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation, there are solutions that are not deformations of the trivial solution (essentially the identity). We consider the algebras defined by these solutions, and the corresponding dual algebras. We then study the representations of the latter. We are also interested in the Baxterisation of these R-matrices and in the corresponding quantum planes.
