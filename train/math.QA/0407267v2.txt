We use the Jack symmetric functions as a basis of the Fock space, and study the action of the Virasoro generators L_n. We calculate explicitly the matrix elements of L_n with respect to the Jack-basis. A combinatorial procedure which produces these matrix elements is conjectured. As a limiting case of the formula, we obtain a Pieri-type formula which represents a product of a power sum and a Jack symmetric function as a sum of Jack symmetric functions. Also, a similar expansion was found for the case when we differentiate the Jack symmetric functions with respect to power sums. As an application of our Jack-basis representation, a new diagrammatic interpretation is presented, why the singular vectors of the Virasoro algebra are proportional to the Jack symmetric functions with rectangular diagrams. We also propose a natural normalization of the singular vectors in the Verma module, and determine the coefficients which appear after bosonization in front of the Jack symmetric functions.
