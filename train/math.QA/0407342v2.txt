We construct a quantum version of the SU(2) Hopf bundle S^7 \to S^4. The quantum sphere S^7_q arises from the symplectic group Sp_q(2) and a quantum 4-sphere S^4_q is obtained via a suitable self-adjoint idempotent p whose entries generate the algebra A(S^4_q) of polynomial functions over it. This projection determines a deformation of an (anti-)instanton bundle over the classical sphere S^4. We compute the fundamental K-homology class of S^4_q and pair it with the class of p in the K-theory getting the value -1 for the topological charge. There is a right coaction of SU_q(2) on S^7_q such that the algebra A(S^7_q) is a non trivial quantum principal bundle over A(S^4_q) with structure quantum group A(SU_q(2)).
