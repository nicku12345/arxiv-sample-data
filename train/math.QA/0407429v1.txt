The symmetric coinvariant algebra C[x_1, dots, x_n]_{S_n} is the quotient algebra of the polynomial ring by the ideal generated by symmetric polynomials vanishing at the origin. It is known that the algebra is isomorphic to the regular representation of S_n. Replacing C[x] with A = C[x,y]/(xy), we introduce another symmetric coinvariant algebra A^{otimes n}_{S_n} and determine its S_n-module structure. As an application, we determine the sl_{r+1}-module structure of the local Weyl module at a double point for sl_{r+1} otimes A.
