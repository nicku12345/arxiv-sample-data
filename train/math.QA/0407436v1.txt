We consider an interesting class of braidings defined by a combinatorial property in an earlier paper. We show that it consists exactly of those braidings that come from certain Yetter-Drinfeld module structures over pointed Hopf algebras with abelian coradical.   As a tool we define a reduced version of the FRT construction. For braidings induced by U_q(g)-modules the reduced FRT construction is calculated explicitly.
