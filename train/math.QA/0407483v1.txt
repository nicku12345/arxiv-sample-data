Quantum planes which correspond to all one parameter solutions of QYBE for the two-dimensional case of GL-groups are summarized and their geometrical interpretations are given. It is shown that the quantum dual plane is associated with an exotic solution of QYBE and the well-known quantum h-plane may be regarded as the quantum analog of the flag (or fiber) plane. Contractions of the quantum supergroup  GL_q(1|2) and corresponding quantum superspace  C_q(1|2) are considered in Cartesian basis. The contracted quantum superspace  C_h(1|2;\iota) is interpreted as the non-commutative analog of the superspace with the fiber odd part.
