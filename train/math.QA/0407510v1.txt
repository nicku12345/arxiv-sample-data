For a quasi-Hopf algebra H, a left H-comodule algebra \mf{B} and a right H-module coalgebra C we will characterize the category of Doi-Hopf modules {}^C{\cal M}(H)_{\mf{B}} in terms of modules. We will also show that for an H-bicomodule algebra \mb{A} and an H-bimodule coalgebra C the category of generalized Yetter-Drinfeld modules {}_{\mb{A}}{\cal YD}(H)^C is isomorphic to a certain category of Doi-Hopf modules. Using this isomorphism we will transport the properties from the category of Doi-Hopf modules to the category of generalized Yetter-Drinfeld modules.
