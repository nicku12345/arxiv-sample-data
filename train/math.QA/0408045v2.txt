The construction of a quantum groupoid out of a double groupoid satisfying a filling condition and a perturbation datum is given. This extends previous work that appeared in math.QA/0308228. Several important classes of examples of tensor categories are shown to fit into this construction. Certain invariants such as a pivotal group-like element and quantum and Frobenius-Perron dimensions of simple objects are computed.
