The cyclic (co)homology of Hopf algebras is defined by Connes and Moscovici [math.DG/9806109] and later extended by Khalkhali et.al [math.KT/0306288] to admit stable anti-Yetter-Drinfeld coefficient module/comodules. In this paper we will show that one can further extend the cyclic homology of Hopf algebras with coefficients non-trivially. The new homology, called the bialgebra cyclic homology, admits stable coefficient module/comodules, dropping the anti-Yetter-Drinfeld condition. This fact allows the new homology to use bialgebras, not just Hopf algebras. We will also give computations for bialgebra cyclic homology of the Hopf algebra of foliations of codimension n and the quantum deformation of an arbitrary semi-simple Lie algebra with several stable but non-anti-Yetter-Drinfeld coefficients.
