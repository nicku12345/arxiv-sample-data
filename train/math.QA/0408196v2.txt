We analyze among all possible quantum deformations of the 3+1 (anti)de Sitter algebras, so(3,2) and so(4,1), which have two specific non-deformed or primitive commuting operators: the time translation/energy generator and a rotation. We prove that under these conditions there are only two families of two-parametric (anti)de Sitter Lie bialgebras. All the deformation parameters appearing in the bialgebras are dimensionful ones and they may be related to the Planck length. Some properties conveyed by the corresponding quantum deformations (zero-curvature and non-relativistic limits, space isotropy,...) are studied and their dual (first-order) non-commutative spacetimes are also presented.
