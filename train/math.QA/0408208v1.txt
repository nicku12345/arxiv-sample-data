Consider a C*-algebra A with a comultiplication \Delta. This pair is usually thought of as locally compact quantum semi-group. When these notes were written, in 1993, it was not at all clear what the extra assumptions on the comultiplication should be for this pair to be a 'locally compact quantum group'. This only became clear in 1999 thanks to the work of Kustermans and Vaes. In the compact case however, rather natural conditions are formulated by Woronowicz and a good notion of a compact quantum group was available in 1993.   In these notes, we consider another class of locally compact quantum groups. We assume the existence of a non-zero element h in A satisfying \Delta(a)(1\otimes h)=a \otimes h for all a in A. We add some natural conditions and we speak of a 'quasi-discrete locally compact quantum group'. We also discuss the discrete case. We prove the existence of the Haar measure, the regular representation, the fundamental unitary and we obtain the reduced dual.   The quasi-discrete case is, in principle, more general than the discrete case. Shortly after these notes were written, Kustermans showed that in fact, the two classes coincided.   For this reason, these notes have not been published. Nevertheless, some of the results and techniques seem to be usful and in recent work, we came across similar settings. Therefore, we have decided to make these notes available on the net. We have added some comments at the end of the introduction and we have updated the reference list. But apart from these minor changes, the notes are still as they were written and distributed in 1993.
