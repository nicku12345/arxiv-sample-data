In this paper, we give a finite number of defining relations satisfied by a finite number of generators for the elliptic Lie algebras and superalgebras {\frak g}_R with rank \geq 2. Here the R's denote the reduced and non-reduced elliptic root systems with rank \geq 2. We also show that if {\cal L} is an extended affine Lie algebra (EALA) whose non-isotropic roots form the R, then there exists a natural homomorphism {\cal F}:{\frak g}_R \to{\cal L}, which also give a universal central extension (UCE) surjective map from [{\frak g}_R,{\frak g}_R] to the core of {\cal L}. (More precisely, we take a {\bar {\frak g}}_R instead of the {\frak g}_R.)
