Construction of the diagrammatic version of the affine Temperley-Lieb algebra of type \widetilde{A_N} as a subring of matrices over the Laurent polynomials is given. We move towards geometrical understanding of cellular structure of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. We represent its center as a coordinate ring of the certain affine algebraic variety and describe this variety constructing its desingularization.
