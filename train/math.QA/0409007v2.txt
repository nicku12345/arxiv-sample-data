This paper is devoted to the eigenvalue problem for the quantum Gaudin system. We prove the universal correspondence between eigenvalues of Gaudin Hamiltonians and the so-called G-opers without monodromy in general gl(n) case modulo a hypothesys on the analytic properties of the solution of a KZ-type equation.   Firstly we explore the quantum analog of the characteristic polynomial which is a differential operator in a variable u with the coefficients in U(gl(n))^{\otimes N}. We will call it "universal G-oper". It is constructed by the formula "Det"(L(u)-\partial_u) where L(u) is the quantum Lax operator for the Gaudin model and "Det" is appropriate definition of the determinant. The coefficients of this differential operator are quantum Gaudin Hamiltonians obtained by one of the authors (D.T. hep-th/0404153). We establish the correspondence between eigenvalues and G-opers as follows: taking eigen-values of the Gaudin's hamiltonians on the joint eigen-vector in the tensor product of finite-dimensional representation of gl(n) and substituting them into the universal G-oper we obtain the scalar differential operator (scalar G-oper) which conjecturally does not have monodromy. We strongly believe that our quantization of the Gaudin model coincides with quantization obtained from the center of universal enveloping algebra on the critical level and that our scalar G-oper coincides with the G-oper obtained by the geometric Langlands correspondence, hence it provides very simple and explicit map (Langlands correspondence) from Hitchin D-modules to G-opers in the case of rational base curves. It seems to be easy to generalize the constructions to the case of other semisimple Lie algebras and models like XYZ.
