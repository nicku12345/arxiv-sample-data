A new class of infinite dimensional representations of the Yangians Y(\frak{g}) and Y(\frak{b}) corresponding to a complex semisimple algebra \frak{g} and its Borel subalgebra \frak{b}\subset\frak{g} is constructed. It is based on the generalization of the Drinfeld realization of Y(\frak{g}), \frak{g}=\frak{gl}(N) in terms of quantum minors to the case of an arbitrary semisimple Lie algebra \frak{g}. The Poisson geometry associated with the constructed representations is described. In particular it is shown that the underlying symplectic leaves are isomorphic to the moduli spaces of G-monopoles defined as the components of the space of based maps of \mathbb{P}^1 into the generalized flag manifold X=G/B. Thus the constructed representations of the Yangian may be considered as a quantization of the moduli space of the monopoles.
