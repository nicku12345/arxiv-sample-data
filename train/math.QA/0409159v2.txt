The aim of this paper is to construct comodules of U_q(sl_2) and modules of SL_q(2) via quiver, where q is not a root of unity.   By embedding the quantized algebra U_q(sl_2) into the path coalgebra k\mathcal{D}^c, where \mathcal{D} is the Gabriel quiver of U_q(sl_2) as a coalgebra, we obtain a basis of U_q(sl_2) in terms of combinations of paths in the quiver \mathcal{D}; this special basis enable us to describe the category of U_q(sl_2)-comodules by certain representations of \mathcal{D}; and this description further permits us to construct a class of modules of the quantum special linear group SL_q(2), from certain representations of \mathcal{D}, via the duality between U_q(sl_2) and SL_q(2).
