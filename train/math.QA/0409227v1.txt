The main topic of this paper is two folds. First, we compute the first relative cohomology group of the Lie algebra of smooth vector fields on the projective line, Vect(RP^1), with coefficients in the space of bilinear differential operators that act on tensor densities, D_{\lambda, \nu;\mu}, vanishing on the Lie algebra sl(2,R). Second, we compute the first cohomology group of the Lie algebra sl(2,R) with coefficients in D_{\lambda, \nu;\mu}.
