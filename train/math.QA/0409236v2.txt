When {\frak g} is a complex semisimple Lie algebra, we study the variety {\mathcal L} of subalgebras of {\frak g}\oplus{\frak g} that are maximally isotropic with respect to K_1 - K_2, where K_i is the Killing form on the ith factor. We show the irreducible components of {\mathcal L} are smooth, classify them in terms of the generalized Belavin-Drinfeld triples introduced by Schiffmann, and relate them to orbits of the adjoint group G\times G. Building on ideas of Yakimov, we give a new proof of Karolinsky's classification of the diagonal G-orbits in {\mathcal L}. Our proof enables us to compute of the normalizer in {\frak g} of a subalgebra in {\mathcal L} under the diagonal action. As a consequence, we recover the classification of Belavin-Drinfeld triples. By results of math.DG/9909005, {\mathcal L} is a Poisson variety and we determine the rank of the symplectic leaf at each point of {\mathcal L} in terms of combinatorial data and relate the symplectic leaves to intersections of orbits of subgroups of G\times G. As a consequence, an intrinsically defined Poisson structure on each conjugacy class on G has an open symplectic leaf and we determine the rank at each point of the conjugacy class.
