The local analytic classification of irregular linear q-difference equations has recently been obtained by J.-P. Ramis, J. Sauloy and C. Zhang. Their description involves a q-analog of the Stokes sheaf and theorems of Malgrange-Sibuya type and is based on a discrete summation process due to C. Zhang. We show here another road to some of these results by algebraic means and we describe the q-Gevrey devissage of the q-Stokes sheaf by holomorphic vector bundles over an elliptic curve.
