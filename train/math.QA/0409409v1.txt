Let L be a positive definite even lattice and V_L^+ be the fixed points of the lattice VOA V_L associated to L under an automorphism of V_L lifting the -1 isometry of L. For any positive rank, the full automotphism group of V_L^+ is determined if L does not have vectors of norm 2 or 4. For any L of rank 2, a set of generators and the full automorphism group of V_L^+ are determined.
