We show that Turaev's group-coalgebras and Hopf group-coalgebras are coalgebras and Hopf algebras in a symmetric monoidal category, which we call the Turaev category. A similar result holds for group-algebras and Hopf group-algebras. As an application, we give an alternative approach to Virelizier's version of the Fundamental Theorem for Hopf algebras. We introduce Yetter-Drinfeld modules over Hopf group-coalgebras using the center construction.
