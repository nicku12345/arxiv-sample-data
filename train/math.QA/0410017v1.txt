We investigate the Drinfel'd doubles D(\Lambda_{n,d}) of a certain family of Hopf algebras. We determine their simple modules and their indecomposable projective modules, and we obtain a presentation by quiver and relations of these Drinfel'd doubles, from which we deduce properties of their representations, including the Auslander-Reiten quivers of the D(\Lambda_{n,d}). We then determine decompositions of the tensor products of most of the representations described, and in particular give a complete description of the tensor product of two simple modules. This study also leads to explicit examples of Hopf bimodules over the original Hopf algebras.
