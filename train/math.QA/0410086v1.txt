The FRT quantum group and space theory is reformulated from the standard mathematical basis to an arbitrary one. The N-dimensional quantum vector Cayley-Klein spaces are described in Cartesian basis and the quantum analogs of (N-1)-dimensional constant curvature spaces are introduced. Part of the 4-dimensional constant curvature spaces are interpreted as the non-commutative analogs of (1+3) kinematics. A different unifications of Cayley-Klein and Hopf structures in a kinematics are described with the help of permutations. All permutations which lead to the physically nonequivalent kinematics are found and the corresponding non-commutative (1+3) kinematics are investigated. As a result the quantum (anti) de Sitter, Minkowski, Newton, Galilei kinematics with the fundamental length, the fundamental mass and the fundamental velocity are obtained.
