We describe certain quiver Hopf algebras by parameters. This leads to the classification of multiple Taft algebras as well as pointed Yetter-Drinfeld modules and their corresponding Nichols algebras. In particular, when the ground-field k is the complex field and G is a finite abelian group, we classify quiver Hopf algebras over G, multiple Taft algebras over G and Nichols algebras in ^{kG}_{kG} {\cal YD}. We show that the quantum enveloping algebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra is a quotient of a semi-path Hopf algebra.
