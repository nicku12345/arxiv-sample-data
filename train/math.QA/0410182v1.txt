In our preceding papers we started considering the categories of tangles with flat G-connections in their complements, where G is a simple complex algebraic group. The braiding (or the commutativity constraint) in such categories satisfies the holonomy Yang-Baxter equation and it is this property which is essential for our construction of invariants of tangles with flat G-connections in their complements. In this paper, to any pair of irreducible modules over the quantized universal enveloping algebra of gl_2 at a root of unity, we associate a solution of the holonomy Yang-Baxter equation.
