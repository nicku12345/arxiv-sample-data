We re-examine the bijective correspondence between the set of isomorphism classes of ideals of the first Weyl algebra and associated quiver varieties (Calogero-Moser spaces) \cite{BW1, BW2}. We give a new explicit construction of this correspondence based on the notion of \A-envelope of a rank one torsion-free A_1-module. Though perhaps less geometric than other methods, our approach is much simpler and seems more natural from the point of view of deformation theory.
