We generalize our previous work on categorification of Kauffman bracket skein module of surfaces, by extending our homology to tangles in cylinders over surfaces, F x [0,1]. Our homology of 0-tangles and 1-tangles in D^3 coincides (up to normalization) with Khovanov link homology and the reduced Khovanov link homology.   We prove the basic properties of our homology. In particular, the short exact sequence of homologies of skein related tangles and the Kunneth formula for the tensor product of tangles.
