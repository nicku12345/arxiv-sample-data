We define the notion of a holomorphic bundle on the noncommutative toric orbifold T_{\theta}/G associated with an action of a finite cyclic group G on an irrational rotation algebra. We prove that the category of such holomorphic bundles is abelian and its derived category is equivalent to the derived category of modules over a finite-dimensional algebras \Lambda. As an application we finish the computation of K_0-groups of the crossed product algebras describing the above orbifolds initiated by Kumjian, Walters and Buck. Also, we describe a torsion pair in the category of \Lambda-modules, such that the tilting with respect to this torsion pair gives the category of holomorphic bundles on T_{\theta}/G.
