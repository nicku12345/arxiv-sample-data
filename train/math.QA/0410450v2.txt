Let M be a compact oriented PL manifold and let C_*M be its PL chain complex. The domain of the chain-level intersection pairing is a subcomplex G of C_*M\otimes C_*M. We prove that G is a "full" subcomplex, that is, the inclusion of G in C_*M \otimes C_*M is a quasi-isomorphism. An analogous result is true for the domain of the iterated intersection pairing. Using this, we show that the intersection pairing gives C_*M a structure of partially defined commutative DGA, which in particular implies that C_*M is canonically quasi-isomorphic to an E_\infty chain algebra.   An erratum is attached which corrects sign errors pointed out by Greg Friedman.
