This paper is concerned with two generalizations of the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions that have more or less recently appeared. The Hopf algebra of noncommutative symmetric functions and its dual, the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions. The focus is on the incredibly rich structure of the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions and the question of which structures and properties have good analogues for the noncommutative symmetric functions and/or the quasisymmetric functions. This paper attempt to survey the ongoing investigations in this topic as dictated by the knowledge and interests of its author. There are many open questions that are discussed.
