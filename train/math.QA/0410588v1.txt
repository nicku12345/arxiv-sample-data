We study the algebra of regular functions on the big cell of the Gauss decomposition of a simple complex Lie group G. We prove that it is spanned by the matrix elements of big projective modules in the BGG category O, and admits a decomposition of Peter-Weyl type. The subspace of Whittaker vectors in the regular representation on the big cell gives a realization of the big projective modules in O, similar to the Borel-Weil theorem. These results can be extended to the quantum groups.
