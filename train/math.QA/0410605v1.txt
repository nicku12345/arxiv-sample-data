In this paper we study the Fock representation of a certain *-algebra which appears naturally in the framework of quantum group theory. It is also a generalization of the twisted CCR-algebra introduced by W. Pusz and S.~Woronowicz. We prove that the Fock representation is a faithful irreducible representation of the algebra by bounded operators in a Hilbert space, and, moreover, it is the only (up to unitary equivalence) representation possessing these properties.   Keywords and phrases: Fock representation, quantum groups, bounded symmetric domain, non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces
