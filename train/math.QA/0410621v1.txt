We study cohomology theories of strongly homotopy algebras, namely A_\infty, C_\infty and L_\infty-algebras and establish the Hodge decomposition of Hochschild and cyclic cohomology of C_\infty-algebras thus generalising previous work by Loday and Gerstenhaber-Schack. These results are then used to show that a C_\infty-algebra with an invariant inner product on its cohomology can be uniquely extended to a symplectic C_\infty-algebra (an \infty-generalisation of a commutative Frobenius algebra introduced by Kontsevich). As another application, we show that the `string topology' operations (the loop product, the loop bracket and the string bracket) are homotopy invariant and can be defined on the homology or equivariant homology of an arbitrary Poincare duality space.
