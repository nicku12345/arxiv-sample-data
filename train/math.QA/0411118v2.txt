In this paper a quantum analog of the *-algebra of regular functions on the Shilov boundary S(\mathbb D) of bounded symmetric domain \mathbb D is constructed. The algebras of regular functions on S(\mathbb D) are described in terms of generators and relations for two particular series of bounded symmetric domains. Also, the degenerate principal series of quantum Harich-Chandra modules related to S(\mathbb D)=U_n is investigated.
