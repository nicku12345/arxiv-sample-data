Let k \subset K be an extension of fields, and let A \subset M_{n}(K) be a k-algebra. We study parameter spaces of m-dimensional subspaces of K^{n} which are invariant under A. The space \mathbb{F}_{A}(m,n), whose R-rational points are A-invariant, free rank m summands of R^{n}, is well known. We construct a distinct parameter space, \mathbb{G}_{A}(m,n), which is a fiber product of a Grassmannian and the projectivization of a vector space. We then study the intersection \mathbb{F}_{A}(m,n) \cap \mathbb{G}_{A}(m,n), which we denote by \mathbb{H}_{A}(m,n). Under suitable hypotheses on A, we construct affine open subschemes of \mathbb{F}_{A}(m,n) and \mathbb{H}_{A}(m,n) which cover their K-rational points. We conclude by using \mathbb{F}_{A}(m,n), \mathbb{G}_{A}(m,n), and \mathbb{H}_{A}(m,n) to construct parameter spaces of two-sided subspaces of two-sided vector spaces.
