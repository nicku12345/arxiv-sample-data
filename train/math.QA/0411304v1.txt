According to Kazhdan-Lusztig and Ginzburg, the Hecke algebra of an affine Weyl group is identified with the equivariant K-group of Steinberg's triple variety. The K-group is equipped with a filtration indexed by closed G-stable subvarieties of the nilpotent variety, where G is the corresponding reductive algebraic group over \mathbb{C}. In this paper we will show in the case of type A that the filtration is compatible with the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis of the Hecke algebra.
