Hopf algebra quantizations of 4-dimensional and 6-dimensional real classical Drinfel'd doubles are studied by following a direct "analytic" approach. The full quantization is explicitly obtained for most of the Drinfel'd doubles, except a small number of them for which the dual Lie algebra is either sl(2) or so(3). In the latter cases, the classical r-matrices underlying the Drinfel'd double quantizations contain known standard ones plus additional twists. Several new four and six-dimensional quantum algebras are presented and some general features of the method are emphasized.
