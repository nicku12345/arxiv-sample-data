We give an explicit construction of the free monoid in monoidal abelian categories when the monoidal product does not necessarily preserve coproducts. We apply it to several new monoidal categories that appeared recently in the theory of Koszul duality for operads and props. This gives a conceptual explanation of the form of the free operad, free dioperad, free properad and free prop.
