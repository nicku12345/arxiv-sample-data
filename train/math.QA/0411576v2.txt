The quantum permutation group of the set X_n=\{1,..., n\} corresponds to the Hopf algebra A_{aut}(X_n). This is an algebra constructed with generators and relations, known to be isomorphic to \cc (S_n) for n\leq 3, and to be infinite dimensional for n\geq 4. In this paper we find an explicit representation of the algebra A_{aut}(X_n), related to Clifford algebras. For n=4 the representation is faithful in the discrete quantum group sense.
