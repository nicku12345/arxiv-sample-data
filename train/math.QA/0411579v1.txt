To some braiding R of Hecke type (a Hecke symmetry) we put into correspondence an associative algebra called the modified Reflection Equation Algebra (mREA). We construct a series of matrices L_(m), m=1,2,... with entries belonging to mREA such that each of them satisfies a version of the Cayley-Hamilton identity with central coefficients.   We also consider some quotients of the mREA which are called the non-commutative orbits. For each of these orbits we construct a large family of projective modules. In this family we introduce an algebraic structure which is close to that of K^0(\Fl(\C^n)). The algebraic structure respects an equivalence relation motivated by a "quantum" trace compatible with the initial Hecke symmetry R. For a subclass of non-commutative orbits we compute the spectrum of central elements of the mREA Tr_R(L_(m)^k), k\in {\Bbb N}.
