We construct a 3^+ summable spectral triple (A(SU_q(2)),H,D) over the quantum group SU_q(2) which is equivariant with respect to a left and a right action of U_q(su(2)). The geometry is isospectral to the classical case since the spectrum of the operator D is the same as that of the usual Dirac operator on the 3-dimensional round sphere. The presence of an equivariant real structure J demands a modification in the axiomatic framework of spectral geometry, whereby the commutant and first-order properties need be satisfied only modulo infinitesimals of arbitrary high order.
