In this paper we prove the existence of a formal dynamical twist quantization for any triangular and non-modified formal classical dynamical r-matrix in the reductive case. The dynamical twist is constructed as the image of the dynamical r-matrix by a L_\infty-quasi-isomorphism. This quasi-isomorphism also allows us to classify formal dynamical twist quantizations up to gauge equivalence.
