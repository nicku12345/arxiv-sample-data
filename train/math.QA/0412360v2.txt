Let G be a simple complex factorizable Poisson Lie algebraic group. Let \U_\hbar(\g) be the corresponding quantum group. We study \U_\hbar(\g)-equivariant quantization \C_\hbar[G] of the affine coordinate ring \C[G] along the Semenov-Tian-Shansky bracket. For a simply connected group G we prove an analog of the Kostant-Richardson theorem stating that \C_\hbar[G] is a free module over its center.
