Let Q be an affine quiver of type A. Let C be the associated generalized Cartan matrix. Let U^- be the negative part of the quantized enveloping algebra attached to C. In terms of perverse sheaves on the moduli space of representations of a quiver, Lusztig constructed U geometrically and gave a canonical basis B of U^- at the same time. The simple perverse sheaves which enter B are defined abstractly in general. In Lusztig's paper [L2], by using McKay's correspondence, he gave a description of these canonical basis elements in affine cases, i.e. specifying the corresponding supports and local systems. But the chosen orientations and the number of vertices of the quiver are not arbitrary. In this paper we generalized the description in [L2] for arbitrary orientations and vertices in the case of type A by using the theory of representations of quivers.
