We study a Laurent polynomial representation V of the double affine Hecke algebra of type GL_n for specialized parameters   t^{k+1}q^{r-1}=1. We define a series of subrepresentations of V by using a vanishing condition. For some cases, we give an explicit basis of the subrepresentation in terms of nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials. These results are nonsymmetric versions of \cite{FJMM} and \cite{KMSV}.
