The purpose of this work is to define a derived Hall algebra \mathcal{DH}(T), associated to any dg-category T (under some finiteness conditions). Our main theorem states that \mathcal{DH}(T) is associative and unital. It is shown that \mathcal{DH}(T) contains the usual Hall algebra \mathcal{H}(T) when T is an abelian category. We will also prove an explicit formula for the derived Hall numbers purely in terms of invariants of the triangulated category associated to T. As an example, we describe the derived Hall algebra of an hereditary abelian category.
