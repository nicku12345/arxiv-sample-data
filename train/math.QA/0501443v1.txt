We discuss some properties of the tower of mapping class group representations associated to a Rational Conformal Field Theory. In particular, after reviewing the elementary properties of the modular representation, we discuss the Galois action, the structure of the projective kernel, and the trace identities generalizing the formula of Verlinde.
