This paper is a short account of the construction of a new class of the infinite-dimensional representations of the quantum groups. The examples include finite-dimensional quantum groups U_q(\mathfrak{g}), Yangian Y(\mathfrak{g}) and affine quantum groups at zero level   U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})_{c=0} corresponding to an arbitrary finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. At the intermediate step we construct the embedding of the quantum groups into the algebra of the rational functions on the quantum multi-dimensional torus. The explicit parameterization of the quantum groups used in this paper turns out to be closely related to the parameterization of the moduli spaces of the monopoles. As a result the proposed constructions of the representations provide a quantization of the moduli spaces of the monopoles on \RR^3 and \RR^2\times S^1.
