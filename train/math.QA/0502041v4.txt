For the quantum affine algebra U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}) with \mathfrak{g} of classical type, let \chi_{\lambda/\mu,a} be the Jacobi-Trudi type determinant for the generating series of the (supposed) q-characters of the fundamental representations. We conjecture that \chi_{\lambda/\mu,a} is the q-character of a certain finite dimensional representation of U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}). We study the tableaux description of \chi_{\lambda/\mu,a} using the path method due to Gessel-Viennot. It immediately reproduces the tableau rule by Bazhanov-Reshetikhin for A_n and by Kuniba-Ohta-Suzuki for B_n. For C_n, we derive the explicit tableau rule for skew diagrams \lambda/\mu of three rows and of two columns, and give the implicit tableau rule in terms of paths for general \lambda/\mu.
