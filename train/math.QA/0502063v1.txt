We construct the two-variable p-adic q-L-function which interpolates the generalized q-Bernoulli polynomials associated with primitive Dirichlet character \chi. Indeed, this function is the q-extension of two-variable p-adic L-function due to Fox, corresponding to the case q=1 . Finally, we give some p-adic integral representation for this two-variable p-adic q-L-function and derive to q-extension of the generalized formula of Diamond and Ferro and Greenberg for the two-variable p-adic L-function in terms of the p-adic gamma and \log gamma function.
