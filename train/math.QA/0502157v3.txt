We classify finite-dimensional complex Hopf algebras A which are pointed, that is, all of whose irreducible comodules are one-dimensional, and whose group of group-like elements G(A) is abelian such that all prime divisors of the order of G(A) are >7. Since these Hopf algebras turn out to be deformations of a natural class of generalized small quantum groups, our result can be read as an axiomatic description of generalized small quantum groups.
