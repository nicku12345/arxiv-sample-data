This is an extended abstract of my talk at the Oberwolfach-Workshop "Representation Theory of Finite-Dimensional Algebras" (February 6 - 12, 2005). It gives self-contained and simplified definitions of quantum cluster algebras introduced and studied in a joint work with A.Berenstein (math.QA/0404446).
