Khovanov introduced a cohomology theory for oriented classical links whose graded Euler characteristic is the Jones polynomial. Since Khovanov's theory is functorial for link cobordisms between classical links, we obtain an invariant of a surface-knot, called the {\it Khovanov-Jacobsson number}, by considering the surface-knot as a link cobordism between empty links. In this paper, we define an invariant of a surface-knot which is a generalization of the Khovanov-Jacobsson number by using Bar-Natan's theory, and prove that any T^2-knot has the trivial Khovanov-Jacobsson number.
