We give closed formulae for the q-characters of the fundamental representations of the quantum loop algebra of a classical Lie algebra in terms of a family of partitions satisfying some simple properties. We also give the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of the imaginary subalgebra in terms of these partitions.
