For every positive integer n, the quantum integer [n]_q is the polynomial [n]_q = 1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^{n-1}. A quadratic addition rule for quantum integers consists of sequences of polynomials \mathcal{R}' = \{r'_n(q)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}, \mathcal{S}' = \{s'_n(q)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}, and \mathcal{T}' = \{t'_{m,n}(q)\}_{m,n=1}^{\infty} such that [m+n]_q = r'_n(q)[m]_q + s'_m(q)[n]_q + t'_{m,n}(q)[m]_q[n]_q for all m and n. This paper gives a complete classification of quadratic addition rules, and also considers sequences of polynomials \polf that satisfy the associated functional equation f_{m+n}(q)= r'_n(q)f_m(q) + s'_m(q)f_n(q) + t'_{m,n}f_m(q)f_n(q).
