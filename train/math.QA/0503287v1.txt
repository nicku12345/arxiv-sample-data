Assuming the existence of the perfect crystal bases of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules over simply-laced quantum affine algebras, we construct certain perfect crystals for twisted quantum affine algebras, and also provide compelling evidence that the constructed crystals are isomorphic to the conjectural crystal bases of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules over twisted quantum affine algebras.
