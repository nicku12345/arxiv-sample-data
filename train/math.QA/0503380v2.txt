We show that the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg map from the space of multivector fields on a graded manifold N (endowed with a Berezinian volume) to the cohomology of the algebra of multidifferential operators on N (as a subalgebra of the Hochschild complex of the algebra of smooth functions on N) is an isomorphism of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras. These results generalize to differential graded manifolds.
