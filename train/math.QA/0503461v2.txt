Associated to a finite graph X is its quantum automorphism group G(X). We prove a formula of type G(X*Y)=G(X)*_wG(Y), where *_w is a free wreath product. Then we discuss representation theory of free wreath products, with the conjectural formula \mu (G*_wH)=\mu (G)\boxtimes\mu (H), where \mu is the associated spectral measure. This is verified in two situations: one using free probability techniques, the other one using planar algebras.
