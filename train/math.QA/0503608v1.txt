We solve a functional version of the problem of twist quantization of a coboundary Lie bialgebra (g,r,Z). We derive from this the following results: (a) the formal Poisson manifolds g^* and G^* are isomorphic; (b) we construct a subalgebra of U(g^*), isomorphic to S(g^*)^g. When g can be quantized, we construct a deformation of the morphism S(g^*)^g subset U(g^*). When g is quasitriangular and nondegenerate, we compare our construction with Semenov-Tian-Shansky's construction of a commutative subalgebra of U(g^*). We also show that the canonical derivation of the function ring of G^* is Hamiltonian.
