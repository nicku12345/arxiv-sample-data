Let H be a Hopf algebra over a commutative ring k with unity and \sigma:H\otimes H\longrightarrow k be a cocycle on H. In this paper, we show that the Yetter-Drinfeld module category of the cocycle deformation Hopf algebra H^{\sigma} is equivalent to the Yetter-Drinfeld module category of H. As a result of the equivalence, the "quantum Brauer" group BQ(k,H) is isomorphic to BQ(k,H^{\sigma}). Moreover, the group \Gal(\HR) constructed in \cite{Z} is studied under a cocycle deformation.
