In this article we describe the Hall algebra H_X of an elliptic curve X defined over a finite field and show that the group SL(2,Z) of exact auto-equivalences of the derived category D^b(Coh(X)) acts on the Drinfeld double DH_X of H_X by algebra automorphisms. Next, we study a certain natural subalgebra U_X of DH_X for which we give a presentation by generators and relations. This algebra turns out to be a flat two-parameter deformation of the ring of diagonal invariants C[x_1^{\pm 1}, ..., y_1^{\pm 1},...]^{S_{\infty}}, i.e. the ring of symmetric Laurent polynomials in two sets of countably many variables under the simultaneous symmetric group action.
