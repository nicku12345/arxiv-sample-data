We obtain closed formulas, in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, for the canonical basis elements of the Fock space representation of U_v(\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}_e) which are labelled by partitions having 'locally small' e-quotients and arbitrary e-cores. We further show that, upon evaluation at v=1, this gives the corresponding decomposition numbers of the q-Schur algebras in characteristic l (where q is a primitive e-th root of unity if l \ne e and q=1 otherwise) whenever l is greater than the size of each constituent of the e-quotient.
