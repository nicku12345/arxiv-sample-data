We introduce the notion of Zwiebach invariants that generalize Gromov-Witten invariants and homotopical algebra structures. We outline the induction procedure that induces the structure of Zwiebach on the subbicomplex, that gives the structure of Gromov-Witten invariants on subbicomplex with zero diffferentials. We propose to treat Hodge dGBV with 1/12 axiom as the simplest set of Zwiebach invariants, and explicitely prove that it induces WDVV and Getzler equations in genera 0 and 1 respectively.
