We present explicit descriptions of the crystals \mathcal{B}(\infty) and \mathcal{B}(\lambda) over special linear Lie algebras in the language of \emph{extended Nakajima monomials}. There is a natural correspondence between the monomial description and Young tableau realization, which is another realization of crystals \mathcal{B}(\infty) and \mathcal{B}(\lambda).
