Each quantum superalgebra is a quasi-triangular Hopf superalgebra, so contains a \textit{universal R-matrix} in the tensor product algebra which satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. Applying the vector representation \pi, which acts on the vector module V, to one side of a universal R-matrix gives a Lax operator. In this paper a Lax operator is constructed for the C-type quantum superalgebras U_q[osp(2|n)]. This can in turn be used to find a solution to the Yang-Baxter equation acting on V \otimes V \otimes W where W is an arbitrary U_q[osp(2|n)] module. The case W=V is included here as an example.
