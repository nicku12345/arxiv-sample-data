In this paper, we study the quantum \mathfrak{sl}(n) representation category using the web space. Specially, we extend \mathfrak{sl}(n) web space for n\ge 4 as generalized Temperley-Lieb algebras. As an application of our study, we find that the HOMFLY polynomial P_n(q) specialized to a one variable polynomial can be computed by a linear expansion with respect to a presentation of the quantum representation category of \mathfrak{sl}(n). Moreover, we correct the false conjecture \cite{PS:superiod} given by Chbili, which addresses the relation between some link polynomials of a periodic link and its factor link such as Alexander polynomial (n = 0) and Jones polynomial (n = 2) and prove the corrected conjecture not only for HOMFLY polynomial but also for the colored HOMFLY polynomial specialized to a one variable polynomial.
