Let Q be a Dynkin quiver and \Pi the corresponding set of positive roots. For the preprojective algebra \Lambda associated to Q we produce a rigid \Lambda-module I_Q with r=|\Pi| pairwise non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands by pushing the injective modules of the Auslander algebra of kQ to \Lambda.   If N is a maximal unipotent subgroup of a complex simply connected simple Lie group of type |Q|, then the coordinate ring C[N] is an upper cluster algebra. We show that the elements of the dual semicanonical basis which correspond to the indecomposable direct summands of I_Q coincide with certain generalized minors which form an initial cluster for C[N], and that the corresponding exchange matrix of this cluster can be read from the Gabriel quiver of End_{\Lambda}(I_Q).   Finally, we exploit the fact that the categories of injective modules over \Lambda and over its covering \tilde{\Lambda} are triangulated in order to show several interesting identities in the respective stable module categories.
