Let (g,\delta_\hbar) be a Lie bialgebra. Let (U_\hbar(g),\Delta_\hbar) a quantization of (g,\delta_\hbar) through Etingof-Kazhdan functor. We prove the existence of a L_\infty-morphism between the Lie algebra C(\g)=\Lambda(g) and the tensor algebra TU=T(U_\hbar(g)[-1]) with Lie algebra structure given by the Gerstenhaber bracket. When (g,\delta_\hbar,r) is a coboundary Lie bialgebra, we deduce from the formality morphism the existence of a quantization R of r.
