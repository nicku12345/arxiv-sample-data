For any commutative algebra R the shuffle product on the tensor module T(R) can be deformed to a new product. It is called the quasi-shuffle algebra, or stuffle algebra, and denoted T^q(R). We show that if R is the polynomial algebra, then T^q(R) is free for some algebraic structure called Commutative TriDendriform (CTD-algebras). This result is part of a structure theorem for CTD-bialgebras which are associative as coalgebras and whose primitive part is commutative. In other words, there is a good triple of operads (As, CTD, Com) analogous to (Com, As, Lie).
