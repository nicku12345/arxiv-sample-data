Let G be a connected Lie group, with Lie algebra g. In 1977, Duflo constructed a homomorphism of g-modules Duf: S(g) -> U(g), which restricts to an algebra isomorphism on invariants. Kashiwara and Vergne (1978) proposed a conjecture on the Campbell-Hausdorff series, which (among other things) extends the Duflo theorem to germs of bi-invariant distributions on the Lie group G.   The main results of the present paper are as follows. (1) Using a recent result of Torossian (2002), we establish the Kashiwara-Vergne conjecture for any Lie group G. (2) We give a reformulation of the Kashiwara-Vergne property in terms of Lie algebra cohomology. As a direct corollary, one obtains the algebra isomorphism H(g,S(g)) -> H(g,U(g)), as well as a more general statement for distributions.
