We prove that non-coisotropic branes in the Poisson-Sigma model are allowed at the quantum level. When the brane is defined by second-class constraints, the perturbative quantization of the model yields the Kontsevich's star product associated to the Dirac bracket on the brane. We also discuss the quantization when both first and second-class constraints are present.
