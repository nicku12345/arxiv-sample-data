The space of smotth functions and vector fields on \R^d is a Lie subalgebra of the (graded) Lie algebra T\_{poly}(\R^d), equipped with the Scouten bracket. In this paper, we compute the cohomology of this subalgebra for the adjoint representation in T\_{poly}(\R^d), restricting ourselves to the case of cochains defined with purely aerial Kontsevich's graphs, as in [AGM]. We find results which are very similar to the classical Gelfand-Fuchs and de Wilde-Lecomte one.
