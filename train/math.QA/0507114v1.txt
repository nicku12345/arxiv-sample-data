We present a uniform construction of level 1 perfect crystals \mathcal B for all affine Lie algebras. We also introduce the notion of a crystal algebra and give an explicit description of its multiplication. This allows us to determine the energy function on \mathcal B \otimes \mathcal B completely and thereby give a path realization of the basic representations at q=0 in the homogeneous picture.
