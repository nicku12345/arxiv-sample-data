To every morphism \chi\colon L\to M of differential graded Lie algebras we associate a functors of artin rings \Def_\chi whose tangent and obstruction spaces are respectively the first and second cohomology group of the cylinder of \chi. Such construction applies to Hilbert and Brill-Noether functors and allow to prove with ease that every higher obstruction to deforming a smooth submanifold of a Kaehler manifold is annihilated by the semiregularity map.
