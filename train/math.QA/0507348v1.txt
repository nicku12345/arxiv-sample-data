We generalize the results of [KMST] concerning equivariant quantization by means of Verma modules M(\lambda) for generic weight \lambda to the case of general \lambda. We consider the relationship between the Shapovalov form on an irreducible highest weight module of a semisimple complex Lie algebra, fusion elements, and equivariant quantization. We also discuss some limiting properties of fusion elements.   [KMST] E. Karolinsky and A. Stolin, Dynamical Yang-Baxter equations, quasi-Poisson homogeneous spaces, and quantization, Lett. Math.
