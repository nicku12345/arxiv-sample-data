In this article we study and obtain a classification of Ising vectors in vertex operator algebras associated to binary codes and \sqrt{2} times root lattices, where an Ising vector is a conformal vector with central charge 1/2 generating a simple Virasoro sub VOA. Then we apply our results to study certain commutant subalgebras related to root systems. We completely classify all Ising vectors in such commutant subalgebras and determine their full automorphism groups.
