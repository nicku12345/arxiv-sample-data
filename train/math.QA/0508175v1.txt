We study the subalgebra of the lattice vertex operator algebra V_{\sqrt{2}A_2} consisting of the fixed points of an automorphism which is induced from an order 3 isometry of the root lattice A_2. We classify the simple modules for the subalgebra. The rationality and the C_2-cofiniteness are also established.
