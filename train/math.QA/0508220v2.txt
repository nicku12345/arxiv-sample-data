We construct a Topological Quantum Field Theory (in the sense of Atiyah) associated to the universal finite-type invariant of 3-dimensional manifolds, as a functor from the category of 3-dimensional manifolds with parametrized boundary, satisfying some additional conditions, to an algebraic-combinatorial category. It is built together with its truncations with respect to a natural grading, and we prove that these TQFTs are non-degenerate and anomaly-free. The TQFT(s) induce(s) a (series of) representation(s) of a subgroup {\cal L}_g of the Mapping Class Group that contains the Torelli group. The N=1 truncation produces a TQFT for the Casson-Walker-Lescop invariant.
