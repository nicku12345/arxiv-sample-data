Let K denote an algebraically closed field with characteristic 0, and let q denote a nonzero scalar in K that is not a root of unity. Let A_q denote the unital associative K-algebra defined by generators x,y and relations x^3y-[3]_q x^2yx +[3]_q xyx^2 -yx^3=0, y^3x-[3]_q y^2xy +[3]_q yxy^2 -xy^3=0, where [3]_q = (q^3-q^{-3})/(q-q^{-1}). We classify up to isomorphism the finite-dimensional irreducible A_q-modules on which neither of x,y is nilpotent. We discuss how these modules are related to tridiagonal pairs.
