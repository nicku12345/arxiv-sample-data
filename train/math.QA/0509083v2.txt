Any finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H is Frobenius and the stable category of H-modules is triangulated monoidal. To H-comodule algebras we assign triangulated module-categories over the stable category of H-modules. These module-categories are generalizations of homotopy and derived categories of modules over a differential graded algebra. We expect that, for suitable H, our construction could be a starting point in the program of categorifying quantum invariants of 3-manifolds.
