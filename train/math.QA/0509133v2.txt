This paper is the first of a sequence papers ([Z4]--[Z7]) on the {\it {\mathcal N}CS (\text{noncommutative symmetric}) systems} over differential operator algebras in commutative or noncommutative variables ([Z4]); the {\mathcal N}CS systems over the Grossman-Larson Hopf algebras ([GL],[F]) of labeled rooted trees ([Z6]); as well as their connections and applications to the inversion problem ([BCW],[E4]) and specializations of NCSFs ([Z5],[Z7]). In this paper, inspired by the seminal work [GKLLRT] on NCSFs (noncommutative symmetric functions), we first formulate the notion {\it {\mathcal N}CS systems} over associative \mathbb Q-algebras. We then prove some results for {\mathcal N}CS systems in general; the {\mathcal N}CS systems over bialgebras or Hopf algebras; and the universal {\mathcal N}CS system formed by the generating functions of certain NCSFs in [GKLLRT]. Finally, we review some of the main results that will be proved in the followed papers [Z4], [Z6] and [Z7] as some supporting examples for the general discussions given in this paper.
