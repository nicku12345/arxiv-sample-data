Let K be any unital commutative \mathbb Q-algebra and z=(z_1, ..., z_n) commutative or noncommutative free variables. Let t be a formal parameter which commutes with z and elements of K. We denote uniformly by \kzz and \kttzz the formal power series algebras of z over K and K[[t]], respectively. For any \alpha \geq 1, let \cDazz be the unital algebra generated by the differential operators of \kzz which increase the degree in z by at least \alpha-1 and  \ataz  the group of automorphisms F_t(z)=z-H_t(z) of \kttzz with o(H_t(z))\geq \alpha and H_{t=0}(z)=0. First, for any fixed \alpha \geq 1 and F_t\in \ataz, we introduce five sequences of differential operators of \kzz and show that their generating functions form a \mathcal NCS (noncommutative symmetric) system [Z4] over the differential algebra \cDazz. Consequently, by the universal property of the \mathcal NCS system formed by the generating functions of certain NCSFs (noncommutative symmetric functions) first introduced in [GKLLRT], we obtain a family of Hopf algebra homomorphisms \cS_{F_t}: {\mathcal N}Sym \to \cDazz (F_t\in \ataz), which are also grading-preserving when F_t satisfies certain conditions. Note that, the homomorphisms \cS_{F_t} above can also be viewed as specializations of NCSFs by the differential operators of \kzz. Secondly, we show that, in both commutative and noncommutative cases, this family \cS_{F_t} (with all n\geq 1 and F_t\in \ataz) of differential operator specializations can distinguish any two different NCSFs. Some connections of the results above with the quasi-symmetric functions ([Ge], [MR], [S]) are also discussed.
