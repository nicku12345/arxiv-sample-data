Let K be any unital commutative \bQ-algebra and W any non-empty subset of \bN^+. Let z=(z_1, ..., z_n) be commutative or noncommutative free variables and t a formal central parameter. % Denote uniformly by \kzz and \kttzz the formal power series algebras % of z over K and K[[t]], respectively. Let \cDazz (\alpha\geq 1) be the unital algebra generated by the differential operators of \kzz which increase the degree in z by at least \alpha-1 and  \ataz  the group of automorphisms F_t(z)=z-H_t(z) of \kttzz with o(H_t(z))\geq \alpha and H_{t=0}(z)=0. First, we study a connection of the \cNcs systems \Omega_{F_t} (F_t\in \ataz) (\cite{GTS-I}, \cite{GTS-II}) over the differential operators algebra \cDazz and the \cNcs system \Omega_\bT^W (\cite{GTS-IV}) over the Grossman-Larson Hopf algebra \cH_{GL}^W (\cite{GL}, \cite{F1}, \cite{F2}) of W-labeled rooted trees. We construct a Hopf algebra homomorphism \mathcal A_{F_t}: \cH_{GL}^W \to \cDazz (F_t\in \ataz) such that \mathcal A_{F_t}^{\times 5}(\Omega_\bT^W) =\Omega_{F_t}. Secondly, we generalize the tree expansion formulas for the inverse map (\cite{BCW}, \cite{Wr3}), the D-Log and the formal flow (\cite{WZ}) of F_t in the commutative case to the noncommutative case. Thirdly, we prove the injectivity of the specialization \cT:{\mathcal N}Sym \to \cH_{GL}^{\bN^+} (\cite{GTS-IV}) of NCSF's (noncommutative symmetric functions) (\cite{G-T}). Finally, we show the family of the specializations \cS_{F_t} of NCSF's with all n\geq 1 and the polynomial automorphisms F_t=z-H_t(z) with H_t(z) homogeneous and the Jacobian matrix JH_t strictly lower triangular can distinguish any two different NCSF's. The graded dualized versions of the main results above are also discussed.
