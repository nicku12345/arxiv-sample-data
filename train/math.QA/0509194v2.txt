A new fermionic formula for the unrestricted Kostka polynomials of type A_{n-1}^{(1)} is presented. This formula is different from the one given by Hatayama et al. and is valid for all crystal paths based on Kirillov-Reshetihkin modules, not just for the symmetric and anti-symmetric case. The fermionic formula can be interpreted in terms of a new set of unrestricted rigged configurations. For the proof a statistics preserving bijection from this new set of unrestricted rigged configurations to the set of unrestricted crystal paths is given which generalizes a bijection of Kirillov and Reshetikhin.
