We show that the category O for a rational Cherednik algebra of type A is equivalent to modules over a q-Schur algebra (parameter not a half integer), providing thus character formulas for simple modules. We give some generalization to B_n(d). We prove an ``abstract'' translation principle. These results follow from the unicity of certain highest categories covering Hecke algebras. We also provide a semi-simplicity criterion for Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups.
