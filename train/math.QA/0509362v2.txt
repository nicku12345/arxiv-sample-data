We develop some applications of certain algebraic and combinatorial conditions on the elements of Coxeter groups, such as elementary proofs of the positivity of certain structure constants for the associated Kazhdan--Lusztig basis. We also explore some consequences of the existence of a Jones-type trace on the Hecke algebra of a Coxeter group, such as simple procedures for computing leading terms of certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials.   The sequel to this paper is math.QA/0509363.
