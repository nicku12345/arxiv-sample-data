We define ``star reducible'' Coxeter groups to be those Coxeter groups for which every fully commutative element (in the sense of Stembridge) is equivalent to a product of commuting generators by a sequence of length-decreasing star operations (in the sense of Lusztig). We show that the Kazhdan--Lusztig bases of these groups have a nice projection property to the Temperley--Lieb type quotient, and furthermore that the images of the basis elements C'_w (for fully commutative w) in the quotient have structure constants in {\Bbb Z}^{\geq 0}[v, v^{-1}]. We also classify the star reducible Coxeter groups and show that they form nine infinite families (types A_n, B_n, D_n, E_n, F_n, H_n, affine A_{n-1} for n odd, affine C_{n-1} for n even, and the case where the Coxeter graph is complete), with two exceptional cases (of ranks 6 and 7).   This paper is the sequel to math.QA/0509362.
