Given a unital associatve graded algebra we construct the graded q-differential algebra by means of a graded q-commutator, where q is a primitive N-th root of unity. The N-th power (N>1) of the differential of this graded q-differential algebra is equal to zero. We use our approach to construct the graded q-differential algebra in the case of a reduced quantum plane which can be endowed with a structure of a graded algebra. We consider the differential d satisfying d to power N equals zero as an analog of an exterior differential and study the first order differential calculus induced by this differential.
