A string basis is constructed for each subalgebra of invariants of the function algebra on the quantum special linear group. By analyzing the string basis for a particular subalgebra of invariants, we obtain a ``canonical basis'' for every finite dimensional irreducible U_q({\mathfrak{sl}}(n))-module. It is also shown that the algebra of functions on any quantum homogeneous space is generated by quantum minors.
