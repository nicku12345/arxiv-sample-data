Quantum deformations of sets of points of the real and the complexified projective line are constructed. These deformations depend on the deformation parameter q and certain further parameters \lambda_{ij}. The deformations for which the subspace of polynomials of degree three has a basis of ordered monomials are selected. We show that the corresponding algebras of three points have "polynomiality". Invariant elements which turn out to be cross ratios in the classical limit are defined. For the special case |\lambda_{ij}| = 1 a quantum cross ratio with properties similar to the classical case is presented. As an application a quantum version of the real Euclidean distance is given.
