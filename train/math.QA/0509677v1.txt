We use the theory of the quantum group U_q(gl(2,\RR)) in order to develop a quantum theory of invariants and show a decomposition of invariants into a Gordan-Capelli series. Higher binary forms are introduced on the basis of braided algebras. We define quantised invariants and give basic examples. We show that the symbolic method of Clebsch and Gordan works also in the quantised case. We discuss the deformed discriminant of the quadratic and the cubic form, the deformed invariants I_1, I_2 of the quartic form and further invariants without a classical analog.
