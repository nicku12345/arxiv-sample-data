Chekhov, Fock and Kashaev introduced a quantization of the Teichm\"{u}ller space \mathcal{T}^q(S) of a punctured surface S, and an exponential version of this construction was developed by Bonahon and Liu. The construction of the quantum Teichm\"{u}ller space crucially depends on certain coordinate change isomorphisms between the Chekhov-Fock algebras associated to different ideal triangulations of S. We show that these coordinate change isomorphisms are essentially unique, once we require them to satisfy a certain number of natural conditions.
