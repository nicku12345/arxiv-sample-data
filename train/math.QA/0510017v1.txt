Let \lambda = \sum_{i \in I_{0}} m_{i} \varpi_{i}, with m_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} for i \in I_{0}, be a level-zero dominant integral weight for an affine Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} over \mathbb{Q}, where the \varpi_{i}, i \in I_{0}, are the level-zero fundamental weights, and let \mathbb{B}(\lambda) be the crystal of all Lakshmibai-Seshadri paths of shape \lambda.   First, we give an explicit description of the decomposition of the crystal \mathbb{B}(\lambda) into a disjoint union of connected components, and show that all the connected components are pairwise ``isomorphic'' (up to a shift of weights).   Second, we ``realize'' the connected component \mathbb{B}_{0}(\lambda) of \mathbb{B}(\lambda) containing the straight line \pi_{\lambda} as a specified subcrystal of the affinization \hat{\mathbb{B}(\lambda)_{\mathrm{cl}}} (with weight lattice P) of the crystal \mathbb{B}(\lambda)_{\mathrm{cl}} \simeq \bigotimes_{i \in I_{0}} \bigl(\mathbb{B}(\varpi_{i})_{\mathrm{cl}} \bigr)^{\otimes m_{i}} (with weight lattice P_{\mathrm{cl}} = P/(\mathbb{Q}\delta \cap P), where \delta is the null root of \mathfrak{g}), which was studied in a previous paper.
