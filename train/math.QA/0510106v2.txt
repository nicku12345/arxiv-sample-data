A Fock space is introduced that admits an action of a quantum group of type A supplemented with some extra operators. The canonical and dual canonical basis of the Fock space are computed and then used to derive the finite-dimenisonal tilting and irreducible characters for the Lie superalgebra osp(2|2n). We also determine all the composition factors of the symmetric tensors of the natural osp(2|2n)-module.
