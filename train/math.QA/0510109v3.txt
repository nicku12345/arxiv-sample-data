The quantum duality principle (QDP) for homogeneous spaces gives four recipes to obtain, from a quantum homogeneous space, a dual one, in the sense of Poisson duality. One of these recipes fails (for lack of the initial ingredient) when the homogeneous space we start from is not a quasi-affine variety. In this work we solve this problem for the quantum Grassmannian, a key example of quantum projective homogeneous space, providing a suitable analogue of the QDP recipe.
