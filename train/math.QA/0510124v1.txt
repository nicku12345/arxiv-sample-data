We investigate the finite-dimensional representation theory of two-parameter quantum orthogonal and symplectic groups that we found in [BGH] under the assumption that rs^{-1} is not a root of unity and extend some results [BW1, BW2] obtained for type A to types B, C and D. We construct the corresponding R-matrices and the quantum Casimir operators, by which we prove that the complete reducibility Theorem also holds for the categories of finite-dimensional weight modules for types B, C, D.
