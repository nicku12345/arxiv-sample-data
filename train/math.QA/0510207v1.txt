In this paper, we consider the versal deformations of three dimensional Lie algebras. We classify Lie algebras and study their deformations by using linear algebra techniques to study the cohomology. We will focus on how the deformations glue the space of all such structures together. This space is known as the moduli space. We will give a geometric description of this space, derived from deformation theory, in order to illustrate general features of moduli spaces of Lie algebras.
