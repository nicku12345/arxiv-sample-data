G_\infty-structure is shown to exist on the deformation complex of a morphism of associative algebras. The main step of the construction is extension of a B_\infty-algebra by an associative algebra. Actions of B_\infty-algebras on associative and B_\infty-algebras are analyzed, extensions of B_\infty-algebras by associative and B_\infty-algebras, that they act upon, are constructed. The resulting G_\infty-algebra on the deformation complex of a morphism is shown to be quasi-isomorphic to the G_\infty-algebra on deformation complex of the corresponding diagram algebra.
