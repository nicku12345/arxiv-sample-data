The dual basis of the canonical basis of the modified quantized enveloping algebra is studied, in particular for type A. The construction of a basis for the coordinate algebra of the n\times n quantum matrices is appropriate for the study the multiplicative property. It is shown that this basis is invariant under multiplication by certain quantum minors including the quantum determinant. Then a basis of quantum SL(n) is obtained by setting the quantum determinant to one. This basis turns out to be equivalent to the dual canonical basis.
