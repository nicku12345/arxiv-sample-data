Let V = < p_{ij}(x)e^{\la_ix}, i=1,...,n, j=1, ..., N_i > be a space of quasi-polynomials of dimension N=N_1+...+N_n. Define the regularized fundamental operator of V as the polynomial differential operator D = \sum_{i=0}^N A_{N-i}(x)\p^i annihilating V and such that its leading coefficient A_0 is a polynomial of the minimal possible degree. We construct a space of quasi-polynomials U = < q_{ab}(u)e^{z_au} > whose regularized fundamental operator is the differential operator \sum_{i=0}^N u^i A_{N-i}(\partial_u). The space U is constructed from V by a suitable integral transform. Our integral transform corresponds to the bispectral involution on the space of rational solutions (vanishing at infinity) to the KP hierarchy, see \cite{W}.   As a corollary of the properties of the integral transform we obtain a correspondence between critical points of the two master functions associated with the (\glN,\glM) dual Gaudin models as well as between the corresponding Bethe vectors.
