In this paper we will prove a super-analogue of a well-known result by Kontsevich which states that the homology of a certain complex which is generated by isomorphism classes of oriented graphs can be calculated as the Lie algebra homology of an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of symplectic vector fields.
