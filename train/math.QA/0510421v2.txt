We introduce a notion of "hopfish algebra" structure on an associative algebra, allowing the structure morphisms (coproduct, counit, antipode) to be bimodules rather than algebra homomorphisms. We prove that quasi-Hopf algebras are examples of hopfish algebras. We find that a hopfish structure on the commutative algebra of functions on a finite set G is closely related to a "hypergroupoid" structure on G. The Morita theory of hopfish algebras is also discussed.
