Let C be an arrangement of affine hyperplanes in a complex affine space X, D the ring of algebraic differential operators on X. We define a category of quivers associated with C. A quiver is a collection of vector spaces, attached to strata of the arrangement, and suitable linear maps between the vector spaces . To a quiver we assign a D-module on X, called the quiver D-module. We describe basic operations for D-modules in terms of linear algebra of quivers. We give an explicit construction of a free resolution of a quive D-module and use the construction to describe the associated perverse sheaf. As an application, we calculate the cohomology of X with coefficients in the quiver perverse sheaf (under certain assumptions).
