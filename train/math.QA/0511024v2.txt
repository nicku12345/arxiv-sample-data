We construct Baxter operators as generalized transfer matrices being traces of products of generic R matrices. The latter are shown to factorize into simpler operators allowing for explicit expressions in terms of functions of a Weyl pair of basic operators. These explicit expressions are the basis for explicit expression for Baxter Q-operators and for investigating their properties.
