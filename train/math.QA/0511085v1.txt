In this paper we are interested in examples of locally compact quantum groups (M,\Delta) such that both von Neumann algebras, M and the dual \hat{M}, are factors. There is a lot of known examples such that (M,\hat{M}) are respectively of type (\rm{I}\_{\infty},\rm{I}\_{\infty}) but there is no examples with factors of other types. We construct new examples of type (\rm{I}\_{\infty},\rm{II}\_{\infty}), (\rm{II}\_{\infty},\rm{II}\_{\infty}) and (\rm{III}\_{\lambda},\rm{III}\_{\lambda}) for each \lambda\in [0,1]. Also we show that there is no such example with M or \hat{M} a finite factor.
