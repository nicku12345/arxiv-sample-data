For r\in \Z_{\geq 0}, we present a linear differential operator %(\di)^{r+1}+ a_1(x)(\di)^{r}+...+a_{r+1}(x) of order r+1 with rational coefficients and depending on parameters. This operator annihilates the r-multiple Jacobi-Pi\~neiro polynomial. For integer values of parameters satisfying suitable inequalities, it is the unique Fuchsian operator with kernel consisting of polynomials only and having three singular points at x=0, 1, \infty with arbitrary non-negative integer exponents 0, m_1+1, >..., m_1+...+m_r+r at x=0, special exponents 0, k+1, k+2,..., k+r at x=1 and arbitrary exponents at x=\infty.
