Let q be a nonzero complex number that is not a root of unity. We give a criterion for (0) to be a primitive ideal of the algebra O_q(M_{m,n}) of quantum matrices. Next, we describe all height one primes of O_q(M_{m,n}); these two problems are actually interlinked since it turns out that (0) is a primitive ideal of O_q(M_{m,n}) whenever O_q(M_{m,n}) has only finitely many height one primes. Finally, we compute the automorphism group of O_q(M_{m,n}) in the case where m is not equal to n. In order to do this, we first study the action of this group on the prime spectrum of O_q(M_{m,n}). Then, by using the preferred basis of O_q(M_{m,n}) and PBW bases, we prove that the automorphism group of O_q(M_{m,n}) is isomorphic to the torus (C*)^{m+n-1} when m is not equal to n, and (m,n) is not equal to (1,3) and (3,1).
