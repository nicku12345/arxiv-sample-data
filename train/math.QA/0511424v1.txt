We classify open maximal subalgebras of all infinite-dimensional linearly compact simple Lie superalgebras. This is applied to the classification of infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebras of vector fields, acting transitively and primitively in a formal neighborhood of a point of a finite-dimensional supermanifold.
