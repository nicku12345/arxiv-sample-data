Using the corepresentation of the quantum group  SL_q(2) a general method for constructing noncommutative spaces covariant under its coaction is developed. The method allows us to treat the quantum plane and Podle\'s' quantum spheres in a unified way and to construct higher dimensional noncommutative spaces systematically. Furthermore, we extend the method to the quantum supergroup  OSp_q(1|2). In particular, a one-parameter family of covariant algebras, which may be interpreted as noncommutative superspheres, is constructed.
