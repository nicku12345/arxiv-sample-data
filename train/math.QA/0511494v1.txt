For any additive subgroup G of an arbitrary field F of characteristic zero, there corresponds a generalized Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra L[G]. Given a total order of G compatible with its group structure, and any h,h_I,c,c_I,c_{LI}\in F, a Verma module M(h,h_I,c,c_I,c_{LI}) over L[G] is defined. In the this note, the irreducibility of Verma modules M(h,h_I,c,c_I,c_{LI}) is completely determined.
