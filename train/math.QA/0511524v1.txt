We prove that an irreducible quasifinite module over the central extension of the Lie algebra of N\times N-matrix differential operators on the circle is either a highest or lowest weight module or else a module of the intermediate series. Furthermore, we give a complete classification of indecomposable uniformly bounded modules.
