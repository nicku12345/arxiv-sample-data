In a paper by Su and Zhao, the Lie algebra A[D]=A\otimes F[D] of Weyl type was defined and studied, where A is a commutative associative algebra with an identity element over a field F of arbitrary characteristic, and F[D] is the polynomial algebra of a commutative derivation subalgebra D of A. The 2-cocycles of a class of A[D] were determined by Su. In the present paper, we determine the 2-cocycles of a class of Lie superalgebras of Weyl type over a field F of characteristic 0.
