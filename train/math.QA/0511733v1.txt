For a field F of characteristic zero and an additive subgroup G of F, a Lie algebra B(G) of lock type is defined with basis \{L_{a,i},c|a \in G, i>-2\} and relations [L_{a,i},L_{b,j}]=((i+1)b-(j+1)a)L_{a+b,i+j}+a\d_{a,-b}\d_{i+j,-2}c, [c,L_{a,i}]=0. Given a total order \succ on G compatible with its group structure, and any \Lambda\in B(G)_0^*, a Verma B(G)-module M(\Lambda,\succ) is defined, and the irreducibility of M(\Lambda,\succ) is completely determined. Furthermore, it is proved that an irreducible highest weight B(Z)-module is quasifinite if and only if it is a proper quotient of a Verma module.
