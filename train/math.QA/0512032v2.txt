Homotopy Quantum Field Theories (HQFTs) were introduced by the second author to extend the ideas and methods of Topological Quantum Field Theories to closed d-manifolds endowed with extra structure in the form of homotopy classes of maps into a given `target' space, B. For d = 1, classifications of HQFTs in terms of algebraic structures are known when B is a K(G,1) and also when it is simply connected. Here we study general HQFTs with d = 1 and target a general 2-type, giving a common generalisation of the classifying algebraic structures for the two cases previously known. The algebraic models for 2-types that we use are crossed modules, \mathcal{C}, and we introduce a notion of formal \mathcal{C}-map, which extends the usual lattice-type constructions to this setting. This leads to a classification of `formal' 2-dimensional HQFTs with target \mathcal{C}, in terms of crossed \mathcal{C}-algebras.
