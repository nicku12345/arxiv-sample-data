Simplicial formal maps were introduced in the first paper, (math.QA/0512032), of this series as a tool for studying Homotopy Quantum Field Theories with background a general homotopy 2-type. Here we continue their study, showing how a natural generalisation can handle much more general backgrounds. The question of the geometric interpretation of these formal maps is partially answered in terms of combinatorial bundles. This suggests new interpretations of HQFTs.
