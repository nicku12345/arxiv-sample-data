A theory of monoids in the category of bicomodules of a coalgebra C or C-rings is developed. This can be viewed as a dual version of the coring theory. The notion of a matrix ring context consisting of two bicomodules and two maps is introduced and the corresponding example of a C-ring (termed a {\em matrix C-ring}) is constructed. It is shown that a matrix ring context can be associated to any bicomodule which is a one-sided quasi-finite injector. Based on this, the notion of a {\em Galois module} is introduced and the structure theorem, generalising Schneider's Theorem II [H.-J. Schneider, Israel J. Math., 72 (1990), 167--195], is proven. This is then applied to the C-ring associated to a weak entwining structure and a structure theorem for a weak A-Galois coextension is derived. The theory of matrix ring contexts for a firm coalgebra (or {\em infinite matrix ring contexts}) is outlined. A Galois connection associated to a matrix C-ring is constructed.
