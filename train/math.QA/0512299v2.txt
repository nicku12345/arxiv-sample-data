We prove the B. and M. Shapiro conjecture that says that if the Wronskian of a set of polynomials has real roots only, then the complex span of this set of polynomials has a basis consisting of polynomials with real coefficients. This in particular implies the following result:   If all ramification points of a parametrized rational curve    f : CP^1 \to CP^r  lie on a circle in the Riemann sphere  CP^1 , then f maps this circle into a suitable real subspace  RP^r \subset CP^r .   The proof is based on the Bethe ansatz method in the Gaudin model. The key observation is that a symmetric linear operator on a Euclidean space has a real spectrum.   In Appendix we discuss properties of differential operators associated with Bethe vectors in the Gaudin model and, in particular, prove a conditional statement: we deduce the transversality of certain Schubert cycles in a Grassmannian from the simplicity of the spectrum of the Gaudin Hamiltonians.
