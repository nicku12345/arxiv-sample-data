We study the moduli space of four dimensional ordinary Lie algebras, and their versal deformations. Their classification is well known; our focus in this paper is on the deformations, which yield a picture of how the moduli space is assembled. Surprisingly, we get a nice geometric description of this moduli space essentially as an orbifold, with just a few exceptional points.
