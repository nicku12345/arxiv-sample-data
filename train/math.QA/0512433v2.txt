We prove that the quantum SO(3)-invariant of an arbitrary 3-manifold M is always an algebraic integer, if the order of the quantum parameter is co-prime with the order of the torsion part of H_1(M,\BZ). An even stronger integrality, known as cyclotomic integrality, was established by Habiro for integral homology 3-spheres. Here we generalize Habiro's result to all rational homology 3-spheres.
