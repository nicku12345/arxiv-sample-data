Certain combinatorial bases of Feigin-Stoyanovsky's type subspaces of level k standard modules for affine Lie algebra sl(r,C)\sptilde are parametrized by (k,r)-admissible configurations. In this note we use Capparelli-Lepowsky-Milas' method to give a new proof of linear independence of these bases, the main ingredient in the proof being the use of Dong-Lepowsky's intertwining operators for fundamental sl(r,C)\sptilde-modules.
