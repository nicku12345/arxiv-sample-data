The problem of finding fermionic formulas for the many generalizations of Kostka polynomials and for the characters of conformal field theories has been a very exciting research topic for the last few decades. In this dissertation we present new fermionic formulas for the unrestricted Kostka polynomials extending the work of Kirillov and Reshetikhin. We also present new fermionic formulas for the characters of N=1 and N=2 superconformal algebras which extend the work of Berkovich, McCoy and Schilling.   Fermionic formulas for the unrestricted Kostka polynomials of type A_{n-1}^{(1)} in the case of symmetric and anti-symmetric crystal paths were given by Hatayama et al. We present new fermionic formulas for the unrestricted Kostka polynomials of type A_{n-1}^{(1)} for all crystal paths based on Kirillov-Reshetihkin modules. We interpret the fermionic formulas in terms of a new set of unrestricted rigged configurations.   Fermionic formulas for the N=1 and N=2 superconformal algebras are derived using the Bailey lemma by establishing new Bailey flows from the nonunitary minimal models to the superconformal models.
