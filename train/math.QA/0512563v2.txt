Let {U}_q(sl_2) be the quantized enveloping algebra associated to the simple Lie algebra sl_2. In this paper, we study the quantum double D_q of the Borel subalgebra {U}_q((sl_2)^{\leq 0}) of {U}_q(sl_2). We construct an analogue of Kostant--Lusztig {Z}[v,v^{-1}]-form for D_q and show that it is a Hopf subalgebra. We prove that, over an algebraically closed field, every simple D_q-module is the pullback of a simple {U}_q(sl_2)-module through certain surjection from D_q onto {U}_q(sl_2), and the category of finite dimensional weight D_q-modules is equivalent to a direct sum of |k^{\times}| copies of the category of finite dimensional weight {U}_q(sl_2)-modules. As an application, we recover (in a conceptual way) Chen's results as well as Radford's results on the quantum double of Taft algebra. Our main results allow a direct generalization to the quantum double of the Borel subalgebra of the quantized enveloping algebra associated to arbitrary Cartan matrix.
