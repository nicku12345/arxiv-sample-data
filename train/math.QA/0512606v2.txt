To every k-dimensional modular invariant vector space we associate a modular form on SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) of weight 2k. We explore number theoretic properties of this form and find a sufficient condition for its vanishing which yields modular identities (e.g., Ramanujan-Watson's modular identities). Furthermore, we focus on a family of modular invariant spaces coming from suitable two-dimensional spaces via the symmetric power construction. In particular, we consider a two-dimensional space spanned by graded dimensions of certain level one modules for the affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra of type D_4^{(1)}. In this case, the reduction modulo prime p=2k+3 \geq 5 of the modular form associated to the k-th symmetric power classifies supersingular elliptic curves in characteristic p. This construction also gives a new interpretation of certain modular forms studied by Kaneko and Zagier.
