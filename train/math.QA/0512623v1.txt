For positive integers 1\leq i\leq k, we consider the arithmetic properties of quotients of Wronskians in certain normalizations of the Andrews-Gordon q-series  \prod_{1\leq n\not \equiv 0,\pm i\pmod{2k+1}}\frac{1}{1-q^n}.  This study is motivated by their appearance in conformal field theory, where these series are essentially the irreducible characters of (2,2k+1) Virasoro minimal models. We determine the vanishing of such Wronskians, a result whose proof reveals many partition identities. For example, if P_{b}(a;n) denotes the number of partitions of n into parts which are not congruent to 0, \pm a\pmod b, then for every positive integer n we have  P_{27}(12; n)=P_{27}(6;n-1) + P_{27}(3;n-2).  We also show that these quotients classify supersingular elliptic curves in characteristic p. More precisely, if 2k+1=p, where p\geq 5 is prime, and the quotient is non-zero, then it is essentially the locus of characteristic p supersingular j-invariants in characteristic p.
