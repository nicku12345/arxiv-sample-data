This paper is motivated by a general question: for which values of k and n is the universal Burnside kei of k generators and Kei "exponent" n, \bar Q(k,n), finite? It is known (starting from the work of M. Takasaki (1942)) that \bar Q(2,n) is isomorphic to the dihedral quandle Z_n and \bar Q(3,3) is isomorphic to Z_3 + Z_3. In this paper we give descriptions of \bar Q(4,3) and \bar Q(3,4). We also investigate some properties of arbitrary quandles satisfying the universal Burnside relation (of "exponent" n) a=...a*b*...*a*b. In particular, we prove that the order of a finite commutative kei is a power of 3. Invariants of links related to Burnside kei \bar Q(k,n) are invariant under n-moves.
