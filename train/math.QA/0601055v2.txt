We discuss the differential graded Lie algebra (DGLA) of Drinfeld modeled on the tensor algebra of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra g over any field K of characteristic zero. We explicitly analyze the first obstruction to the existence of the formality quasi-isomorphism for this DGLA. Our analysis implies the formality of the DGLA of Drinfeld associated to the two-dimensional Borel algebra b.
