Let G be a complex symplectic group. We introduce a G x (C ^x) ^{l + 1}-variety N_{l}, which we call the l-exotic nilpotent cone. Then, we realize the Hecke algebra H of type C_n ^(1) with three parameters via equivariant algebraic K-theory in terms of the geometry of N_2. This enables us to establish a Deligne-Langlands type classification of "non-critical" simple H-modules. As applications, we present a character formula and multiplicity formulas of H-modules.
