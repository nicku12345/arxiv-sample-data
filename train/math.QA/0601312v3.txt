We show that the mapping cone of a morphism of differential graded Lie algebras \chi\colon L\to M can be canonically endowed with an L_\infty-algebra structure which at the same time lifts the Lie algebra structure on L and the usual differential on the mapping cone. Moreover, this structure is unique up to isomorphisms of L_\infty-algebras. The associated deformation functor coincides with the one introduced by the second author in arXiv:math.AG/0507287.
