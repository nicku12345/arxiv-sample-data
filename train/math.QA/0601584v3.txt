Our starting point is a class of braid matrices, presented in a previous paper, constructed on a basis of a nested sequence of projectors. Statistical models associated to such N^2\times N^2 matrices for odd N are studied here. Presence of \frac 12(N+3)(N-1) free parameters is the crucial feature of our models, setting them apart from other well-known ones. There are N possible states at each site. The trace of the transfer matrix is shown to depend on \frac 12(N-1) parameters. For order r, N eigenvalues consitute the trace and the remaining (N^r-N) eigenvalues involving the full range of parameters come in zero-sum multiplets formed by the r-th roots of unity, or lower dimensional multiplets corresponding to factors of the order r when r is not a prime number. The modulus of any eigenvalue is of the form e^{\mu\theta}, where \mu is a linear combination of the free parameters, \theta being the spectral parameter. For r a prime number an amusing relation of the number of multiplets with a theorem of Fermat is pointed out. Chain Hamiltonians and potentials corresponding to factorizable S-matrices are constructed starting from our braid matrices. Perspectives are discussed.
