Global constructions of quantization deformation and obstructions are discussed for an arbitrary complex analytic space in terms of adapted (analytic) Hochschild cohomology. For K3-surfaces an explicit global construction of a Poisson bracket is given. It is shown that the analytic Hochschild (co)homology on a complex space has structure of coherent analytic sheaf in each degree.
