We present a state sum construction of two-dimensional extended Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs), so-called open-closed TQFTs, which generalizes the state sum of Fukuma--Hosono--Kawai from triangulations of conventional two-dimensional cobordisms to those of open-closed cobordisms, i.e. smooth compact oriented 2-manifolds with corners that have a particular global structure. This construction reveals the topological interpretation of the associative algebra on which the state sum is based, as the vector space that the TQFT assigns to the unit interval. Extending the notion of a two-dimensional TQFT from cobordisms to suitable manifolds with corners therefore makes the relationship between the global description of the TQFT in terms of a functor into the category of vector spaces and the local description in terms of a state sum fully transparent. We also illustrate the state sum construction of an open-closed TQFT with a finite set of D-branes using the example of the groupoid algebra of a finite groupoid.
