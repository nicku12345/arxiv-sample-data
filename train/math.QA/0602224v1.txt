We give a description in terms of square matrices of the family of group-like algebras with S*id=id*S=u\epsilon. In the case that S=id and char\Bbbk is not 2 and does not divide the dimension of the algebra, this translation take us to Hadamard matrices and, particularly, to examples of biFrobenius algebras satisfying S*id=id*S=u\epsilon and that are not Hopf algebras. Finally, we generalize some known results on separability and coseparability valid for finite dimensional Hopf algebras to this special class of biFrobenius algebras with S*id=id*S=u\epsilon, presenting a version of Maschke's theorem for this family.
