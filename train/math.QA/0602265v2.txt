We construct the quantum s-tuple subfactors for an AFD II_1 subfactor with finite index and depth, for an arbitrary natural number s. This is a generalization of the quantum multiple subfactors by J.Erlijman and H.Wenzl, which generalizes the quantum double construction of a subfactor for the case that the original subfactor gives rise to a braided tensor category. In this paper we give a multiple construction for a subfactor with a weaker condition than braidedness of the bimodule system.
