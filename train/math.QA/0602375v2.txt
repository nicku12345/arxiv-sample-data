We argue that a customary q-difference equation for the continuous q-Hermite polynomials H_n(x|q) can be written in the factorized form as (D_q^2 - 1)H_n(x|q)=(q^{-n}-1)H_n(x|q), where D_q is some explicitly known q-difference operator. This means that the polynomials H_n(x|q) are in fact governed by the q-difference equation D_qH_n(x|q)=q^{-n/2}H_n(x|q), which is simpler than the conventional one.
