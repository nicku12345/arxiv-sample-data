Let K denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over K with finite positive dimension. We consider a pair of linear transformations A:V \to V and A^*:V \to V that satisfy (i), (ii) below:   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A^* is diagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A^* is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A is diagonal.   We call such a pair a {\em Leonard pair} on V. It is known that there exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is lower bidiagonal and the matrix representing A^* is upper bidiagonal. In this paper we give some formulae involving the matrix units associated with this basis.
