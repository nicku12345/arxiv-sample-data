We obtain a presentation of certain affine q-Schur algebras in terms of generators and relations. The presentation is obtained by adding more relations to the usual presentation of the quantized enveloping algebra of type affine gl_n. Our results extend and rely on the corresponding result for the q-Schur algebra of the symmetric group, which were proved by the first author and Giaquinto.
