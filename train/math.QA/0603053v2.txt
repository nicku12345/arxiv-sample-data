We present an introduction to the use of noncommutative geometry for gauge theories with emphasis on a construction of instantons for a class of four dimensional toric noncommutative manifolds. These instantons are solutions of self-duality equations and are critical points of an action functional. We explain the crucial role of twisted symmetries as well as methods from noncommutative index theorems.
