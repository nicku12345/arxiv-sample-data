We obtain a q-analog of the well known Wallach-Okounkov result on a joint spectrum of invariant differential operators with polynomial coefficients on a prehomogeneous vector space of complex n \times n-matrices. We are motivated by applications to the problems of harmonic analysis in the quantum matrix ball: our main theorem can be used while proving the Plancherel formula (to be published).   This paper is dedicated to our friend and colleague Dmitry Shklyarov who celebrates his 30-th birthday on April 8, 2006.
