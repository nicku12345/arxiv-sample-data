Let H be a Hopf algebra with bijective antipode over a field k and suppose that R{#}H is a bi-product. Then R is a bialgebra in the Yetter--Drinfel'd category {}_H^H{\mathcal YD}. We describe the bialgebras (R{#}H)^{op} and (R{#}H)^o explicitly as bi-products R^{\UOP}{#}H^{op} and R^{\UO}{#}H^o respectively where R^{\UOP} is a bialgebra in {}^{H^{op}}_{H^{op}}{\mathcal YD} and R^{\UO} is a bialgebra in {}^{H^o}_{H^o}{\mathcal YD}. We use our results to describe two-cocycle twist bialgebra structures on the tensor product of bi-products.
