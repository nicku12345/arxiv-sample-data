We parameterize the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of a class of pointed Hopf algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero by dominant characters. The Hopf algebras we are considering arise in the work of N. Andruskiewitsch and the second author. Special cases are the multiparameter deformations of the enveloping algebras of semisimple Lie algebras where the deforming parameters are not roots of unity and some of their finite-dimensional versions in the root of unity case.
