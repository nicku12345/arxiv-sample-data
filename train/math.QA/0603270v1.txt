Let U and A be algebras over a field k. We study algebra structures H on the underlying tensor product U{\otimes}A of vector spaces which satisfy (u{\otimes}a)(u'{\otimes}a') = uu'{\otimes}aa' if a = 1 or u' = 1. For a pair of characters \rho \in \Alg(U, k) and \chi \in \Alg(A, k) we define a left H-module L(\rho, \chi). Under reasonable hypotheses the correspondence (\rho, \chi) \mapsto L(\rho, \chi) determines a bijection between character pairs and the isomorphism classes of objects in a certain category {}_H\underline{\mathcal M} of left H-modules. In many cases the finite-dimensional objects of {}_H\underline{\mathcal M} are the finite-dimensional irreducible left H-modules. In math.QA/0603269 we apply the results of this paper and show that the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of a wide class of pointed Hopf algebras are parameterized by pairs of characters.
