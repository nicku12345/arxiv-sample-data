We define a rank variety for a module of a noncocommutative Hopf algebra A = \Lambda \rtimes G where \Lambda = k[X_1, ..., X_m]/(X_1^{\ell}, ..., X_m^{\ell}), G = ({\mathbb Z}/\ell{\mathbb Z})^m, and \text{char} k does not divide \ell, in terms of certain subalgebras of A playing the role of "cyclic shifted subgroups". We show that the rank variety of a finitely generated module M is homeomorphic to the support variety of M defined in terms of the action of the cohomology algebra of A. As an application we derive a theory of rank varieties for the algebra \Lambda. When \ell=2, rank varieties for \Lambda-modules were constructed by Erdmann and Holloway using the representation theory of the Clifford algebra. We show that the rank varieties we obtain for \Lambda-modules coincide with those of Erdmann and Holloway.
