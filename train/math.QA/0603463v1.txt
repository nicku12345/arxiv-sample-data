We construct a basis for the right quantum algebra introduced by Garoufalidis, Le and Zeilberger and give a method making it possible to go from an algebra submitted to commutation relations (without the variable q) to the right quantum algebra by means of an appropriate weight-function. As a consequence, a strong quantum MacMahon Master Theorem is derived. Besides, the algebra of biwords is systematically in use.
