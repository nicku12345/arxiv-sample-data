In this article, X will denote a {\cal C}^{\infty} manifold. In a very famous article, Kontsevich showed that the differential graded Lie algebra (DGLA) of polydifferential operators on X is formal. Calaque extended this theorem to any Lie algebroid. More precisely, given any Lie algebroid E over X, he defined the DGLA of E-polydifferential operators, \Gamma (X, ^{E}D^{*}_{poly}), and showed that it is formal. Denote by \Gamma (X, ^{E}T^{*}_{poly}) the DGLA of E-polyvector fields. Considering M, a module over E, we define \Gamma (X, ^{E}T_{poly}^{*}(M)) the \Gamma (X, ^{E}T^{*}_{poly})-module of E-polyvector fields with values in M. Similarly, we define the \Gamma (X, ^{E}D^{*}_{poly})-module of E-polydifferential operators with values in M, \Gamma (X, ^{E}D^{*}_{poly}(M)). We show that there is a quasi-isomorphism of L_{\infty}-modules over \Gamma (X, ^{E}T^{*}_{poly}) from \Gamma (X, ^{E}T^{*}_{poly}(M)) to \Gamma (X, ^{E}D^{*}_{poly}(M)). Our result extends Calaque 's (and Kontsevich's) result.
