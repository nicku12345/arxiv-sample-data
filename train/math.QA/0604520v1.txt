We introduce quasi-Hopf *-algebras i.e. quasi-Hopf algebras equipped with a conjugation (star) operation. The definition of quasi-Hopf *-algebras proposed ensures that the class of quasi-Hopf *-algebras is closed under twisting and additionally, that any Hopf *-algebra becomes a quasi-Hopf *-algebra via twisting. The basic properties of these algebras are developed. The relationship between the antipode and star structure is investigated. Quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf *-algebras are introduced and studied.
