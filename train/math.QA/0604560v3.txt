By using the Ringel-Hall algebra approach, we investigate the structure of the Lie algebra L(\Lambda) generated by indecomposable constructible sets in the varieties of modules for any finite dimensional \mathbb{C}-algebra \Lambda. We obtain a geometric realization of the universal enveloping algebra R(\Lambda) of L(\Lambda). This generalizes the main result of Riedtmann in \cite{R}. We also obtain Green's theorem in \cite{G} in a geometric form for any finite dimensional \mathbb{C}-algebra \Lambda and use it to give the comultiplication formula in R(\Lambda).
