We show how to use the Hopf algebra structure of quantum field theory to derive nonperturbative results for the short-distance singular sector of a renormalizable quantum field theory in a simple but generic example. We discuss renormalized Green functions G_R(\alpha,L) in such circumstances which depend on a single scale L=\ln q^2/\mu^2 and start from an expansion in the scale G_R(\alpha,L)=1+\sum_k \gamma_k(\alpha)L^k. We derive recursion relations between the \gamma_k which make full use of the renormalization group. We then show how to determine the Green function by the use of a Mellin transform on suitable integral kernels. We exhibit our approach in an example for which we find a functional equation relating weak and strong coupling expansions.
