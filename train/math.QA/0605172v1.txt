Let V = < x^{\lambda_i}p_{ij}(x), i=1,...,n, j=1, ..., N_i >  be a space of quasi-polynomials in x of dimension N=N_1+...+N_n. The regularized fundamental differential operator of V is the polynomial differential operator \sum_{i=0}^N A_{N-i}(x)(x \frac d {dx})^i annihilating V and such that its leading coefficient A_0 is a monic polynomial of the minimal possible degree. Let U = < z_a^{u} q_{ab}(u), a=1,...,m, b=1,..., M_a > be a space of quasi-exponentials in u of dimension M=M_1+...+M_m. The regularized fundamental difference operator of U is the polynomial difference operator \sum_{i=0}^M B_{M-i}(u)(\tau_u)^i annihilating U and such that its leading coefficient B_0 is a monic polynomial of the minimal possible degree. Here (\tau_uf)(u)=f(u+1).   Having a space V of quasi-polynomials with the regularized fundamental differential operator D, we construct a space of quasi-exponentials U = <z_a^{u}q_{ab}(u) > whose regularized fundamental difference operator is the difference operator \sum_{i=0}^N u^i A_{N-i}(\tau_u). The space U is constructed from V by a suitable integral transform. Similarly, having U we can recover V by a suitable integral transform. Our integral transforms are analogs of the bispectral involution on the space of rational solutions to the KP hierarchy \cite{W}.   As a corollary of the properties of the integral transforms we obtain a correspondence between solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations of two (gl_N, gl_M) dual quantum integrable models: one is the special trigonometric Gaudin model and the other is the special XXX model.
