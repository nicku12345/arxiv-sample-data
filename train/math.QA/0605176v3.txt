In this paper, we study the structure of a general framed vertex operator algebra. We show that the structure codes (C,D) of a framed VOA V satisfy certain duality conditions. As a consequence, we prove that every framed VOA is a simple current extension of the associated binary code VOA V_C. This result would give a prospect on the classification of framed vertex operator algebras. In addition, the pointwise frame stabilizer of V is studied. We completely determine all automorphisms in this pointwise stabilizer, which are of order 1, 2 or 4. The 4A-twisted sector and the 4A-twisted orbifold theory of the famous Moonshine VOA are also constructed explicitly. We verify that the top module of this twisted sector is of dimension 1 and of weight 3/4 and the VOA obtained by 4A-twisted orbifold construction of the moonshine VOA is isomorphic to the moonshine VOA itself.
