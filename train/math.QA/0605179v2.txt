The presentation of two-parameter quantum groups of type E-series in the sense of Benkart-Witherspoon [BW1] is given, which has a Drinfel'd quantum double structure. The universal R-matrix and a convex PBW-type basis are described for type E_6 (as a sample), and the conditions of those isomorphisms from these quantum groups into the one-parameter quantum doubles are discussed.
