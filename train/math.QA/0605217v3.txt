We extend Schur-Weyl duality to an arbitrary level l \geq 1, the case l=1 recovering the classical duality between the symmetric and general linear groups. In general, the symmetric group is replaced by the degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebra over \C parametrized by a dominant weight of level l for the root system of type A_\infty. As an application, we prove that the degenerate analogue of the quasi-hereditary cover of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra constructed by Dipper, James and Mathas is Morita equivalent to certain blocks of parabolic category \mathcal{O} for the general linear Lie algebra.
