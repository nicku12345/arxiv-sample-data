The solution of the Drinfeld equation corresponding to the full set of different carrier subalgebras in sl(3) are explicitly constructed. The obtained Hopf structures are studied. It is demonstrated that the presented twist deformations can be considered as limits of the corresponding quantum analogues (q-twists) defined for the q-quantized algebras.
