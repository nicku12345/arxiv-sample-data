We establish isomorphisms between certain specializations of Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras and the symmetric squares of Temperley-Lieb algebras. These isomorphisms imply a link-polynomial identity due to W. B. R. Lickorish. As an application, we compute the closed images of the irreducible braid group representations factoring over these specialized BMW algebras.
