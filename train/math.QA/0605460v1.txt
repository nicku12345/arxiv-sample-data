A Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand resolution for arbitrary Kac-Moody algebras and arbitrary subsets of the set of simple roots is proven. Moreover, quantum group analogs of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand resolution for symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras are established. For quantized enveloping algebras with fixed complex nonzero deformation parameter q exactness is proven for all q which are not a root of unity.
