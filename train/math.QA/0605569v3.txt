We consider N-complexes as functors over an appropriate linear category in order to show first that the Krull-Schmidt Theorem holds, then to prove that amplitude cohomology only vanishes on injective functors providing a well defined functor on the stable category. For left truncated N-complexes, we show that amplitude cohomology discriminates the isomorphism class up to a projective functor summand. Moreover amplitude cohomology of positive N-complexes is proved to be isomorphic to an Ext functor of an indecomposable N-complex inside the abelian functor category. Finally we show that for the monoidal structure of N-complexes a Clebsch-Gordan formula holds, in other words the fusion rules for N-complexes can be determined.
