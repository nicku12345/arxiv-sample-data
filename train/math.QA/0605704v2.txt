We compute the stable homology of necklace Lie algebras associated with quivers and give a construction of stable homology classes from certain A_\infty-categories. Our construction is a generalization of the construction of homology classes of moduli spaces of curves due to M. Kontsevich.   In the second part of the paper we produce a Moyal-type quantization of the symmetric algebra of a necklace Lie algebra. The resulting quantized algebra has natural representations in the usual Moyal quantization of polynomial algebras.
