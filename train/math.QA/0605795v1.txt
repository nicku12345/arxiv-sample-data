Arithmetic root systems are invariants of Nichols algebras of diagonal type with a certain finiteness property. They can also be considered as generalizations of ordinary root systems with rich structure and many new examples. On the other hand, Nichols algebras are fundamental objects in the construction of quantized enveloping algebras, in the noncommutative differential geometry of quantum groups, and in the classification of pointed Hopf algebras by the lifting method of Andruskiewitsch and Schneider. In the present paper arithmetic root systems are classified in full generality. As a byproduct many new finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebras are obtained.
