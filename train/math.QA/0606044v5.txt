Let \{B(\Lambda_m)|m\in\Z/e\Z\} be the set of level one \mathfrak{g}(A^{(1)}_{e-1})-crystals, and consider the realization of B(\Lambda_m) using e-restricted partitions. We prove a purely Young diagrammatic criterion for an element of B(\Lambda_0)^{\otimes d_1}\otimes B(\Lambda_m)^{\otimes d_2} to be in the component B(d_1\Lambda_0+d_2\Lambda_m). As an application, we give a non-recursive characterization of simple modules of the Hecke algebra of type B. In the course of the proof, we also obtain a combinatorial description of the second type of Kashiwara's Demazure crystal in B(\Lambda_m).
