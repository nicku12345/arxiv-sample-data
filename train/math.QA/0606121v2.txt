We prove an analogue of the Sylvester theorem for the generator matrices of the quantum affine algebra {\rm U}_q(\hat{\mathfrak{gl}}_n). We then use it to give an explicit realization of the skew representations of the quantum affine algebra. This allows one to identify them in a simple way by calculating their highest weight, Drinfeld polynomials and the Gelfand-Tsetlin character (or q-character). We also apply the quantum Sylvester theorem to construct a q-analogue of the Olshanski algebra as a projective limit of certain centralizers in {\rm U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n) and show that this limit algebra contains the q-Yangian as a subalgebra.
