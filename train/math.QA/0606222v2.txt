We derive explicit dimension formulas for irreducible M_F-spherical K_F-representations where K_F is the maximal compact subgroup of the general linear group GL(d,F) over a local field F and M_F is a closed subgroup of K_F such that K_F/M_F realizes the Grassmannian of n-dimensional F-subspaces of F^d. We explore the fact that (K_F,M_F) is a Gelfand pair whose associated zonal spherical functions identify with various degenerations of the multivariable little q-Jacobi polynomials. As a result, we are led to consider generalized dimensions defined in terms of evaluations and quadratic norms of multivariable little q-Jacobi polynomials, which interpolate between the various classical dimensions. The generalized dimensions themselves are shown to have representation theoretic interpretations as the quantum dimensions of irreducible spherical quantum representations associated to quantum complex Grassmannians.
