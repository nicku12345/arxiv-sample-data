As part of our study of the q-tetrahedron algebra \boxtimes_q we introduce the notion of a q-inverting pair. Roughly speaking, this is a pair of invertible semisimple linear transformations on a finite-dimensional vector space, each of which acts on the eigenspaces of the other according to a certain rule. Our main result is a bijection between the following two sets:   (i) the isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional irreducible \boxtimes_q-modules of type 1;   (ii) the isomorphism classes of q-inverting pairs.
