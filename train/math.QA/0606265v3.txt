We study the composition of the functor from the category of modules over the Lie algebra gl_m to the category of modules over the degenerate affine Hecke algebra of GL_N introduced by I. Cherednik, with the functor from the latter category to the category of modules over the Yangian Y(gl_n) due to V. Drinfeld. We propose a representation theoretic explanation of a link between the intertwining operators on the tensor products of Y(gl_n)-modules, and the `extremal cocycle' on the Weyl group of gl_m defined by D. Zhelobenko. We also establish a connection between the composition of two functors, and the `centralizer construction' of the Yangian Y(gl_n) discovered by G. Olshanski.
