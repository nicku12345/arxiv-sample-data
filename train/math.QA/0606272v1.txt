We study a composition of two functors. The first one, from the category of modules over the Lie algebra \gl_m to the category of modules over the degenerate affine Hecke algebra of GL_N, was introduced by I. Cherednik. The second functor is a skew version of the functor from the latter category to the category of modules over the Yangian \Y(\gl_n) due to V. Drinfeld. We give a representation theoretic explanation of a link between intertwining operators on tensor products of \Y(\gl_n)-modules, and the `extremal cocycle' on the Weyl group of \gl_m introduced by D. Zhelobenko. We establish a connection between the composition of two functors, and the `centralizer construction' of the Yangian \Y(\gl_n) discovered by G. Olshanski.
