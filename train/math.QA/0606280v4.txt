For the critical XXZ model, we consider the space W of operators which are products of local operators with a disorder operator. We introduce two anti-commutative family of operators b(z), c(z) which act on the space W. These operators are constructed as traces over representations of the q-oscillator algebra, in close analogy with Baxter's Q-operators. We show that the vacuum expectation values of operators in W can be expressed in terms of an exponential of a quadratic form of b(z), c(z).
