We study some elementary properties of the quantum enveloping algebra associated to a parabolic subalgebra \mathfrak{p} of a semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. In particular we prove an explicit formula for the degree of this algebra, that extends the well known formula for the quantum enveloping algebra associated to \mathfrak{g} and \mathfrak{b}, where \mathfrak{b}i is a Borel subalgebra of \mathfrak{g}.
