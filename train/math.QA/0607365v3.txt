We give a new construction of symbols of the differential operators on the sections of a quantum line bundle L over a Kaehler manifold M using the natural contravariant connection on L. These symbols are the functions on the tangent bundle TM polynomial on fibres. For high tensor powers of L, the asymptotics of the composition of these symbols leads to the star product of a deformation quantization with separation of variables on TM corresponding to some pseudo-Kaehler structure on TM. Surprisingly, this star product is intimately related to the formal symplectic groupoid with separation of variables over M. We extend the star product on TM to generalized functions supported on the zero section of TM. The resulting algebra of generalized functions contains an idempotent element which can be thought of as a natural counterpart of the Bergman projection operator. Using this idempotent, we define an algebra of Toeplitz elements and show that it is naturally isomorphic to the algebra of Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization on M.
