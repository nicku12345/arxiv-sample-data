We prove explit formulas for the decomposition of a differential graded Lie algebra into a minimal and a linear L_\infty-algebra. We define a category of metric L_\infty-algebras, called Palamodov L_\infty algebras, where the structure maps satisfy a certain convergence condition and deduce a decomposition theorem for differential graded Lie algebras in this category. This theorem serves for instance to prove the convergence of the Kuranishi map assigned to a differential graded Lie algeba.
