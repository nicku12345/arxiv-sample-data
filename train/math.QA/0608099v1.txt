Crawley-Boevey introduced the definition of a noncommutative Poisson structure on an associative algebra A that extends the notion of the usual Poisson bracket. Let V be a symplectic manifold and G be a finite group of symplectimorphisms of V. Consider the twisted group algebra A=C[V]#G.   We produce a counterexample to prove that it is not always possible to define a noncommutative poisson structure on C[V]#G that extends the Poisson bracket on C[V]^G.
