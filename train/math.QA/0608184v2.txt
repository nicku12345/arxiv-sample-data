The boundary theory for the c=-2 triplet model is investigated in detail. In particular, we show that there are four different boundary conditions that preserve the triplet algebra, and check the consistency of the corresponding boundary operators by constructing their OPE coefficients explicitly. We also compute the correlation functions of two bulk fields in the presence of a boundary, and verify that they are consistent with factorisation.
