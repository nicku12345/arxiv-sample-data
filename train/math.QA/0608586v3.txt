We study maximal Poisson-commutative subalgebras in the Poisson algebra S(\mathfrak{g}) of a semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} constructed by Mischenko and Fomenko with the help of the argument shift method. We prove that these subalgebras are Poisson centralizers of certain quadratic elements of S(\mathfrak{g}). We deduce from this that there is a unique quantization of Mischenko--Fomenko subalgebras, i.e. there is a unique way to lift Mischenko--Fomenko subalgebras to commutative subalgebras of the universal enveloping algebra U(\mathfrak{g}).
