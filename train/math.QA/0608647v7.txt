We give a necessary and sufficient condition for two Hopf algebras presented as central extensions to be isomorphic, in a suitable setting. We then study the question of isomorphism between the Hopf algebras constructed in 0707.0070v1 as quantum subgroups of quantum groups at roots of 1. Finally, we apply the first general result to show the existence of infinitely many non-isomorphic Hopf algebras of the same dimension, presented as extensions of finite quantum groups by finite groups.
