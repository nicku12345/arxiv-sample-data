In terms of the crystal base of a quantum affine algebra U_q(\mathfrak{g}), we study a soliton cellular automaton (SCA) associated with the exceptional affine Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}=D_4^{(3)}. The solitons therein are labeled by the crystals of quantum affine algebra U_q(A_1^{(1)}). The scatteing rule is identified with the combinatorial R matrix for U_q(A_1^{(1)})-crystals. Remarkably, the phase shifts in our SCA are given by {\em 3-times} of those in the well-known box-ball system.
