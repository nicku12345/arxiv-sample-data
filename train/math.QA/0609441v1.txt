We present a description of a new kind of the deformed canonical commutation relations, their representations and generated by them Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. This deformed algebra allows us to derive operations of the Hopf algebra structure: comultiplication, counit and antipode. We discuss properties of a discrete spectrum of the Hamiltonian of the deformed harmonic oscillator corresponding to this oscillator-like system.
