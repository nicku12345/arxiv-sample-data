In this work we study the induction (induced and coinduced)theory for Hopf group coalgebra. We define a substructure B of a Hopf group coalgebra H, called subHopf group coalgebra. Also, we have introduced the definition of Hopf group suboalgebra and group coisotropic quantum subgroup of H. The properties of the algebraic structure of the induced and coinduced are given. Moreover, a framework of the geometric interperation and simplicity theory of such representation strructure are stuided.
