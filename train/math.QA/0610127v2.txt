We study the homogeneous coordinate rings of real multiplication noncommutative tori as defined by A. Polishchuk. Our aim is to understand how these rings give rise to an arithmetic structure on the noncommutative torus. We start by giving an explicit presentation of these rings in terms of their natural generators. This presentation gives us information about the rationality of the rings and is the starting point for the analysis of the corresponding geometric data. Linear bases for these rings are also discussed. The basic role played by theta functions in these computations gives relations with elliptic curves at the level of modular curves. We use the modularity of these coordinate rings to obtain algebras which do no depend on the choice of a complex structure on the noncommutative torus. These algebras are obtained by an averaging process over (limiting) modular symbols.
