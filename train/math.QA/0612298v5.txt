Given a vector bundle \mathcal E on a connected compact complex manifold X, [FLS] use a notion of completed Hochschild homology \hat{\text{HH}} of \text{Diff}(\mathcal E) such that \hat{\text{HH}}_0(\text{Diff}(\mathcal E)) is isomorphic to \text{H}^{2n}(X, \mathbb C). On the other hand, they construct a trace on \hat{\text{HH}}_0(\text{Diff}(\mathcal E)). This therefore gives to a linear functional on \text{H}^{2n}(X, \mathbb C). They show that this functional is \int_X if \mathcal E has non zero Euler characteristic. They conjecture that this functional is \int_X for all \mathcal E.   These notes prove the integral conjecture in [FLS] for compact complex manifolds having at least one vector bundle with non zero Euler characteristic.
