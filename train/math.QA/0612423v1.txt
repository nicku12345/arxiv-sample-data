In this paper we describe all Lie bialgebra structures on the polynomial Lie algebra \mathbf{g}[u], where \mathbf{g} is a simple, finite dimensional, complex Lie algebra. The results are based on an unpublished paper Montaner and Zelmanov. Further, we introduce quasi-rational solutions of the CYBE and describe all quasi-rational r-matrices for \mathbf{sl}(2).
