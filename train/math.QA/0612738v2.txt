With any skew Young diagram one can associate a one parameter family of "elementary" modules over the Yangian \Yg(\g\l_N). Consider the twisted Yangian \Yg(\g_N)\subset \Yg(\g\l_N) associated with a classical matrix Lie algebra \g_N\subset\g\l_N. Regard the tensor product of elementary Yangian modules as a module over \Yg(\g_N) by restriction. We prove its irreducibility for generic values of the parameters.
