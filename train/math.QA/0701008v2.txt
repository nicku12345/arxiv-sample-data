We introduce the notion of `bar category' by which we mean a monoidal category equipped with additional structure formalising the notion of complex conjugation. Examples of our theory include bimodules over a *-algebra, modules over a conventional *-Hopf algebra and modules over a more general object which call a `quasi-*-Hopf algebra' and for which examples include the standard quantum groups u_q(g) at q a root of unity (these are well-known not to be a usual *-Hopf algebra). We also provide examples of strictly quasiassociative bar categories, including modules over `*-quasiHopf algebras' and a construction based on finite subgroups H\subset G of a finite group. Inside a bar category one has natural notions of `\star-algebra' and `unitary object' therefore extending these concepts to a variety of new situations. We study braidings and duals in bar categories and \star-braided groups (Hopf algebras) {\em in} braided-bar categories. Examples include the transmutation B(H) of a quasitriangular *-Hopf algebra and the quantum plane C_q^2 at certain roots of unity q in the bar category of \widetilde{u_q(su_2)}-modules. We use our methods to provide a natural quasi-associative C^*-algebra structure on the octonions {\mathbb O} and on a coset example. In the appendix we extend the Tannaka-Krein reconstruction theory to bar categories in relation to *-Hopf algebras.
