The condition for double bicrosssum to be a braided Lie bialgebra is given. The result generalizes quantum double, bicrosssum, bicrosscosum, bisum. The quantum double of braided Lie bialgebras is constructed. The relation between double crosssum of Lie algebras and double crossproduct of Hopf algebras is given.
