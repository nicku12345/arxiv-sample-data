We introduce a new class of possibly infinite dimensional Lie algebras and study their structural properties. Examples of this new class of Lie algebras are finite dimensional simple Lie algebras containing a nonzero split torus, affine and extended affine Lie algebras. Our results generalize well-known properties of these examples.
