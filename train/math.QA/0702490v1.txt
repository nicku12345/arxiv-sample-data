This paper is devoted to further results on the nontrivially associated categories \mathcal{C} and \mathcal{D}, which are constructed from a choice of coset representatives for a subgroup of a finite group.   We look at the construction of integrals in the algebras A and D in the categories. These integrals are used to construct abstract projection operators to show that general objects in \mathcal{D} can be split into a sum of simple objects. The braided Hopf algebra D is shown to be braided cocommutative, but not braided commutative. Extensions of the categories and their connections with conjugations and inner products are discussed.
