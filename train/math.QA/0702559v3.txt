We classify finite-dimensional complex pointed Hopf algebra with group of group-like elements isomorphic to A_5. We show that any pointed Hopf algebra with infinitesimal braiding associated with the conjugacy class of \pi \in A_n is infinite-dimensional if the order of \pi is odd except for \pi=(1 2 3) in A_4. We also study pointed Hopf algebras over the dihedral groups.
