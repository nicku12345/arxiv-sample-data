We present an uniform construction of the solution to the Yang- Baxter equation with the symmetry algebra s\ell(2) and its deformations: the q-deformation and the elliptic deformation or Sklyanin algebra. The R-operator acting in the tensor product of two representations of the symmetry algebra with arbitrary spins \ell_1 and \ell_2 is built in terms of products of three basic operators \mathcal{S}_1, \mathcal{S}_2,\mathcal{S}_3 which are constructed explicitly. They have the simple meaning of representing elementary permutations of the symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_4, the permutation group of the four parameters entering the RLL-relation.
