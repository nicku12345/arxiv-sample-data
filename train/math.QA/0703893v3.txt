Let M be the tensor product of finite-dimensional polynomial evaluation Yangian Y(gl_N)-modules. Consider the universal difference operator D = \sum_{k=0}^N (-1)^k T_k(u) e^{-k\partial_u} whose coefficients T_k(u): M \to M are the XXX transfer matrices associated with M. We show that the difference equation Df = 0 for an M-valued function f has a basis of solutions consisting of quasi-exponentials. We prove the same for the universal differential operator D = \sum_{k=0}^N (-1)^k S_k(u) \partial_u^{N-k} whose coefficients S_k(u) : M \to M are the Gaudin transfer matrices associated with the tensor product M of finite-dimensional polynomial evaluation gl_N[x]-modules.
