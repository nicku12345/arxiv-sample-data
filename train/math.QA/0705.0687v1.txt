This is a sequel to \cite{li-qva1} and \cite{li-qva2} in a series to study vertex algebra-like structures arising from various algebras such as quantum affine algebras and Yangians. In this paper, we study two versions of the double Yangian DY_{\hbar}(sl_{2}), denoted by DY_{q}(sl_{2}) and DY_{q}^{\infty}(sl_{2}) with q a nonzero complex number. For each nonzero complex number q, we construct a quantum vertex algebra V_{q} and prove that every DY_{q}(sl_{2})-module is naturally a V_{q}-module. We also show that DY_{q}^{\infty}(sl_{2})-modules are what we call V_{q}-modules-at-infinity. To achieve this goal, we study what we call \S-local subsets and quasi-local subsets of \Hom (W,W((x^{-1}))) for any vector space W, and we prove that any \S-local subset generates a (weak) quantum vertex algebra and that any quasi-local subset generates a vertex algebra with W as a (left) quasi module-at-infinity. Using this result we associate the Lie algebra of pseudo-differential operators on the circle with vertex algebras in terms of quasi modules-at-infinity.
