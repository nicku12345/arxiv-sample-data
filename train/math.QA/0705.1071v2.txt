We obtain Drinfeld second realization of the quantum affine superalgebras associated with the affine Lie superalgebra D^{(1)}(2,1;x). Our results are analogous to those obtained by Beck for the quantum affine algebras. Beck's analysis uses heavily the (extended) affine Weyl groups of the affine Lie algebras. In our approach the structures are based on a Weyl groupoid.
