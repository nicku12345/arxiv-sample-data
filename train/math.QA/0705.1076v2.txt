We study the interplay between noncommutative tori and noncommutative elliptic curves through a category of equivariant differential modules on \mathbb{C}^*. We functorially relate this category to the category of holomorphic vector bundles on noncommutative tori as introduced by Polishchuk and Schwarz and study the induced map between the corresponding K-theories. In addition, there is a forgetful functor to the category of noncommutative elliptic curves of Soibelman and Vologodsky, as well as a forgetful functor to the category of vector bundles on \mathbb{C}^* with regular singular connections.   The category that we consider has the nice property of being a Tannakian category, hence it is equivalent to the category of representations of an affine group scheme. Via an equivariant version of the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence we determine this group scheme to be (the algebraic hull of) \mathbb{Z}^2. We also obtain a full subcategory of the category of holomorphic bundles of the noncommutative torus, which is equivalent to the category of representations of \mathbb{Z}. This group is the proposed topological fundamental group of the noncommutative torus (understood as a degenerate elliptic curve) and we study Nori's notion of \'etale fundamental group in this context.
