Associated to each subset J of the nodes I of a Dynkin diagram is a triangular decomposition of the corresponding Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} into three subalgebras \widetilde{\mathfrak{g}_{J}} (generated by e_{j}, f_{j} for j\in J and h_{i} for i\in I), \mathfrak{n}^{-}_{D} (generated by f_{d}, d\in D=I\setminus J) and its dual \mathfrak{n}_{D}^{+}.   We demonstrate a quantum counterpart, generalising work of Majid and Rosso, by exhibiting analogous triangular decompositions of U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}) and identifying a graded braided Hopf algebra that quantizes \mathfrak{n}_{D}^{-}. This algebra has many similar properties to U_{q}^{-}(\mathfrak{g}), in many cases being a Nichols algebra and therefore completely determined by its associated braiding.
