Let \alpha be a polynomial Poisson bivector on a finite-dimensional vector space V over \mathbb{C}. Then Kontsevich [K97] gives a formula for a quantization f\star g of the algebra S(V)^*. We give a construction of an algebra with the PBW property defined from \alpha by generators and relations. Namely, we define an algebra as the quotient of the free tensor algebra T(V^*) by relations x_i\otimes x_j-x_j\otimes x_i=R_{ij}(\hbar) where R_{ij}(\hbar)\in T(V^*)\otimes\hbar \mathbb{C}[[\hbar]], R_{ij}=\hbar \Sym(\alpha_{ij})+\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2), with one relation for each pair of i,j=1...\dim V. We prove that the constructed algebra obeys the PBW property, and this is a generalization of the Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt theorem. In the case of a linear Poisson structure we get the PBW theorem itself, and for a quadratic Poisson structure we get an object closely related to a quantum R-matrix on V. At the same time we get a free resolution of the deformed algebra (for an arbitrary \alpha).   The construction of this PBW algebra is rather simple, as well as the proof of the PBW property. The major efforts should be undertaken to prove the conjecture that in this way we get an algebra isomorphic to the Kontsevich star-algebra.
