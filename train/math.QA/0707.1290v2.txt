Associated to a differential BV algebra are two differential graded Lie algebras: we call one classical and the other, which contains a formal h-bar parameter, quantum. The classical dgLa is always smooth formal. In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the quantum dgLa to be smooth formal. These conditions are equivalent to the degeneration of a version of the noncommutative Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence. References added.
