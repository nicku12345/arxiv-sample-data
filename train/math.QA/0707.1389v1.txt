It is shown that quantum homogeneous coordinate rings of generalised flag manifolds corresponding to minuscule weights, their Schubert varieties, big cells, and determinantal varieties are AS-Cohen-Macaulay. The main ingredient in the proof is the notion of a quantum graded algebra with a straightening law, introduced by T.H. Lenagan and L. Rigal [J. Algebra 301 (2006), 670-702]. Using Stanley's Theorem it is moreover shown that quantum generalised flag manifolds of minuscule weight and their big cells are AS-Gorenstein.
