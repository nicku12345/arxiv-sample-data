In this paper we prove that any Poisson structure on a sheaf of Lie algebroids admits a weak deformation quantization, and give a sufficient condition for such a Poisson structure to admit an actual deformation quantization. We also answer the corresponding classification problems. In the complex symplectic case, we recover in particular some results of Nest-Tsygan and Polesello-Schapira.   We begin the paper with a recollection of known facts about deformation theory of cosimplicial differential graded Lie algebras.
