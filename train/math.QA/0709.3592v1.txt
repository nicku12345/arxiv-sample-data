In this paper we discuss classical elliptic current algebras and show that there are two different choices of commutative test function algebras on a complex torus leading to two different elliptic current algebras. Quantization of these classical current algebras give rise to two classes of quantized dynamical quasi-Hopf current algebras studied by Enriquez-Felder-Rubtsov and Arnaudon-Buffenoir-Ragoucy-Roche-Jimbo-Konno-Odake-Shiraishi. Different degenerations of the classical elliptic algebras are considered. They yield different versions of rational and trigonometric current algebras. We also review the averaging method of Faddeev-Reshetikhin, which allows to restore elliptic algebras from the trigonometric ones.
