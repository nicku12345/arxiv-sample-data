We discuss a class of generalized divided difference operators which give rise to a representation of Nichols-Woronowicz algebras associated to Weyl groups. For the root system of type A, we also study the condition for the deformations of the Fomin-Kirillov quadratic algebra, which is a quadratic lift of the Nichols-Woronowicz algebra, to admit a representation given by generalized divided difference operators. The relations satisfied by the mutually commuting elements called Dunkl elements in the deformed Fomin-Kirillov algebra are determined. The Dunkl elements correspond to the truncated elliptic Dunkl operators via the representation given by the generalized divided difference operators.
