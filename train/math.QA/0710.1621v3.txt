We study the unitarizability of premodular categories constructed from representations of quantum group at roots of unity. We introduce \emph{Grothendieck unitarizability} as a natural generalization of unitarizability to any class of premodular categories with a common Grothendieck semiring. We obtain new results for quantum groups of Lie types F_4 and G_2, and improve the known results for Lie types B and C.
