Ideas from deformation quantization are applied to deform the expression of elements of an algebra. Extending these ideas to certain transcendental elements implies that \frac{1}{i\h}uv in the Weyl algebra is naturally viewed as an indeterminate living in a discrete set \mathbb{N}{+}{1/2} {\it or} {-}(\mathbb{N}{+}{1/2}) . This may yield a more mathematical understanding of Dirac's positron theory.
