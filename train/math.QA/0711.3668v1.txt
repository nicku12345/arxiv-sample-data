We propose a relatively new notion of two-valued elements, which arises naturally in constructing the star exponential functions of the quad-ratics in the Weyl algebra over the complex number field. This notion enables us to describe the group like objects of the set of star exponential functions of quadratics in the Weyl algebra.
