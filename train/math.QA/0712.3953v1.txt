The ice Ansatz on matrix solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation is weakened to a condition which we call rime. Generic rime solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation are described. We prove that the rime non-unitary (respectively, unitary) R-matrix is equivalent to the Cremmer-Gervais (respectively, boundary Cremmer-Gervais) solution. Generic rime classical r-matices satisfy the (non-)homogeneous associative classical Yang-Baxter equation.
