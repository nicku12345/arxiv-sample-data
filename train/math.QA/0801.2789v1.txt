Le X be a C^\infty-manifold and \g be a finite dimensional Lie algebra acting freely on X. Let r \in \ve^2(\g) be such that Z=[r,r] \in \ve^3(\g)^\g. In this paper we prove that every quasi-Poisson (\g,Z)-manifold can be quantized. This is a generalization of the existence of a twist quantization of coboundary Lie bialgebras (\cite{EH}) in the case X=G (where G is the simply connected Lie group corresponding to \g). We deduce our result from a generalized formality theorem. In the case Z=0, we get a new proof of the existence of (equivariant) formality theorem and so (equivariant) quantization of Poisson manifold ({\it cf.} \cite{Ko,Do}). As a consequence of our results, we get quantization of modified classical dynamical r-matrices over abelian bases in the reductive case
