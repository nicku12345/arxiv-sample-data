We generalize a recent observation [arXiv:math/0610433] that the partition function of the 6-vertex model with domain-wall boundary conditions can be obtained by computing the projections of the product of the total currents in the quantum affine algebra U_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{2}) in its current realization. A generalization is proved for the the elliptic current algebra [arXiv:q-alg/9703018,arXiv:q-alg/9601022]. The projections of the product of total currents are calculated explicitly and are represented as integral transforms of the product of the total currents. We prove that the kernel of this transform is proportional to the partition function of the SOS model with domain-wall boundary conditions.
