Solutions of the qKZ equation associated with the quantum affine algebra U_q(\hat{sl}_2) and its two dimensional evaluation representation are studied. The integral formulae derived from the free field realization of intertwining operators of q-Wakimoto modules are shown to coincide with those of Tarasov and Varchenko.
