We compute necessary conditions on Yetter-Drinfeld modules over the groups \mathbf{PGL}(2,q)=\mathbf{PGL}(2,\FF_q) and \mathbf{PSL}(2,q)=\mathbf{PSL}(2,\FF_q) to generate finite dimensional Nichols algebras. This is a first step towards a classification of pointed Hopf algebras with group of group-likes isomorphic to one of these groups.   As a by-product of the techniques developed in this work, we prove that there is no non-trivial finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebra over the Mathieu groups M_{20} and M_{21}=\mathbf{PSL}(3,4).
