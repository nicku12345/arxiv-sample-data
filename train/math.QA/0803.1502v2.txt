By using the known description of combinatorial bases for Feigin-Stoyanovsky's type subspaces of standard modules for affine Lie algebra \mathfrak{sl}(l+1,\mathbb{C})^{\widetilde{}}, as well as certain intertwining operators between standard modules, we obtain exact sequences of Feigin-Stoyanovsky's type subspaces at fixed level k. This directly leads to systems of recurrence relations for formal characters of those subspaces.
