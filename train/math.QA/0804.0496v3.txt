We construct quantization functors of quasi-Lie bialgebras. We establish a bijection between this set of quantization functors, modulo equivalence and twist equivalence, and the set of quantization functors of Lie bialgebras, modulo equivalence. This is based on the acyclicity of the kernel of the natural morphism from the universal deformation complex of quasi-Lie bialgebras to that of Lie bialgebras. The proof of this acyclicity consists in several steps, ending up in the acyclicity of a complex related to free Lie algebras, namely, the universal version of the Lie algebra cohomology complex of a Lie algebra in its enveloping algebra, viewed as the left regular module. Using the same arguments, we also prove the compatibility of quantization functors of quasi-Lie bialgebras with twists, which allows us to recover our earlier results on compatibility of quantization functors with twists in the case of Lie bialgebras.
