We study representations of nilpotent type nontrivial liftings of quantum linear spaces and their Drinfel'd quantum doubles. We construct a family of Verma- type modules in both cases and prove a parametrization theorem for simple modules. We compute the Loewy and socle series of Verma modules under a mild restriction on the datum of a lifting. We find bases and dimensions of simple modules.
