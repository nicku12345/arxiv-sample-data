Let \mathbb{F} be a field of characteristic 0, G an additive subgroup of \mathbb{F}, \alpha\in \mathbb{F} satisfying \alpha\notin G, 2\alpha\in G. We define a class of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras which are called generalized Schr\"{o}dinger-Virasoro algebras and use \mathfrak{gsv}[G,\alpha] to denote the one corresponding to G and \alpha. In this paper the automorphism group and irreducibility of Verma modules for \mathfrak{gsv}[G,\alpha] are completely determined.
