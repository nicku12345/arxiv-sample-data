Kontsevich has proven that the Lie homology of the Lie algebra of symplectic vector fields can be computed in terms of the homology of a graph complex. We prove that the Leibniz homology of this Lie algebra can be computed in terms of the homology of a variant of the graph complex endowed with an action of the symmetric groups. The resulting isomorphism is shown to be a Zinbiel-associative bialgebra isomorphism.
