All -1-type pointed Hopf algebras and central quantum linear spaces with Weyl groups of exceptional type are found. It is proved that every non -1-type pointed Hopf algebra with real G(H) is infinite dimensional and every central quantum linear space over finite group is finite dimensional. It is proved that except a few cases Nichols algebras of reducible Yetter-Drinfeld modules over   Weyl groups of exceptional type are infinite dimensional.
