The notions of Galois and cleft extensions are generalized for coquasi-Hopf algebras. It is shown that such an extension over a coquasi-Hopf algebra is cleft if and only if it is Galois and has the normal basis property. A Schneider type theorem is proven for coquasi-Hopf algebras with bijective antipode. As an application, we generalize Schauenburg's bialgebroid construction for coquasi-Hopf algebras.
