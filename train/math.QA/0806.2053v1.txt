It was proved by Montaner and Zelmanov that up to classical twisting Lie bialgebra structures on \mathfrak{g}[u] fall into four classes. Here \mathfrak{g} is a simple complex finite-dimensional Lie algebra. It turns out that classical twists within one of these four classes are in a one-to-one correspondence with the so-called quasi-trigonometric solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. In this paper we give a complete list of the quasi-trigonometric solutions in terms of sub-diagrams of the certain Dynkin diagrams related to \mathfrak{g}. We also explain how to quantize the corresponding Lie bialgebra structures.
