We give a necessary and sufficient condition for an MV polytope P in a highest weight crystal to lie in an arbitrary fixed Demazure crystal (resp., opposite Demazure crystal), in terms of the lengths of edges along a path through the 1-skeleton of P corresponding to a reduced word for the longest element of the Weyl group W. % Also, we give an explicit description as a pseudo-Weyl polytope for extremal MV polytopes in a highest weight crystal. % Finally, by combining the results above, we obtain a polytopal condition for an MV polytope P to lie in an arbitrary fixed opposite Demazure crystal.
