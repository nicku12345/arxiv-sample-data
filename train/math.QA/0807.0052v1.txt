In this paper we construct all the primitive idempotents of the restricted quantum group \overline{U}_q (sl_2) and also determine the multiplication rules among a basis given by the action of generators of \bar{U}_q (sl_2) to the idempotents. By using this result we construct a basis of the space of symmetric linear functions of \overline{U}_q (sl_2) and determine the decomposition of the integral of the dual of \overline{U}_q (sl_2) twisted by the balancing element to the basis of the space of symmetric linear functions.
