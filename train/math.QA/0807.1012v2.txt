Let \mathfrak{g} be a finite dimensional complex simple Lie algebra, \mathbb{K} a commutative field and q a nonzero element of \mathbb{K} which is not a root of unity. To each reduced decomposition of the longest element w_0 of the Weyl group W corresponds a PBW basis of the quantised enveloping algebra \mathcal{U}_q^+(\mathfrak{g}), and one can apply the theory of deleting-derivation to this iterated Ore extension. In particular, for each decomposition of w_0, this theory constructs a bijection between the set of prime ideals in \mathcal{U}_q^+(\mathfrak{g}) that are invariant under a natural torus action and certain combinatorial objects called Cauchon diagrams. In this paper, we give an algorithmic description of these Cauchon diagrams when the chosen reduced decomposition of w_0 corresponds to a good ordering (in the sense of Lusztig \cite{Lu2}) of the set of positive roots. This algorithmic description is based on the constraints that are coming from Lusztig's admissible planes \cite{Lu2}: each admissible plane leads to a set of constraints that a diagram has to satisfy to be Cauchon. Moreover, we explicitely describe the set of Cauchon diagrams for explicit reduced decomposition of w_0 in each possible type. In any case, we check that the number of Cauchon diagrams is always equal to the cardinal of W. In \cite{CM}, we use these results to prove that Cauchon diagrams correspond canonically to the positive subexpressions of w_0. So the results of this paper also give an algorithmic description of the positive subexpressions of any reduced decomposition of w_0 corresponding to a good ordering.
