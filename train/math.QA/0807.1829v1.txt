The fundamental example of Gerstenhaber algebra is the space T_{poly}({\mathbb R}^d) of polyvector fields on \mathbb{R}^d, equipped with the wedge product and the Schouten bracket. In this paper, we explicitely describe what is the enveloping G_\infty algebra of a Gerstenhaber algebra \mathcal{G}. This structure gives us a definition of the Chevalley-Harrison cohomology operator for \mathcal{G}. We finally show the nontriviality of a Chevalley-Harrison cohomology group for a natural Gerstenhaber subalgebra in T_{poly}({\mathbb R}^d).
