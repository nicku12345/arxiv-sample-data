We study in this article the concepts of algebra up to homotopy for a structure defined by two operations  \pt  and [, ]. Having determined the structure of  G_\infty  algebras and  P_\infty  algebras, we generalize this construction and we define a structure of  (a, b)-algebra up to homotopy. Given a structure of commutative and differential graded Lie algebra for two shifts degree given by a and b, we will give an explicit construction of the associate algebra up to homotopy
