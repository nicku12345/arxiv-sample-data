We describe an explicit action of the prop of the chains on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces on the Hochschild complex of a Calabi-Yau elliptic space. One example of such an elliptic space extends the known string topology operations, for all compact simply-connected manifolds, to a collection indexed by the de Rham currents on the moduli space. Another example pertains to the B-model at all genera.
