The present work is a part of a larger program to construct explicit combinatorial models for the (indecomposable) regular representation of the nilpotent factor N in the Iwasawa decomposition of a semi-simple Lie algebra \mathfrak g, using the restrictions to N of the simple finite dimensional modules of \mathfrak g. Such a description is given in \cite{[ABW]}, for the cas \mathfrak g=\mathfrak{sl}(n). Here, we give the analog for the rank 2 semi simple Lie algebras (of type A_1\times A_1, A_2, C_2 and G_2). The algebra \mathbb C[N] of polynomial functions on N is a quotient, called reduced shape algebra of the shape algebra for \mathfrak g. Basis for the shape algebra are known, for instance the so called semi standard Young tableaux (see \cite{[ADLMPPrW]}). We select among the semi standard tableaux, the so called quasi standard ones which define a kind basis for the reduced shape algebra.
