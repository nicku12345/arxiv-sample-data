A well-known Peterson's theorem says that the number of abelian ideals in a Borel subalgebra of a rank-r finite dimensional simple Lie algebra is exactly 2^r. In this paper, we determine the dimensional distribution of abelian ideals in a Borel subalgebra of finite dimensional simple Lie algebras, which is a refinement of the Peterson's theorem capturing more Lie algebra invariants.
