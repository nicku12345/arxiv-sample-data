We present an unified construction for algebras and modules homologies and cohomologies, in the case of associative, commuttaive, Lie and Gerstenhaber algebras. We make a distinction between the linear part of the construction of algebras and cogebras, characterized by the symmetries of the defining relations and the structure itself which appears as a differential on these algebras and cogebras.
