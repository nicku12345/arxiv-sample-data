Matrix elements of intertwining operators between q-Wakimoto modules associated to the tensor product of representations of U_q(\widehat{sl_2}) with arbitrary spins are studied. It is shown that they coincide with the Tarasov-Varchenko's formulae of the solutions of the qKZ equations. The result generalizes that of the previous paper [Kuroki K., Nakayashiki A., SIGMA 4 (2008), 049, 13 pages, arXiv:0802.1776].
