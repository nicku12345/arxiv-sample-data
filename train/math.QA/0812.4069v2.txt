We define a new monoidal category on collections (shuffle composition). Monoids in this category (shuffle operads) turn out to bring a new insight in the theory of symmetric operads. For this category, we develop the machinery of Gr\"obner bases for operads, and present operadic versions of Bergman's Diamond Lemma and Buchberger's algorithm. This machinery can be applied to study symmetric operads. In particular, we obtain an effective algorithmic version of Hoffbeck's PBW criterion of Koszulness for (symmetric) quadratic operads.
