As a generalization of Postnikov's construction (see arXiv: math/0609764), we define a map from the space of edge weights of a directed network in an annulus into a space of loops in the Grassmannian. We then show that universal Poisson brackets introduced for the space of edge weights in arXiv: 0805.3541 induce a family of Poisson structures on rational-valued matrix functions and on the space of loops in the Grassmannian. In the former case, this family includes, for a particular kind of networks, the Poisson bracket associated with the trigonometric R-matrix.
