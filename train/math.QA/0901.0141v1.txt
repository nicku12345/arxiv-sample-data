The theory of general Galois-type extensions is presented, including the interrelations between coalgebra extensions and algebra (co)extensions, properties of corresponding (co)translation maps, and rudiments of entwinings and factorisations. To achieve broad perspective, this theory is placed in the context of far reaching generalisations of the Galois condition to the setting of corings. At the same time, to bring together K-theory and general Galois theory, the equivariant projectivity of extensions is assumed resulting in the centrepiece concept of a principal extension. Motivated by noncommutative geometry, we employ such extensions as replacements of principal bundles. This brings about the notion of a strong connection and yields finitely generated projective associated modules, which play the role of noncommutative vector bundles. Subsequently, the theory of strong connections is developed. It is purported as a basic ingredient in the construction of the Chern character for Galois-type extensions (called the Chern-Galois character).
