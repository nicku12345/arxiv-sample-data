We describe a nonstandard version of the quantum plane, the one in the basis of divided powers at an even root of unity q=e^{i\pi/p}. It can be regarded as an extension of the "nearly commutative" algebra C[X,Y] with X Y =(-1)^p Y X by nilpotents. For this quantum plane, we construct a Wess--Zumino-type de Rham complex and find its decomposition into representations of the 2p^3-dimensional quantum group U_q sl(2) and its Lusztig extension; the quantum group action is also defined on the algebra of quantum differential operators on the quantum plane.
