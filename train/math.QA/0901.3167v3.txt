We compare two different models of noncommutative geometry of the cyclotomic tower, both based on an arithmetic algebra of functions of roots of unity and an action by endomorphisms, the first based on the Bost-Connes quantum statistical mechanical system and the second on the Habiro ring, where the Habiro functions have, in addition to evaluations at roots of unity, also full Taylor expansions. Both have compatible endomorphisms actions of the multiplicative semigroup of positive integers. As a higher dimensional generalization, we consider a crossed product ring obtained using Manin's multivariable generalizations of the Habiro functions and an action by endomorphisms of the semigroup of integer matrices with positive determinant. We then construct a corresponding class of multivariable Bost-Connes endomotives, which are obtained geometrically from self maps of higher dimensional algebraic tori, and we discuss some of their quantum statistical mechanical properties. These multivariable Bost-Connes endomotives are universal for (torsion free) Lambda-rings, compatibly with the Frobenius action. Finally, we discuss briefly how Habiro's universal Witten--Reshetikhin--Turaev invariant of integral homology 3-spheres may relate invariants of 3-manifolds to gadgets over the field with one element and semigroup actions on homology 3-spheres to endomotives.
