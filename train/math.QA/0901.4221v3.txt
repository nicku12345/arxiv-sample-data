In this paper we study the tensor category structure of the module category of the restricted quantum enveloping algebra associated to \mathfrak{sl}_2. Indecomposable decomposition of all tensor products of modules over this algebra is completely determined in explicit formulas. As a by-product, we show that the module category of the restricted quantum enveloping algebra associated to \mathfrak{sl}_2 is not a braided tensor category.
