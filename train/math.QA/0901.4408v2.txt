We apply a combinatorial formula of the first author and Rosso, for products in Hopf quiver algebras, to determine the structure of Nichols algebras. We illustrate this technique by explicitly constructing new examples of Nichols algebras in positive characteristic. We further describe the corresponding Radford biproducts and some liftings of these biproducts, which are new finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebras.
