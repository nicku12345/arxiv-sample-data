Motivated by the recently introduced concept of a pseudosymmetric braided monoidal category, we define the pseudosymmetric group PS_n, as the quotient of the braid group B_n by the relations \sigma_i\sigma_{i+1}^{-1}\sigma_i=\sigma _{i+1}\sigma_i^{-1}\sigma_{i+1}, with 1\leq i\leq n-2. It turns out that PS_n is isomorphic to the quotient of B_n by the commutator subgroup [P_n, P_n] of the pure braid group P_n (which amounts to saying that [P_n, P_n] coincides with the normal subgroup of B_n generated by the elements [\sigma_i^2, \sigma_{i+1}^2], with 1\leq i\leq n-2), and that PS_n is a linear group.
