The half-liberated orthogonal group O_n^* appears as intermediate quantum group between the orthogonal group O_n, and its free version O_n^+. We discuss here its basic algebraic properties, and we classify its irreducible representations. The classification of representations is done by using a certain twisting-type relation between O_n^* and U_n, a non abelian discrete group playing the role of weight lattice for O_n^*, and a number of methods inspired from the theory of Lie algebras. We use these results for showing that the discrete quantum group dual to O_n^* has polynomial growth.
