This paper is based on the lectures given by the first author at Harvard in February and March, 2009. It begins with an introduction to the classical p-adic theory of the Macdonald, Matsumoto and Whittaker functions. Its major directions are as follows: 1) extending the theory of DAHA to arbitrary levels; 2) the affine Satake isomorphism and Hall functions via DAHA; 3) the spinor Dunkl operators for the Q-Toda equation; 4) applications to the nil-DAHA and q-Whittaker functions; 5) the technique of spinors in the differential theory and its applications to the AKZ-QMBP isomorphism theorem.
