We develop a theory of \phi-coordinated (quasi) modules for a nonlocal vertex algebra and we establish a conceptual construction of nonlocal vertex algebras and their \phi-coordinated (quasi) modules, where \phi is what we call an associate of the one-dimensional additive formal group. By specializing \phi to a particular associate, we obtain a new construction of weak quantum vertex algebras in the sense of \cite{li-qva1}. As an application, we associate weak quantum vertex algebras to quantum affine algebras, and we also associate quantum vertex algebras and \phi-coordinated modules to a certain quantum \beta\gamma-system.
