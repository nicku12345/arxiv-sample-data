For a braided vector space (V,\sigma) with braiding \sigma of Hecke type, we introduce three associative algebra structures on the space \oplus_{p=0}^{M}\mathrm{End}S_\sigma^p(V) of graded endomorphisms of the quantum symmetric algebra S_\sigma(V). We use the second product to construct a new trace. This trace is an algebra morphism with respect to the third product. In particular, when V is the fundamental representation of \mathcal{U}_{q}\mathfrak{sl}_{N+1} and \sigma is the action of the R-matrix, this trace is a scalar multiple of the quantum trace of type A.
