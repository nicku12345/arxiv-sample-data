We derive a bosonic formula for the character of the principal space in the level k vacuum module for \widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{n+1}, starting from a known fermionic formula for it. In our previous work, the latter was written as a sum consisting of Shapovalov scalar products of the Whittaker vectors for U_{v^{\pm1}}(\mathfrak{gl}_{n+1}). In this paper we compute these scalar products in the bosonic form, using the decomposition of the Whittaker vectors in the Gelfand-Zetlin basis. We show further that the bosonic formula obtained in this way is the quasi-classical decomposition of the fermionic formula.
