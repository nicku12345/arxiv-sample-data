We establish some properties of quantum quasi-shuffle algebras. They include the necessary and sufficient condition for the construction of the quantum quasi-shuffle product, the universal property, and the commutativity condition. As an application, we use the quantum quasi-shuffle product to construct a linear basis of T(V), for a special kind of Yang-Baxter algebras (V,m,\sigma).
