We consider a category of \gl_\infty-crystals, whose objects are disjoint unions of extremal weight crystals of non-negative level with certain finite conditions on the multiplicity of connected components. We show that it is a monoidal category under tensor product of crystals and the associated Grothendieck ring is anti-isomorphic to an Ore extension of the character ring of integrable lowest weight \gl_\infty-modules with respect to derivations shifting the characters of fundamental modules. A Littlewood-Richardson rule of extremal weight crystals with non-negative level is described explicitly in terms of classical Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
