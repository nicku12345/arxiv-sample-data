The notion of an anti-commutative (resp. commutative) rigid superalgebra is a natural generalisation of the notion of a Lie (resp. Jordan) superalgebra. Intuitively rigidity means that small deformations of the product under the structural group produce an isomorphic algebra. In this paper we classify all linearly compact simple anti-commutative (resp. commutative) rigid superalgebras. Beyond Lie (resp. Jordan) superalgebras the complete list includes four series and twenty two exceptional superalgebras (resp. ten exceptional superalgebras).
