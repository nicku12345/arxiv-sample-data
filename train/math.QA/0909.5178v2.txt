We use an example to provide evidence for the statement: the Vassiliev-Kontsevich invariants k_n of a knot (or braid) k can be redefined so that k = \sum_0^\infty k_n. This constructs a knot from its Vassiliev-Kontsevich invariants, like a power series expansion. The example is pure braids on two strands P_2\cong \mathbb{Z}, which leads to solving e^\tau=q for \tau a Laurent series in q. We set \tau = \sum_1^\infty (-1)^{n+1} (q^n - q^{-n})/n and use Parseval's theorem for Fourier series to prove e^\tau=q. Finally we describe some problems, particularly a Plancherel theorem for braid groups, whose solution would take us towards a proof of k=\sum_0^\infty k_n.
