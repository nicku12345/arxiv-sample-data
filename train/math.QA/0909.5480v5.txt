The dilogarithm identities for the central charges of conformal field theories of simply laced type were conjectured by Bazhanov, Kirillov, and Reshetikhin. Their functional generalizations were conjectured by Gliozzi and Tateo. They have been partly proved by various authors. We prove these identities in full generality for any pair of Dynkin diagrams of simply laced type based on the cluster algebra formulation of the Y-systems.
