We prove that Nichols algebras of irreducible Yetter-Drinfeld modules over classical Weyl groups A \rtimes \mathbb S_n supported by \mathbb S_n are infinite dimensional, except in three cases. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for Nichols algebras of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over classical Weyl groups A \rtimes \mathbb S_n supported by A to be finite dimensional.
