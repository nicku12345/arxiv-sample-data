For the Borel part of a quantized enveloping algebra we classify all right coideal subalgebras for which the intersection with the coradical is a Hopf algebra. The result is expressed in terms of characters of the subalgebras U^+[w] of the quantized enveloping algebra, introduced by de Concini, Kac, and Procesi for any Weyl group element w. We explicitly determine all characters of U^+[w] building on recent work by Yakimov on prime ideals of U^+[w] which are invariant under a torus action.   Key words: Quantum groups, coideal subalgebras
