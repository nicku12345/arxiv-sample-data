For a finite dimensional simple complex Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}, Lie bialgebra structures on \mathfrak{g}[[u]] and \mathfrak{g}[u] were classified by Montaner, Stolin and Zelmanov. In our paper, we provide an explicit algorithm to produce r-matrices which correspond to Lie bialgebra structures over polynomials.
