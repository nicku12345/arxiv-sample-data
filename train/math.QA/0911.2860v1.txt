Some duality properties for induced representations of enveloping algebras involve the character Trad_{\goth g}. We extend them to deformation Hopf algebras A_{h} of a noetherian Hopf k-algebra A_{0} satistying Ext^{i}_{A_{0}}(k, A_{0})=\{0\} except for i=d where it is isomorphic to k. These duality properties involve the character of A_{h} defined by right multiplication on the one dimensional free k[[h]]-module Ext^{d}_{A_{h}} (k[[h]], A_{h}). In the case of quantized enveloping algebras, this character lifts the character Trad_{\goth g}. We also prove Poincar{\'e} duality for such deformation Hopf algebras in the case where A_{0} is of finite homological dimension. We explain the relation of our construction with quantum duality.
