We give several necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of {\it the presentation by conjugation} for a non-simply laced extended affine Weyl group. We invent a computational tool by which one can determine simply the existence of the presentation by conjugation for an extended affine Weyl group. As an application, we determine the existence of the presentation by conjugation for a large class of extended affine Weyl groups.
