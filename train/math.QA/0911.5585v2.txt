The notion of inner linear Hopf algebra is a generalization of the notion of discrete linear group. In this paper, we prove two general results that enable us to enlarge the class of Hopf algebras that are known to be inner linear: the first one is a characterization by using the Hopf dual, while the second one is a stability result under extensions. We also discuss the related notion of inner unitary Hopf *-algebra.
