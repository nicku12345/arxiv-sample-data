Quantum principal bundles or principal comodule algebras are re-interpreted as principal bundles within a framework of Synthetic Noncommutative Differential Geometry. More specifically, the notion of a noncommutative principal bundle within a braided monoidal category is introduced and it is shown that a noncommutative principal bundle in the category opposite to the category of vector spaces is the same as a faithfully flat Hopf-Galois extension.
