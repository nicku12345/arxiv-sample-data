Let SU_q(2) and E_q(2) be Woronowicz' q-deformations of respectively the compact Lie group SU(2) and the non-trivial double cover of the Lie group E(2) of Euclidian transformations of the plane. We prove that, in some sense, their duals are `Morita equivalent locally compact quantum groups'. In more concrete terms, we prove that the von Neumann algebraic quantum groups of `bounded measurable functions' on SU_q(2) and E_q(2) are unitary cocycle deformations of each other.
