In this paper we describe the right coideal subalgebras containing all group-like elements of the two-parameter quantum groups Uq(g) and uq(g), where g is a simple Lie algebra of type G2. As a consequence, we determine that there are precisely 60 different right coideal subalgebras containing all group-like elements.
