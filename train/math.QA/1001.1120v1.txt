In this paper we describe the right coideal subalgebras containing all group-like elements of the multiparameter quantum group Uq+(g), where g is a simple Lie algebra of type G2, while the main parameter of quantization q is not a root of 1. If the multiplicative order t of q is finite, t>4, t different from 6, then the same classification remains valid for homogeneous right coideal subalgebras of the positive part uq+(g) of the multiparameter version of the small Lusztig quantum group.
