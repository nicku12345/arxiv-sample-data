We study coquasitriangular pointed Majid algebras via the quiver approaches. The class of Hopf quivers whose path coalgebras admit coquasitriangular Majid algebras is classified. The quiver setting for general coquasitriangular pointed Majid algebras is also provided. Through this, some examples and classification results are obtained.
