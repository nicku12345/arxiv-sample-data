Solutions of the classical dynamical Yang-Baxter equation on a Lie superalgebra are called super dynamical r-matrices. In this note we explicitly quantize zero-weight super dynamical r-matrices with zero coupling constant. We also answer some questions about super dynamical R-matrices. In particular we offer some support for one particular interpretation of the super Hecke condition.
