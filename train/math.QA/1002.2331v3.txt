We prove an estimate on denominators of rational Drinfeld associators. To obtain this result, we prove the corresponding estimate for the p-adic associators stable under the action of suitable elements of Gal(\bar{Q}/Q). As an application, we settle in the positive Duflo's question on the Kashiwara--Vergne factorizations of the Jacobson element J_p(x,y)=(x+y)^p-x^p-y^p in the free Lie algebra over a field of characteristic p. Another application is a new estimate on denominators of the Kontsevich knot invariant.
