A family of quantum cluster algebras is introduced and studied. In general, these algebras are new, but subclasses have been studied previously by other authors. The algebras are indexed by double partitions or double flag varieties. Equivalently, they are indexed by broken lines L. By grouping together neighboring mutations into quantum line mutations we can mutate from the cluster algebra of one broken line to another. Compatible pairs can be written down. The algebras are equal to their upper cluster algebras. The variables of the quantum seeds are given by elements of the dual canonical basis.   This is the final version, where some arguments have been expanded and/or improved and several typos corrected.
