We prove that we have an isomorphism of type A_{aut}(\mathbb C_\sigma[G])\simeq A_{aut}(\mathbb C[G])^\sigma, for any finite group G, and any 2-cocycle \sigma on G. In the particular case G=\mathbb Z_n^2, this leads to a Haar-measure preserving identification between the subalgebra of A_o(n) generated by the variables u_{ij}^2, and the subalgebra of A_s(n^2) generated by the variables X_{ij}=\sum_{a,b=1}^np_{ia,jb}. Since u_{ij} is "free hyperspherical" and X_{ij} is "free hypergeometric", we obtain in this way a new free probability formula, which at n=\infty corresponds to the well-known relation between the semicircle law, and the free Poisson law.
