In this paper we construct bases of standard (i.e. integrable highest weight) modules L(\Lambda) for affine Lie algebra of type B_2\sp{(1)} consisting of semi-infinite monomials. The main technical ingredient is a construction of monomial bases for Feigin-Stoyanovsky type subspaces W(\Lambda) of L(\Lambda) by using simple currents and intertwining operators in vertex operator algebra theory. By coincidence W(k\Lambda_0) for B_2\sp{(1)} and the integrable highest weight module L(k\Lambda_0) for A_1\sp{(1)} have the same parametrization of combinatorial bases and the same presentation \mathcal P/\mathcal I\,.
