Let g be an affine Lie algebra and g^L be its Langlands dual. It is conjectured that g has a positive geometric crystal whose ultra-discretization is isomorphic to the limit of certain coherent family of perfect crystals for g^L. We prove that the ultra-discretization of the positive geometric crystal for g = D_4^3 given by Igarashi and Nakashima is isomorphic to the limit of the coherent family of perfect crystals for g^L= G_2^1 constructed recently by Misra, Mohamad and Okado.
