The space T_{poly}(\mathbb R^d) of all tensor fields on \mathbb R^d, equipped with the Schouten bracket is a Lie algebra. The subspace of ascending tensors is a Lie subalgebra of T_{poly}(\mathbb R^d). In this paper, we compute the cohomology of the adjoint representations of this algebra (in itself and T_{poly}(\mathbb R^d)), when we restrict ourselves to cochains defined by aerial Kontsevitch's graphs like in our previous work (Pacific J of Math, vol 229, no 2, (2007) 257-292). As in the vectorial graphs case, the cohomology is freely generated by all the products of odd wheels.
