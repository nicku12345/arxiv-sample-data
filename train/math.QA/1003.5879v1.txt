We give a presentation in terms of generators and relations of Hopf algebras generated by skew-primitive elements and abelian group of group-like elements with action given via characters. This class of pointed Hopf algebras has shown great importance in the classification theory and can be seen as generalized quantum groups. As a consequence we get an analog presentation of Nichols algebras of diagonal type.
