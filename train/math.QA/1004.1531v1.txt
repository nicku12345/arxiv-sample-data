The present paper is a continuation of [5], where Lie bialgebra structures on g[u] were studied. These structures fall into different classes labelled by the vertices of the extended Dynkin diagram of g. In [5] the Lie bialgebras corresponding to the maximal root were classified. In the present article, we investigate the Lie bialgebras corresponding to an arbitrary simple root.
