Let V be a braided vector space, that is, a vector space together with a solution \hat{R}\in {\text{End}}(V\otimes V) of the Yang--Baxter equation. Denote T(V):=\bigoplus_k V^{\otimes k}. We associate to \hat{R} a solution T(\hat{R})\in {\text{End}}(T(V)\otimes T(V)) of the Yang--Baxter equation on the tensor space T(V). The correspondence \hat{R}\rightsquigarrow T(\hat{R}) is functorial with respect to V.
