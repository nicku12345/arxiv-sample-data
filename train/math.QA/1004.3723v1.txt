We classify Nichols algebras of irreducible Yetter-Drinfeld modules over nonabelian groups satisfying an inequality for the dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree two. All such Nichols algebras are finite-dimensional, and all known finite-dimensional Nichols algebras of nonabelian group type appear in the result of our classification. We find a new finite-dimensional Nichols algebra over fields of characteristic two.
