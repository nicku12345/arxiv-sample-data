We recall the notion of a Hopf (co)quasigroup defined in \cite{Kl09} and define integration and Fourier Transforms on these objects analogous to those in the theory of Hopf algebras. Using the general Hopf module theory for Hopf (co)quasigroups from \cite{Br09} we show that a finite dimensional Hopf (co)quasigroup has a unique integration up to scale and an invertible antipode. We also supply the inverse Fourier transformation and show that it maps the convolution product on H to the product in its dual H^*. Finally, we further develop the theory to consider Frobenius Hopf (co)quasigroups, separability and semisimplicity.
