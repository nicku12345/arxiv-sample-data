Definitions of actions of Hopf quasigroups are discussed in the context of Long dimodules and smash products. In particular, Long dimodules are defined for Hopf quasigroups and coquasigroups, and solutions to Militaru's D-equation are constructed. A necessary compatibility condition between action and multiplication of a Hopf quasigroup acting on its quasimodule Hopf quasigroup for a smash product construction is derived.
