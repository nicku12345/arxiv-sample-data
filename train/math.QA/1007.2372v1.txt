We introduce a common generalization of the L-R-smash product and twisted tensor product of algebras, under the name L-R-twisted tensor product of algebras. We investigate some properties of this new construction, for instance we prove a result of the type "invariance under twisting" and we show that under certain circumstances L-R-twisted tensor products of algebras may be iterated.
