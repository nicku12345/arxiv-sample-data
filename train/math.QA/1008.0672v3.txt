An algebraic analysis framework for quantum calculus is proposed. The quantum derivative operator D_{\tau ,\sigma} is based on two commuting bijections \tau and \sigma defined on an arbitrary set M equipped with a tension structure determined by a single tension function \theta, i.e. a 1-dimensional case is analyzed here. The well known cases, i.e. h- and q-calculi together with their symmetric versions, can be obtained owing to special choice of mappings \tau and \sigma.
