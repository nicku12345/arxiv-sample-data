The branching coefficients in the expansion of the elementary symmetric function multiplied by a symmetric Macdonald polynomial P_\kappa(z) are known explicitly. These formulas generalise the known r=1 case of the Pieri-type formulas for the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials E_\eta(z). In this paper we extend beyond the case r=1 for the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials, giving the full generalisation of the Pieri-type formulas for symmetric Macdonald polynomials. The decomposition also allows the evaluation of the generalised binomial coefficients \tbinom{\eta }{\nu }_{q,t} associated with the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials.
