We give a construction of a Dirac operator on a quantum group based on any simple Lie algebra of classical type. The Dirac operator is an element in the vector space U_q(\g) \otimes \mathrm{cl}_q(\g) where the second tensor factor is a q-deformation of the classical Clifford algebra. The tensor space  U_q(\g) \otimes \mathrm{cl}_q(\g) is given a structure of the adjoint module of the quantum group and the Dirac operator is invariant under this action. The purpose of this approach is to construct equivariant Fredholm modules and K-homology cycles. This work generalizes the operator introduced by Bibikov and Kulish in \cite{BK}.
