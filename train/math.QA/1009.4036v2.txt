We study the Gram matrix determinants for the groups S_n,O_n,B_n,H_n, for their free versions S_n^+,O_n^+,B_n^+,H_n^+, and for the half-liberated versions O_n^*,H_n^*. We first collect all the known computations of such determinants, along with complete and simplified proofs, and with generalizations where needed. We conjecture that all these determinants decompose as D=\prod_\pi\phi(\pi), with product over all associated partitions.
