A method of constructing (finitely generated and projective) right module structure on a finitely generated projective left module over an algebra is presented. This leads to a construction of a first order differential calculus on such a module which admits a hom-connection or a divergence. Properties of integrals associated to this divergence are studied, in particular the formula of integration by parts is derived. Specific examples include inner calculi on a noncommutative algebra, the Berezin integral on the supercircle and integrals on Hopf algebras.
