We introduce the notion of quantum Schur (or q-Schur) superalgebras. These algebras share certain nice properties with q-Schur algebras such as base change property, existence of canonical \mathbb Z[v,v^{-1}]-bases, and the duality relation with quantum matrix superalgebra \sA(m|n). We also construct a cellular \mathbb Q(\up)-basis and determine its associated cells, called super-cells, in terms of a Robinson--Schensted--Knuth super-correspondence. In this way, we classify all irreducible representations over \mathbb Q(\up) via super-cell modules.
