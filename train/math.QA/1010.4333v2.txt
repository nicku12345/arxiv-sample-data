Let C be a fusion category which is an extension of a fusion category D by a finite group G. We classify module categories over C in terms of module categories over D and the extension data (c,M,a) of C. We also describe functor categories over C (and in particular the dual categories of C). We use this in order to classify module categories over the Tambara Yamagami fusion categories, and their duals.
