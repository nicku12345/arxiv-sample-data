We show that all finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebras with the same diagram in the classification scheme of Andruskiewitsch and Schneider are cocycle deformations of each other. This is done by giving first a suitable characterization of such Hopf algebras, which allows for the application of results by Masuoka about Morita-Takeuchi equivalence and by Schauenburg about Hopf Galois extensions. We also outline a method to describe the deforming cocycles involved using the exponential map and its q-analogue.
