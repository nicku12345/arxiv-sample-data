We define a super version of the Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebra, \mathcal{H}_1. For that, we consider the supergroup G^s=Diff^+(\mathbb{R}^{1,1}) of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the superline \mathbb{R}^{1,1} and define two (super) subgroups G^s_1 and G^s_2 of G^s where G^s_1 is the supergroup of affine transformations. The super Hopf algebra \mathcal{H} ^s_1 is defined as a certain bicrossproduct super Hopf algebra of the super Hopf algebras attached to G^s_1 and G^s_2. We also give an explicit description of \mathcal{H} ^s_1 in terms of generators and relations.
