Quantum calculus based on the right invertible divided difference operator D_{\sigma}^{\tau} is proposed here in context of algebraic analysis \cite{DPR}. The linear operator D_{\sigma}^{\tau}, specified with the help of two fixed maps \sigma\;, \tau\colon M\rightarrow M, generalizes the quantum derivative operator used in h- or q-calculus \cite{kac}. In the domain of D_{\sigma}^{\tau} there are special elements defined as D_{\sigma}^{\tau}-polynomials and the corresponding Taylor formula is proved.
