Let \mathfrak g be a Kac-Moody algebra. We show that every homogeneous right coideal subalgebra U of the multiparameter version of the quantized universal enveloping algebra U_q(\mathfrak{g}), q^m\neq 1 containing all group-like elements has a triangular decomposition U=U^-\otimes_{{\bf k}[F]} {\bf k}[H] \otimes_{{\bf k}[G]} U^+, where U^- and  U^+ are right coideal subalgebras of negative and positive quantum Borel subalgebras. However if  U_1 and  U_2 are arbitrary right coideal subalgebras of respectively positive and negative quantum Borel subalgebras, then the triangular composition  U_2\otimes_{{\bf k}[F]} {\bf k}[H]\otimes_{{\bf k}[G]} U_1 is a right coideal but not necessary a subalgebra. Using a recent combinatorial classification of right coideal subalgebras of the quantum Borel algebra U_q^+(\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}), we find a necessary condition for the triangular composition to be a right coideal subalgebra of U_q(\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}).   If q has a finite multiplicative order t>4, similar results remain valid for homogeneous right coideal subalgebras of the multiparameter version of the small Lusztig quantum groups u_q({\frak g}), u_q(\frak{so}_{2n+1}).
