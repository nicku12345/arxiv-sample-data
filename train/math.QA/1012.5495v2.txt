Given a complex manifold M with an open dense subset \Omega endowed with a pseudo-Kaehler form \omega which cannot be smoothly extended to a larger open subset, we consider various examples where the corresponding Kaehler-Poisson structure and a star product with separation of variables on (\Omega, \omega) admit smooth extensions to M. We suggest a simple criterion of the existence of a smooth extension of a star product and apply it to these examples.
