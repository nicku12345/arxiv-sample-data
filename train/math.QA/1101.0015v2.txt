We study natural cluster structures in the rings of regular functions on simple complex Lie groups and Poisson-Lie structures compatible with these cluster structures. According to our main conjecture, each class in the Belavin-Drinfeld classification of Poisson-Lie structures on \G corresponds to a cluster structure in \O(\G). We prove a reduction theorem explaining how different parts of the conjecture are related to each other. The conjecture is established for SL_n, n<5, and for any \G in the case of the standard Poisson-Lie structure.
