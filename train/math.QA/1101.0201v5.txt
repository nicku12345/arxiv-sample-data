Let G' be a closed subgroup of a topological group G. A principal G-bundle X is reducible to a locally trivial principal G'-bundle X' if and only if there exists a local trivialisation of X such that all transition functions take values in G'. We prove a noncommutative-geometric counterpart of this theorem. To this end, we employ the concept of a piecewise-trivial principal comodule algebra as a replacement of a locally trivial compact principal bundle. To illustrate our theorem, first we define a new noncommutative deformation of the \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}-principal bundle S^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}P^2 that yields a piecewise-trivial principal comodule algebra. It is the C*-algebra of a quantum cube whose each face is given by the Toeplitz algebra. The \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}-invariant subalgebra defines the C*-algebra of a quantum \mathbb{R}P^2. It is given as a triple-pullback of Toeplitz algebras. Next, we prolongate this noncommutative \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}-principal bundle to a noncommutative U(1)-principal bundle, so that the former becomes a reduction of the latter thus instantiating our theorem. Moreover, using K-theory results, we prove that the prolongated noncommutative bundle is not trivial.
