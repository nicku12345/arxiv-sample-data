In a previous paper, we presented an infinite dimensional associative diagram algebra that satisfies the relations of the generalized Temperley--Lieb algebra having a basis indexed by the fully commutative elements of the Coxeter group of type affine C. We also provided an explicit description of a basis for the diagram algebra. In this paper, we show that the diagrammatic representation is faithful and establish a correspondence between the basis diagrams and the so-called monomial basis of the Temperley--Lieb algebra of type affine C.
