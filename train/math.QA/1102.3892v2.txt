We define a new q-deformation of Brauer's centralizer algebra which contains Hecke algebras of type A as unital subalgebras. We determine its generic structure as well as the structure of certain semisimple quotients. This is expected to have applications for constructions of subfactors of type II_1 factors and for module categories of fusion categories of type A corresponding to certain symmetric spaces.
