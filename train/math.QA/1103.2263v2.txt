Using the machinery provided by a Frobenius algebra we show how the antipode of a quasi-Hopf algebra H carries out left or right cointegrals for H. These formulas will allow us to find out the explicit form of an integral and a cointegral for the quantum double D(H) of H in terms of those of H, and so to answer to a conjecture of Hausser and Nill raised at the end of the nineties.
