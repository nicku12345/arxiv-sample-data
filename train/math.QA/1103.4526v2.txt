We classify Nichols algebras of irreducible Yetter-Drinfeld modules over groups such that the underlying rack is braided and the homogeneous component of degree three of the Nichols algebra satisfies a given inequality. This assumption turns out to be equivalent to a factorization assumption on the Hilbert series. Besides the known Nichols algebras we obtain a new example. Our method is based on a combinatorial invariant of the Hurwitz orbits with respect to the action of the braid group on three strands.
