In this paper, we study the representation theory for the affine Lie algebra \H associated to the Nappi-Witten model H_{4}. We classify all the irreducible highest weight modules of \H. Furthermore, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for each \H-(generalized) Verma module to be irreducible. For reducible ones, we characterize all the linearly independent singular vectors. Finally, we construct Wakimoto type modules for these Lie algebras and interpret this construction in terms of vertex operator algebras and their modules.
