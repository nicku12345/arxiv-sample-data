We study representations of U_q(su(1,1)) that can be considered as quantum analogs of tensor products of irreducible *-representations of the Lie algebra su(1,1). We determine the decomposition of these representations into irreducible *-representations of U_q(su(1,1)) by diagonalizing the action of the Casimir operator on suitable subspaces of the representation spaces. This leads to an interpretation of the big q-Jacobi polynomials and big q-Jacobi functions as quantum analogs of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
