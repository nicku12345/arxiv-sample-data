Exact sequences of Feigin-Stoyanovsky's type subspaces for affine Lie algebra \mathfrak{sl}(l+1,\mathbb{C})^{\widetilde{}} lead to systems of recurrence relations for formal characters of those subspaces. By solving the corresponding system for \mathfrak{sl}(3,\mathbb{C})^{\widetilde{}}, we obtain a new family of character formulas for all Feigin-Stoyanovsky's type subspaces at general level.
