We compute the indecomposable objects of \dot{U}^+_3 - the category that categorifies the positive half of the quantum sl_3, and we decompose an arbitrary object into indecomposable ones. On decategorified level we obtain the Lusztig's canonical basis of the positive half U^+_q(sl_3) of the quantum sl_3. We also categorify the higher quantum Serre relations in U_q^+(sl_3), by defining a certain complex in the homotopy category of \dot{U}^+_3 that is homotopic to zero. We work with the category \dot{U}^+_3 that is defined over the ring of integers. This paper is based on the (extended) diagrammatic calculus introduced to categorify quantum groups.
