In this note, we prove that, for a finite-dimensional Lie algebra \mathfrak g over a field \mathbb K of characteristic 0 which contains \mathbb C, the Chevalley--Eilenberg complex \mathrm U(\mathfrak g)\otimes \wedge(\mathfrak g), which is in a natural way a deformation quantization of the Koszul complex of \mathrm S(\mathfrak g), is A_\infty-quasi-isomorphic to the deformation quantization of the A_\infty-bimodule K=\mathbb K provided by the Formality Theorem in presence of two branes (CFFR).
