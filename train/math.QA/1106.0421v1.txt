The first steps towards linearisation of partial orders and equivalence relations are described. The definitions of partial orders and equivalence relations (on sets) are formulated in a way that is standard in category theory and that makes the linearisation (almost) automatic. The linearisation is then achieved by replacing sets by coalgebras and the Cartesian product by the tensor product of vector spaces. As a result, definitions of orders and equivalence relations on coalgebras are proposed. These are illustrated by explicit examples that include relations on colagebras spanned by grouplike elements (or linearised sets), the diagonal relation, and an order on a three-dimensional non-cocommutative coalgebra. Although relations on coalgebras are defined for vector spaces, all the definitions are formulated in a way that is immediately applicable to other braided monoidal categories.
