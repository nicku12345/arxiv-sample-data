The aim of this note is to define for any e_n-algebra A and a compact parallelizable n-manifold M without borders a morphism from the homology of homotopy Lie algebra A[n-1] to the topological chiral homology of M with coefficients in A. This map plays a crucial role in the perturbative Chern-Simons theory.
