We prove that the quantum group inclusion O_n \subset O_n^* is "maximal", where O_n is the usual orthogonal group and O_n^* is the half-liberated orthogonal quantum group, in the sense that there is no intermediate compact quantum group O_n\subset G\subset O_n^*. In order to prove this result, we use: (1) the isomorphism of projective versions PO_n^*\simeq PU_n, (2) some maximality results for classical groups, obtained by using Lie algebras and some matrix tricks, and (3) a short five lemma for cosemisimple Hopf algebras.
