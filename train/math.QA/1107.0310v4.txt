We classify twisted conjugacy classes of type D associated to the sporadic simple groups. This is an important step in the program of the classification of finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras with non-abelian coradical. As a by-product we prove that every complex finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebra over the group of automorphisms of M12, J2, Suz, He, HN, T is the group algebra. In the appendix we improve the study of conjugacy classes of type D in sporadic simple groups.
