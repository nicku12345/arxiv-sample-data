A new quantization of groupoids under the name of \times-Hopf coalgebras is introduced. We develop a Hopf cyclic theory with coefficients in stable-anti-Yetter-Drinfeld modules for \times-Hopf coalgebras. We use \times-Hopf coalgebras to study coextensions of coalgebras. Finally, equivariant \times-Hopf coalgebra Galois coextensions are defined and applied as functors between categories of stable anti-Yetter-Drinfeld modules over \times-Hopf coalgebras involved in the coextension.
