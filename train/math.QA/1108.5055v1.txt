This paper describes the Leray spectral sequence associated to a differential fibration. The differential fibration is described by base and total differential graded algebras. The cohomology used is noncommutative differential sheaf cohomology. For this purpose, a sheaf over an algebra is a left module with zero curvature covariant derivative. As a special case, we can recover the Serre spectral sequence for a noncommutative fibration.
