From a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} satisfying \mathcal{Z}(\mathfrak{g})=0 and \Lambda^2(\mathfrak{g})^\mathfrak{g}=0 (in particular, for \g semisimple) we describe explicitly all Lie bialgebra structures on extensions of the form \mathfrak{L} =\mathfrak{g}\times \mathbb{K} in terms of Lie bialgebra structures on \mathfrak{g} (not necessarily factorizable nor quasi-triangular) and its biderivations, for any field \mathbb{K} with char \mathbb{K}=0. If moreover, [\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]=\mathfrak{g}, then we describe also all Lie bialgebra structures on extensions \mathfrak{L} =\mathfrak{g}\times \mathbb{K}^n. In interesting cases we characterize the Lie algebra of biderivations.
