In paper arXiv:1109.6031 the author introduced stable formality quasi-isomorphisms and described the set of its homotopy classes. This result can be interpreted as a complete description of formal quantization procedures. In this note we give a brief exposition of stable formality quasi-isomorphisms and prove that every homotopy class of stable formality quasi-isomorphisms contains a representative which admits globalization. This note is loosely based on the talk given by the author at the XXX Workshop on Geometric Methods in Physics in Bialowieza, Poland.
