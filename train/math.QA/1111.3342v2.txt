We study the Calabi-Yau property of pointed Hopf algebra U(\mc{D},\lmd) of finite Cartan type. It turns out that this class of pointed Hopf algebras constructed by N. Andruskiewitsch and H.-J. Schneider contains many Calabi-Yau Hopf algebras. To give concrete examples of new Calabi-Yau Hopf algebras, we classify the Calabi-Yau pointed Hopf algebras U(\mc{D},\lmd) of dimension less than 5.
