Let H be a finite dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra and R a braided Hopf algebra in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H. When R is a Calabi-Yau algebra, a necessary and sufficient condition for R#H to be a Calabi-Yau Hopf algebra is given. Conversely, when H is the group algebra of a finite group and the smash product R#H is a Calabi-Yau algebra, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the algebra R to be a Calabi-Yau algebra.
