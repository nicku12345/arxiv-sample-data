Let (R^{\vee},R) be a dual pair of Hopf algebras in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over a Hopf algebra H with bijective antipode. We show that there is a braided monoidal isomorphism between rational left Yetter-Drinfeld modules over the bosonizations of R and of R^{\vee}, respectively. As an application of this very general category isomorphism we obtain a natural proof of the existence of reflections of Nichols algebras of semisimple Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H.   Key words: Hopf algebras, quantum groups, Weyl groupoid
