The extended affine Lie algebra \widetilde{\frak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C}_q)} is quantized from three different points of view in this paper, which produces three noncommutative and noncocommutative Hopf algebra structures, and yield other three quantizations by an isomorphism of \widetilde{\frak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C}_q)} correspondingly. Moreover, two of these quantizations can be restricted to the extended affine Lie algebra {sl_2(\mathbb{C}_q)}.
