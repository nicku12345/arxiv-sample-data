An overview of the basic results on Macdonald(-Koornwinder) polynomials and double affine Hecke algebras is given. We develop the theory in such a way that it naturally encompasses all known cases. Among the basic properties of the Macdonald polynomials we treat are the quadratic norm formulas, duality and the evaluation formulas. This text is a provisional version of a chapter on Macdonald polynomials for volume 5 of the Askey-Bateman project, entitled "Multivariable special functions".
