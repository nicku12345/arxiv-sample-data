We find an analytic formulation of the notion of Hopf image, in terms of the associated idempotent state. More precisely, if \pi:A\to M_n(\mathbb C) is a finite dimensional representation of a Hopf C^*-algebra, we prove that the idempotent state associated to its Hopf image A' must be the convolution Ces\`aro limit of the linear functional \phi=tr\circ\pi. We discuss then some consequences of this result, notably to inner linearity questions.
