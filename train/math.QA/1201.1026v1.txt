The concept of polynomials in the sense of algebraic analysis, for a single right invertible linear operator, was introduced and studied originally by D. Przeworska-Rolewicz \cite{DPR}. One of the elegant results corresponding with that notion is a purely algebraic version of the Taylor formula, being a generalization of its usual counterpart, well known for functions of one variable. In quantum calculus there are some specific discrete derivations analyzed, which are right invertible linear operators \cite{kac}. Hence, with such quantum derivations one can associate the corresponding concept of algebraic polynomials and consequently the quantum calculus version of Taylor formula \cite{MULT2}. In the present paper we define and analyze, in the sense of algebraic analysis, polynomials corresponding with a given family of right invertible operators. Within this approach we generalize the usual polynomials of several variables.
