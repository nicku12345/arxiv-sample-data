We study the discrete groups \Lambda whose duals embed into a given compact quantum group, \hat{\Lambda}\subset G. In the matrix case G\subset U_n^+ the embedding condition is equivalent to having a quotient map \Gamma_U\to\Lambda, where F=\{\Gamma_U|U\in U_n\} is a certain family of groups associated to G. We develop here a number of techniques for computing F, partly inspired from Bichon's classification of group dual subgroups \hat{\Lambda}\subset S_n^+. These results are motivated by Goswami's notion of quantum isometry group, because a compact connected Riemannian manifold cannot have non-abelian group dual isometries.
