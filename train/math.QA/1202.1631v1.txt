In [4], some quasi-Hopf algebras of dimension n^{3}, which can be understood as the quasi-Hopf analogues of Taft algebras, are constructed. Moreover, the quasi-Hopf analogues of generalized Taft algebras are considered in [7], where the language of the dual of a quasi-Hopf algebra is used. The Drinfeld doubles of such quasi-Hopf algebras are computed in this paper. The authors in [5] shew that the Drinfeld double of a quasi-Hopf algebra of dimension n^{3} constructed in [4] is always twist equivalent to Lusztig's small quantum group u_q(sl_2) if n is odd. Based on computations and analysis, we show that this is \emph{not} the case if n is even. That is, the quasi-Hopf analogue Qu_q(sl_2) of u_q(sl_2) is gotten.
