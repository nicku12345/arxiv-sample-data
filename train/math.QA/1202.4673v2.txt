Let \mathbb F denote a field, and fix a nonzero q\in\mathbb F such that q^4\not=1. The universal Askey-Wilson algebra \Delta_q is the associative \mathbb F-algebra defined by generators and relations in the following way. The generators are A, B, C. The relations assert that each of A+\frac{qBC-q^{-1}CB}{q^2-q^{-2}}, B+\frac{qCA-q^{-1}AC}{q^2-q^{-2}}, C+\frac{qAB-q^{-1}BA}{q^2-q^{-2}} is central in \Delta_q. The universal DAHA \hat H_q of type (C_1^\vee,C_1) is the associative \mathbb F-algebra defined by generators \lbrace t^{\pm1}_i\rbrace_{i=0}^3 and relations (i) t_i t^{-1}_i=t^{-1}_i t_i=1; (ii) t_i+t^{-1}_i is central; (iii) t_0t_1t_2t_3=q^{-1}. We display an injection of \mathbb F-algebras \psi:\Delta_q\to\hat H_q that sends A\mapsto t_1t_0+(t_1t_0)^{-1}, B\mapsto t_3t_0+(t_3t_0)^{-1}, C\mapsto t_2t_0+(t_2t_0)^{-1}. For the map \psi we compute the image of the three central elements mentioned above. The algebra \Delta_q has another central element of interest, called the Casimir element \Omega. We compute the image of \Omega under \psi. We describe how the Artin braid group B_3 acts on \Delta_q and \hat H_q as a group of automorphisms. We show that \psi commutes with these B_3 actions. Some related results are obtained.
