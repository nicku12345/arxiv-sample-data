We construct explicit Drinfel'd twists for the generalized Cartan type H Lie algebras in characteristic 0 and obtain the corresponding quantizations and their integral forms. Via making modular reductions including modulo p reduction and modulo p-restrictedness reduction, and base changes, we derive certain modular quantizations of the restricted universal enveloping algebra \mathbf u(\mathbf{H}(2n;\underline{1})) in characteristic p. They are new non-pointed Hopf algebras of truncated p-polynomial noncommutative and noncocommutative deformation of prime-power dimension p^{p^{2n}-1}, which contain the well-known Radford algebras as Hopf subalgebras. As a by-product, we also get some Jordanian quantizations for \mathfrak {sp}_{2n}.
