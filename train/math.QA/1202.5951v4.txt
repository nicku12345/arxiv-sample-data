In this paper we provide a detailed calculation of the Sweedler cohomology of the algebra of functions on (Z/2)^r, in all degrees, over a field of characteristic 2. The result is strikingly different from the characteristic 0 analog.   Then we show that there is a variant in characteristic p of the result obtained by Kassel and the author in characteristic zero, which provides a near-complete calculation of the second lazy cohomology group in the case of function algebras over a finite group.
