Let A \subseteq E be an extension of Hopf algebras such that there exists a normal left A-module coalgebra map \pi : E \to A that splits the inclusion. We shall describe the set of all coquasitriangular structures on the Hopf algebra E in terms of the datum (A, E, \pi) as follows: first, any such extension E is isomorphic to a unified product A \ltimes H, for some unitary subcoalgebra H of E (\cite{am2}). Then, as a main theorem, we establish a bijective correspondence between the set of all coquasitriangular structures on an arbitrary unified product A \ltimes H and a certain set of datum (p, \tau, u, v) related to the components of the unified product. As the main application, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for Majid's infinite dimensional quantum double D_{\lambda}(A, H) = A \bowtie_{\tau} H to be a coquasitriangular Hopf algebra. Several examples are worked out in detail.
