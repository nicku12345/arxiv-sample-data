A key theorem of Yakimov's proves that the torus-invariant prime spectra of De Concini-Kac-Procesi algebras are isomorphic as partially ordered sets to corresponding Bruhat order intervals of Weyl groups. We present examples of more general Cauchon-Goodearl-Letzter (CGL) extensions which exhibit this same phenomenon. To accomplish this, we develop a procedure for iteratively constructing poset isomorphisms between torus-invariant prime spectra of CGL extensions and Bruhat order intervals of Coxeter groups.
