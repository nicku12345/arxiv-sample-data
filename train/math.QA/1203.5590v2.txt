We introduce the notion of a crystal base of a finite dimensional q-deformed Kac module over the quantum superalgebra U_q(\gl(m|n)), and prove its existence and uniqueness. In particular, we obtain the crystal base of a finite dimensional irreducible U_q(\gl(m|n))-module with typical highest weight. We also show that the crystal base of a q-deformed Kac module is compatible with that of its irreducible quotient V(\lambda) given by Benkart, Kang and Kashiwara when V(\lambda) is an irreducible polynomial representation.
