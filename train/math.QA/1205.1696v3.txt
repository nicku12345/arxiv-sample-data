We establish some comparison results among the different parameterized Galois theories for q-difference equations, completing the work by CHatzidakis, Hardouin and Singer, that addresses the problem in the case without parameters. Our main result is the link between the abstract parameterized Galois theories, that give information on the differential properties of abstract solutions of q-difference equations, and the properties of meromorphic solutions of such equations. Notice that a linear q-difference equation with meromorphic coefficients always admits a basis of meromorphic solutions, as proven by Praagman.
