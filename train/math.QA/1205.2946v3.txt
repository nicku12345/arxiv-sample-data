In [Kyushu J. Math. 64 (2010), 81-144, arXiv:0904.2889], it is discussed that a certain subalgebra of the quantum affine algebra U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2) controls the second kind TD-algebra of type I (the degenerate q-Onsager algebra). The subalgebra, which we denote by U'_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2), is generated by e_0^+, e_1^\pm, k_i^{\pm1} (i=0,1) with e^-_0 missing from the Chevalley generators e_i^\pm, k_i^{\pm1} (i=0,1) of U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2). In this paper, we determine the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of U'_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2). Intertwiners are also determined.
