The purpose of this short note is to establish an explicit equivalence between two star products \star and \star_{\log} on the symmetric algebra \mathrm S(\mathfrak g) of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra \mathfrak g over a field \mathbb K\supset\mathbb C of characteristic 0: the differential operator of infinite order with constant coefficients realizing the equivalence is related to the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller group.
