We show that Gammelgaard's formula expressing a star product with separation of variables on a pseudo-Kaehler manifold in terms of directed graphs without cycles is equivalent to an inversion formula for an operator on a formal Fock space. We prove this inversion formula directly and thus offer an alternative approach to Gammelgaard's formula which gives more insight into the question why the directed graphs in his formula have no cycles.
