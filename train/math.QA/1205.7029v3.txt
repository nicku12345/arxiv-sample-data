For a finite-dimensional Lie algebra \mathfrak g over a field \mathbb K\supset \mathbb C, we deduce from the compatibility between cup products Kontsevich (2003, Section 8) and from the main result of Shoikhet (2001) an alternative way of re-writing Kontsevich product \star on \mathrm S(\mathfrak g) by means of the Alekseev--Torossian flat connection (Alekseev and Torossian, 2010). We deduce a similar formula directly from the Kashiwara--Vergne conjecture (Kashiwara and Vergne, 1978).
