This paper is concerned by the concept of algebra up to homotopy for a structure defined by two operations . and [,]. An important example of such a structure is the Gerstenhaber algebra (commutatitve and Lie). The notion of Gerstenhaber algebra up to homotopy (G_\infty algebra) is known. Here, we give a definition of pre-Gerstenhaber algebra (pre-commutative and pre-Lie) allowing the construction of \hbox{pre}G_\infty algebra. Given a structure of pre-commutative (Zinbiel) and pre-Lie algebra and working over the corresponding dual operads, we will give an explicit construction of the associated pre-Gerstenhaber algebra up to homotopy, this is a bicogebra (Leibniz and permutative) equipped with a codifferential which is a coderivation for the two coproducts.
