Let g be a simple Lie algebra and q transcendental. We consider the category C_P of finite-dimensional representations of the quantum loop algebra Uq(Lg) in which the poles of all l-weights belong to specified finite sets P. Given the data (g,q,P), we define an algebra A whose raising/lowering operators are constructed to act with definite l-weight (unlike those of Uq(Lg) itself). It is shown that there is a homomorphism Uq(Lg) -> A such that every representation V in C_P is the pull-back of a representation of A.
