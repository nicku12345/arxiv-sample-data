In this paper, we offer a presentation for the Weyl group of an affine reflection system R of type A_1 as well as a presentation for the so called hyperbolic Weyl group associated with an affine reflection system of type A_1. Applying these presentations to extended affine Weyl groups, and using a description of the center of the hyperbolic Weyl group, we also give a new finite presentation for an extended affine Weyl group of type A_1. Our presentation for the (hyperbolic) Weyl group of an affine reflection system of type A_1 is the first non-trivial presentation given in such a generality, and can be considered as a model for other types.
