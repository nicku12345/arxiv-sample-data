In this paper we present the general theory of cleft extensions for a cocommutative weak Hopf algebra H. For a weak left H-module algebra we obtain a bijective correspondence between the isomorphisms classes of H-cleft extensions A_{H}\hookrightarrow A, where A_{H} is the subalgebra of coinvariants, and the equivalence classes of crossed systems for H over A_H. Finally, we establish a bijection between the set of equivalence classes of crossed systems with a fixed weak H-module algebra structure and the second cohomology group H_{\varphi_{Z(A_H)}}^2(H, Z(A_H)), where Z(A_H) is the center of A_H.
