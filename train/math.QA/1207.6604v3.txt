We first study a new family of graded quiver varieties together with a new t-deformation of the associated Grothendieck rings. This provides the geometric foundations for a joint paper by Yoshiyuki Kimura and the author.   We further generalize the result of that paper to any acyclic quantum cluster algebra with arbitrary nondegenerate coefficients. In particular, we obtain the generic basis, the dual PBW basis, and the dual canonical basis. The method consists in a correction technique, which works for general quantum cluster algebras.
