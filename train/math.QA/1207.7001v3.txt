We study generalised differential structures \Omega^1,d on an algebra A, where A\tens A\to \Omega^1 given by a\tens b\to a d b need not be surjective. The finite set case corresponds to quivers with embedded digraphs, the Hopf algebra left covariant case to pairs (\Lambda^1,\omega) where \Lambda^1 is a right module and \omega a right module map, and the Hopf algebra bicovariant case corresponds to morphisms \omega:A^+\to \Lambda^1 in the category of right crossed (or Drinfeld-Radford-Yetter) modules over A. When A=U(g) the generalised left-covariant differential structures are classified by cocycles \omega\in Z^1(g,\Lambda^1). We then introduce and study the dual notion of a codifferential structure (\Omega^1,i) on a coalgebra and for Hopf algebras the self-dual notion of a strongly bicovariant differential graded algebra (\Omega,d) augmented by a codifferential i of degree -1. Here \Omega is a graded super-Hopf algebra extending the Hopf algebra \Omega^0=A and, where applicable, the dual super-Hopf algebra gives the same structure on the dual Hopf algebra. We show how to construct such objects from first order data, with both a minimal construction using braided-antisymmetrizes and a maximal one using braided tensor algebras and with dual given via braided-shuffle algebras. The theory is applied to quantum groups with \Omega^1(C_q(G)) dually paired to \Omega^1(U_q(g)), and to finite groups in relation to (super) Hopf quivers.
