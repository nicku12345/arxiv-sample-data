Given a polynomial P of partial derivatives of the Kahler metric, expressed as a linear combination of directed multigraphs, we prove a simple criterion in terms of the coefficients for P to be an invariant polynomial, i.e. invariant under the transformation of coordinates. As applications, we prove an explicit composition formula for covariant differential operators under a canonical basis, also known as invariant differential operators in the case of bounded symmetric domains. We also prove a general explicit formula of star products on Kahler manifolds.
