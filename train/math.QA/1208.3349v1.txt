The diamond cone is a combinatorial description for a basis of an indecomposable module for the nilpotent factor \mathfrak n of a semi simple Lie algebra. After N. J. Wildberger who introduced this notion, this description was achevied for \mathfrak{sl}(n), the rank 2 semi-simple Lie algebras and \mathfrak{sp}(2n). In the present work, we generalize these constructions to the Lie algebras \mathfrak{so}(2n+1). The orthogonal semistandard Young tableaux were defined by M. Kashiwara and T. Nakashima, they form a basis for the shape algebra of \mathfrak{so}(2n+1). Defining the notion of orthogonal quasistandard Young tableaux, we prove these tableaux give a basis for the diamond module for \mathfrak{so}(2n+1).
