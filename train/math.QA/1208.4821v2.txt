We prove a family of 3-term relations in the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional modules over the affine quantum algebra of type G_2 extending the celebrated T-system relations of type G_2. We show that these relations can be used to compute classes of certain irreducible modules, including classes of all minimal affinizations of type G_2. We use this result to obtain explicit formulas for dimensions of all participating modules.
