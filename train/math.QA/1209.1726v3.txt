Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. In this paper we prove that fusion categories of Frobenius-Perron dimensions 84 and 90 are of Frobenius type. Combining this with previous results in the literature, we obtain that every weakly integral fusion category of Frobenius-Perron dimension less than 120 is of Frobenius type.
