A solvable vertex model in ferromagnetic regime gives rise to a soliton cellular automaton which is a discrete dynamical system in which site variables take on values in a finite set. We study the scattering of a class of soliton cellular automata associated with the U_q(D_n^{(1)})-perfect crystal B^{2,s}. We calculate the combinatorial R matrix for all elements of B^{2,s} \otimes B^{2,1}. In particular, we show that the scattering rule for our soliton cellular automaton can be identified with the combinatorial R matrix for U_q(A_1^{(1)}) \oplus U_q(D_{n-2}^{(1)})-crystals.
