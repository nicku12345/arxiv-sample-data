Recently Cherednik and Feigin obtained several Rogers-Ramanujan type identities via the nilpotent double affine Hecke algebras (Nil-DAHA). These identities further led to a series of dilogarithm identities, some of which are known, while some are left conjectural. We confirm and explain all of them by showing the connection with Y-systems associated with (untwisted and twisted) quantum affine Kac-Moody algebras.
