We study a natural q-analogue of a class of matrices with noncommutative entries, which were first considered by Yu. I. Manin in 1988 in relation with quantum group theory, (called Manin Matrices in [5]) . These matrices we shall call q-Manin matrices(qMMs). They are defined, in the 2x2 case, by the relations M_21 M_12 = q M_12 M_21; M_22 M_12 = q M_12 M_22; [M_11;M_22] = 1/q M_21 M_12 - q M_12 M_21: They were already considered in the literature, especially in connection with the q-Mac Mahon master theorem [16], and the q-Sylvester identities [25]. The main aim of the present paper is to give a full list and detailed proofs of algebraic properties of qMMs known up to the moment and, in particular, to show that most of the basic theorems of linear algebras (e.g., Jacobi ratio theorems, Schhur complement, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and so on and so forth) have a straightforward counterpart for q-Manin matrices. We also show how this classs of matrices ?ts within the theory of quasi-determninants of Gel'fand-Retakh and collaborators (see, e.g., [17]). In the last sections of the paper, we frame our definitions within the tensorial approach to non-commutative matrices of the Leningrad school, and we show how the notion of q-Manin matrix is related to theory of Quantum Integrable Systems.
