We prove that certain acyclic cluster algebras over the complex numbers are the coordinate rings of holomorphic symplectic manifolds. We also show that the corresponding quantum cluster algebras have no non-trivial prime ideals. This allows us to give evidence for a generalization of the conjectured variant of the orbit method for quantized coordinate rings and their classical limits.
