This paper investigates the Poisson geometry of cluster algebras and the corresponding ideal theory of quantum cluster algebras. We then show how our approach can be applied to the ring theory of quantized coordinate rings. We give a new construction for the Dixmier map constructed by Yakimov from the space of symplectic leaves on \CC[G] to the space of primitive ideals on \CC_q[G] and give further evidence that this map is a homeomorphism.
