This is a paper in a series to study quantum vertex algebras and their relations with various quantum algebras. In this paper, we introduce a notion of T-type quantum vertex algebra and a notion of G-covariant \phi-coordinated quasi module for a T-type quantum vertex algebra with an automorphism group G. We refine and extend several previous results and we obtain a commutator formula for G-covariant \phi-coordinated quasi modules. As an illustrating example, we study a special case of the deformed Virasoro algebra \V_{p,q} with q=-1, to which we associate a Clifford vertex superalgebra and its G-covariant \phi-coordinated quasi modules.
