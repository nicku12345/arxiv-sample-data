We consider principal subspaces W_{L(k\Lambda_0)} and W_{N(k\Lambda_0)} of standard module L(k\Lambda_0) and generalized Verma module N(k\Lambda_0) at level k\geq 1 for affine Lie algebra of type B_2^{(1)}. By using the theory of vertex operator algebras, we find combinatorial bases of principal ubspaces in terms of quasi-particles. From quasi-particle bases, we obtain character formulas for W_{L(k\Lambda_0)} and W_{N(k\Lambda_0)}.
