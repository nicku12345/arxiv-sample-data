Let \M_{n\times n} be the algebra of all n\times n matrices. For x,y\in {R}^{n} it is said that x is majorized by y if there is a double stochastic matrix A\in {M}_{n\times n} such that x=Ay (denoted by x\prec y). Suppose that \Phi is a linear mapping from {R}^{n} into {R}^{n}, which is said to be strictly isotone if \Phi(x)\prec \Phi(y) whenever x\prec y. We say that an element \alpha\in {R}^{n} is a strictly all-isotone point if every strictly isotone \varphi at \alpha (i.e. \Phi(\alpha)\prec\Phi(y) whenever x\in {R}^{n} with \alpha\prec x, and \Phi(x)\prec\Phi(\alpha) whenever x\in {R}^{n} with x\prec \alpha) is a strictly isotone. In this paper we show that every \alpha=(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},...,\alpha_{n})\in {R}^{n} with \alpha_{1}>\alpha_{2}>...>\alpha_{n} is a strictly all-isotone point.
