We construct chiral algebras that centralize rank-two Nichols algebras with at least one fermionic generator. This gives "logarithmic" W-algebra extensions of a fractional-level ^sl(2) algebra. We discuss crucial aspects of the emerging general relation between Nichols algebras and logarithmic CFT models: (i) the extra input, beyond the Nichols algebra proper, needed to uniquely specify a conformal model; (ii) a relation between the CFT counterparts of Nichols algebras connected by Weyl groupoid maps; and (iii) the common double bosonization U(X) of such Nichols algebras. For an extended chiral algebra, candidates for its simple modules that are counterparts of the U(X) simple modules are proposed, as a first step toward a functorial relation between U(X) and W-algebra representation categories.
