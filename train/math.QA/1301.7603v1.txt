A theory of quasi modules at infinity for (weak) quantum vertex algebras including vertex algebras was previously developed in \cite{li-infinity}. In this current paper, quasi modules at infinity for vertex algebras are revisited. Among the main results, we extend some technical results, to fill in a gap in the proof of a theorem therein, and we obtain a commutator formula for general quasi modules at infinity and establish a version of the converse of the aforementioned theorem.
