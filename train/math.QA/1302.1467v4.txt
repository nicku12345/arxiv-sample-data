We study properties of solutions of Q-systems in the WZW fusion ring obtained by the Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules. We make a conjecture about their positivity and periodicity and give a proof of it in some cases. We also construct a positive solution of the level k restricted Q-system of classical types in the fusion rings. As an application, we prove some conjectures of Kirillov and Kuniba-Nakanishi-Suzuki on the level k restricted Q-systems.
