By applying Miyamoto's \mathbb{Z}_{3}-orbifold construction to the lattice vertex operator algebras associated to Niemeier lattices and their automorphisms of order 3, we construct holomorphic vertex operator algebras of central charge 24 whose Lie algebras of the weight one spaces are of types A_{2,3}^6, E_{6,3}G_{2,1}^{3}, and A_{5,3}D_{4,3}A_{1,1}^{3}, which correspond to No.6, No.17, and No.32 on Schellekens' list, respectively.
