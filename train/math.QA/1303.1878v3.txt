The notion of normal quantum subgroup introduced in algebraic context by Parshall and Wang when applied to compact quantum groups is shown to be equivalent to the notion of normal quantum subgroup introduced by the author. As applications, a quantum analog of the third fundamental isomorphism theorem for groups is obtained, which is used along with the equivalence theorem to obtain results on structure of quantum groups with property F and quantum groups with property FD. Other results on normal quantum subgroups for tensor products, free products and crossed products are also proved.
