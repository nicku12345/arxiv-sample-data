With the motivation of giving a more precise estimation of the quantum Brauer group of a Hopf algebra H over a field k we construct an exact sequence containing the quantum Brauer group of a Hopf algebra in a certain braided monoidal category. Let B be a Hopf algebra in \C=_H ^H\YD, the category of Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over H. We consider the quantum Brauer group \BQ(\C; B) of B in \C, which is isomorphic to the usual quantum Brauer group \BQ(k; B\rtimes H) of the Radford biproduct Hopf algebra B\rtimes H. We show that under certain symmetricity condition on the braiding in \C there is an inner action of the Hopf automorphism group of B on the former. We prove that the subgroup \BM(\C; B) - the Brauer group of module algebras over B in \C - is invariant under this action for a family of Radford biproduct Hopf algebras. The analogous invariance we study for \BM(k; B\rtimes H). We apply our recent results on the latter group and generate a new subgroup of the quantum Brauer group of B\rtimes H. In particular, we get new information on the quantum Brauer groups of some known Hopf algebras.
