In the present article we discuss the classification of quantum groups whose quasi-classical limit is a given simple complex Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. This problem reduces to the classification of all Lie bialgebra structures on \mathfrak{g}(\mathbb{K}), where \mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}((\hbar)). The associated classical double is of the form \mathfrak{g}(\mathbb{K})\otimes_{\mathbb{K}} A, where A is one of the following: \mathbb{K}[\epsilon], where \epsilon^{2}=0, \mathbb{K}\oplus \mathbb{K} or \mathbb{K}[j] where j^{2}=\hbar. The first case relates to quasi-Frobenius Lie algebras. In the second and third cases we introduce a theory of Belavin-Drinfeld cohomology associated to any non-skewsymmetric r-matrix from the Belavin-Drinfeld list. We prove a one-to-one correspondence between gauge equivalence classes of Lie bialgebra structures on \mathfrak{g}(\mathbb{K}) and cohomology classes (in case II) and twisted cohomology classes (in case III) associated to any non-skewsymmetric r-matrix.
