We show that any compact quantum group having the same fusion rules as the ones of SO(3) is the quantum automorphism group of a pair (A, \varphi), where A is a finite dimensional C^*-algebra endowed with a homogeneous faithful state. We also study the representation category of the quantum automorphism group of (A, \varphi) when \varphi is not necessarily positive, generalizing some known results, and we discuss the possibility of classifying the cosemisimple (not necessarily compact) Hopf algebras whose corepresentation semi-ring is isomorphic to that of SO(3).
