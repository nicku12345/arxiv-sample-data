We give a realization of the level zero fundamental weight representation W(\varpi_k) of the quantum affine algebra U_q'(\mf{g}), when \mf{g} has a maximal parabolic subalgebra of type C_n. We define a semisimple U'_q({\mf g})-module structure on \E^{\otimes 2} in terms of q-deformed Clifford generators, where \E is the exterior algebra generated by a dual natural representation V of U_q(\mf{sl}_{n}). We show that each W(\varpi_k) appears as an irreducible summand (not necessarily multiplicity free) in \E^{\otimes 2}. As a byproduct, we obtain a simple description of the affine crystal structure of W(\varpi_k) in terms of n\times 2 binary matrices and their (\mf{sl}_n,\mf{sl}_2)-bicrystal structure.
