We study the bialgebra structure of the Hall algebra of two-periodic complexes recently introduced by Bridgeland. We introduce coproduct on Bridgeland's Hall algebra, and show that in the hereditary case the resulting bialgebra structure coincides with that on Drinfeld double of the ordinary Hall algebra
