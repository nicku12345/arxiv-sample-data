Let O be a closed Poisson conjugacy class of the complex algebraic Poisson group GL(n) relative to the Drinfeld-Jimbo factorizable classical r-matrix. Denote by T the maximal torus of diagonal matrices in GL(n). With every a\in O\cap T we associate a highest weight module M_a over the quantum group U_q(gl(n)) and an equivariant quantization C_{h,a}[O] of the polynomial ring C[O] realized by operators on M_a. All quantizations C_{h,a}[O] are isomorphic and can be regarded as different exact representations of the same algebra, C_{h}[O]. Similar results are obtained for semisimple adjoint orbits in gl(n) equipped with the canonical GL(n)-invariant Poisson structure.
