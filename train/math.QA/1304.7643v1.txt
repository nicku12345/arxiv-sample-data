We show that there exists a Galois correspondence between subalgebras of an H-comodule algebra A over a base ring R and generalised quotients of a Hopf algebra H if both A and H are flat Mittag--Leffler modules. We also provide new criteria for subalgebras and generalised quotients to be closed elements of the Galois connection constructed. We generalise the Schauenburg theory of admissible objects to this more general context. Then we consider coextensions of H-module coalgebras. We construct a Galois connection for them and we prove that H-Galois coextensions are closed. We apply the results obtained to the Hopf algebra itself and we give a simple proof that there is a bijective correspondence between right ideal coideals of H and its left coideal subalgebras when H is finite dimensional. Furthermore, we formulate a necessary and sufficient condition for a bijective Galois correspondence for A=H. We also consider crossed product algebras.
