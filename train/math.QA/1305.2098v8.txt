We continue the study of extended T-systems of quantum affine algebras. We find a sub-system of the extended T-system of the quantum affine algebra U_q \hat{\mathfrak{g}} of type C_3. The sub-system consisting of four systems which are denoted by I, II, III, and IV. Each of the systems I, II, III, IV is closed. The systems I-IV can be used to compute minimal affinizations with weights of the form \lambda_1 \omega_1 + \lambda_2 \omega_2 + \lambda_3 \omega_3, where at least one of \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3 are zero. Using the systems I-IV, we compute the characters of the restrictions of the minimal affinizations in the systems to  U_q \mathfrak{g}  and obtain some conjectural decomposition formulas for the restrictions of some minimal affinizations.
