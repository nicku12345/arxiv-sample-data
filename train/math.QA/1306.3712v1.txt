We consider principal subspace W({\Lambda}) of integrable highest weight module L({\Lambda}) for quantum affine algebra U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{n+1}). We introduce quantum analogues of the quasi-particles associated with the principal subspaces for \hat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{n+1} and discover certain relations among them. By using these relations we find, for certain highest weight {\Lambda}, combinatorial bases of principal subspace W({\Lambda}) in terms of monomials of quantum quasi-particles.
