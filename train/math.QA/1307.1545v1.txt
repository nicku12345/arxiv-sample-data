We investigate a Hopf algebra structure on the cotensor coalgebra associated to a Hopf bimodule algebra which contains universal version of Clifford algebras and quantum groups as examples. It is shown to be the bosonization of the quantum quasi-shuffle algebra built on the space of its right coinvariants. The universal property and a Rota-Baxter algebra structure are established on this new algebra.
