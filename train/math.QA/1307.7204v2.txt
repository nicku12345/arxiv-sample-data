Given a holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle and a star-product with separation of variables on a pseudo-Kaehler manifold, we construct a star product on the sections of the endomorphism bundle of the dual bundle which also has the appropriately generalized property of separation of variables. For this star product we prove a generalization of Gammelgaard's graph-theoretic formula.
