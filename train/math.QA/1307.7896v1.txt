An explicit realization of the affine Lie algebra \hat{sl}_2(C) at the critical level is constructed using a mixture of bosons and parafermions. Subsequently a representation of the associated Lepowsky-Wilson Z-algebra is given on a space of the tensor product of bosonic fields and certain semi-infinite wedge products.
