We study natural cluster structures in the rings of regular functions on simple complex Lie groups and Poisson-Lie structures compatible with these cluster structures. According to our main conjecture, each class in the Belavin-Drinfeld classification of Poisson-Lie structures on \G corresponds to a cluster structure in \O(\G). We have shown before that this conjecture holds for any \G in the case of the standard Poisson--Lie structure and for all Belavin-Drinfeld classes in SL_n, n<5. In this paper we establish it for the Cremmer-Gervais Poisson-Lie structure on SL_n, which is the least similar to the standard one. Besides, we prove that on SL_3 the cluster algebra and the upper cluster algebra corresponding to the Cremmer-Gervais cluster structure do not coincide, unlike the case of the standard cluster structure. Finally, we show that the positive locus with respect to the   Cremmer-Gervais cluster structure is contained in the set of totally positive matrices.
