We introduce the notion of extended affine Lie superalgebras and investigate the properties of their root systems. Extended affine Lie algebras, invariant affine reflection algebras, finite dimensional basic classical simple Lie superalgebras and affine Lie superalgebras are examples of extended affine Lie superalgebras.
