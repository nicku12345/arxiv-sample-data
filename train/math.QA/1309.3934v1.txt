In this paper, the (p,q)-derivative and the (p,q)-integration are investigated. Two suitable polynomials bases for the (p,q)-derivative are provided and various properties of these bases are given. As application, two (p,q)-Taylor formulas for polynomials are given, the fundamental theorem of (p,q)-calculus is included and the formula of (p,q)-integration by part is proved.
