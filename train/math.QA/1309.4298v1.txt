We construct by fusion product new irreducible representations of the quantum affinization U_q(\hat{sl}_\infty). The action is defined via the Drinfeld coproduct and is related to the crystal structure of semi-standard tableaux of type A_\infty. We call these representations extremal loop weight modules. The main motivations are applications to quantum toroidal algebras U_q(sl_{n+1}^{tor}): we prove the conjectural link between U_q(\hat{sl}_\infty) and U_q(sl_{n+1}^{tor}) stated in [14] for this family of representations. We recover in this way the extremal loop weight modules obtained in [23].
