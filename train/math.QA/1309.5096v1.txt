For every pair of positive coprime integers, m and n, with m<n, there is an associated generalized Cremmer-Gervais r-matrix r_{m,n} for the Lie algebra sl_n which provides a nonstandard quasitriangular solution to the classical Yang-Baxter equation. We give an interpretation of r_{n-2,n} (for n odd) in terms of differential-Dunkl operators related to the polynomial representation of dihedral-type rational Cherednik algebras. Finally, we use this interpretation to partially answer a conjecture of Gerstenhaber and Giaquinto concerning boundary solutions to the classical Yang-Baxter equation.
