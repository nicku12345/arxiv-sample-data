The purpose of this paper is to consider some basic constructions in the category of compact quantum groups --for example de case of extensions, of Drinfeld twists, of matched pairs, of extensions, of linked pairs and of cocycle Singer pairs -- with special emphasis in the finite dimensional situation. We give conditions, in some cases necessary and sufficient, to extend to the new objects the original compact structure. We illustrate the results in the case of matched pairs of groups.
