The elliptic Ding-Iohara algebra is an elliptic quantum group obtained from the free field realization of the elliptic Macdonald operator. In this article, we show the construction of two families of commuting operators which contain the elliptic Macdonald operator by using the elliptic Ding-Iohara algebra and the elliptic Feigin-Odesskii algebra.
