The present article is a continuation of QA/1303.4046, where we discussed the classification of quantum groups with quasi-classical limit \mathfrak{g} and introduced a theory of Belavin-Drinfeld cohomology associated to any non-skewsymmetric r-matrix. Depending on the form of the corresponding double, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between gauge equivalence classes of Lie bialgebra structures on \mathfrak{g}\otimes_{\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{K}, where \mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}((\hbar)), and untwisted or twisted cohomology classes. In the present paper we investigate twisted cohomologies for sl(n) associated to generalized Cremmer-Gervais r-matrices, and twisted cohomologies for o(n).
