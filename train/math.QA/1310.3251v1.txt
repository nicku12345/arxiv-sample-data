We study a particular category {\cal{C}} of \gl_{\infty}-modules and a subcategory {\cal{C}}_{int} of integrable \gl_{\infty}-modules. As the main results, we classify the irreducible modules in these two categories and we show that every module in category {\cal{C}}_{int} is semi-simple. Furthermore, we determine the decomposition of the tensor products of irreducible modules in category {\cal{C}}_{int}.
