Let H be a quasi-Hopf algebra, a weak Hopf algebra or a braided Hopf algebra. Let B be an H-bicomodule algebra such that there exists a morphism of H-bicomodule algebras v:H\rightarrow B. Then we can define an object B^{co(H)} which is a left-left Yetter-Drinfeld module over H, having extra properties that allow to make a smash product B^{co(H)}# H which is an H-bicomodule algebra, isomorphic to B.
