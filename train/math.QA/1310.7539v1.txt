We define two subalgebras which can be seen as the quantization of the coordinate rings of the unipotent radical of the standard positive (respectively negative) Borel subgroup of SL_{n+1}. We give a presentation for these algebras and show they are isomorphic. Moreover, we show that these algebras are the conivariants of a natural O_q(T)-coaction on O_q(B^\pm). Finally, using a dual pairing, we show that these algebras are isomorphic to the quantum nilpotent Lie subalgebra of U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}).
