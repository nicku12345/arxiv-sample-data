The {\rm SU}(2)-prolongation of the Hopf fibration S^3\to S^2 is a trivializable principal {\rm SU}(2)-bundle. We present a noncommutative deformation of this bundle to a quantum principal {\rm SU}_q(2)-bundle that is not trivializable. On the other hand, we show that the {\rm SU}_q(2)-bundle is piecewise trivializable with respect to the closed covering of S^2 by two hemispheres intersecting at the equator.
