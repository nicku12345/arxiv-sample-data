The first cohomology group of a generalized loop Virasoro algebra with coefficients in the tensor product of its adjoint module is shown to be trivial. The result is applied to prove that Lie bialgebra structures on generalized loop Virasoro algebras are coboundary triangular. We then generalize the results to generalized map Virasoro algebras.
