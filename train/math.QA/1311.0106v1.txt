The Lie conformal algebra of loop Virasoro algebra, denoted by \mathscr{CW}, is introduced in this paper. Explicitly, \mathscr{CW} is a Lie conformal algebra with \mathbb{C}[\partial]-basis \{L_i\,|\,i\in\mathbb{C}\} and \lambda-brackets [L_i\, {}_\lambda \, L_j]=(-\partial-2\lambda) L_{i+j}. Then conformal derivations of \mathscr{CW} are determined. Finally, rank one conformal modules and \mathbb{Z}-graded free intermediate series modules over \mathscr{CW} are classified.
