In our previous publications we have introduced a differential calculus on the algebra U(gl(m)) based on a new form of the Leibniz rule which differs from that usually employed in Noncommutative Geometry. This differential calculus includes partial derivatives in generators of the algebra U(gl(m)) and their differentials. The orresponding differential algebra \Omega(U(gl(m))) is a deformation of the commutative algebra \Omega({\rm Sym}(gl(m))).A similar claim is valid for the Weyl algebra {\cal W}(U(gl(m))) generated by the algebra U(gl(m)) and the mentioned partial derivatives. In the particular case m=2 we treat the compact form U(u(2)) of this algebra as a quantization of the Minkowski space algebra. Below we consider noncommutative versions of the Klein-Gordon equation and the Schr\"odinger equation for the hydrogen atom. We show that these quantum models become in a sense discrete.For the quantum Klein-Gordon model we get (under an assumption on momenta) an analog of the plane wave, for the quantum hydrogen atom model we find the first order corrections to the ground state energy and wave function.
