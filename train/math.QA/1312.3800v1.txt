Let (H,R) be a quasitriangular weak Hopf algebra over a field k. We show that there is a braided monoidal equivalence between the Yetter-Drinfeld module category ^H_H\mathscr{YD} over H and the category of comodules over some braided Hopf algebra {}_RH in the category _H\mathscr{M}. Based on this equivalence, we prove that every braided bi-Galois object A over the braided Hopf algebra {}_RH defines a braided autoequivalence of the category ^H_H\mathscr{YD} if and only if A is quantum commutative. In case H is semisimple over an algebraically closed field, i.e. the fusion case, then every braided autoequivalence of ^H_H\mathscr{YD} trivializable on _H\mathscr{M} is determined by such a quantum commutative Galois object. The quantum commutative Galois objects in _H\mathscr{M} form a group measuring the Brauer group of (H,R) as studied in [20] in the Hopf algebra case.
