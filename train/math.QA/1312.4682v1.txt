It is quite natural to wonder whether there is a difference-differential equations, the Galois group of which is a quantum group that is neither commutative nor co-commutative. Believing that there was no such linear equations, we explored non-linear equations and discovered a such equation. We show that the example is related with a linear equation. We treat only one charming example. It is not, however, an isolated example. We open a window that allows us to have a look at a quantized Picard-Vessiot theory.
