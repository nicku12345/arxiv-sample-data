We construct all projective modules of the restricted quantum group \bar{U}_q s\ell(2|1) at an even, 2pth, root of unity. This 64p^4-dimensional Hopf algebra is a common double bosonization, B(X^*)\otimes B(X)\otimes H, of two rank-2 Nichols algebras B(X) with fermionic generator(s), with H=Z_{2p}\otimes Z_{2p}. The category of \bar{U}_q s\ell(2|1)-modules is equivalent to the category of Yetter--Drinfeld B(X)-modules in C_{\rho}={}^H_H\!YD, where coaction is defined by a universal R-matrix \rho. As an application of the projective module construction, we find the associative algebra structure and the dimension, 5p^2-p+4, of the \bar{U}_q s\ell(2|1) center.
