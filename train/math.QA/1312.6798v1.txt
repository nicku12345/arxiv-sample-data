Quantum bounded extensions of multifiltered algebras are defined, and they are endowed with a new multifiltration. The behavior of the associated multigraded rings is studied. A refiltering process allows to lift homological properties from the associated multigraded ring to the multifiltered ring. This is the full version, with proofs, of the paper entitled "Regularidad de las \'algebras envolventes cuantizadas", by the author, published in "Actas del Encuentro de Matem\'aticos Andaluces Vol. 2, pp. 493-500, ISBN 8447206394, Sevilla, 2001."
