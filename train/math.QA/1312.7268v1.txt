An arbitrary Leibniz algebra can be embedded in a differential graded Lie algebra via the derived bracket construction. Such an embedding is called a derived bracket representation. We will construct the universal version of the derived bracket representation, prove that the principal part of the target dg Lie algebra defines a subcomplex of Leibniz (co)homology complex and that the existence of the subcomplex is a reflection of the anti-cyclicity of the Leibniz operad.
