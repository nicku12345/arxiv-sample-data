The aim of this paper is to contribute more examples and classification results of finite pointed quasi-quantum groups within the quiver framework initiated in \cite{qha1, qha2}. The focus is put on finite dimensional graded Majid algebras generated by group-like elements and two skew-primitive elements which are mutually skew-commutative. Such quasi-quantum groups are associated to quasi-quantum planes in the sense of nonassociative geomertry \cite{m1, m2}. As an application, we obtain an explicit classification of graded pointed Majid algebras with abelian coradical of dimension p^3 and p^4 for any prime number p.
