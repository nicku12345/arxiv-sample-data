A fusion category of rank 4 has either four self-dual objects or exactly two self-dual objects. We study fusion categories of rank 4 with exactly two self-dual objects, giving nearly a complete classification of those based ring that admit pseudo-unitary categorification. More precisely, we show that if \mathcal{C} is such a fusion category, then its Grothendieck ring K(\mathcal{C}) must be one of seven based rings, six of which have know categorifications. In doing so, we classify all based rings associated with near-group categories of the group \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}.
