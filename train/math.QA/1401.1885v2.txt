Let \k be a field and Q a minimal Hopf quiver, i.e., a cyclic quiver or the infinite linear quiver, and let \rep^{ln}(Q) denote the category of locally nilpotent finite dimensional \k-representations of Q. The category \rep^{ln}(Q) has natural tensor structures induced from graded Hopf structures on the path coalgebra \k Q. Tensor categories of the form \rep^{ln} (Q) are an interesting class of tame hereditary pointed tensor categories which are not finite. The aim of this paper is to compute the Clebsch-Gordan formulae and Green rings of such tensor categories.
