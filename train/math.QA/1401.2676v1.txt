Supersymmetric gauge theories have played a central role in applications of quantum field theory to mathematics. Topologically twisted supersymmetric gauge theories often admit a rigorous mathematical description: for example, the Donaldson invariants of a 4-manifold can be interpreted as the correlation functions of a topologically twisted N=2 gauge theory. The aim of these lectures is to describe a mathematical formulation of partially-twisted supersymmetric gauge theories (in perturbation theory). These partially twisted theories are intermediate in complexity between the physical theory and the topologically twisted theories. Moreover, we will sketch how the operators of such a theory form a two complex dimensional analog of a vertex algebra. Finally, we will consider a deformation of the N=1 theory and discuss its relation to the Yangian, as explained in arXiv:1308.0370 and arXiv:1303.2632.
