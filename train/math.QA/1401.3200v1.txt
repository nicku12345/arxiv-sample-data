We prove the statement/conjecture of M. Kontsevich on the existence of the logarithmic formality morphism. This question was open since 1999, and the main obstacle was the presence of dr/r type singularities near the boundary r=0 in the integrals over compactified configuration spaces. The novelty of our approach is the use of local torus actions on configuration spaces of points in the upper half-plane. It gives rise to a version of Stokes' formula for differential forms with singularities at the boundary which implies the formality property.   We also show that the logarithmic formality morphism admits a globalization from \mathbb{R}^d to an arbitrary smooth manifold.
