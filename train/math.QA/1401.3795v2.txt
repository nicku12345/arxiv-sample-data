We establish the relationship among Nichols algebras, Nichols braided Lie algebras and Nichols Lie algebras. We prove two results: (i) Nichols algebra \mathfrak B(V) is finite-dimensional if and only if Nichols braided Lie algebra \mathfrak L(V) is finite-dimensional if there does not exist any m-infinity element in \mathfrak B(V); (ii) Nichols Lie algebra \mathfrak L^-(V) is infinite dimensional if  D^- is infinite. We give the sufficient conditions for Nichols braided Lie algebra \mathfrak L(V) to be a homomorphic image of a braided Lie algebra generated by V with defining relations.
