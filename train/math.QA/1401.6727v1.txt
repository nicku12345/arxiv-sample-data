The class of graded elementary quasi-Hopf algebras of tame type is classified. Combining with our previous work [19], this completes the trichotomy for such class of algebras according to their representation types. In addition, new examples of genuine elementary quasi-Hopf algebras, and accordingly finite pointed tensor categories, are provided.
