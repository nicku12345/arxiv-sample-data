The purpose of this paper is to provide new constructions of Hom-associative algebras using Hom-analogues of certain operators called twistors and pseudotwistors, by deforming a given Hom-associative multiplication into a new Hom-associative multiplication. As examples, we introduce Hom-analogues of the twisted tensor product and smash product. Furthermore we show that the construction by the ''twisting principle'' introduced by Yau and the twisting of associative algebras using pseudotwistors admit a common generalization
