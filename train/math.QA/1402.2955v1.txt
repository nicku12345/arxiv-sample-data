For any finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H we construct a group homomorphism \biga(H)\to \text{BrPic}(\Rep(H)), from the group of equivalence classes of H-biGalois objects to the group of equivalence classes of invertible exact \Rep(H)-bimodule categories. We discuss the injectivity of this map. We exemplify in the case H=T_q is a Taft Hopf algebra and for this we classify all exact indecomposable \Rep(T_q)-bimodule categories.
