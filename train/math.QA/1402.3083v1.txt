Given an arbitrary field \mathbb{F} of characteristic 0, we study Lie bialgebra structures on sl(n,\mathbb{F}), based on the description of the corresponding classical double. For any Lie bialgebra structure \delta, the classical double D(sl(n,\mathbb{F}),\delta) is isomorphic to sl(n,\mathbb{F})\otimes_{\mathbb{F}} A, where A is either \mathbb{F}[\varepsilon], with \varepsilon^{2}=0, or \mathbb{F}\oplus \mathbb{F} or a quadratic field extension of \mathbb{F}. In the first case, the classification leads to quasi-Frobenius Lie subalgebras of sl(n,\mathbb{F}). In the second and third cases, a Belavin--Drinfeld cohomology can be introduced which enables one to classify Lie bialgebras on sl(n,\mathbb{F}), up to gauge equivalence. The Belavin--Drinfeld untwisted and twisted cohomology sets associated to an r-matrix are computed. For the Cremmer--Gervais r-matrix in sl(3), we also construct a natural map of sets between the total Belavin--Drinfeld twisted cohomology set and the Brauer group of the field \mathbb{F}.
