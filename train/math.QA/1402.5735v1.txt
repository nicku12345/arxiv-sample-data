We consider the quadruples \,(\mathcal{A},\mathbb{V},D,\gamma) where \mathcal{A} is a unital, associative \mathbb{K}\,-algebra represented on the \mathbb{K}\,-vector space \mathbb{V}, D\in \mathcal{E}nd(\mathbb{V}), \gamma\in\mathcal{E}nd(\mathbb{V}) is a \mathbb{Z}_2-grading operator which commutes with \mathcal{A} and anticommutes with D. We prove that the collection of such quadruples, denoted by \,\widetilde{\mathcal{S}pec}\,, is a monoidal category. We consider the monoidal subcategory \,\widetilde{\mathcal{S}pec_{sub}}\, of objects of \,\widetilde{\mathcal{S}pec}\, for which \gamma\in\pi(\mathcal{A}). We show that there is a covariant functor \,\mathcal{G}:\widetilde{\mathcal{S}pec}\longrightarrow\widetilde{\mathcal{S}pec_{sub}}\,. Let \,\Omega_D^\bullet\, be the differential graded algebra defined by Connes ([Con2]) and DGA denotes the category of differential graded algebras over the field \mathbb{K}\,. We show that \mathcal{F}:\widetilde{\mathcal{S}pec_{sub}}\longrightarrow DGA\,, given by (\mathcal{A},\mathbb{V},D,\gamma)\longmapsto\Omega_D^\bullet(\mathcal{A}), is a monoidal functor. To show that \,\mathcal{F}\circ\mathcal{G}\, is not trivial we explicitly compute it for the cases of compact manifold and the noncommutative torus along with the associated cohomologies.
