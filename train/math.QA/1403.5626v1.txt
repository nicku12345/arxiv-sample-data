Over the quantum weighted 1-dimensional complex projective spaces, called quantum teardrops, the quantum line bundles associated with the quantum principal U(1)-bundles introduced and studied by Brzezinski and Fairfax are explicitly identified among the finitely generated projective modules which are classified up to isomorphism. The quantum lens space in which these quantum line bundles are embedded is realized as a concrete groupoid C*-algebra.
