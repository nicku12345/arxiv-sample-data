This is a survey on the state-of-the-art of the classification of finite-dimensional complex Hopf algebras. This general question is addressed through the consideration of different classes of such Hopf algebras. Pointed Hopf algebras constitute the class best understood; the classification of those with abelian group is expected to be completed soon and there is substantial progress in the non-abelian case.
