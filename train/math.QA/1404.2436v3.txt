In this paper, we give a characterization of the crystal bases \mathcal{B}_{x}^{+}(\lambda), x \in W_{\mathrm{af}}, of Demazure submodules V_{x}^{+}(\lambda), x \in W_{\mathrm{af}}, of a level-zero extremal weight module V(\lambda) over a quantum affine algebra U_{q}, where \lambda is an arbitrary level-zero dominant integral weight, and W_{\mathrm{af}} denotes the affine Weyl group. This characterization is given in terms of the initial direction of a semi-infinite Lakshmibai-Seshadri path, and is established under a suitably normalized isomorphism between the crystal basis \mathcal{B}(\lambda) of the level-zero extremal weight module V(\lambda) and the crystal \mathbb{B}^{\frac{\infty}{2}}(\lambda) of semi-infinite Lakshmibai-Seshadri paths of shape \lambda, which is obtained in our previous work. As an application, we obtain a formula expressing the graded character of the Demazure submodule V_{w_0}^{+}(\lambda) in terms of the specialization at t=0 of the symmetric Macdonald polynomial P_{\lambda}(x\,;\,q,\,t).
