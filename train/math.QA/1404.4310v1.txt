In this paper, we study a class of generalized intersection matrix Lie algebras \gim(M_n), and prove that its every finite-dimensional semi-simple quotient is of type M(n,{\bf a}, {\bf c},{\bf d}). Particularly, any finite dimensional irreducible \gim(M_n) module must be an irreducible module of M(n,{\bf a}, {\bf c},{\bf d}) and any finite dimensional irreducible M(n,{\bf a}, {\bf c},{\bf d}) module must be an irreducible module of \gim(M_n).
