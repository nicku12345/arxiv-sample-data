Denominators of normalized R-matrices provide important information on finite dimensional representations over quantum affine algebras, and over quiver Hecke algebras by the generalized quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality functors. We compute the denominators of all normalized R-matrices between fundamental representations of types A_{2n-1}^{(2)}, A_{2n}^{(2)}, B_{n}^{(1)} and D_{n+1}^{(2)}. Thus we can conclude that the normalized R-matrices of types A_{2n-1}^{(2)}, A_{2n}^{(2)}, B_{n}^{(1)} have only simple poles, and of type D_{n+1}^{(2)} have double poles under certain conditions.
