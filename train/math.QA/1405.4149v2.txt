The central notion in Connes' formulation of non commutative geometry is that of a spectral triple. Given a homogeneous space of a compact quantum group, restricting our attention to all spectral triples that are `well behaved' with respect to the group action, we construct a certain dimensional invariant. In particular, taking the (quantum) group itself as the homogeneous space, this gives an invariant for a compact quantum group. Computations of this invariant in several cases, including all type A quantum groups, are given.
