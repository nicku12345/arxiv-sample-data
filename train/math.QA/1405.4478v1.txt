In this paper, we give a unified construction of two-parameter quantum groups U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g}), two-parameter Kashiwara algebras B_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g}), two-parameter quantized Weyl algebras W_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g}) and the action of U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g}) on B_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g}) and W_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g}). Applying their properties to the category \mathcal{O}(B_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})), whose objects are "upper bounded" B_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})-modules, We can give a conceptual proof of its semi-simplicity and the classification of simple modules in it.
