We study tensor products of infinite dimensional representations (not corepresentations) of the \mathrm{SU}(2) quantum group. Eigenvectors of certain self-adjoint elements are obtained, and coupling coefficients between different eigenvectors are computed. The coupling coefficients can be considered as q-analogs of Bessel functions. As a results we obtain several q-integral identities involving q-hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials and q-Bessel-type functions.
