We introduce the notion of (G, \Gamma)-crossed action on a tensor category, where (G, \Gamma) is a matched pair of finite groups. A tensor category is called a (G, \Gamma)-crossed tensor category if it is endowed with a (G, \Gamma)-crossed action. We show that every (G, \Gamma)-crossed tensor category \mathcal C gives rise to a tensor category \mathcal C^{(G, \Gamma)} that fits into an exact sequence of tensor categories \operatorname{Rep G} \to \mathcal C^{(G, \Gamma)} \to \mathcal C. We also define the notion of a (G, \Gamma)-braiding in a (G, \Gamma)-crossed tensor category, which is connected with certain set-theoretical solutions of the QYBE. This extends the notion of G-crossed braided tensor category due to Turaev. We show that if \mathcal C is a (G, \Gamma)-crossed tensor category equipped with a (G, \Gamma)-braiding, then the tensor category \mathcal C^{(G, \Gamma)} is a braided tensor category in a canonical way.
