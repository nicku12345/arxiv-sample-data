Two new realizations, denoted U_{q,x}(\widehat{gl_2}) and U(R_{q,x}(\widehat{gl_2})) of the trigonometric dynamical quantum affine algebra U_{q,\lambda}(\widehat{gl_2}) are proposed, based on Drinfeld-currents and RLL relations respectively, along with a Heisenberg algebra \left\{P,Q\right\}, with x=q^{2P}. Here P plays the role of the dynamical variable \lambda and Q=\frac{\partial}{\partial P}. An explicit isomorphism from U_{q,x}(\widehat{gl_2}) to U(R_{q,x}(\widehat{gl_2})) is established, which is a dynamical extension of the Ding-Frenkel isomorphism of U_{q}(\widehat{gl_2}) with U(R_{q}(\widehat{gl_2})) between the Drinfeld realization and the Reshetikhin-Tian-Shanksy construction of quantum affine algebras. Hopf algebroid structures and an affine dynamical determinant element are introduced and it is shown that U_{q,x}(\widehat{sl_2}) is isomorphic to U(R_{q,x}(\widehat{sl_2})). The dynamical construction is based on the degeneration of the elliptic quantum algebra U_{q,p}(\widehat{sl_2}) of Jimbo, Konno et al. as the elliptic variable p \to 0.
