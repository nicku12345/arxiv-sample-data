We describe quantum groups given by multiparametric deformations of enveloping algebras of Kac-Moody algebras as a family of pointed Hopf algebras introduced by Andruskiewitsch and Schneider associated to a generalized Cartan matrix. We show that under some assumptions, these Hopf algebras depend only on one parameter on each connected component of the Dynkin diagram, up to a cocycle deformation. In particular, we obtain in this way a known result of Hu, Pei and Rosso.
