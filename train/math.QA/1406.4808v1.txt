We obtain the superconformal algebra associated to a sigma model with target a manifold with G_{2} holonomy, i.e., the Shatashvili-Vafa G_{2} algebra as a quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the exceptional Lie superalgebra D(2,1;\alpha) for \alpha=1. We produce the complete family of W-algebras SW(\frac{3}{2},\frac{3}{2}, 2) (extensions of the N=1 superconformal algebra by two primary supercurrents of conformal weight \frac{3}{2} and 2 respectively) as a quantum Hamiltonian reduction of D(2,1;\alpha). As a corollary we find a free field realization of the Shatashvili-Vafa G_{2} algebra, and an explicit description of the screening operators.
