In this paper the surjective homomorphism from the Drinfeld realization to the Drinfeld and Jimbo presentation of affine quantum algebras is proved to be injective. A consequence of the arguments used in the paper is the triangular decomposition of the Drinfeld realization of affine quantum algebras also in the twisted case. A presentation of the affine Kac-Moody algebras in terms of the "Drinfeld generators" is also provided.
