We construct embeddings of \widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2 in lattice vertex algebras by composing the Wakimoto realization with the Friedan-Martinec-Shenker bosonization. The Kac-Wakimoto hierarchy then gives rise to two new hierarchies of integrable, non-autonomous, non-linear partial differential equations. A new feature of our construction is that it works for any value of the central element of \widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2; that is, the level becomes a parameter in the equations.
