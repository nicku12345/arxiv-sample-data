Integral modular categories of Frobenius-Perron dimension pq^n, where p and q are primes, are considered. It is already known that such categories are group-theoretical in the cases of 0 \leq n \leq 4. In the general case we determine that these categories are either group theoretical or contain a Tannakian subcategory of dimension q^i for i>1. We then show that all integral modular categories \mathcal{C} with \mathrm{FPdim}(\mathcal{C})=pq^5 are group-theoretical, and, if in addition p<q, all with \mathrm{FPdim}(\mathcal{C})=pq^6 or pq^7 are group-theoretical. In the process we generalize an existing criterion for an integral modular category to be group-theoretical.
