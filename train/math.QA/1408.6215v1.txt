We show that if two Hopf algebras are monoidally equivalent, then their categories of bicovariant differential calculi are equivalent. We then classify, for q \in \mathbb{C}^* not a root of unity, the finite dimensional bicovariant differential calculi over the Hopf algebra \mathcal{O}_q(SL_2). Using a monoidal equivalence between free orthogonal Hopf algebras and \mathcal{O}_q(SL_2) for a given q, this leads us to the classification of finite dimensional bicovariant differential calculi over free orthogonal Hopf algebras.
