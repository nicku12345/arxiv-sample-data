Let C_n denote the representation category of a finite supergroup generated by purely odd n-dimensional vector space. We compute the Brauer-Picard group BrPic(C_n) of C_n. This is done by identifying BrPic(C_n) with the group of braided tensor autoequivalences of the Drinfeld center of C_n and studying the action of the latter group on the categorical Lagrangian Grassmannian of C_n. We show that this action corresponds to the action of a projective symplectic group on a classical Lagrangian Grassmannian.
