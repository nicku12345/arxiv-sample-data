In this article, we determine quantum dimensions and fusion rules for the orbifold code VOA  V^\tau_{L_{C \times D}}. As an application, we also construct certain 3-local subgroups inside the automorphism group of the VOA V^\sharp, where V^\sharp is a holomorphic VOA obtained by the \mathbb{Z}_3-orbifold construction on the Leech lattice VOA.
