We lay down a general framework for how to construct a Topological Quantum Field Theory Z_A defined on shaped triangulations of orientable 3-manifolds from any Pontryagin self-dual locally compact abelian group A. The partition function for a triangulated manifold is given by a state integral over the LCA A of a certain combinations of functions which satisfy Faddeev's operator five term relation. In the cases where all elements of the LCA A are divisible by 2 and it has a subgroup B whose Pontryagin dual is isomorphic to A/B, this TQFT has an alternative formulation in terms of the space of sections of a line bundle over (A/B)^{2}. We apply this to the LCA \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z} and obtain a TQFT, which we show is Quantum Chern-Simons theory at level N for the complex gauge group SL(2,\mathbb{C}) by the use of geometric quantization.
