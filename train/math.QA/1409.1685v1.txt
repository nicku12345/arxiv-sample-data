Compact quantum groups of face type, as introduced by Hayashi, form a class of compact quantum groupoids with a classical, finite set of objects. Using the notions of a weak multiplier bialgebra and weak multiplier Hopf algebra (resp. due to B{\"o}hm--G\'{o}mez-Torrecillas--L\'{o}pez-Centella and Van Daele-Wang), we generalize Hayashi's definition to allow for an infinite set of objects, and call the resulting objects partial compact quantum groups. We prove a Tannaka-Kre\breve{\textrm{\i}}n-Woronowicz reconstruction result for such partial compact quantum groups using the notion of a partial fusion C^*-category. As examples, we consider the dynamical quantum SU(2)-groups from the point of view of partial compact quantum groups.
