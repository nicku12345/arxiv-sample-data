We prove {\rm (i)} Nichols algebra \mathfrak B(V) of vector space V is finite-dimensional if and only if Nichols braided Lie algebra \mathfrak L(V) is finite-dimensional; {\rm (ii)} If the rank of connected V is 2 and \mathfrak B(V) is an arithmetic root system, then \mathfrak B(V) = F \oplus \mathfrak L(V); and {\rm (iii)} if \Delta (\mathfrak B(V)) is an arithmetic root system and there does not exist any m-infinity element with p_{uu} \not= 1 for any u \in D(V), then \dim (\mathfrak B(V) ) = \infty if and only if there exists V', which is twisting equivalent to V, such that  \dim (\mathfrak L^ - (V')) = \infty. Furthermore we give an estimation of dimensions of Nichols Lie algebras and two examples of Lie algebras which do not have maximal solvable ideals.
