Let G be a simply connected simple algebraic group over \mathbb{C}, B and B_- be two opposite Borel subgroups in G and W be the Weyl group. For u, v\in W, it is known that the coordinate ring {\mathbb C}[G^{u,v}] of the double Bruhat cell G^{u,v}=BuB\cap B_-vB_- is isomorphic to an upper cluster algebra \bar{{\mathcal A}}({\bf i})_{{\mathbb C}} and the generalized minors \{\Delta(k;{\bf i})\} are the cluster variables belonging to a given initial seed in {\mathbb C}[G^{u,v}] [Berenstein A., Fomin S., Zelevinsky A., Duke Math. J. 126 (2005), 1-52, math.RT/0305434]. In the case G={\rm SL}_{r+1}({\mathbb C}), v=e and some special u\in W, we shall describe the generalized minors \{\Delta(k;{\bf i})\} as summations of monomial realizations of certain Demazure crystals.
