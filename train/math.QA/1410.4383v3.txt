Cherednik attached to an affine Hecke algebra module a compatible system of difference equations, called quantum affine Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. In case of a principal series module we construct a basis of power series solutions of the quantum affine KZ equations. Relating the bases for different asymptotic sectors gives rise to a Weyl group cocycle, which we compute explicitly in terms of theta functions. For the spin representation of the affine Hecke algebra of type C the quantum affine KZ equations become the boundary qKZ equations associated to the Heisenberg spin-1/2 XXZ chain. We show that in this special case the results lead to an explicit 4-parameter family of elliptic solutions of the dynamical reflection equation associated to Baxter's 8-vertex face dynamical R-matrix. We use these solutions to define an explicit 9-parameter elliptic family of boundary quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard (KZB) equations.
