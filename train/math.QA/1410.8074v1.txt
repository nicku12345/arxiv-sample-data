A list of generic U_q(sl_2)-module algebra structures on the Laurent polynomial algebra over the quantum plane with uncountably many isomorphism classes is produced. Also, a complete list of such structures is presented in which the action of Cartan generator of U_q(sl_2) does not reduce to multiplying x and y (the generators of quantum plane) by constants.
