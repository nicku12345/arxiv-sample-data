Let (H, R) be a finite dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebra over a field k, and _H\mathcal{M} the representation category of H. In this paper, we study the braided autoequivalences of the Drinfeld center ^H_H\mathcal{YD} trivializable on _H\mathcal{M}. We establish a group isomorphism between the group of those autoequivalences and the group of quantum commutative bi-Galois objects of the transmutation braided Hopf algebra _RH. We then apply this isomorphism to obtain a categorical interpretation of the exact sequence of the equivariant Brauer group \mathrm{BM}(k, H,R) in [18]. To this aim, we have to develop the braided bi-Galois theory initiated by Schauenburg in [14,15], which generalizes the Hopf bi-Galois theory over usual Hopf algebras to the one over braided Hopf algebras in a braided monoidal category.
