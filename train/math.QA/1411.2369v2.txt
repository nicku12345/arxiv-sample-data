We study the cohomology of complexes of ordinary (non-decorated) graphs, introduced by M. Kontsevich. We construct spectral sequences converging to zero whose first page contains the graph cohomology. In particular, these series may be used to show the existence of an infinite series of previously unknown and provably non-trivial cohomology classes, and put constraints on the structure of the graph cohomology as a whole.
