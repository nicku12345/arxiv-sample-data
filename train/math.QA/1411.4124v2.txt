In this paper, we find the fusion rules for the free wreath product quantum groups \mathbb{G}\wr_*S_N^+ for all compact matrix quantum groups of Kac type \mathbb{G} and N\ge4. This is based on a combinatorial description of the intertwiner spaces between certain generating representations of \mathbb{G}\wr_*S_N^+. The combinatorial properties of the intertwiner spaces in \mathbb{G}\wr_*S_N^+ then allows us to obtain several probabilistic applications. We then prove the monoidal equivalence between \mathbb{G}\wr_*S_N^+ and a compact quantum group whose dual is a discrete quantum subgroup of the free product \widehat{\mathbb{G}}*\widehat{SU_q(2)}, for some 0<q\le1. We obtain as a corollary certain stability results for the operator algebras associated with the free wreath products of quantum groups such as Haagerup property, weak amenability and exactness.
