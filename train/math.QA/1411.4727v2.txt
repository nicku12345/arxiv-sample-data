Following Kashiwara's algebraic approach in one-parameter case, we construct crystal bases for two-parameter quantum algebras and for their integrable modules. We also show that the global crystal basis coincides with the canonical basis geometrically constructed by Fan and Li up to a 2-cocycle deformation.
