In this note we show a close relation between the following objects: Classical Yang---Baxter equation (CYBE), conformal algebras (also known as vertex Lie algebras), and averaging operators on Lie algebras. It turns out that the singular part of a solution of CYBE (in the operator form) on a Lie algebra \mathfrak g determines an averaging operator on the corresponding current conformal algebra \mathrm{Cur} \mathfrak g. For a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak g, we describe all homogeneous averaging operators on \mathrm{Cur}\mathfrak g. It turns out that all these operators actually define solutions of CYBE with a pole at the origin.
