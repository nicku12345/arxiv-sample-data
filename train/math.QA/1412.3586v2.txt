It is shown that the coordinate algebra of the quantum 2n+1-dimensional lens space \mathcal{O}(L^{2n+1}_q(\prod_{i=0}^n m_i; m_0,\ldots, m_n)) is a principal \mathbb{Z}-comodule algebra or the coordinate algebra of a circle principal bundle over the weighted quantum projective space \mathbb{WP}^n_q(m_0,\ldots, m_n). Furthermore, the weighted U(1)-action or the \mathbb{CZ}-coaction on the quantum odd dimensional sphere algebra \mathcal{O}(S^{2n+1}_q) that defines \mathbb{WP}^n_q(1,m_1,\ldots, m_n) is free or principal. Analogous results are proven for quantum real weighted projective spaces \mathbb{RP}^{2n}_q(m_0,\ldots, m_n). The K-groups of \mathbb{WP}^n_q(1,\ldots, 1, m) and \mathbb{RP}^{2n}_q(1,\ldots, 1,m) and the K_1-group of L^{2n+1}_q(N; m_0,\ldots, m_n) are computed
