Minimal affinizations form a class of modules of quantum affine algebras introduced by Chari. We introduce a system of equations satisfied by the q-characters of minimal affinizations of type G_2 which we call the M-system of type G_2. The M-system of type G_2 contains all minimal affinizations of type G_2 and only contains minimal affinizations. The equations in the M-system of type G_2 are three-term recurrence relations. The M-system of type G_2 is much simpler than the extended T-system of type G_2 obtained by Mukhin and the second author. We also interpret the three-term recurrence relations in the M-system of type G_2 as exchange relations in a cluster algebra constructed by Hernandez and Leclerc.
