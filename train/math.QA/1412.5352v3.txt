Using the notion of compatibility between Poisson brackets and cluster structures in the coordinate rings of simple Lie groups, Gekhtman Shapiro and Vainshtein conjectured a correspondence between the two. Poisson Lie groups are classified by the Belavin-Drinfeld classification of solutions to the classical Yang Baxter equation. For any non trivial Belavin-Drinfeld data of minimal size for SL_{n}, we give an algorithm for constructing an initial seed \Sigma in \mathcal{O}(SL_{n}). The cluster structure \mathcal{C}=\mathcal{C}(\Sigma) is then proved to be compatible with the Poisson bracket associated with that Belavin-Drinfeld data, and the seed \Sigma is locally regular.   This is the first of two papers, and the second one proves the rest of the conjecture: the upper cluster algebra \bar{\mathcal{A}}_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathcal{C}) is naturally isomorphic to \mathcal{O}(SL_{n}), and the correspondence of Belavin-Drinfeld classes and cluster structures is one to one.
