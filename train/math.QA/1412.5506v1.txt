We propose a new type of state sum model for two-dimensional surfaces that takes into account topology and spin. The definition used - new to the literature - provides a rich class of extended models called spin models. Both examples and general properties are studied. Most prominently, we find this type of model can depend on a surface spin structure through parity alone and we explore explicit cases that feature this behaviour. Further directions for the two dimensional world are analysed: we introduce a source of new information - defects - and show how they can enlarge the class of spin models available.
