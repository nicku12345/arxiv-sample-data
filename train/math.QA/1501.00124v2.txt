We prove an \text{SL}_2 (\mathbb{Z})-invariance property of multivariable trace functions on modules for a regular VOA. Applying this result, we provide a proof of the inversion transformation formula for Siegel theta series. As another application, we show that if V is a regular VOA containing a regular subVOA U whose commutant U^c is regular and satisfies (U^c)^c =U, then all simple U-modules appear in some simple V-module.
