The aim of this paper is two-fold: (1) introduce four systems of equations called M-systems and dual M-systems of types A_{n} and B_{n} respectively; (2) make a connection between M-systems (dual M-systems) and cluster algebras and prove that the Hernandez-Leclerc conjecture is true for minimal affinizations of types A_n and B_n.
