We determine the center of a localization of {\mathcal U}_q({\mathfrak n}_\omega)\subseteq {\mathcal U}^+_q({\mathfrak g}) by the covariant elements (non-mutable elements) by means of constructions and results from quantum cluster algebras. In our set-up, {\mathfrak g} is any finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra and \omega is any element in the Weyl group W. The non-zero complex parameter q is mostly assumed not to be a root of unity, but our method also gives many details in case q is a primitive root of unity. We point to a new and very useful direction of approach to a general set of problems which we exemplify here by obtaining the result that the center is determined by the null space of 1+\omega. Further, we use this to give a generalization to double Schubert Cell algebras where the center is proved to be given by \omega^{\mathfrak a}+\omega^{\mathfrak c}. Another family of quadratic algebras is also considered and the centers determined.
