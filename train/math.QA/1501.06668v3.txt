This note is a development of our two previous papers, arXiv:1212.3392v1 and 1306.3660v1.   The fundamental question is whether there exists a Galois theory, in which the Galois group is a quantum group.   For a linear equations with respect to a Hopf algebra, we arrived at a final form if the base field consists of constants. In this case, we have non-commutative Picard-Vessiot rings and asymmetric Tannaka theory.   For non-linear equations there are examples that might make us optimistic.
