Let A=F[x,y] be the polynomial algebra on two variables x,y over an algebraically closed field F of characteristic zero. Under the Poisson bracket, A is equipped with a natural Lie algebra structure. It is proven that the maximal good subspace of A^* induced from the multiplication of the associative commutative algebra A coincides with the maximal good subspace of A^* induced from the Poisson bracket of the Poisson Lie algebra A. Based on this, structures of dual Lie bialgebras of the Poisson type are investigated. As by-products, five classes of new infinite dimensional Lie algebras are obtained.
