Let G be the complex symplectic or special orthogonal group and \g its Lie algebra. With every point x of the maximal torus T\subset G we associate a highest weight module M_x over the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group U_q(\g) and a quantization of the conjugacy class of x by operators in \End(M_x). These quantizations are isomorphic for x lying on the same orbit of the Weyl group, and M_x support different representations of the same quantum conjugacy class.
