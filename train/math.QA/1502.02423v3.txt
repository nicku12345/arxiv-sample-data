In this paper, we apply the theory of cluster algebras to study minimal affinizations for the quantum affine algebra of type F_4. We show that the q-characters of a large family of minimal affinizations of type F_4 satisfy a system of equations. Moreover, a minimal affinization in this system corresponds to some cluster variable in some cluster algebra \mathscr{A}. For the other minimal affinizations of type F_4 which are not in this system, we give some conjectural equations which contains these minimal affinizations. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of dominant monomial graphs to study the equations satisfied by q-characters of modules of quantum affine algebras.
