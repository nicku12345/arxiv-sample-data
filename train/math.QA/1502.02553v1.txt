We construct a configuration space model for a particular 2-colored differential graded operad encoding the structure of two A_\infty algebras with two A_\infty morphisms and a homotopy between the morphisms. The cohomology of this operad is shown to be the well-known 2-colored operad encoding the structure of two associative algebras and of an associative algebra morphism between them.
