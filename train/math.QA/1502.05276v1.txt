The notion of {\it free} generalized vertex algebras is introduced. It is equivalent to the notion of {\it generalized principal subspaces} associated with lattices which are not necessarily integral. Combinatorial bases and the characters of the free generalized vertex algebras are given. As an application, the commutants of principal subspaces are described by using generalized principal subspaces.
