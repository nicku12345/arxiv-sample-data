We develop the theory of diagrammatic Temperley-Lieb categories in order to construct examples of spherical fusion categories, which we then use to construct Turaev-Viro skein modules for n-holed disks. This is a thesis submitted for the degree of Bachelor of Science with Honours at the Australian National University.
