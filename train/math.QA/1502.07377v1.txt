In this paper, we define and study weak monoidal Hom-Hopf algebras, which generalize both weak Hopf algebras and monoidal Hom-Hopf algebras. If H is a weak monoidal Hom-Hopf algebra with bijective antipode and let Aut_{wmHH}(H) be the set of all automorphisms of H. Then we introduce a category {_{H}\mathcal{WMHYD}^{H}}(\alpha,\beta) with \alpha,\beta\in Aut_{wmHH}(H) and construct a braided T-category \mathcal{WMHYD}(H) that having all the categories {_{H}\mathcal{WMHYD}^{H}}(\alpha,\beta) as components.
