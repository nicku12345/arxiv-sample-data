We study \mathbb Z_2-graded Poisson structures defined on \mathbb Z_2-graded commutative polynomial algebras. In small dimensional cases, we exhibit classifications of such Poisson structures, obtain the associated Poisson \mathbb Z_2-graded cohomology and in some cases, deformations of these Poisson brackets and P_\infty-algebra structures. We highlight differences and analogies between this \mathbb Z_2-graded context and the non graded context, by studying for example the links between Poisson cohomology and singularities.
