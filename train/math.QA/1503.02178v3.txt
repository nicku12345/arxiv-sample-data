The aim of this paper is to study the graded limits of minimal affinizations over the quantum loop algebra of type G_2. We show that the graded limits are isomorphic to multiple generalizations of Demazure modules, and obtain defining relations of them. As an application, we obtain a polyhedral multiplicity formula for the decomposition of minimal affinizations of type G_2 as a U_q(\mathfrak{g})-module, by showing the corresponding formula for the graded limits.
