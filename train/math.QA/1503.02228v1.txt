We construct a Fock space representation and the action of the two-parameter quantum algebra U_{r,s}(\frak{gl}_{\infty}) using extended Young diagrams. In particular, we obtain an integrable representation of the two-parameter quantum affine algebra of type C_n^{(1)} which is a two-parameter generalization of Kang-Misra-Miwa's realization.
