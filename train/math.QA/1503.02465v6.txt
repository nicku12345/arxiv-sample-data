We give a classification of open Klein topological conformal field theories in terms of Calabi-Yau A_\infty-categories endowed with an involution. Given an open Klein topological conformal field theory, there is a universal open-closed extension whose closed part is the involutive variant of the Hochschild chains of the open part.
