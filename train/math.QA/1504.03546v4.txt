Given a star product with separation of variables on a pseudo-Kaehler manifold, we obtain a new formal (1,1)-form from its classifying form and call it the phase form of the star product. The cohomology class of a star product with separation of variables equals the class of its phase form. We show that the phase forms can be arbitrary and they bijectively parametrize the star products with separation of variables. We also describe the action of a change of the formal parameter on a star product with separation of variables, its formal Berezin transform, classifying form, phase form, and canonical trace density.
