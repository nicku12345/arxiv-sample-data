Let X be a smooth affine symplectic variety over \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}, and let A_1 be an Azumaya algebra over X. In this note we show that if A is a deformation quantization of A_1 over \mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}, then any two-sided \mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}-flat ideal in A is generated by central elements.
