We study the graded limits of simple U_q(\tilde{\mathfrak{sl}}_{n+1})-modules which are isomorphic to tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules associated to a fix fundamental weight. We prove that every such module admits a graded limit which is isomorphic to the fusion product of the graded limits of its tensor factors. Moreover, using recent results of Naoi, we exhibit a set of defining relations for these graded limits.
