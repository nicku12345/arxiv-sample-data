Let G=Sp_{2r}({\mathbb C}) be a simply connected simple algebraic group over \mathbb{C} of type C_r, B and B_- be its two opposite Borel subgroups, and W be the associated Weyl group. For u, v\in W, it is known that the coordinate ring {\mathbb C}[G^{u,v}] of the double Bruhat cell G^{u,v}=BuB\cap B_-vB_- is isomorphic to an upper cluster algebra \overline{\mathcal{A}}(\textbf{i})_{{\mathbb C}} and the generalized minors \Delta(k;\textbf{i}) are the cluster variables of {\mathbb C}[G^{u,v}][Berenstein A., Fomin S., Zelevinsky A., Duke Math. J. 126 (2005), 1-52, math.RT/0305434]. In the case v=e, we shall describe the generalized minor \Delta(k;\textbf{i}) explicitly.
