The n-dimensional quantum torus \mathcal O_{\mathbf q}((F^\times)^n) is defined as the associative F-algebra generated by x_1, \cdots, x_n together with their inverses satisfying the relations x_ix_j = q_{ij}x_jx_i, where \mathbf q = (q_{ij}). We show that the modules that are finitely generated over certain commutative sub-algebras \mathscr B are \mathscr B-torsion-free and have finite length. We determine the Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions of simple modules in the case when \[ \Kdim(\mathcal O_{\mathbf q}((F^\times)^n)) = n - 1, \] where \Kdim stands for the Krull dimension. In this case if M is a simple \mathcal O_{\mathbf q}((F^\times)^n)-module then  \gk(M) = 1 or \[ \gk(M) \ge \gk(\mathcal O_{\mathbf q}((F^\times)^n)) - \gk(\mathcal Z(\mathcal O_{\mathbf q}((F^\times)^n))) - 1,\] where \mathcal Z(C) stands for the center of an algebra C. We also show that there always exists a simple F \s A-module satisfying the above inequality.
