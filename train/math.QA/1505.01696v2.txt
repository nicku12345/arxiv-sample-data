We introduce the notion of a lowering-raising (or LR) triple of linear transformations on a nonzero finite-dimensional vector space. We show how to normalize an LR triple, and classify up to isomorphism the normalized LR triples. We describe the LR triples using various maps, such as the reflectors, the inverters, the unipotent maps, and the rotators. We relate the LR triples to the equitable presentation of the quantum algebra U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2) and Lie algebra   \mathfrak{sl}_2.
