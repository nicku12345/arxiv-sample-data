In this paper we give a criterion that characterizes equivalent weak crossed products. By duality, we obtain a similar result for weak crossed coproducts and, as a consequence, we find the conditions that assures the equivalence between two weak crossed biproducts. As an application, we show that the main results proved by Panaite, for Brzezi\'nski's crossed products, admits a substantial reduction in the imposed conditions.
