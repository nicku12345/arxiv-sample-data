A bijection \psi is defined between the prime spectrum of quantum SL_3 and the Poisson prime spectrum of SL_3, and we verify that \psi and \psi^{-1} both preserve inclusions of primes, i.e. that \psi is in fact a homeomorphism between these two spaces. This is accomplished by developing a Poisson analogue of Brown and Goodearl's framework for describing the Zariski topology of spectra of quantum algebras, and then verifying directly that in the case of SL_3 these give rise to identical pictures on both the quantum and Poisson sides. As part of this analysis, we study the Poisson primitive spectrum of \mathcal{O}(SL_3) and obtain explicit generating sets for all of the Poisson primitive ideals.
