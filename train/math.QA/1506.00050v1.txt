Quantum vertex algebra theory, developed by H.-S. Li, allows us to apply zeroth products of Frenkel-Jing operators, corresponding to Drinfeld realization of U_q (\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{n+1}), on the extension of Koyama vertex operators. As a result, we obtain an infinite-dimensional space and describe its structure as a module for the associative algebra U_q (\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1})_z, a certain quantum analogue of U(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}) which we introduce in this paper.
