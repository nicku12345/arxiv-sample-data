A central question in Quantum Computing is how matrices in SU(2) can be approximated by products over a small set of "generators". A topology will be defined on SU(2) so as to introduce the notion of a covering exponent \cite{letter}, which compares the length of products required to covering SU(2) with \varepsilon balls against the Haar measure of \varepsilon balls. An efficient universal set over PSU(2) will be constructed using the Pauli matrices, using the metric of the covering exponent. Then, the relationship between SU(2) and S^3 will be manipulated to correlate angles between points on S^3 and give a conjecture on the maximum of angles between points on a lattice. It will be shown how this conjecture can be used to compute the covering exponent, and how it can be generalized to universal sets in SU(2).
