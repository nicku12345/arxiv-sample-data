In this paper we show that weak Hopf (co)quasigroups can be characterized by a Galois-type condition. Taking into account that this notion generalizes the ones of Hopf (co)quasigroup and weak Hopf algebra, we obtain as a consequence the first fundamental theorem for Hopf (co)quasigroups and a characterization of weak Hopf algebras in terms of bijectivity of a Galois-type morphism (also called fusion morphism).
