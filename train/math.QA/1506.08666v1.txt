The positive part U^+_q of U_q({\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}}_2) has a presentation by two generators X,Y that satisfy the q-Serre relations. The q-Onsager algebra \mathcal O_q has a presentation by two generators A,B that satisfy the q-Dolan/Grady relations. We give two results that describe how U^+_q and \mathcal O_q are related. First, we consider the filtration of \mathcal O_q whose nth component is spanned by the products of at most n generators. We show that the associated graded algebra is isomorphic to U^+_q. Second, we introduce an algebra \square_q and show how it is related to both U^+_q and \mathcal O_q. The algebra \square_q is defined by generators and relations. The generators are \lbrace x_i \rbrace_{i \in \mathbb Z_4} where \mathbb Z_4 is the cyclic group of order 4. For i \in \mathbb Z_4 the generators x_i, x_{i+1} satisfy a q-Weyl relation, and x_i,x_{i+2} satisfy the q-Serre relations. We show that \square_q is related to U^+_q in the following way. Let  \square^{\rm even}_q (resp.  \square^{\rm odd}_q) denote the subalgebra of  \square_q generated by x_0, x_2 (resp. x_1, x_3). We show that (i) there exists an algebra isomorphism U^+_q \to \square^{\rm even}_q that sends X\mapsto x_0 and Y\mapsto x_2; (ii) there exists an algebra isomorphism U^+_q \to \square^{\rm odd}_q that sends X\mapsto x_1 and Y\mapsto x_3; (iii) the multiplication map \square^{\rm even}_q \otimes \square^{\rm odd}_q \to \square_q, u \otimes v \mapsto uv is an isomorphism of vector spaces. We show that \square_q is related to \mathcal O_q in the following way. For nonzero scalars a,b there exists an injective algebra homomorphism  \mathcal O_q \to \square_q that sends A \mapsto a x_0+ a^{-1} x_1 and B \mapsto b x_2+ b^{-1} x_3.
