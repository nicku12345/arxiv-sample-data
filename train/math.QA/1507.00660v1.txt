In this article, we develop a theory of integration on algebraic quantum groupoids in the form of regular multiplier Hopf algebroids, and establish the main properties of integrals obtained by Van Daele for algebraic quantum groups before - faithfulness, uniqueness up to scaling, existence of a modular element and existence of a modular automorphism - for algebraic quantum groupoids under reasonable assumptions. The approach to integration developed in this article forms the basis for the extension of Pontrjagin duality to algebraic quantum groupoids, and for the passage from algebraic quantum groupoids to operator-algebraic completions, which both will be studied in separate articles.
