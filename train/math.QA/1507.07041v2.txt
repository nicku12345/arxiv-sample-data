We show that if G is a compact Lie group and \mathfrak{g} is its Lie algebra, then there is a map from the Hopf-cyclic cohomology of the quantum enveloping algebra U_q(\mathfrak{g}) to the twisted cyclic cohomology of quantum group algebra \mathcal{O}(G_q). We also show that the Schm\"udgen-Wagner index cocycle associated with the volume form of the differential calculus on the standard Podle\'s sphere \mathcal{O}(S^2_q) is in the image of this map.
