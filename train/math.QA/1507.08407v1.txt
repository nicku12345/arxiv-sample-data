Definition of a smooth action of a CQG on a compact, smooth manifold is given and studied. It is shown that a smooth action is always injective. Furthermore A necessary and sufficient condition for a lift of the smooth action as a bimodule morphism on the bimodule of one forms has been deduced and it is also shown to be equivalent to the condition of preserving some Riemannian inner product on the manifold.
