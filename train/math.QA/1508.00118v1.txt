In the past two decades there has been a great attention to Lie (super)algebras which are extensions of affine Kac-Moody Lie (super)algebras, in certain typical or axiomatic approaches. These Lie (super)algebras have been mostly studied under variations of the name "extended affine Lie (super)algebras". We show that certain classes of Malcev (super)algebras also can be put in this framework. This in particular allows to provide new examples of Malcev (super)algebras which extend the known Kac-Moody Malcev (super)algebras.
