We study the cohomology of the hairy graph complexes which compute the rational homotopy of embedding spaces, generalizing the Vassiliev invariants of knot theory. We provide spectral sequences converging to zero whose first pages contain the hairy graph cohomology. Our results yield a way to construct many hairy graph cohomology classes out of non-hairy classes by a mechanism which we call the waterfall mechanism. By this mechanism we can construct many previously unknown classes and provide a first glimpse at the tentative global structure of the hairy graph cohomology.
