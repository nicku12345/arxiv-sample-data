Snake modules introduced by Mukhin and Young form a family of modules of quantum affine algebras. The aim of this paper is to prove that the Hernandez-Leclerc conjecture about monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras is true for prime snake modules of types A_{n} and B_{n}. We prove that prime snake modules are real. We introduce S-systems consisting of equations satisfied by the q-characters of prime snake modules of types A_{n} and B_{n}. Moreover, we show that every equation in the S-system of type A_n (respectively, B_n) corresponds to a mutation in the cluster algebra \mathscr{A} (respectively, \mathscr{A}') constructed by Hernandez and Leclerc and every prime snake module of type A_n (respectively, B_n) corresponds to some cluster variable in \mathscr{A} (respectively, \mathscr{A}'). In particular, this proves that the Hernandez-Leclerc conjecture is true for all prime snake modules of types A_{n} and B_{n}.
