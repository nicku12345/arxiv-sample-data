In the preceeding paper we constructed an infinite exact sequence a la Villamayor-Zelinsky for a symmetric finite tensor category. It consists of cohomology groups evaluated at three types of coefficients which repeat periodically. In the present paper we interpret the middle cohomology group in the second level of the sequence. We introduce the notion of coring categories and we obtain that the mentioned middle cohomology group is isomorphic to the group of Azumaya quasi coring categories. This result is a categorical generalization of the classical Crossed Product Theorem, which relates the relative Brauer group and the second Galois cohomology group with respect to a Galois field extension. We construct the colimit over symmetric finite tensor categories of the relative groups of Azumaya quasi coring categories and the full group of Azumaya quasi coring categories over vec. We prove that the latter two groups are isomorphic.
