We provide a classification of finite-dimensional graded pointed Majid algebras generated by finite abelian groups as group-like elements and a set of quasi-commutative skew-primitive elements. This amounts to a classification of finite quasi-quantum linear spaces in the sense of nonassociative geometry.
