For a set theoretical solution of the Yang-Baxter equation (X,\sigma), we define a d.g. bialgebra B=B(X,\sigma), containing the semigroup algebra A=k\{X\}/\langle xy=zt : \sigma(x,y)=(z,t)\rangle, such that k\otimes_A B\otimes_Ak and \mathrm{Hom}_{A-A}(B,k) are respectively the homology and cohomology complexes computing biquandle homology and cohomology defined in \cite{CJKS} and other generalizations of cohomology of rack-quanlde case (for example defined in \cite{CES}). This algebraic structure allow us to show the existence of an associative product in the cohomology of biquandles, and a comparison map with Hochschild (co)homology of the algebra A.
