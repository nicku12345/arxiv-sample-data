We introduce a Z_3-graded quantum (2+1)-superspace and define Z_3-graded Hopf algebra structure on algebra of functions on the Z_3-graded quantum superspace. We construct a differential calculus on the Z_3-graded quantum superspace, and obtain the corresponding Z_3-graded Lie superalgebra. We also find a new Z_3-graded quantum supergroup which is a symmetry group of this calculus.
