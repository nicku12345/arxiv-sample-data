Given a braided pivotal category \mathcal C and a pivotal module tensor category \mathcal M, we define a functor \mathrm{Tr}_{\mathcal C}:\mathcal M \to \mathcal C, called the associated categorified trace. By a result of Bezrukavnikov, Finkelberg and Ostrik, the functor \mathrm{Tr}_{\mathcal C} comes equipped with natural isomorphisms \tau_{x,y}:\mathrm{Tr}_{\mathcal C}(x \otimes y) \to \mathrm{Tr}_{\mathcal C}(y \otimes x), which we call the traciators. This situation lends itself to a diagramatic calculus of `strings on cylinders', where the traciator corresponds to wrapping a string around the back of a cylinder. We show that \mathrm{Tr}_{\mathcal C} in fact has a much richer graphical calculus in which the tubes are allowed to branch and braid. Given algebra objects A and B, we prove that \mathrm{Tr}_{\mathcal C}(A) and \mathrm{Tr}_{\mathcal C}(A \otimes B) are again algebra objects. Moreover, provided certain mild assumptions are satisfied, \mathrm{Tr}_{\mathcal C}(A) and \mathrm{Tr}_{\mathcal C}(A \otimes B) are semisimple whenever A and B are semisimple.
