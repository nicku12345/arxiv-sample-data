In this paper, we study finite dimensional non-cosemisimple Hopf algebras through its underlying coalgebra. We decompose such a Hopf algebra as a direct sum of `blocks'. Blocks are closely related to each other by `rules' and form the `block system'. Through the block system, we are able to give a lower bound for \dim H, where H is a non-cosemisimple Hopf algebras with no nontrivial skew-primitives, and a series of results about non-cosemisimple Hopf algebras of dimension 12p, 15p, 16p, 20p\ \text{and}\ 21p with p being a prime number.
