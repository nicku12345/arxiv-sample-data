Super Hopf algebra structure on the function algebra on the extended quantum superspace has been defined. It is given a bicovariant differential calculus on the superspace. The corresponding (quantum) Lie superalgebra of vector fields and its Hopf algebra structure are obtained. The dual Hopf algebra is explicitly constructed. A new quantum supergroup that is the symmetry group of the differential calculus is found.
