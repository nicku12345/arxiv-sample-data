Let {\mathfrak p}\subset {\mathfrak g} be a parabolic subalgebra of s simple finite dimensional Lie algebra over {\mathbb C}. To each pair w^{\mathfrak a}\leq w^{\mathfrak c} of minimal left coset representatives in the quotient space W_p\backslash W we construct explicitly a quantum seed {\mathcal Q}_q({\mathfrak a},{\mathfrak c}). We define Schubert creation and annihilation mutations and show that our seeds are related by such mutations. We also introduce more elaborate seeds to accommodate our mutations. The quantized Schubert Cell decomposition of the quantized generalized flag manifold can be viewed as the result of such mutations having their origins in the pair ({\mathfrak a},{\mathfrak c})= ({\mathfrak e},{\mathfrak p}), where the empty string {\mathfrak e} corresponds to the neutral element. This makes it possible to give simple proofs by induction. We exemplify this in three directions: Prime ideals, upper cluster algebras, and the diagonal of a quantized minor.
