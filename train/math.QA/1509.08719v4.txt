Inspired by a profound observation on the Racah--Wigner coefficients of U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2), the Askey--Wilson algebras were introduced in the early 1990s. A universal analog \triangle_q of the Askey--Wilson algebras was recently studied. For q not a root of unity, it is known that Z(\triangle_q) is isomorphic to the polynomial ring of four variables. A presentation for Z(\triangle_q) at q a root of unity is displayed in this paper. As an application, a presentation for the center of the double affine Hecke algebra of type (C_1^\vee,C_1) at roots of unity is obtained.
