In this master thesis we construct an oddification of the rings H^n from arXiv:math/0103190 using the functor from arXiv:0710.4300 . This leads to a collection of non-associative rings OH^n_C where C represent some choices of signs. Extending the center up to anti-commutative elements, we get a ring OZ(OH^n_C) which is isomorphic to the oddification of the ring cohomology of the (n,n)-Springer variety from arXiv:1203.0797 .
