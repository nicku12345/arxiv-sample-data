In this paper, the notion of unitary vertex operator superalgebra is introduced. It is proved that the vertex operator superalgebras associated to the unitary highest weight representations for the Neveu-Schwarz Lie superalgebra, Heisenberg superalgebras and to positive definite integral lattices are unitary vertex operator superalgebras. The unitary structures are then used to study the structures of vertex operator superalgebras, it is proved that any unitary vertex operator superalgebra is a direct sum of strong CFT type unitary simple vertex operator superalgebras. The classification of unitary vertex operator superalgebras generated by the subspaces with conformal weights less than or equal to 1 is also considered.
