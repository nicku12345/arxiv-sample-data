In this paper, we first introduce a quantum n-space with a cocommutative Hopf algebra structure. Then it is shown that to this quantum n-space there corresponds a derivation algebra of \sigma-twisted derivations related to some algebra automorphisms \sigma on the quantum n-space. Furthermore, we show that this derivation algebra is a noncommutative and non-cocommutative Hopf algebra, namely, a quantum group. Morever, for this the quantum n-space, we show how to construct a bicovariant differential calculus related to the derivation algebra.
