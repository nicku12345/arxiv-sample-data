We introduce the notion of universal odd generalized Poisson superalgebra associated to an associative algebra A, by generalizing a construction made in [5]. By making use of this notion we give a complete classification of simple linearly compact (generalized) n-Nambu-Poisson algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.
