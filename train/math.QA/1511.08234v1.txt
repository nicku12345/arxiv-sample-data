Using the notion of compatibility between Poisson brackets and cluster structures in the coordinate rings of simple Lie groups, Gekhtman Shapiro and Vainshtein conjectured a correspondence between the two. Poisson Lie groups are classified by the Belavin--Drinfeld classification of solutions to the classical Yang Baxter equation. For any non trivial Belavin--Drinfeld data of minimal size for SL_{n}, the companion paper constructed a cluster structure with a locally regular initial seed, which was proved to be compatible with the Poisson bracket associated with that Belavin--Drinfeld data.   This paper proves the rest of the conjecture: the corresponding upper cluster algebra \overline{\mathcal{A}}_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathcal{C}) is naturally isomorphic to \mathcal{O}\left(SL_{n}\right), the torus determined by the BD triple generates theaction of (\mathbb{C}^{*})^{2k_{T}} on \mathbb{C}\left(SL_{n}\right), and the correspondence between Belavin--Drinfeld classes and cluster structures is one to one.
