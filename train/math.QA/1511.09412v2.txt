We prove Eilenberg-Watts Theorem for 2-categories of the representation categories \C\x\Mod of finite tensor categories \C. For a consequence we obtain that any autoequivalence of \C\x\Mod is given by tensoring with a representative of some class in the Brauer-Picard group \BrPic(\C). We introduce bialgebroid categories over \C and a cohomology over a symmetric bialgebroid category. This cohomology turns out to be a generalization of the one we developed in a previous paper and moreover, an analogous Villamayor-Zelinsky sequence exists in this setting. In this context, for a symmetric bialgebroid category \A, we interpret the middle cohomology group appearing in the third level of the latter sequence. We obtain a group of quasi-monoidal structures on the representation category \A\x\Mod.
