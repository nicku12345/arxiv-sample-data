Let H be a Hopf algebra. Any finite-dimensional lifting of V\in {}^{H}_{H}\mathcal{YD} arising as a cocycle deformation of A=\mathfrak{B}(V)\#H defines a twist in the Hopf algebra A^*, via dualization. We follow this recipe to write down explicit examples and show that it extends known techniques for defining twists. We also contribute with a detailed survey about twists in braided categories.
