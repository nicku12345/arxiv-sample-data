We give new combinatorial formulas for decomposition of the tensor product of integrable highest weight modules over the classical Lie algebras of type B, C, D, and the branching decomposition of an integrable highest weight module with respect to a maximal Levi subalgebra of type A. This formula is based on a combinatorial model of classical crystals called spinor model. We show that our formulas extend in a bijective way various stable branching rules for classical groups to arbitrary highest weights, including the Littlewood restriction rules.
