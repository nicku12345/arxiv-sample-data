Motivated by the universal obstruction to the deformation quantization of Poisson structures in infinite dimensions we introduce the notion of quantizable odd Lie bialgebra. The main result of the paper is a construction of a highly non-trivial minimal resolution of the properad governing such Lie bialgebras, and its link with the theory of so called quantizable Poisson structures.
