In this paper, we introduce two kinds of Lie conformal algebras associated with the loop Schr\"odinger-Virasoro Lie algebra and the extended loop Schr\"odinger-Virasoro Lie algebra, respectively. The conformal derivations, the second cohomology groups of these two conformal algebras are completely determined. And nontrivial free conformal modules of rank one and Z-graded free intermediate series modules over these two conformal algebras are also classified in the present paper
