Let \mathfrak{g}'\subset \mathfrak{g} be the pair of Lie algebras of either symplectic or orthogonal infinitesimal endomorphisms of the complex vector spaces \mathbb{C}^{N-2}\subset \mathbb{C}^N and U_q(\mathfrak{g}')\subset U_q(\mathfrak{g}) the pair of quantum groups with triangular decomposition U_q(\mathfrak{g})=U_q(\mathfrak{g}_-)U_q(\mathfrak{g}_+)U_q(\mathfrak{h}). Let Z_q(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}') be the corresponding step algebra and regard its generators as rational trigonometric functions \mathfrak{h}^*\to U_q(\mathfrak{g}_\pm). We describe their regularization such that the resulting generators do not vanish when specialized at any weight.
