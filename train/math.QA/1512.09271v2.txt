We classify pointed Hopf algebras with finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension whose infinitesimal braiding has dimension 2 but is not of diagonal type, or equivalently is a block. These Hopf algebras are new and turn out to be liftings of either a Jordan or a super Jordan plane over a nilpotent-by-finite group.
