Let G be a connected, simply connected simple complex algebraic group and let \epsilon be a primitive \ellth root of unity with \ell odd and coprime with 3 if G is of type G_{2}. We determine all Hopf algebra quotients of the twisted multiparameter quantum function algebra \mathcal{O}_{\epsilon}^{\varphi}(G) introduced by Costantini and Varagnolo. This extends the results of Andruskiewitsch and the first author, where the untwisted case is treated.
