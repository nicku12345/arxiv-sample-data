We obtain a classification of metaplectic modular categories: every metaplectic modular category is a gauging of the particle-hole symmetry of a cyclic modular category. Our classification suggests a conjecture that every weakly-integral modular category can be obtained by gauging a symmetry of a pointed modular category.
