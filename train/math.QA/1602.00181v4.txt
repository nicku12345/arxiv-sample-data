The branching coefficients of the tensor product of finite-dimensional irreducible U_{q}(\mathfrak{g})-modules, where \mathfrak{g} is \mathfrak{so}(2n+1,\mathbb{C}) (B_{n}-type), \mathfrak{sp}(2n,\mathbb{C}) (C_{n}-type), and \mathfrak{so}(2n,\mathbb{C}) (D_{n}-type), are expressed in terms of Littlewood-Richardson (LR) coefficients in the stable region. We give an interpretation of this relation by Kashiwara's crystal theory by providing an explicit surjection from the LR crystal of type C_{n} to the disjoint union of Cartesian product of LR crystals of A_{n-1}-type and by proving that LR crystals of types B_{n} and D_{n} are identical to the corresponding LR crystal of type C_{n} in the stable region.
