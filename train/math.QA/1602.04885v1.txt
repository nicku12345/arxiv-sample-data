Let U_q(\mathfrak{g}) be the quantum supergroup of \mathfrak{gl}_{m|n} or the modified quantum supergroup of osp_{m|2n} over the field of rational functions in q, and let V_q be the natural module for U_q(\mathfrak{g}). There exists a unique tensor functor, associated with V_q, from the category of ribbon graphs to the category of finite dimensional representations of U_q(\mathfrak{g}, which preserves ribbon category structures. We show that this functor is full in the cases \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n} or osp_{2\ell+1|2n}. For \mathfrak{g}=osp_{2\ell|2n}, we show that the space Hom_{U_q(\mathfrak{g}}(V_q^{\otimes r}, V_q^{\otimes s}) is spanned by images of ribbon graphs if r+s< 2\ell(2n+1). The proofs involve an equivalence of module categories for two versions of the quantisation of U(\mathfrak{g}).
