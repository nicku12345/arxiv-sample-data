In this paper we follow the constructions of Turaev's book [Tu] closely, but with small modifications, to construct of a modular functor, in the sense of Kevin Walker, from any modular tensor category. We further show that this modular functor has duality and if the modular tensor category category is Hermitian or unitary, then the resulting modular functor is also Hermitian or unitary respectively.
