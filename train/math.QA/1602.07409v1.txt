Consider the class RBLie of Lie algebras equipped with a Rota---Baxter operator. Then the forgetful functor RBLie --> Lie has a left adjoint one denoted by U_{RB}(\cdot). We prove an "operator" analogue of the Poincare---Birkhoff---Witt theorem for U_{RB}(L), where L is an arbitrary Lie algebra, by means of Gr\"obner---Shirshov bases theory for Lie algebras with an additional operator.
