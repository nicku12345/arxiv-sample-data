Let G be a simply connected simple algebraic group over \mathbb{C} of type B_r, B and B_- be its two opposite Borel subgroups, and W be the associated Weyl group. For u, v\in W, it is known that the coordinate ring {\mathbb C}[G^{u,v}] of the double Bruhat cell G^{u,v}=BuB\cap B_-vB_- is isomorphic to an upper cluster algebra \overline{\mathcal{A}}(\textbf{i})_{{\mathbb C}} and the generalized minors \Delta(k;\textbf{i}) are the cluster variables of {\mathbb C}[G^{u,v}][A.Berenstein, S.Fomin, A.Zelevinsky, Duke Math. J. 126 (2005), 1-52, arxiv:math.RT/0305434]. Recently, it is also shown that {\mathbb C}[G^{u,v}] have structure of cluster algebra [K. R. Goodearl, M. T. Yakimov, arxiv:1602.00498 (2016)]. In the case v=e, we shall describe the generalized minor \Delta(k;\textbf{i}) explicitly.
