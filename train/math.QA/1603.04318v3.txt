We develop methods of computation of the Brauer-Picard groups of fusion categories and apply them to compute such groups for several classes of fusion categories of prime power dimension: representation categories of elementary abelian groups with twisted associativity constraint, extra special p-groups, and the Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra. We conclude that many finite groups of Lie type occur as composition factors of the Brauer-Picard groups of pointed fusion categories.
