Recently a new class of quantum integrable models, the cyclotomic Gaudin models, were described in arXiv:1409.6937, arXiv:1410.7664. Motivated by these, we identify a class of affine hyperplane arrangements that we call cyclotomic discriminantal arrangements. We establish correspondences between the flag and Aomoto complexes of such arrangements and chain complexes for nilpotent subalgebras of Kac-Moody type Lie algebras with diagram automorphisms.   As a byproduct, we show that the Bethe vectors of cyclotomic Gaudin models associated to diagram automorphisms are nonzero.
