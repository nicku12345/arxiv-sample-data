Double Poisson structures (a la Van den Bergh) on commutative algebras are studied; the main result shows that there are no non-trivial such structures on polynomial algebras of Krull dimension greater than one. For a general commutative algebra A, this places significant restrictions on possible double Poisson structures. Exotic double Poisson structures are exhibited by the case of the polynomial algebra on a single generator, previously considered by Van den Bergh.
