We study graded nonlocal \underline{\mathsf{q}}-vertex algebras and we prove that they can be generated by certain sets of vertex operators. As an application, we consider the family of graded nonlocal \underline{\mathsf{q}}-vertex algebras V_{c,1}, c\geq 1, associated with the principal subspaces W(c\Lambda_0) of the integrable highest weight U_q (\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)-modules L(c\Lambda_0). Using quantum integrability, we derive combinatorial bases for V_{c,1} and compute the corresponding character formulae.
