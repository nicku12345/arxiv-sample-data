Let \mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{q}} be a finite-dimensional Nichols algebra of diagonal type corresponding to a matrix \mathfrak{q} \in \mathbf{k}^{\theta \times \theta}, where \mathbf{k} is an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Let \mathcal{L}_{\mathfrak{q}} be the Lusztig algebra associated to \mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{q}}, see http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04518. We present \mathcal{L}_{\mathfrak{q}} as an extension (as braided Hopf algebras) of \mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{q}} by \mathfrak Z_{\mathfrak{q}} where \mathfrak Z_{\mathfrak{q}} is isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra \mathfrak n_{\mathfrak{q}}. We compute the Lie algebra \mathfrak n_{\mathfrak{q}} when \theta = 2.
