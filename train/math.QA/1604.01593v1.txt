For any two complex numbers a and b, \mathcal{V} ir(a,b) is a central extension of \mathcal{W}(a,b) which is universal in the case (a,b)\neq (0,1), where \mathcal{W}(a,b) is the Lie algebra with basis \{L_n,W_n\mid n\in\Z\} and relations [L_m,L_n]=(n-m)L_{m+n}, [L_m,W_n]=(a+n+bm)W_{m+n}, [W_m,W_n]=0. In this paper, we construct and classify a class of non-weight modules over the algebra \mathcal{V} ir(a,b) which are free U(\mathbb{C} L_0\oplus\mathbb{C} W_0)-modules of rank 1. It is proved that such modules can only exist for a=0.
