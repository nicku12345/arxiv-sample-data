We discuss an extension of the Weingarten formula, to the case of noncommutative homogeneous spaces, under suitable "easiness" assumptions. The spaces that we consider are noncommutative algebraic manifolds, generalizing the spaces of type X=G/H\subset\mathbb C^N, with H\subset G\subset U_N being subgroups of the unitary group, subject to certain uniformity conditions. We discuss various axiomatization issues, then we establish the Weingarten formula, and we derive some probabilistic consequences.
