We consider a series of VOAs generated by 3-dimensional Griess algebras. We will show that these VOAs can be characterized by their 3-dimensional Griess algebras and their structures are uniquely determined. As an application, we will determine the groups generated by the Miyamoto involutions associated to Virasoro vectors of our VOAs.
