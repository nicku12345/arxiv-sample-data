In this paper, we present a general construction of 3-transposition groups as automorphism groups of vertex operator algebras. Applying to the moonshine vertex operator algebra, we establish the Conway-Miyamoto correspondences between Fischer 3-transposition groups \mathrm{Fi}_{23} and \mathrm{Fi}_{22} and c=25/28 and c=11/12 Virasoro vectors of subalgebras of the moonshine vertex operator algebra.
