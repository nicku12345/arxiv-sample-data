Let G be a simply connected simple algebraic group over \mathbb{C}, B and B_- its two opposite Borel subgroups, and W the associated Weyl group. It is shown that the coordinate ring {\mathbb C}[G^{u,v}] (u, v\in W) of the double Bruhat cell G^{u,v}=BuB\cap B_-vB_- is isomorphic to the cluster algebra {\mathcal{A}}(\textbf{i})_{{\mathbb C}} and the initial cluster variables of {\mathbb C}[G^{u,v}] are the generalized minors \Delta(k;\textbf{i}) by Berenstein, Fomin, Zelevinsky, Goodearl and Yakimov. In the case that a classical group G is of type {\rm B}_r, {\rm C}_r or {\rm D}_r, we shall describe the non-trivial last r initial cluster variables \{\Delta(k;\textbf{i})\}_{(m-2)r<k\leq (m-1)r} (m is some positive integer) of the cluster algebra \mathbb{C}[L^{u,e}] in terms of monomial realization of Demazure crystals, where L^{u,e} is the reduced double Bruhat cell of type (u,e). The relation between \Delta(k;\textbf{i}) on G^{u,e} and on L^{u,e} is described as well. We also present the corresponding results for type {\rm A}_r though the results for all initial cluster variables have been obtained by ourselves.
