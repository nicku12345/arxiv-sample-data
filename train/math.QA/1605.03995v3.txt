Using the standard filtration associated with a generalized lifting method, we determine all finite-dimensional Hopf algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero whose coradical generates a Hopf subalgebra isomorphic to the smallest non-pointed non-cosemisimple Hopf algebra {\mathcal{K}} and the corresponding infinitesimal module is an indecomposable object in {}^{{\mathcal{K}}}_{{\mathcal{K}}}\mathcal{YD} (we assume that the diagrams are Nichols algebras). As a byproduct, we obtain new Nichols algebras of dimension 8 and new Hopf algebras of dimension 64.
