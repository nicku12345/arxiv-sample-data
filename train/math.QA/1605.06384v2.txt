Like quantum groups, quantum groupoids frequently appear in pairs of mutually dual objects. We develop a general Pontrjagin duality theory for quantum groupoids in the algebraic setting that extends Van Daele's duality theory for multiplier Hopf algebras and overcomes the finiteness restrictions of the approach of Kadison, Szlach\'anyi, B\"ohm and Schauenburg. Our construction is based on the integration theory for multiplier Hopf algebroids and yields, as a corollary, a duality theory for weak multiplier Hopf algebras with integrals. We compute the duals in several examples and introduce morphisms of multiplier Hopf algebroids to succinctly describe their structure. Moreover, we show that such morphisms preserve the antipode.
