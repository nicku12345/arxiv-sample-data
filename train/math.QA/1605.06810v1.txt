We study the properties of the extended graphical calculus for categorified quantum sl(n). The main results include proofs of Reidemeister 2 and Reidemeister 3-like moves involving strands corresponding to arbitrary thicknesses and arbitrary colors -- the results that were anounced in [M. Stosic: Indecomposable objects and Lusztig's canonical basis, Math. Res. Lett. 22, no. 1 (2015), 245-278].
