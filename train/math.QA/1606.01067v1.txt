In this paper, we give a combinatorial realization of the crystal basis of a quantum Weyl module over a quantum affine algebra of type A_{2n}^{(2)}, and a representation-theoretic interpretation of the specialization P_{\lambda}^{A_{2n}^{(2)}} (q,0) of the symmetric Macdonald polynomial P_{\lambda}^{A_{2n}^{(2)}} (q,t) at t=0, where \lambda is a dominant weight and P_{\lambda}^{A_{2n}^{(2)}}(q,t) denotes the specific specialization of the symmetric Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomial P_{\lambda}(q,t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5). More precisely, as some results for untwisted affine types, the set of all (A_{2n}^{(2)}-type) quantum Lakshmibai-Seshadri paths of shape \lambda, which is described in terms of the finite Weyl group W, realizes the crystal basis of a quantum Weyl module over a quantum affine algebra of type {A_{2n}^{(2)}} and its graded character is equal to the specialization P_{\lambda}^{A_{2n}^{(2)}} (q,0) of the symmetric Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomial.
