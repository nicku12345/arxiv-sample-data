We discuss the notion of matrix model, \pi:C(X)\to M_K(C(T)), for algebraic submanifolds of the free complex sphere, X\subset S^{N-1}_{\mathbb C,+}. When K\in\mathbb N is fixed there is a universal such model, which factorizes as \pi:C(X)\to C(X^{(K)})\subset M_K(C(T)). We have X^{(1)}=X_{class} and, under a mild assumption, inclusions X^{(1)}\subset X^{(2)}\subset X^{(3)}\subset\ldots\subset X. Our main results concern X^{(2)},X^{(3)},X^{(4)},\ldots, their relation with various half-classical versions of X, and lead to the construction of families of higher half-liberations of the complex spheres and of the unitary groups, all having faithful matrix models.
