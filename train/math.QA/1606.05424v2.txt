Let O_\tau(\Gamma) be a family of algebras \textit{quantizing} the coordinate ring of \mathbb{C}^2 / \Gamma, where \Gamma is a finite subgroup of \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}), and let G_{\Gamma} be the automorphism group of O_\tau. We study the natural action of G_\Gamma on the space of right ideals of O_\tau (equivalently, finitely generated rank 1 projective O_\tau-modules). It is known that the later can be identified with disjoint union of algebraic (quiver) varieties, and this identification is G_\Gamma-equivariant. In the present paper, when \Gamma \cong \mathbb{Z}_2, we show that the G_{\Gamma}-action on each quiver variety is transitive. We also show that the natural embedding of G_\Gamma into \mathrm{Pic}(O_\tau), the Picard group of O_\tau, is an isomorphism. These results are used to prove that there are countably many non-isomorphic algebras Morita equivalent to O_\tau, and explicit presentation of these algebras are given. Since algebras O_\tau(\mathbb{Z}_2) are isomorphic to primitive factors of U(sl_2), we obtain a complete description of algebras Morita equivalent to primitive factors. A structure of the group G_{\Gamma}, where \Gamma is an arbitrary cyclic group, is also investigated. Our results generalize earlier results obtained for the (first) Weyl algebra A_1.
