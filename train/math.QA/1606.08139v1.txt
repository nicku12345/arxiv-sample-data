A Z_3-graded Hopf algebra structure of exterior algebra with two generators is introduced. Two covariant differential calculus on the Z_3-graded exterior algebra are presented. Using the generators and their partial derivatives a Grassmann-Heisenberg algebra is constructed. An R-matrix which satisfies graded Yang-Baxter equations is obtained. A Z_3-graded universal enveloping algebra U_q(\widetilde{gl}(2)) is constructed with the quadratic elements of the Grassmann-Weyl algebra.
