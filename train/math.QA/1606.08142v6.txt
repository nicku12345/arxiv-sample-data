We prove the existence and uniqueness of Levi-Civita connections for strongly sigma-compatible pseudo-Riemannian metrics on tame differential calculi. Such pseudo-Riemannian metrics properly contain the classes of bilinear metrics as well as their conformal deformations. This extends the previous results in references 9 and 10. Star-compatibility of Levi-Civita connections for bilinear pseudo-Riemannian metrics are also discussed.
