In this article, we develop a general technique for proving the uniqueness of holomorphic vertex operator algebras based on the orbifold construction and its "reverse" process. As an application, we prove that the structure of a strongly regular holomorphic vertex operator algebra of central charge 24 is uniquely determined by its weight one Lie algebra if the Lie algebra has the type E_{6,3}G_{2,1}^3, A_{2,3}^6 or A_{5,3}D_{4,3}A_{1,1}^3.
