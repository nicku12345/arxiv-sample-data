We study \N-graded \phi-coordinated modules for a general quantum vertex algebra V of a certain type in terms of an associative algebra \widetilde{A}(V) introduced by Y.-Z. Huang. Among the main results, we establish a bijection between the set of equivalence classes of irreducible \N-graded \phi-coordinated V-modules and the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible \widetilde{A}(V)-modules. We also show that for a vertex operator algebra, rationality, regularity, and fusion rules are independent of the choice of the conformal vector.
