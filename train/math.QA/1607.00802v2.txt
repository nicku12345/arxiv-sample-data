Let \frak{g} be a finite dimensional simple complex Lie algebra and U=U_q(\frak{g}) the quantized enveloping algebra (in the sense of Jantzen) with q being generic. In this paper, we show that the center Z(U_q(\frak{g})) of the quantum group U_q(\frak{g}) is isomorphic to a monoid algebra, and that Z(U_q(\frak{g})) is a polynomial algebra if and only if \frak{g} is of type A_1, B_n, C_n, D_{2k+2}, E_7, E_8, F_4 or G_2. Moreover, in case \frak{g} is of type D_{n} with n odd, then Z(U_q(\frak{g})) is isomorphic to a quotient algebra of a polynomial algebra in n+1 variables with one relation; in case \frak{g} is of type E_6, then Z(U_q(\frak{g})) is isomorphic to a quotient algebra of a polynomial algebra in fourteen variables with eight relations; in case \frak{g} is of type A_{n}, then Z(U_q(\frak{g})) is isomorphic to a quotient algebra of a polynomial algebra described by n-sequences.
