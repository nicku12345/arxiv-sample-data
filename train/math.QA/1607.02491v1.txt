A unitary orthosymplectic quantum supergroup is introduced. Two covariant differential calculi on the quantum superspace SP_q^{1|2} are presented. The h-deformed symplectic superspaces via a contraction of the q-deformed symplectic superspaces are obtained. A new h-deformation of the Heisenberg superalgebra is given.
