In this paper, the relations between the Yang-Baxter equation and affine actions are explored in detail. In particular, we classify solutions of the Yang-Baxter equations in two ways: (i) by their associated affine actions of their structure groups on their derived structure groups, and (ii) by the C*-dynamical systems obtained from their associated affine actions. On the way to our main results, several other useful results are also obtained.
