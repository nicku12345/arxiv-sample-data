The loop super-Virasoro conformal superalgebra \mathfrak{cls} associated with the loop super-Virasoro algebra is constructed in the present paper. The conformal superderivation algebra of \mathfrak{cls} is completely determined, which is shown to consist of inner superderivations. And nontrivial free and free \mathbb{Z}-graded \mathfrak{cls}-modules of rank two are classified. We also give a classification of irreducible free \mathfrak{cls}-modules of rank two and all irreducible submodules of each free \mathbb{Z}-graded \mathfrak{cls}-module of rank two.
