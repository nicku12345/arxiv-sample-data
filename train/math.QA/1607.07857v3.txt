We complete the classification of Hopf algebras whose infinitesimal braiding is a principal Yetter-Drinfeld realization of a braided vector space of Cartan type G_2 over a cosemisimple Hopf algebra. We develop a general formula for a class of liftings in which the quantum Serre relations hold. We give a detailed explanation of the procedure for finding the relations, based on the recent work of Andruskiewitsch, Angiono and Rossi Bertone.
