It is shown that if \mathfrak B(V)  is connected Nichols algebra of diagonal type with \dim V>1, then \dim (\mathfrak L^-(V)) = \infty (resp.  \dim (\mathfrak L(V)) = \infty ) ( resp.  \dim (\mathfrak B(V)) = \infty ) if and only if \Delta(\mathfrak B(V))  is an arithmetic root system and the quantum numbers (i.e. the fixed parameters) of generalized Dynkin diagrams of V are of finite order. Sufficient and necessary conditions for m-fold adjoint action in \mathfrak B(V) equal to zero, viz. \overline{l}_{x_{i}}^{m}[x_{j}]^ -=0 for x_i,~x_j\in \mathfrak B(V), are given.
