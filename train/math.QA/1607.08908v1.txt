We construct a representation of the Temperley-Lieb algebra from a multiplicity-free semisimple monoidal Abelian category {\cal C}, with two simple objects \lambda and \nu such that \lambda\otimes\nu is simple and Hom_{\cal C}(\lambda\otimes \lambda, \nu) is not empty. A self-contained manual to tensor categories is also provided as well as a summary of the best known example of the construction: Schur-Weyl duality for U_q(sl_2)).
