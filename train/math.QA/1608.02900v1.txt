We prove the equivalence of two presentations of deformed double current algebras associated to a complex simple Lie algebra, the first one obtained via a degeneration of affine Yangians while the other one naturally appeared in the construction of the elliptic Casimir connection. We also construct a specific central element of these algebras and, in type A, show that they contain a very large center for certain values of their parameters.
