This paper is about \phi-coordinated modules for weak quantum vertex algebras. Among the main results, several canonical connections among \phi-coordinated modules for different \phi are established. For vertex operator algebras, a reinterpretation of Frenkel-Huang-Lepowsky's theorem on contragredient module is given in terms of \phi-coordinated modules.
