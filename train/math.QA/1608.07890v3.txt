Let M(1) be the vertex operator algebra with the Virasoro element \omega associated to the Heisenberg algebra of rank 1 and let M(1)^{+} be the subalgebra of M(1) consisting of the fixed points of an automorphism of M(1) of order 2. We classify the simple weak M(1)^{+}-modules with a non-zero element w such that for some integer s\geq 2, \omega_i w\in{\mathbb C}w (i=\lfloor s/2\rfloor+1,\lfloor s/2\rfloor+2,\ldots,s-1), \omega_{s}w\in{\mathbb C}^{\times}w, and \omega_i w=0 for all i>s. The result says that any such simple weak M(1)^{+}-module is isomorphic to some simple weak M(1)-module or to some \theta-twisted simple weak M(1)-module.
