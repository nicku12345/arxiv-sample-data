We propose a non skew-symmetric generalization of the original definition of double Poisson Bracket by M. Van den Bergh. It allows one to explicitly construct more general class of H0-Poisson structures on finitely generated associative algebras. We show that modified double Poisson brackets inherit certain major properties of the double Poisson brackets.
