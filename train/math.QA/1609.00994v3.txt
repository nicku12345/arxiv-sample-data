We prove that the trace of the nth power of the antipode of a Hopf algebra with the Chevalley property is a gauge invariant, for each integer n. As a consequence, the order of the antipode, and its square, are invariant under Drinfeld twists. The invariance of the order of the antipode is closely related to a question of Shimizu on the pivotal covers of finite tensor categories, which we affirmatively answer for representation categories of Hopf algebras with the Chevalley property.
