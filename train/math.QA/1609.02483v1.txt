We construct quantization of semisimple conjugacy classes of the exceptional group G=G_2 along with and by means of their exact representations in highest weight modules of the quantum group U_q(\mathfrak{g}). With every point t of a fixed maximal torus we associate a highest weight module M_t over U_q(\mathfrak{g}) and realize the quantized polynomial algebra of the class of t by linear operators on M_t. Quantizations corresponding to points of the same orbit of the Weyl group are isomorphic.
