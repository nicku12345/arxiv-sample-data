We give a complete classification of modular categories of dimension p^3m where p is prime and m is a square-free integer. When p is odd, all such categories are pointed. For p=2 one encounters modular categories with the same fusion ring as orthogonal quantum groups at certain roots of unity, namely SO(2m)_2. As an immediate step we classify a more general class of so-called even metaplectic modular categories with the same fusion rules as SO(2N)_2 with N odd.
