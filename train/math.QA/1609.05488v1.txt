Let \mathbb F denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over \mathbb F with finite positive dimension. Pick a nonzero q \in \mathbb F such that q^4 \not=1, and let A,B,C denote a Leonard triple on V that has q-Racah type. We show that there exist invertible W, W', W''  in {\rm End}(V) such that (i) A commutes with W and W^{-1}BW-C; (ii) B commutes with W' and (W')^{-1}CW'-A; (iii) C commutes with W'' and (W'')^{-1}AW''-B. Moreover each of W,W', W'' is unique up to multiplication by a nonzero scalar in \mathbb F. We show that the three elements W'W, W''W', WW'' mutually commute, and their product is a scalar multiple of the identity. A number of related results are obtained.
