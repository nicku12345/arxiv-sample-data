We determine convex PBW-type Lyndon bases for two-parameter quantum groups U_{r,s}(F_4) with detailed commutation relations. We construct a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra \mathfrak u_{r,s}(F_4), as a quotient of U_{r,s}(F_4) by a Hopf ideal generated by certain central elements, which is pointed, and of a Drinfel'd double structure under a certain condition. All of Hopf isomorphisms of \mathfrak u_{r,s}(F_4) are determined which are important for seeking the possible new pointed objects in low order with (\ell, 210)\ne 1. Finally, necessary and sufficient conditions for \mathfrak u_{r,s}(F_4) to be a ribbon Hopf algebra are singled out by describing the left and right integrals.
