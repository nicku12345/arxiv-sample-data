Let p and q be distinct prime numbers. We study the Galois objects and cocycle deformations of the noncommutative, noncocommutative, semisimple Hopf algebras of odd dimension p^3 and of dimension pq^2. We obtain that the p+1 non-isomorphic self-dual semisimple Hopf algebras of dimension p^3 classified by Masuoka have no non-trivial cocycle deformations, extending his previous results for the 8-dimensional Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra. This is done as a consequence of the classification of categorical Morita equivalence classes among semisimple Hopf algebras of odd dimension p^3, established by the third-named author in an appendix.
