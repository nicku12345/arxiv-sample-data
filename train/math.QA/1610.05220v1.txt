The degree d part of the cokernel \mathsf C_d of the Johnson homomorphism decomposes into irreducible \mathrm{SP}-modules indexed by partitions of d-2r for r\geq 0: \mathsf C_d\cong \mathsf C_d(d)\oplus \mathsf C_d(d-2)\oplus\cdots. In this addendum we calculate \mathsf{C}_d(d) precisely: it is isomorphic to the \mathrm{GL}(V)-decomposition of a space of coinvariants (V^{\otimes d})_{D_{2d}}, and the isomorphism is induced by Enomoto and Satoh's trace map. This establishes Conjecture 7.2 of the paper "The Johnson Cokernel and the Enomoto-Satoh invariant."
