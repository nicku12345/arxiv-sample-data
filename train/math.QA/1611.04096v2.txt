The goal of the present paper is to classify an interesting class of elementary quasi-Hopf algebras, or equivalently, finite-dimensional pointed Majid algebras. By a Tannaka-Krein type duality, this determines a big class of pointed finite tensor categories. Based on some interesting observations of normalized 3-cocycles on finite abelian groups, we elucidate an explicit connection between our objective pointed Majid algebras and finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras over finite abelian groups. With a help of this connection and the successful theory of diagonal Nichols algebras over abelian groups, we provide a conceptual classification of finite-dimensional graded pointed Majid algebras of diagonal type. Some efficient methods of construction are also given.
