A series of associative algebras A_n(V) for a vertex operator algebra V over an arbitrary algebraically closed field and nonnegative integers n are constructed such that there is a one to one correspondence between irreducible A_n(V)-modules which are not A_{n-1}(V) modules and irreducible V-modules. Moreover, V is rational if and only if A_n(V) is semisimple for all n. In particular, the homogeneous subspaces of any irreducible V-module are finite dimensional for rational vertex operator algebra V.
