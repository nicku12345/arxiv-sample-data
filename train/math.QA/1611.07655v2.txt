The vertex operator algebra structure of a strongly regular holomorphic vertex operator algebra V of central charge 24 is proved to be uniquely determined by the Lie algebra structure of its weight one space V_1 if V_1 is a Lie algebra of the type A_{1,4}^{12}, B_{2,2}^6, B_{3,2}^4, B_{4,2}^3, B_{6,2}^2, B_{12,2}, D_{4,2}^2B_{2,1}^4, D_{8,2}B_{4,1}^2, A_{3,2}^4A_{1,1}^4, D_{5,2}^2A_{3,1}^2, D_{9,2}A_{7,1}, C_{4,1}^4 or D_{6,2}B_{3,1}^2C_{4,1}.
