This is a brief note on a numerical computation of the dimension of the center of the small quantum group u_q(sl_3) at the 5th root of unity. The obtained dimension is 57. Using the description of the regular block of the center for u_q(sl_3), given in arXiv:1604.07380, we conclude that the dimension of the singular parabolic block of the center for u_q(sl_3) is 6, and obtain a complete block decomposition of the center in this case.
