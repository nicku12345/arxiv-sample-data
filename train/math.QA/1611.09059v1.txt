Generalizing the construction of the cyclotomic Gaudin algebra from arXiv:1409.6937, we define the universal cyclotomic Gaudin algebra. It is a cyclotomic generalization of the Gaudin models with irregular singularities defined in arXiv:math/0612798.   We go on to solve, by Bethe ansatz, the special case in which the Lax matrix has simple poles at the origin and arbitrarily many finite points, and a double pole at infinity.
