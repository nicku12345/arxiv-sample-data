One-point theta functions for modules of vertex operator algebras (VOAs) are defined and studied. These functions are a generalization of the character theta functions studied by Miyamoto and are deviations of the classical one-point functions for modules of a VOA. Transformation laws with respect to the group \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) are established.
