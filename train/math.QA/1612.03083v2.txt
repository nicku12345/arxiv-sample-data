It is conjectured that the Kashiwara-Vergne Lie algebra \widehat{\mathfrak{krv}}_2 is isomorphic to the direct sum of the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra \mathfrak{grt}_1 and a one-dimensional Lie algebra. In this paper, we use the graph complex of internally connected graphs to define a nested sequence of Lie subalgebras of \widehat{\mathfrak{krv}}_2 whose intersection is \mathfrak{grt}_1, thus giving a way to interpolate between these two Lie algebras.
