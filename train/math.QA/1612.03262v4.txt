Let H_8 be the neither commutative nor cocommutative semisimple eight dimensional Hopf algebra, which is also called Kac-Paljutkin algebra \cite{MR0208401}. All simple Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over H_8 are given. As for simple objects and direct sums of two simple objects in {}_{H_8}^{H_8}\mathcal{YD}, we calculated dimensions for the corresponding Nichols algebras, except four semisimple cases which are generally difficult. Under the assumption that the four undetermined Nichols algebras are all infinite dimensional, we determine all the finite dimensional Nichols algebras over H_8. It turns out that the already known finite dimensional Nichols algebras are all diagonal type. In fact, they are Cartan types A_1, A_2, A_2\times A_2, A_1\times \cdots \times A_1, and A_1\times \cdots \times A_1\times A_2. By the way, we calculate Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions for some Nichols algebras. As an application, we obtain five families of new finite dimensional Hopf algebras over H_8 according to the lifting method.
