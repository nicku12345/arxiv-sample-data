Earlier we have proposed new q - Maxwell equations which are the first members of an infinite new hierarchy of q - difference equations. We have used an indexless formulation in which all indices are traded for two conjugate variables, z,\bar z. Weproposed also new q - Minkowski coordinates which together with z,\bar z can be interpreted as the six local coordinates of a SU_q(2,2) flag manifold. In the present paper we generalise the main ingredients of this construction to the multiparameter case using the seven-parameter quantum group deformation of GL(4) and U(gl(4)) and the four-parameter quantum group deformation of SL(4) and U(sl(4)). The main result is the explicit presentation of the multiparameter quantum Minkowski space-time within the corresponding deformed flag manifold.
