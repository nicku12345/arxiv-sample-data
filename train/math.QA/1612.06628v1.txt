The aim of this paper is to develop the theory of skew Armendariz and quasi-Armendariz modules over skew PBW extensions. We generalize the results of several works in the literature concerning Ore extensions to another non-commutative rings which can not be expressed as iterated Ore extensions. As a consequence of our treatment, we extend and unify different results about the Armendariz, Baer, p.p., and p.q.-Baer properties for Ore extensions and skew PBW extensions.
