In this paper, a holomorphic vertex operator algebra U of central charge 24 with the weight one Lie algebra A_{8,3}A_{2,1}^2 is proved to be unique. Moreover, a holomorphic vertex operator algebra of central charge 24 with weight one Lie algebra F_{4,6}A_{2,2} is obtained by applying a \mathbb{Z}_2-orbifold construction to U. The uniqueness of such a vertex operator algebra is also established. By a similar method, we also established the uniqueness of a holomorphic vertex operator algebra of central charge 24 with the weight one Lie algebra E_{7,3}A_{5,1}. As a consequence, we verify that all 71 Lie algebras in Schellekens' list can be realized as the weight one Lie algebras of some holomorphic vertex operator algebras of central charge 24. In addition, we establish the uniqueness of three holomorphic vertex operator algebras of central charge 24 whose weight one Lie algebras have the type A_{8,3}A_{2,1}^2, F_{4,6}A_{2,2}, and E_{7,3}A_{5,1}.
