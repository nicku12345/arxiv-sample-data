We classify finite pointed braided tensor categories admitting a fiber functor in terms of bilinear forms on symmetric Yetter-Drinfeld modules over abelian groups. We describe the groupoid formed by braided equivalences of such categories in terms of certain metric data, generalizing the well-known result of Joyal and Street for fusion categories. We study symmetric centers and ribbon structures of pointed braided tensor categories and examine their Drinfeld centers.
