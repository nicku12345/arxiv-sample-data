A Leonard pair is a pair of diagonalizable linear transformations of a finite-dimensional vector space, each of which acts in an irreducible tridiagonal fashion on an eigenbasis for the other one. Let \mathbb F denote an algebraically closed field, and fix a nonzero q \in \mathbb F that is not a root of unity. The universal double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) \hat{H}_q of type (C_1^\vee,C_1) is the associative \mathbb F-algebra defined by generators \lbrace t_i^{\pm 1}\rbrace_{i=0}^3 and relations (i) t_it_i^{-1}=t_i^{-1}t_i=1; (ii) t_i+t_i^{-1} is central; (iii) t_0t_1t_2t_3 = q^{-1}. We consider the elements X=t_3t_0 and Y=t_0t_1 of \hat{H}_q. Let \mathcal V denote a finite-dimensional irreducible \hat{H}_q-module on which each of X, Y is diagonalizable and t_0 has two distinct eigenvalues. Then \mathcal V is a direct sum of the two eigenspaces of t_0. We show that the pair X+X^{-1}, Y+Y^{-1} acts on each eigenspace as a Leonard pair, and each of these Leonard pairs falls into a class said to have q-Racah type. Thus from \mathcal V we obtain a pair of Leonard pairs of q-Racah type. It is known that a Leonard pair of q-Racah type is determined up to isomorphism by a parameter sequence (a,b,c,d) called its Huang data. Given a pair of Leonard pairs of q-Racah type, we find necessary and sufficient conditions on their Huang data for that pair to come from the above construction.
