We recall Lusztig's construction of the asymptotic Hecke algebra J of a Coxeter system (W,S) via the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of the corresponding Hecke algebra. The algebra J has a direct summand J_E for each two-sided Kazhdan--Lusztig cell of W, and we study the summand J_C corresponding to a particular cell C called the subregular cell. We develop a combinatorial method to compute J_C without using the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis. As applications, we deduce some connections between J_C and the Coxeter diagram of W, and we show that for certain Coxeter systems J_C contains subalgebras that are free fusion rings in the sense of [Banica], thereby connecting the subalgebras to compact quantum groups arising from operator algebra theory.
