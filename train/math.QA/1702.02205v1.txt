We review different constructions of the supersymmetry subalgebras of the chiral de Rham complex on special holonomy manifolds. We describe the difference between the holomorphic-anti-holomorphic sectors based on a local free ghost system vs the decomposition in left-right sectors from a local Boson-Fermion system. We describe the topological twist in the case of G_2 and Spin_7 manifolds. We describe the construction of these algebras as quantum Hamiltonian reduction of Lie superalgebras at the minimal or superprincipal nilpotent.
