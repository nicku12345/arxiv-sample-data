Let \mathfrak{g} be a hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra of rank 2, and set \lambda: = \Lambda_1 - \Lambda_2, where \Lambda_1, \Lambda_2 are the fundamental weights for \mathfrak{g}; note that \lambda is neither dominant nor antidominant. Let \mathbb{B}(\lambda) be the crystal of all Lakshmibai-Seshadri paths of shape \lambda. We prove that (the crystal graph of) \mathbb{B}(\lambda) is connected. Furthermore, we give an explicit description of Lakshmibai-Seshadri paths of shape \lambda.
