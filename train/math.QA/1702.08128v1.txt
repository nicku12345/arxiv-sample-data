When the parameter q is a root of unity, the Temperley-Lieb algebra TL_n(q) is non-semisimple for almost all n. Jones showed that there is a canonical symmetric bilinear form on TL_n(q), whose radical R_n(q) is generated by a certain idempotent E_\ell\in TL_{\ell-1}(q)\subseteq TL_n(q), which is now referred to as the Jones-Wenzl idempotent, for which an explicit formula was subsequently given by Graham and Lehrer. In this work, we study the quotients Q_n(\ell):=TL_n(q)/R_n(q), where |q^2|=\ell, which are precisely the algebras generated by Jones' projections. We give the dimensions of their simple modules, as well as \dim(Q_n(\ell)); en route we give generating functions and recursions for the dimensions of cell modules and associated combinatorics. When the order |q^2|=4, we obtain an isomorphism of Q_n(\ell) with the even part of the Clifford algebra, well known to physicists through the Ising model. When |q^2|=5, we obtain a sequence of algebras whose dimensions are the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers. The general case is described explicitly.
