We find a dual version of a previous double-bosonisation theorem whereby each finite-dimensional braided-Hopf algebra B in the category of comodules of a coquasitriangular Hopf algebra A has an associated coquasitriangular Hopf algebra B^{\underline{\rm op}}\rtimes A \ltimes B^*. As an application we find new generators for c_q[SL_{2}] reduced at q a primitive odd root of unity with the remarkable property that their monomials are essentially a dual basis to the standard PBW basis of the reduced Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum enveloping algebra u_q(sl_{2}). Our methods apply in principle for general c_{q}[G] as we demonstrate for c_q[SL_3] at certain odd roots of unity.
