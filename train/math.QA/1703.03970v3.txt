Under very strong axioms, there is precisely one real noncommutative geometry between the classical one and the free one, namely the half-classical one, coming from the relations abc=cba. We discuss here the complex analogues of this geometry, notably with a study of the geometry coming from the commutation relations between all the variables \{ab^*,a^*b\}, that we believe to be the "correct" one.
