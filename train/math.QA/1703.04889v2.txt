For the simple Lie algebra  \frak{so}_m, we study the commutant vertex operator algebra of  L_{\hat{\frak{so}}_{m}}(n,0) in the n-fold tensor product  L_{\hat{\frak{so}}_{m}}(1,0)^{\otimes n}. It turns out that this commutant vertex operator algebra can be realized as a fixed point subalgebra of L_{\hat{\frak{so}}_{n}}(m,0) (or its simple current extension) associated with a certain abelian group. This result may be viewed as a version of level-rank duality.
