Let W be a finite dimensional purely odd supervector space over \mathbb{C}, and let \sRep(W) be the finite symmetric tensor category of finite dimensional superrepresentations of the finite supergroup W. We show that the set of equivalence classes of finite non-degenerate braided tensor categories \C containing \sRep(W) as a Lagrangian subcategory is a torsor over the cyclic group \mathbb{Z}/16\mathbb{Z}. In particular, we obtain that there are 8 non-equivalent such braided tensor categories \C which are integral and 8 which are non-integral.
