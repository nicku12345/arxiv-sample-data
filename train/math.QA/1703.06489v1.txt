In previous work the authors introduced a new class of modular quasi-Hopf algebras D^{\omega}(G, A) associated to a finite group G, a central subgroup A, and a 3-cocycle \omega\in Z^3(G, C^x). In the present paper we propose a description of the class of orbifold models of rational vertex operator algebras whose module category is tensor equivalent to D^{\omega}(G, A)-mod. The paper includes background on quasi-Hopf algebras and a discussion of some relevant orbifolds.
