The purpose of this paper is to study Rota-Baxter operators for BiHom-associative algebras. Moreover, we introduce and discuss the properties of the notions of BiHom-(tri)dendriform algebra, BiHom-Zinbiel algebra and BiHom-quadri-algebra. We construct the free Rota-Baxter BiHom-associative algebra and present some observations about categories and functors related to Rota-Baxter structures.
