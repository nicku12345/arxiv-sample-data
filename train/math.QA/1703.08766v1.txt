We study symmetric groups and left braces satisfying special conditions, or identities. We are particularly interested in the impact of conditions like \textbf{Raut} and \textbf{lri} on the properties of the symmetric group and its associated brace. We show that the symmetric group G=G(X,r) associated to a nontrivial solution (X,r) has multipermutation level 2 if and only if G satisfies \textbf{lri}. In the special case of a two-sided brace we express each of the conditions \textbf{lri} and \textbf{Raut} as identities on the associated radical ring G_*. We apply these to construct examples of two-sided braces satisfying some prescribed conditions. In particular we construct a finite two-sided brace with condition \textbf{Raut} which does not satisfy \textbf{lri}. (It is known that condition \textbf{lri} implies \textbf{Raut}). We show that a finitely generated two-sided brace which satisfies \textbf{lri} has a finite multipermutation level which is bounded by the number of its generators.
