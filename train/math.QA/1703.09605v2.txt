We construct a direct quasi-isomorphism from Kontsevich's graph complex GC_n to the oriented graph complex OGC_{n+1}, thus providing an alternative proof that the two complexes are quasi-isomorphic. Moreover, the result is extended to the sequence of multi-oriented graph complexes, where GC_n and OGC_{n+1} are the first two members. These complexes play a key role in the deformation theory of multi-oriented props recently invented by Sergei Merkulov.
