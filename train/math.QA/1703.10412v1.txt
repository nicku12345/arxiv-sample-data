A dynamical Yang-Baxter map, introduced by Shibukawa, is a solution of the set-theoretical analogue of the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation. In this paper, we initiate a quiver-theoretical approach for the study of dynamical Yang-Baxter maps. Our key observation is that the category of dynamical sets over a set \Lambda, introduced by Shibukawa to establish a categorical framework to deal with dynamical Yang-Baxter maps, can be embedded into the category of quivers with vertices \Lambda. By using this embedding, we shed light on Shibukawa's classification result of a certain class of dynamical Yang-Baxter maps and extend his construction to obtain a new class of dynamical Yang-Baxter maps. We also discuss a relation between Shibukawa's bialgebroid associated to a dynamical Yang-Baxter map and Hayashi's weak bialgebra associated to a star-triangular face model.
