We consider C^*-algebra Isom_{q_{ij}} generated by n isometries a_1, \ldots, a_n satisfying the relations a_i^* a_j = q_{ij} a_j a_i^* with \max |q_{ij}| < 1. This C^*-algebra is shown to be nuclear. We prove that the Fock representation of Isom_{q_{ij}} is faithful. Further we describe an ideal in Isom_{q_{ij}} which is isomorphic to the algebra of compact operators.
