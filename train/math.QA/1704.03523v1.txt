We show that the core of a weakly group-theoretical braided fusion category \C is equivalent as a braided fusion category to a tensor product \B \boxtimes \D, where \D is a pointed weakly anisotropic braided fusion category, and \B \cong \vect or \B is an Ising braided category. In particular, if \C is integral, then its core is a pointed weakly anisotropic braided fusion category. As an application we give a characterization of the solvability of a weakly group-theoretical braided fusion category. We also prove that an integral modular category all of whose simple objects have Frobenius-Perron dimension at most 2 is necessarily group-theoretical.
