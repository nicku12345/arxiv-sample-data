Let V be a braided vector space of diagonal type. Let \mathfrak B(V), \mathfrak L^-(V) and \mathfrak L(V) be the Nichols algebra, Nichols Lie algebra and Nichols braided Lie algebra over V, respectively. We show that a monomial belongs to \mathfrak L(V) if and only if that this monomial is connected. We obtain the basis for \mathfrak L(V) of arithmetic root systems and the dimension for \mathfrak L(V) of finite Cartan type. We give the sufficient and necessary conditions for \mathfrak B(V) = F\oplus \mathfrak L^-(V) and \mathfrak L^-(V)= \mathfrak L(V). We obtain an explicit basis of \mathfrak L^ - (V) over quantum linear space V with \dim V=2.
