In this paper we provide a quantization via formality of Poisson actions of a triangular Lie algebra (\mathfrak g,r) on a smooth manifold M. Using the formality of polydifferential operators on Lie algebroids we obtain a deformation quantization of M together with a quantum group \mathscr{U}_\hbar(\mathfrak{g}) and a map of associated DGLA's. This motivates a definition of quantum action in terms of L_\infty-morphisms which generalizes the one given by Drinfeld.
