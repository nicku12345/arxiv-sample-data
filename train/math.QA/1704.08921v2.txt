We study a mixed tensor product \mathbf{3}^{\otimes m} \otimes \mathbf{\overline{3}}^{\otimes n} of the three-dimensional fundamental representations of the Hopf algebra U_{q} s\ell(2|1), whenever q is not a root of unity. Formulas for the decomposition of tensor products of any simple and projective U_{q} s\ell(2|1)-module with the generating modules \mathbf{3} and \mathbf{\overline{3}} are obtained. The centralizer of U_{q} s\ell(2|1) on the chain is calculated. It is shown to be the quotient \mathscr{X}_{m,n} of the quantum walled Brauer algebra. The structure of projective modules over \mathscr{X}_{m,n} is written down explicitly. It is known that the walled Brauer algebras form an infinite tower. We have calculated the corresponding restriction functors on simple and projective modules over \mathscr{X}_{m,n}. This result forms a crucial step in decomposition of the mixed tensor product as a bimodule over \mathscr{X}_{m,n}\boxtimes U_{q} s\ell(2|1). We give an explicit bimodule structure for all m,n.
