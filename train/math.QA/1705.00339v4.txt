Let p,q,r be distinct prime numbers and \mathds{k} an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. We study the classification of pointed Hopf algebras over \mathds{k} of dimension p^2q, pq^2 and pqr. We obtain a complete classification of pointed Hopf algebras of dimension pq, pqr, p^2q, 2q^2 and 4p. We also classify all pointed Hopf algebras of dimension pq^2 whose diagrams are Nichols algebras and show that pointed Hopf algebras of dimension pq^2 whose diagrams are not Nichols algebras must be Hopf extensions of Taft algebras by restricted universal enveloping algebras of dimension p. In particular, we obtain many new non-commutative and non-cocommutative finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras.
