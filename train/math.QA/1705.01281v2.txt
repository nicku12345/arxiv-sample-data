In this article, we study orbifold constructions associated with the Leech lattice vertex operator algebra. As an application, we prove that the structure of a strongly regular holomorphic vertex operator algebra of central charge 24 is uniquely determined by its weight one Lie algebra if the Lie algebra has the type A_{3,4}^3A_{1,2}, A_{4,5}^2, D_{4,12}A_{2,6}, A_{6,7}, A_{7,4}A_{1,1}^3, D_{5,8}A_{1,2} or D_{6,5}A_{1,1}^2 by using the reverse orbifold construction. Our result also provides alternative constructions of these vertex operator algebras (except for the case A_{6,7}) from the Leech lattice vertex operator algebra.
