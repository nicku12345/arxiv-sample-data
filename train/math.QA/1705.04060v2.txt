We construct a filtration of chiral Hodge cohomolgy of a K3 surface X, such that its associated graded object is a unitary representation of the N=4 vertex algebra with central charge 6 and its subspace of primitive vectors has the property: its equivariant character for a symplectic automorphism g of X agrees with the McKay-Thompson series for g in Mathieu moonshine.
