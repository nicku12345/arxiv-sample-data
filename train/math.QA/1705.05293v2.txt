We pursue a classification of low-rank super-modular categories parallel to that of modular categories. We classify all super-modular categories up to rank=6, and spin modular categories up to rank=11. In particular, we show that, up to fusion rules, there is exactly one non-split super-modular category of rank 2,4 and 6, namely PSU(2)_{4k+2} for k=0,1 and 2. This classification is facilitated by adapting and extending well-known constraints from modular categories to super-modular categories, such as Verlinde and Frobenius-Schur indicator formulae.
