These notes contain an introduction to the theory of complex semisimple quantum groups. Our main aim is to discuss the classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules for these quantum groups, following Joseph and Letzter. Along the way we cover extensive background material on quantized universal enveloping algebras and explain connections to the analytical theory in the setting of locally compact quantum groups.
