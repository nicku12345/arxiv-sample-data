For p = 3,5,7,13, we consider a {\mathbb Z}_p-orbifold construction of the Moonshine vertex operator algebra V^\natural. We show that the vertex operator algebra obtained by the {\mathbb Z}_p-orbifold construction on the Leech lattice vertex operator algebra V_\Lambda and a lift of a fixed-point-free isometry of order p is isomorphic to the Moonshine vertex operator algebra V^\natural. We also describe the relationship between those {\mathbb Z}_p-orbifold constructions and the {\mathbb Z}_2-orbifold construction in a uniform manner. In Appendix, we give a characterization of the Moonshine vertex operator algebra V^\natural by two mutually orthogonal Ising vectors.
