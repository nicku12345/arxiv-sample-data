There is a long-standing belief that the modular tensor categories \mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{g},k), for k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq1} and finite-dimensional simple complex Lie algebras \mathfrak{g}, contain exceptional connected \'etale algebras at only finitely many levels k. This premise has known implications for the study of relations in the Witt group of nondegenerate braided fusion categories, modular invariants of conformal field theories, and the classification of subfactors in the theory of von Neumann algebras. Here we confirm this conjecture when \mathfrak{g} has rank 2, contributing proofs and explicit bounds when \mathfrak{g} is of type B_2 or G_2, adding to the previously known positive results for types A_1 and A_2.
