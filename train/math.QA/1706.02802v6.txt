Let X be a noncommutative real compact algebraic manifold, in the sense that C(X)=C^*(x_1,\ldots,x_N|x_i=x_i^*,f_\alpha(x_1,\ldots,x_N)=0), with f_\alpha\in\mathbb R<x_1,\ldots,x_N>. Associated to X are its classical version X^\times, obtained via the relations ab=ba, and its half-classical version X^*, obtained via the relations abc=cba. We discuss here some general questions regarding the inclusions X^\times\subset X^*\subset X, and notably the comparison of the corresponding quantum isometry groups. Our main results concern the half-classical case, X=X^*, and more specifically, the case of the submanifolds X\subset S^{N-1}_{\mathbb R,*}.
