In this paper, we associate quantum vertex algebras to a certain family of associative algebras \widetilde{\A}(g) which are essentially Ding-Iohara algebras. To do this, we introduce another closely related family of associative algebras \A(h). The associated quantum vertex algebras are based on the vacuum modules for \A(h), whereas \phi-coordinated modules for these quantum vertex algebras are associated to \widetilde{A}(g)-modules. Furthermore, we classify their irreducible \phi-coordinated modules.
