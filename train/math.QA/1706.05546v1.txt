Pascal Baseilhac and Stefan Kolb recently introduced the Lusztig automorphism L of the q-Onsager algebra \mathcal O_q. In this paper, we express each of L, L^{-1} as a formal sum involving some quantum adjoints. In addition, (i) we give a computer-free proof that L exists; (ii) we establish the higher order q-Dolan/Grady relations previously conjectured by Baseilhac and Thao Vu; (iii) we obtain a Lusztig automorphism for the current algebra \mathcal A_q associated with \mathcal O_q; (iv) we describe what happens when a finite-dimensional irreducible \mathcal O_q-module is twisted via L.
