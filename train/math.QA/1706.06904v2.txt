We give a classification of semisimple and separable algebras in a multi-fusion category over an arbitrary field in analogy to Wedderben-Artin theorem in classical algebras. It turns out that, if the multi-fusion category admits a semisimple Drinfeld center, the only obstruction to the separability of a semisimple algebra arises from inseparable field extensions as in classical algebras. Among others, we show that a division algebra is separable if and only if it has a nonvanishing dimension.
