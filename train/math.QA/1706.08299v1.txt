The goal of this article is to define a linearized or depth-graded version \mathfrak{lkv}, and a closely related elliptic version \mathfrak{krv}_{ell}, of the Kashiwara-Vergne Lie algebra \mathfrak{krv} originally constructed by Alekseev and Torossian as the space of solutions to the linearized Kashiwara-Vergne problem. We show how the elliptic Lie algebra \mathfrak{krv}_{ell} is related to earlier constructions of elliptic versions \mathfrak{grt}_{ell} and \mathfrak{ds}_{ell} of the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra \mathfrak{grt} and the double shuffle Lie algebra \mathfrak{ds}. In particular we show that there is an injective Lie morphism \mathfrak{ds}_{ell}\hookrightarrow \mathfrak{krv}_{ell}, and an injective Lie algebra morphism \mathfrak{krv}\rightarrow \mathfrak{krv}_{ell} extending the known morphisms \mathfrak{grt}\hookrightarrow\mathfrak{grt}_{ell} (Enriquez section) and \mathfrak{ds}\rightarrow\mathfrak{ds}_{ell} (\'Ecalle map).
