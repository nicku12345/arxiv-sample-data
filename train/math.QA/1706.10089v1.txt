Feigin-Stoyanovsky's type subspaces for affine Lie algebras of type C_\ell^{(1)} have monomial bases with a nice combinatorial description. We describe bases of whole standard modules in terms of semi-infinite monomials obtained as "a limit of translations" of bases for Feigin-Stoyanovsky's type subspaces.
