In this paper we determine the projective unitary representations of finite dimensional Lie supergroups whose underlying Lie superalgebra is \frak{g} = A \otimes \frak{k}, where \frak{k} is a compact simple Lie superalgebra and A is a supercommutative associative (super)algebra; the crucial case is when A = \Lambda_s(\mathbb{R}) is a Gra\ss{}mann algebra. Since we are interested in projective representations, the first step consists of determining the cocycles defining the corresponding central extensions. Our second main result asserts that, if \frak{k} is a simple compact Lie superalgebra with \frak{k}_1\neq \{0\}, then each (projective) unitary representation of \Lambda_s(\mathbb{R})\otimes \frak{k} factors through a (projective) unitary representation of \frak{k} itself, and these are known by Jakobsen's classification. If \frak{k}_1 = \{0\}, then we likewise reduce the classification problem to semidirect products of compact Lie groups K with a Clifford--Lie supergroup which has been studied by Carmeli, Cassinelli, Toigo and Varadarajan.
