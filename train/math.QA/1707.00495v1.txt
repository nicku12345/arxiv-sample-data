We establish an isomorphism between the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra \mathfrak{grt}_1 in depth two modulo higher depth and the cohomology of the two-loop part of the graph complex of internally connected graphs \mathsf{ICG}(1). In particular, we recover all linear relations satisfied by the brackets of the conjectural generators \sigma_{2k+1} modulo depth three by considering relations among two-loop graphs.   The Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra is related to the zeroth cohomology of M. Kontsevich's graph complex \mathsf{GC}_2 via T. Willwacher's isomorphism. We define a descending filtration on H^0(\mathsf{GC}_2) and show that the degree two components of the corresponding associated graded vector spaces are isomorphic under T. Willwacher's map.
