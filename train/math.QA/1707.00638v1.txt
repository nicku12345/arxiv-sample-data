We show that Willwacher's cyclic formality theorem can be extended to preserve natural Gravity operations on cyclic multivector fields and cyclic multidifferential operators. We express this in terms of a homotopy Gravity quasi-isomorphism with explicit local formulas. For this, we develop operadic tools related to mixed complexes and cyclic homology and prove that the operad \mathsf M_\circlearrowleft of natural operations on cyclic operators is formal and hence quasi-isomorphic to the Gravity operad.
