We generalize the theory of the second invariant cohomology group H^2_{\rm inv}(G) for finite groups G, developed in [Da2,Da3,GK], to the case of affine algebraic groups G, using the methods of [EG1,EG2,G]. In particular, we show that for connected affine algebraic groups G over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, the map \Theta from [GK] is bijective (unlike for some finite groups, as shown in [GK]). This allows us to compute H^2_{\rm inv}(G) in this case, and in particular show that this group is commutative (while for finite groups it can be noncommutative, as shown in [GK]).
