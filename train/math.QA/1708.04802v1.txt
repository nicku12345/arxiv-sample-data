We prove Bergman's theorem on centralizers by using generic matrices and Kontsevich's quantization method. For any field \textbf{k}  of positive characteristics, set A=\textbf{k} \langle x_1,\dots,x_s\rangle be a free associative algebra, then any centralizer \mathcal{C}(f) of nontrivial element f\in A\backslash \textbf{k} is a ring of polynomials on a single variable. We also prove that there is no commutative subalgebra with transcendent degree \geq 2 of A.
