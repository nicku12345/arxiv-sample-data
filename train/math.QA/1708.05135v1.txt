In this paper, a notion of affine walled Brauer-Clifford superalgebras BC_{r, t}^{\rm aff}  is introduced over an arbitrary integral domain R containing 2^{-1}. These superalgebras can be considered as affinization of walled Brauer superalgebras in \cite{JK}. By constructing infinite many homomorphisms from BC_{r, t}^{\rm aff} to a class of level two walled Brauer-Clifford superagebras over \mathbb C, we prove that BC_{r, t}^{\rm aff}  is free over R with infinite rank. We explain that any finite dimensional irreducible BC_{r, t}^{\rm aff} -module over an algebraically closed field F of characteristic not 2 factors through a cyclotomic quotient of BC_{r, t}^{\rm aff} , called a cyclotomic (or level k) walled Brauer-Clifford superalgebra  BC_{k, r, t}. Using a previous method on cyclotomic walled Brauer algebras in \cite{RSu1}, we prove that BC_{k, r, t} is free over R with super rank (k^{r+t}2^{r+t-1} (r+t)!, k^{r+t}2^{r+t-1} (r+t)!) if and only if it is admissible in the sense of Definition~6.4. Finally, we prove that the degenerate affine (resp., cyclotomic) walled Brauer-Clifford superalgebras defined by Comes-Kujawa in \cite{CK} are isomorphic to our affine (resp., cyclotomic) walled Brauer-Clifford superalgebras.
