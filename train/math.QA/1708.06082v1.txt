Let p be an odd prime and let \widehat{\sigma} be an order p automorphism of V_{\sqrt{2}A_{p-1}} which is a lift of a p-cycle in the Weyl group {\rm Weyl}(A_{p-1})\cong {\mathfrak S}_p. We study a certain extension V of a tensor product of finitely many copies of the orbifold model V_{\sqrt{2}A_{p-1}}^{\langle \widehat{\sigma} \rangle} and give a criterion for V that every irreducible V-module is a simple current.
