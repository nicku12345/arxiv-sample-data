For any a,b\in\mathbb C, W(a,b) is the Lie algebra with basis \{L_m,M_m\,|\,m\in\mathbb Z\} and relations [L_m,L_n]=(n-m)L_{m+n}, [L_m,W_n]=(a+n+bm)W_{m+n}, [W_m,W_n]=0 for m,n\in\mathbb Z. For any \lambda\in\mathbb C^*, \alpha\in\mathbb C, h:=h(t)\in\mathbb C[t], there exists a non-weight module over W(0,b) (resp., W(0,1)), denoted by \Phi(\lambda,\alpha,h) (resp. \Theta(\lambda,h)), which is defined on the space \mathbb C[s,t] of polynomials on variables s,t and is free of rank one over the enveloping algebra U(\mathbb C L_0\oplus\mathbb C W_0) of \mathbb C L_0\oplus\mathbb C W_0. In the present paper, by introducing two sequences of useful operators on \mathbb C[s,t], we determine all submodules of \mathbb C[s,t]. We also study submodules of \mathbb C[s,t] regarded as modules over the Virasoro algebra \mathscr V\! (with the trivial action of the center), and prove that these submodules are finitely generated if and only if {\rm deg}\,h(t)\geq1. In addition, it is proven that \Phi(\lambda, \alpha,h) is an irreducible \mathscr V\!-module if and only if b=-1, {\rm deg}\, h(t)=1, \alpha\neq0. Finally, we obtain a large family of new irreducible modules over the Virasoro algebra \mathscr V\!, by taking various tensor products of a finite number of irreducible modules \Phi(\lambda_i,\alpha_i, h_i) for \lambda_i,\alpha_i\in\mathbb C^*, h_i\in\mathbb C[t] with an irreducible \mathscr V\!-module V, where V satisfies that there exists a nonnegative integer R_V such that L_m acts locally finitely on V for m\geq R_V.
