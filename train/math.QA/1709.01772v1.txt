Let A be a Poisson Hopf algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. If A is finitely generated and connected graded as an algebra and its Poisson bracket is homogeneous of degree d \geq 0, then A is unimodular; that is, the modular derivation of A is zero. This is a Poisson analogue of a recent result concerning Hopf algebras which are connected graded as algebras.
