In this paper we give two general formulae for the M\"uger centralizers in the category of representations of a semisimple quasitriangular Hopf algebra. The first formula is given in the terms of the Drinfeld map associated to the quasitriangular Hopf algebra. The second formula for the M\"uger centralizer is given in the terms of the conjugacy classes introduced by Cohen and Westreich in [J. Algebra 283 (2005), 42-62]. In the case of a factorizable Hopf algebra these formulae extend some particular cases obtained by the author in [Math. Z. 279 (2015), 227-240].
