We discuss the classification problem for the unitary easy quantum groups, under strong axioms, of noncommutative geometric nature. Our main results concern the intermediate easy quantum groups O_N\subset G\subset U_N^+. To any such quantum group we associate its Schur-Weyl twist \bar{G}, two noncommutative spheres S,\bar{S}, a noncommutative torus T, and a quantum reflection group K. Studying (S,\bar{S},T,K,G,\bar{G}) leads then to some natural axioms, which can be used in order to investigate G itself. We prove that the main examples are covered by our formalism, and we conjecture that in what concerns the case U_N\subset G\subset U_N^+, our axioms should restrict the list of known examples.
