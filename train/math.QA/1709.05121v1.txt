Feigin-Stoyanovsky's type subspace W(\Lambda) of a standard \tilde{{\mathfrak g}}-module L(\Lambda) is a \tilde{{\mathfrak g}}_1-submodule of L(\Lambda) generated by the highest-weight vector v_\Lambda, where \tilde{{\mathfrak g}}_1 is a certain commutative subalgebra of \tilde{{\mathfrak g}}. Based on the description of basis of W(\Lambda) for \tilde{{\mathfrak g}} of type C_\ell^{(1)}, we give a presentation of this subspace in terms of generators and relations W(\Lambda)\simeq U(\tilde{{\mathfrak g}}_1^-)/J.
