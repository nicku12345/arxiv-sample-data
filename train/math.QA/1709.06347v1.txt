We suggest two explicit descriptions of the Poisson q-W algebras which are Poisson algebras of regular functions on certain algebraic group analogues of the Slodowy transversal slices to adjoint orbits in a complex semisimple Lie algebra g. To obtain the first description we introduce certain projection operators which are analogous to the quasi-classical versions of the so-called Zhelobenko and extremal projection operators. As a byproduct we obtain some new formulas for natural coordinates on Bruhat cells in algebraic groups.
