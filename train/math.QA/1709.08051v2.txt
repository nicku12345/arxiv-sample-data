In this work we deal with partial (co)action of multiplier Hopf algebras on not necessarily unital algebras. Our main goal is to construct a Morita context relating the coinvariant algebra R^{\underline{coA}} with a certain subalgebra of the smash product R\#\widehat{A}. Besides this we present the notion of partial Galois coaction, which is closely related to this Morita context.
