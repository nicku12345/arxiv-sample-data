In this paper we study (non-Abelian) extensions of a given hom-Lie color algebra and provide a geometrical interpretation of extensions. In particular, we characterize an extension of a hom-Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} by another hom-Lie algebra \mathfrak{h} and we discuss the case where \mathfrak{h} has no center. We also deal with the setting of covariant exterior derivatives, Chevalley derivative, curvature and the Bianchi identity for the possible extensions in differential geometry. Moreover, we find a cohomological obstruction to the existence of extensions of hom-Lie color algebras, i. e. we show that in order to have an extendible hom-Lie color algebra, there should exist a trivial member of the third cohomology.
