We quantize homogeneous vector bundles over an even complex sphere \mathbb{S}^{2n} as one-sided projective modules over its quantized coordinate ring. We realize them in two different ways: as locally finite \mathbb{C}-homs between pseudo-parabolic Verma modules and as induced modules of the quantum orthogonal group. Based on this alternative, we study representations of a quantum symmetric pair related to \mathbb{S}^{2n}_q and prove their complete reducibility.
