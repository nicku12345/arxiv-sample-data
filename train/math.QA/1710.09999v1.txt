In this article we consider conditions under which projection operators in multiplicity free semi-simple tensor categories satisfy Temperley-Lieb like relations. This is then used as a stepping stone to prove sufficient conditions for obtaining a representation of the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra from a braided multiplicity free semi-simple tensor category. The results are found by utalising the data of the categories. There is considerable overlap with the results found in arXiv:1607.08908, where proofs are shown by manipulating diagrams.
