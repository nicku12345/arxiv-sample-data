In this paper, we study Virasoro vertex algebras and affine vertex algebras over a general field of characteristic p>2. More specifically, we study certain quotients of the universal Virasoro and affine vertex algebras by ideals related to the p-centers of the Virasoro algebra and affine Lie algebras. Among the main results, we classify their irreducible \mathbb{N}-graded modules by explicitly determining their Zhu algebras and show that these vertex algebras have only finitely many irreducible \mathbb{N}-graded modules and they are C_2-cofinite.
