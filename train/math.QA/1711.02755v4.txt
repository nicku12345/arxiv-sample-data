We study the first and second cohomology groups of the ^*-algebras of the universal unitary and orthogonal quantum groups U_F^+ and O_F^+. This provides valuable information for constructing and classifying L\'evy processes on these quantum groups, as pointed out by Sch\"urmann. In the case when all eigenvalues of F^*F are distinct, we show that these ^*-algebras have the properties (GC), (NC), and (LK) introduced by Sch\"urmann and studied recently by Franz, Gerhold and Thom. In the degenerate case F=I_d, we show that they do not have any of these properties. We also compute the second cohomology group of U_d^+ with trivial coefficients -- H^2(U_d^+,{}_\epsilon\Bbb{C}_\epsilon)\cong \Bbb{C}^{d^2-1} -- and construct an explicit basis for the corresponding second cohomology group for O_d^+ (whose dimension was known earlier thanks to the work of Collins, H\"artel and Thom).
