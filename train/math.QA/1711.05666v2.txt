We prove a criterion of when a coaction of a compact Lie group on an algebra of continuous functions on a compact manifold extends to a coaction of deformation quantizations of the Lie group and the algebra. We compute an explicit example of a compact quantum group SU(3)_\theta, which arises as a deformation quantization of the Lie group SU(3) by an action of its maximal torus. Using the criterion, we determine exactly when the action of SU(3) on S^5 extends to a coaction of SU(3)_\theta on the noncommutative 5-sphere S^5_{\theta'}. Furthermore, this coaction is shown to be cotransitive. A coaction of SU(3)_\theta on the product of two noncommutative 5-sphere (S^5\times S^5)_{\theta'} with nontrivial algebra of coinvariant elements is given and associated projective modules are constructed.
