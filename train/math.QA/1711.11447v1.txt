Graded quasi-commutative skew PBW extensions are isomorphic to graded iterated Ore extensions of endomorphism type, whence graded quasi-commutative skew PBW extensions with coefficients in AS-regular algebras are skew Calabi-Yau and the Nakayama automorphism exists for these extensions. With this in mind, in this paper we give a description of Nakayama automorphism for these non-commutative algebras using the Nakayama automorphism of the ring of the coefficients.
