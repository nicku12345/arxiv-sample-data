Let \mathds{k} be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We determine all finite-dimensional Hopf algebras over \mathds{k} whose Hopf coradical is isomorphic to the unique 12-dimensional Hopf algebra \mathcal{C} without the dual Chevalley property, such that the diagrams are strictly graded and the corresponding infinitesimal braidings are indecomposable objects in {}_{\mathcal{C}}^{\mathcal{C}}\mathcal{YD}. In particular, we obtain new Nichols algebras of dimension 18 and 36 and two families of new Hopf algebras of dimension 216.
