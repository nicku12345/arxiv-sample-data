We construct two examples of q-deformed classical Howe dual pairs (sl(2,C), sl(2,C)) and (sl(2,C), sl(n,C)). Moreover, we obtain a noncommutative version of the first fundamental theorem of classical invariant theory. Our approach to these duality differs from the paper of Lehrer-Zhang-Zhang. Furthermore, we solve the tensor product decomposition problem for Verma modules over U_q(sl(2,C)) provided q is not a root of unity.
