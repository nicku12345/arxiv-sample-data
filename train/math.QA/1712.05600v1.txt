A quantum Capelli identity is given on the multiparameter quantum general linear group based on the (p_{ij}, u)-condition. The multiparameter quantum Pfaffian of the (p_{ij}, u)-quantum group is also introduced and the transformation under the congruent action is given. Generalization to the multiparameter hyper-Pfaffian and relationship with the quantum minors are also investigated.
