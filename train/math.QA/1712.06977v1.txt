For a finite dimensional Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}, the Duflo map S\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow U\mathfrak{g} defines an isomorphism of \mathfrak{g}-modules. On \mathfrak{g}-invariant elements it gives an isomorphism of algebras. Moreover, it induces an isomorphism of algebras on the level of Lie algebra cohomology H(\mathfrak{g},S\mathfrak{g})\rightarrow H(\mathfrak{g}, U\mathfrak{g}). However, as shown by J. Alm and S. Merkulov, it cannot be extended in a universal way to an A_\infty-isomorphism between the corresponding Chevalley-Eilenberg complexes. In this paper, we give an elementary and self-contained proof of this fact using a version of M. Kontsevich's graph complex.
