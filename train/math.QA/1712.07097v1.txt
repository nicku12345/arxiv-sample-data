The purpose of this paper is to study minimal modular extensions of braided fusion categories doing emphases in minimal modular extensions of super-Tannakian fusion categories. We define actions of finite super-groups on fermionic fusion categories and spin-braided fusion categories. Similar to the case of groups, our motivation came from the study of fusion categories containing the representation category of a super-group. We develop many analog results to the Tannakian case, including cohomological obstructions, relation with braided G-crossed categories and minimal modular extensions. We apply the general results to the construction and classification of minimal modular extensions of super-groups and braided fusion categories. In particular, we exhibit some examples of braided fusion categories without minimal modular extensions.
