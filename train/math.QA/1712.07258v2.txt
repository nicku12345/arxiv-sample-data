We introduce a new family of classical r-matrices for the Lie algebra \mathfrak{sl}_n that lies in the Zariski boundary of the Belavin-Drinfeld space {\mathcal M} of quasi-triangular solutions to the classical Yang-Baxter equation. In this setting {\mathcal M} is a finite disjoint union of components; exactly \phi(n) of these components are SL_n-orbits of single points. These points are the generalized Cremmer-Gervais r-matrices r_{i, n} which are naturally indexed by pairs of positive coprime integers, i and n, with i < n. A conjecture of Gerstenhaber and Giaquinto states that the boundaries of the Cremmer-Gervais components contain r-matrices having maximal parabolic subalgebras \mathfrak{p}_{i,n}\subseteq \mathfrak{sl}_n as carriers. We prove this conjecture in the cases when n\equiv \pm 1 (mod i). The subprime linear functionals f\in\mathfrak{p}_{i, n}^* and the corresponding principal elements H\in\mathfrak{p}_{i, n} play important roles in our proof. Since the subprime functionals are Frobenius precisely in the cases when n\equiv \pm 1 (mod i), this partly explains our need to require these conditions on i and n. We conclude with a proof of the GG boundary conjecture in an unrelated case, namely when (i, n) = (5, 12), where the subprime functional is no longer a Frobenius functional.
