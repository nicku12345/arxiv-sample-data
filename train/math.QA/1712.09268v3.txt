We introduce a new category of differential graded multi-oriented props whose representations (called homotopy algebras with branes) in a graded vector space require a choice of a collection of k linear subspaces in that space, k being the number of extra directions (if k=0 this structure recovers an ordinary prop); symplectic vector spaces equipped with k Lagrangian subspaces play a distinguished role in this theory.   Manin triples is a classical example of an algebraic structure (concretely, a Lie bialgebra structure) given in terms of a vector space and its subspace; in the context of this paper Manin triples are precisely symplectic Lagrangian representations of the {\em 2-oriented} generalization of the classical operad of Lie algebras. In a sense, the theory of multi-oriented props provides us with a far reaching strong homotopy generalization of Manin triples type constructions.   The homotopy theory of multi-oriented props can be quite non-trivial (and different from that of ordinary props). The famous Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller group acts faithfully as homotopy non-trivial automorphisms on infinitely many multi-oriented props, a fact which motivated much the present work as it gives us a hint to a non-trivial deformation quantization theory in every geometric dimension d\geq 4 generalizing to higher dimensions Drinfeld-Etingof-Kazhdan's quantizations of Lie bialgebras (the case d=3) and Kontsevich's quantizations of Poisson structures (the case d=2).
