A tensor category is multiplicity-free if for any objects A,B,C we have that \mathrm{Hom}(A\otimes B\otimes C,\mathbb{C}) is either 0 or 1 dimensional. It is known that Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4))) is not multiplicty-free. We find a full subcategory of Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4))) which is multiplicty-free. A description of the dimension of these \mathrm{Hom} spaces is given for this subcategory, including when q is a root of unity. The methods used arise from the description, given by Kuperberg, of Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4))) as a spider. The main tool is the recursive definition of clasps given by Kim. In particular, we provide an appropriate notion of admissibility when looking at the \mathrm{Sp}(4)_k ribbon graph invariants with restricted edge labels.
