Recently Pascal Baseilhac and Stefan Kolb obtained a PBW basis for the q-Onsager algebra \mathcal O_q. They defined the PBW basis elements recursively, and it is obscure how to express them in closed form. To mitigate the difficulty, we bring in the universal Askey-Wilson algebra \Delta_q. There is a natural algebra homomorphism \natural \colon \mathcal O_q \to \Delta_q. We apply \natural  to the above PBW basis, and express the images in closed form. Our results make heavy use of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.
