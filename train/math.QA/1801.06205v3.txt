We classify finite-dimensional Hopf algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero whose Hopf coradcial is isomorphic to the smallest non-pointed basic Hopf algebra, under the assumption that the diagrams are strictly graded. In particular, we obtain some new Nichols algebras of non-diagonal type and new finite-dimensional Hopf algebras without the dual Chevalley property.
