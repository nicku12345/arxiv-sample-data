We prove two results about \text{SLF}(\bar U_q), the algebra of symmetric linear forms on the restricted quantum group \bar U_q = \bar U_q(\mathfrak{sl}(2)). First, we express any trace on finite dimensional projective \bar U_q-modules as a linear combination in the basis of \text{SLF}(\bar U_q) constructed by Gainutdinov - Tipunin and also by Arike. In particular, this allows us to determine the symmetric linear form corresponding to the modified trace on projective \bar U_q-modules. Second, we give the explicit multiplication rules between symmetric linear forms in this basis.
