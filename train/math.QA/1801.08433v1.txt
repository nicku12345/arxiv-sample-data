On a Fock space constructed from mn free bosons and lattice {\Bbb {Z}}^{mn}, we give a level n action of the quantum toroidal algebra \mathscr {E}_m associated to \mathfrak{gl}_m, together with a level m action of the quantum toroidal algebra {\mathscr E}_n associated to {\mathfrak {gl}}_n. We prove that the \mathscr {E}_m transfer matrices commute with the \mathscr {E}_n transfer matrices after an appropriate identification of parameters.
