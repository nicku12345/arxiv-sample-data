Let \kappa be a commutative ring containing 2^{-1}. In this paper, we prove the Comes-Kujawa's conjecture on a \kappa-basis of cyclotomic oriented Brauer-Clifford supercategory. As a by-product, we prove that the cyclotomic walled Brauer-Clifford superalgebra defined by Comes and Kujawa and ours are isomorphic if \kappa is an algebraically closed field with characteristic not two.
