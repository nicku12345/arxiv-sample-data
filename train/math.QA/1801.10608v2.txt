We prove that any irreducible *-representation of \mathrm{Pol}(\mathrm{Mat}_n)_q can be 'lifted' to an irreducible *-representation of \mathbb{C}[SU_{2n}]_q, this result is then used to show the existence of the universal enveloping C^*- algebra of \mathrm{Pol}(\mathrm{Mat}_n)_q and to prove that it is isomorphic to the closure of the image of the Fock representation. Moreover, we also classify all irreducible *-representations of \mathrm{Pol}(\mathrm{Mat}_n)_q using a diagram approach.
