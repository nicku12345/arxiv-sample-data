Hilbert space representations of quantum SU(2) by multiplication operators on a local chart are constructed, where the local chart is given by tensor products of square integrable functions on a quantum disc and on the classical unit circle. The actions of generators of quantum SU(2), generators of the opposite algebra, and noncommutative partial derivatives are computed on a Hilbert space basis.
