Drinfeld realisations are constructed for the quantum affine superalgebras of the series {\rm\mathfrak{osp}}(1|2n)^{(1)},{\rm\mathfrak{sl}}(1|2n)^{(2)} and {\rm\mathfrak{osp}}(2|2n)^{(2)}. By using the realisations, we develop vertex operator representations and classify the finite dimensional irreducible representations for these quantum affine superalgebras.
