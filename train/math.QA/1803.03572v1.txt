For a fixed finite group Q and semi-simple finite dimensional algebra S, we examine an equivalence between strongly Q-graded algebras (extensions) with identity component S and S^1-gerbes on action groupoids of Q on the set of isomorphism classes of simple objects of the category of S-modules. This clarifies the nature of the map considered in arXiv:1312.7316. Motivated by this and arXiv:0909.3140(2) we suggest and study a notion of extensions suitable to the case when S is replaced by a Hopf algebra, in the sense that there is a bijection between extensions with "fiber" H and H^*. In particular we focus on the case of H equal to the group algebra of a finite group. When K is abelian, the answer is particularly symmetric as duality of Hopf algebras does not take us outside of the category of groups.
