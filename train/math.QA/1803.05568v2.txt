We introduce the notion of a \textit{reflection fusion category}, which is a type of a G-crossed category generated by objects of Frobenius-Perron dimension 1 and \sqrt{p}, where p is an odd prime. We show that such categories correspond to orthogonal reflection groups over \mathbb{F}_p. This allows us to use the known classification of irreducible reflection groups over finite fields to classify irreducible reflection fusion categories.
