In a recent article, the coordinate ring of the nodal cubic was given the structure of a quantum homogeneous space. Here the corresponding coalgebra Galois extension is expressed in terms of quantum groups at roots of unity, and is shown to be cleft. Furthermore, the minimal quotient extensions are determined.
