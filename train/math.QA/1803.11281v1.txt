Let V be a strongly regular vertex operator algebra and let \frak{ch}_V be the space spanned by the characters of the irreducible V-modules.\ It is known that \frak{ch}_V is the space of solutions of a so-called \emph{modular linear differential equation (MLDE)}.\ In this paper we obtain a near-classification of those V for which the corresponding MLDE is irreducible and monic of order 2.\ As a consequence we derive the complete classification when V has exactly two simple modules.\ It turns out that V is either one of four affine Kac-Moody algebras of level 1, or the Yang-Lee Virasoro model of central charge {-}22/5.\ Our proof establishes new connections between the characters of V and Gauss hypergeometric series, and puts the finishing touches to work of Mathur, Mukhi and Sen who first considered this problem forty years ago.
