In this paper, following [1], we develop the theory of global pseudo-differential operators defined on the quantum group SU_q(2), and provide some spectral results concerning these operators. We define a graduation for this algebra of pseudo-differential operators in terms of its natural Fourier decomposition and, using the infinite-dimensional representations introduced by Woronowicz [15], we also provide a *-representation of SU_q(2) as bounded pseudo-differential operators acting on L^2(\mathbb{S}^1).
