In this note, we examine the gauging of the \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} permutation action on the tensor square of a modular tensor category. When \mathcal{C} has no nontrivial invertible objects, we provide formulas for the fusion rules of both the extensions, expressed in terms of the fusion rules of \mathcal{C}, and the subsequent equivariantizations, which additionally requires the modular data of \mathcal{C}. We discuss several examples related to quantum groups at roots of unity.
