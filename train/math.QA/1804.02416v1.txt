In a recent paper the authors Beliakova, Blanchet and Gainutdinov have shown that the modified trace on the category H-pmod of the projective modules corresponds to the symmetrised integral on the finite dimensional pivotal Hopf algebra H. We generalize this fact to the context of G-graded categories and Hopf G-coalgebra studied by Turaev-Virelizier. We show that the symmetrised G-integral on a finite type pivotal Hopf G-coalgebra induces a modified trace in the associated G-graded category.
