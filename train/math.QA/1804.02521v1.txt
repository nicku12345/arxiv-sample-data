We continue our program on classification of holomorphic vertex operator algebras of central charge 24. In this article, we show that there exists a unique strongly regular holomorphic VOA of central charge 24, up to isomorphism, if its weight one Lie algebra has the type C_{4,10}, D_{7,3}A_{3,1}G_{2,1}, A_{5,6}C_{2,3}A_{1,2}, A_{3,1}C_{7,2}, D_{5,4}C_{3,2}A_{1,1}^2, or E_{6,4}C_{2,1}A_{2,1}. As a consequence, we have verified that the isomorphism class of a strongly regular holomorphic vertex operator algebra of central charge 24 is determined by its weight one Lie algebra structure if the weight one subspace is nonzero.
