It is well-known that any compact Lie group appears as closed subgroup of a unitary group, G\subset U_N. The unitary group U_N has a free analogue U_N^+, and the study of the closed quantum subgroups G\subset U_N^+ is a problem of general interest. We review here the basic tools for dealing with such quantum groups, with all the needed preliminaries included, and we discuss as well a number of more advanced topics.
