In this paper, we classify all prime Hopf algebras H of GK-dimension one satisfying the following two conditions: 1) H has a 1-dimensional representation of order PI.deg(H) and 2) the invariant components of H with respect to this 1-dimensional representation are domains (see Section 2 for related definitions). As consequences, 1) a number of new Hopf algebras of GK-dimension one are found and some of them are not pointed, 2) we give a partial answer to a question posed by Brown and Zhang and 3) some new kinds of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras are found.
