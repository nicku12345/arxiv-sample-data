This is the third in a series of papers studying the vertex-algebraic structure of principal subspaces of twisted modules for lattice vertex operator algebras. We focus primarily on lattices L whose Gram matrix contains only non-negative entries. We develop further ideas originally presented by Calinescu, Lepowsky, and Milas to find presentations (generators and relations) of the principal subspace of a certain natural twisted module for the vertex operator algebra V_L. We then use these presentations to construct exact sequences involving this principal subspace, which give a set of recursions satisfied by the multigraded dimension of the principal subspace and allow us to find the multigraded dimension of the principal subspace.
