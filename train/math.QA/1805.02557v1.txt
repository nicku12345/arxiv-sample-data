We construct equivariant vector bundles over quantum projective spaces making use of parabolic Verma modules over the quantum general linear group. Using an alternative realization of the quantized coordinate ring of projective space as a subalgebra in the algebra of functions on the quantum group, we reformulate quantum vector bundles in terms of quantum symmetric pairs. In this way, we prove complete reducibility of modules over the corresponding coideal stabilizer subalgebras, via the quantum Frobenius reciprocity.
