We compute the factorization homology of a polynomial algebra over a compact and closed manifold with trivialized tangent bundle up to weak equivalence in a new way. This calculation is based on the model of a graph complex and an explicit morphism into the codomain, which makes it possible to twist the algebra with a Maurer-Cartan element and potentially apply other deformations.
