We consider several vertex operator (super)algebras closely related to V_{-1}(\frak{sl} (n) ), n \ge 3 : (a) the parafermionic subalgebra K(\frak{sl}(n),-1) for which we completely describe its inner structure, (b) the vacuum algebra \Omega (V_{-1}(\frak{sl} (n) ) ), and (c) an infinite extension \mathcal U of V_{-1}(\frak{sl} (n) ) constructed by combining certain irreducible ordinary modules with integral weights. It turns out that \mathcal U is isomorphic to the coset vertex algebra \frak{psl}(n|n) _1 / \frak{sl}(n)_1, n \ge 3. We show that V_{-1}(\frak{sl}(n)) admits precisely n ordinary irreducible modules, up to isomorphism. This leads to the conjecture that {\mathcal U} is {\em quasi-lisse}. We present evidence in support of this conjecture: we prove that the (super)character of \mathcal U is quasi-modular of weight one by virtue of being the constant term of a meromorphic Jacobi form of index zero. Explicit formulas and MLDE for characters and supercharacters are given for \frak{g}=\frak{sl}(3) and outlined for general n. We present a conjectural family of 2nd order MLDEs for characters of vertex algebras \frak{psl}(n|n) _1, n \geq 2. We finish with a theorem pertaining to characters of \frak{psl}(n|n)_1 and \mathcal U-modules.
