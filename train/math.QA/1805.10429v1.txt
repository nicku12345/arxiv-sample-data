We study deformation of Courant pairs with a commutative algebra base. We consider the deformation cohomology bi-complex and describe a universal infinitesimal deformation. In a sequel, we formulate an extension of a given deformation of a Courant pair to another with extended base. This leads to describe the obstruction in extending a given deformation. We also discuss about the construction of versal deformation of Courant pairs. As an application, we explicitly compute universal infinitesimal deformation of Poisson algebra structures
