Let L be an even (positive definite) lattice and g\in O(L). In this article, we prove that the orbifold vertex operator algebra V_{L}^{\hat{g}} has group-like fusion if and only if g acts trivially on the discriminant group \mathcal{D}(L)=L^*/L (or equivalently (1-g)L^*<L). We also determine their fusion rings and the corresponding quadratic space structures when g is fixed point free on L. By applying our method to some coinvariant sublattices of the Leech lattice \Lambda, we prove a conjecture proposed by G. H\"ohn. In addition, we also discuss a construction of certain holomorphic vertex operator algebras of central charge 24 using the the orbifold vertex operator algebra V_{\Lambda_g}^{\hat{g}}.
