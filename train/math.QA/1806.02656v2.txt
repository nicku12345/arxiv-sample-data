The little and big q-Jacobi polynomials are shown to arise as basis vectors for representations of the Askey-Wilson algebra. The operators that these polynomials respectively diagonalize are identified within the Askey-Wilson algebra generated by twisted primitive elements of \mathfrak U_q(sl(2)). The little q-Jacobi operator and a tridiagonalization of it are shown to realize the equitable embedding of the Askey-Wilson algebra into \mathfrak U_q(sl(2)).
