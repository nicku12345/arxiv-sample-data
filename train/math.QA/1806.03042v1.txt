Braided Morita invariants of finite-dimensional semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf algebras with braidings are constructed by refining the polynomial invariants introduced by the author. The invariants are computed for the duals of Suzuki's braided Hopf algebras, and as an application of that, the braided Morita equivalence classes over the 8-dimensional Kac-Paljutkin algebra are determined. This paper also includes the modified results and proofs on determination of the coribbon elements of Suzuki's braided Hopf algebras, that are discussed and given in my previous paper "The coribbon structures of some finite dimensional braided Hopf algebras generated by 2\times 2-matrix coalgebras" which is published in Banach Center Publication.
