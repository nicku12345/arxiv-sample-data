We introduce a notion of Mathieu-Zhao subspaces of vertex algebras. Among other things, we show that for a vertex algebra V and its subspace M that contains C_2(V), M is a Mathieu-Zhao subspace of V if and only if the quotient space M/C_2(V) is a Mathieu-Zhao subspace of a commutative associative algebra V/C_2(V). As a result, one can study the famous Jacobian conjecture in terms of Mathieu-Zhao subspaces of vertex algebras. In addition, for a CFT-type vertex operator algebra V that satisfies the C_2-cofiniteness condition, we classify all Mathieu-Zhao subspaces M that contain C_2(V).
