Given a closed subgroup G\subset U_N^+ which is homogeneous, in the sense that we have S_N\subset G\subset U_N^+, the corresponding Tannakian category C must satisfy span(\mathcal{NC}_2)\subset C\subset span(P). Based on this observation, we construct a certain integer p\in\mathbb N\cup\{\infty\}, that we call "easiness level" of G. The value p=1 corresponds to the case where G is easy, and we explore here, with some theory and examples, the case p>1. As a main application, we show that S_N\subset S_N^+ and other liberation inclusions, known to be maximal in the easy setting, remain maximal at the easiness level p=2 as well.
