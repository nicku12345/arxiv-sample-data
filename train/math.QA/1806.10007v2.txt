Let \mathbb F denote a field, and pick a nonzero q \in \mathbb F that is not a root of unity. Let \mathbb Z_4=\mathbb Z/4 \mathbb Z denote the cyclic group of order 4. Define a unital associative {\mathbb F}-algebra \square_q by generators \lbrace x_i \rbrace_{i \in \mathbb Z_4} and relations \frac{q x_i x_{i+1}-q^{-1}x_{i+1}x_i}{q-q^{-1}} = 1,\qquad x^3_i x_{i+2} - \lbrack 3 \rbrack_q x^2_i x_{i+2} x_i + \lbrack 3 \rbrack_q x_i x_{i+2} x^2_i -x_{i+2} x^3_i = 0, where \lbrack 3 \rbrack_q = \big(q^3-q^{-3}\big)/\big(q-q^{-1}\big). Let V denote a \square_q-module. A vector \xi\in V is called NIL whenever x_1 \xi = 0  and x_3 \xi=0 and \xi \not=0. The \square_q-module V is called NIL whenever V is generated by a NIL vector. We show that up to isomorphism there exists a unique NIL \square_q-module, and it is irreducible and infinite-dimensional. We describe this module from sixteen points of view. In this description an important role is played by the q-shuffle algebra for affine \mathfrak{sl}_2.
