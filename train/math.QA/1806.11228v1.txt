The positive part U^+_q of U_q({\widehat {\mathfrak{sl}}}_2) has a presentation with two generators A,B that satisfy the cubic q-Serre relations. In 1993 I. Damiani obtained a PBW basis for   U^+_q, consisting of some elements \lbrace E_{n\delta+\alpha_0}\rbrace_{n=0}^\infty, \lbrace E_{n\delta+\alpha_1}\rbrace_{n=0}^\infty, \lbrace E_{n\delta}\rbrace_{n=1}^\infty that are defined recursively. Our goal is to describe these elements in closed form. We achieve this goal using Catalan words and a q-shuffle algebra.
