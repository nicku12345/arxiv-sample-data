Drinfeld Yangian of a queer Lie superalgebra is defined as the quantization of a Lie bisuperelgebra of twisted polynomial currents. An analogue of the new system of generators of Drinfeld is being constructed. It is proved for the partial case Lie superalgebra sq_1 that this so defined Yangian and the Yangian, introduced earlier by M. Nazarov using the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtadzhjan approach, are isomorphic.
