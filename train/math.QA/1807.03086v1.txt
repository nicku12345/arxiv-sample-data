We study the L-infinity-formality problem for the Hochschild complex of the universal enveloping algebra of some examples of Lie algebras such as Cartan-3-regular quadratic Lie algebras (for example semisimple Lie algebras and in more detail so(3)), and free Lie algebras generated by a vector space of dimension at least 2. We show that for these examples formality in Kontsevich's sense does NOT hold, although some of them allow unconditioned deformability. We compute the L-infinity-structure on the cohomology given by homotopy transfer in certain cases.
