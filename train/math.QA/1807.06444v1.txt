In this paper we study skew Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt extensions over weak symmetric and (\Sigma,\Delta)-weak symmetry rings. Since these extensions generalize Ore extensions of injective type and another noncommutative rings of polynomial type, we unify and extend several results in the literature concerning the property of being symmetry. Under adequate conditions, we transfer the property of being weak symmetric or (\Sigma,\Delta)-weak symmetric from a ring of coefficients to a skew PBW extension over this ring. We illustrate our results with remarkable examples of algebras appearing in noncommutative algebraic geometry and theoretical physics.
