The hyperoctahedral group H_N is known to have two natural liberations: the "good" one H_N^+, which is the quantum symmetry group of N segments, and the "bad" one \bar{O}_N, which is the quantum symmetry group of the N-hypercube. We study here this phenomenon, in the general "quizzy" framework, which covers the various liberations and twists of H_N,O_N. Our results include: (1) an interpretation of the embedding \bar{O}_N\subset S_{2^N}^+, as corresponding to the antisymmetric representation of O_N, (2) a study of the liberations of H_N, notably with the result <H_N^+,\bar{O}_N>=O_N^+, and (3) a comparison of the k-orbitals for the inclusions H_N\subset H_N^+ and H_N\subset\bar{O}_N, for k\in\mathbb N small.
