We give the analogue for Hopf algebras of the polyuble Lie bialgebra construction by Fock and Rosli. By applying this construction to the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group, we obtain a deformation quantization \mathbb{C}_\hslash[(N \backslash G)^m] of a Poisson structure \pi^{(m)} on products (N \backslash G)^m of principal affine spaces of a connected and simply connected complex semisimple Lie group G. The Poisson structure \pi^{(m)} descends to a Poisson structure \pi_m on products (B \backslash G)^m of the flag variety of G which was introduced and studied by the Lu and the author. Any ample line bundle on (B \backslash G)^m inherits a natural flat Poisson connection, and the corresponding graded Poisson algebra is quantized to a subalgebra of \mathbb{C}_\hslash[(N \backslash G)^m].   We define the notion of a strongly coisotropic subalgebra in a Hopf algebra, and explain how strong coisotropicity guarantees that any homogeneous coordinate ring of a homogeneous space of a Poisson Lie group can be quantized in the sense of Ciccoli, Fioresi, and Gavarini.
