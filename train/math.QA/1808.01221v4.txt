Symmetric and nonsymmetric interpolation Laurent polynomials are introduced with the interpolation points depending on q and a n-tuple of parameters \tau=(\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n). For the principal specialization \tau_i=st^{n-i} the symmetric interpolation Laurent polynomials reduce to Okounkov's BC-type interpolation Macdonald polynomials and the nonsymmetric interpolation Laurent polynomials become their nonsymmetric variants. We expand the symmetric interpolation Laurent polynomials in the nonsymmetric ones. We show that Okounkov's BC-type interpolation Macdonald polynomials can also be obtained from their nonsymmetric versions using a one-parameter family of actions of the finite Hecke algebra of type B_n in terms of Demazure-Lusztig operators. In the Appendix we give some experimental results and conjectures about extra vanishing.
