We discuss an extended easy quantum group formalism, with the Schur-Weyl theoretic Kronecker symbols being as general as possible, and allowed to take values in \{-1,0,1\}, and more generally in \mathbb T\cup\{0\}. Our study includes an axiomatization of the theory, some structure and classification results, and the study of the basic examples of quantum unitary and reflection groups, with both positive and negative results.
