We classify braided extensions C of a rank 2 fusion category. The result shows that C is tensor equivalent to a Deligne's tensor product of some known categories, except C is slightly degenerate and generated by a \sqrt{2}-dimensional simple object. To start with, we describe the fusion rules, universal grading group, and the Frobenius-Perron dimensions of simple objects of C without the restriction that C is braided.
