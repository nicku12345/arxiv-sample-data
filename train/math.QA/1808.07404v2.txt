Following [14] and [12], we formalize the notion of an oscillatory integral interpreted as a functional on the amplitudes supported near a fixed critical point x_0 of the phase function with zero critical value. We relate to an oscillatory integral two objects, a formal oscillatory integral kernel and the full formal asymptotic expansion at x_0. The formal asymptotic expansion is a formal distribution supported at x_0 which is applied to the amplitude. In [12] this distribution itself is called a formal oscillatory integral (FOI). We establish a correspondence between the formal oscillatory integral kernels and the FOIs based upon a number of axiomatic properties of a FOI expressed in terms of its formal integral kernel. Then we consider a family of polydifferential operators related to a star product with separation of variables on a pseudo-K\"ahler manifold. These operators evaluated at a point are FOIs. We completely identify their formal oscillatory kernels.
