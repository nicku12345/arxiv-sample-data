We prove that the q-deformed unitary group, i.e., U_q(N), is the universal compact quantum group in the category of (compact) quantum groups which coact on the q-deformed odd sphere S_q^{2N-1} leaving the space spanned by the natural set of generators invariant and preserving the unique SU_q(N) invariant functional on S_q^{2N-1}. Using this, we identify U_q(N) as the quantum group of orientation preserving isometries (in the sense of Bhowmick and Goswami \cite{MR2555012}) for a natural spectral triple associated with S_q^{2N-1} constructed by Chakraborty and Pal \cite{MR2458039}.
