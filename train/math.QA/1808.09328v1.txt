In this paper, our main aim is to determine the multiplicities of a class of roots for Nichols algebra of diagonal type over fields of arbitrary characteristic, which is a generalization of the results on the multiplicities of these roots over fields of characteristic zero obtained by I. Heckenberber and the author.
