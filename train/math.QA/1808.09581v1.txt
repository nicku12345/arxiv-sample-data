We study exact sequences of finite tensor categories of the form \Rep G \to \C \to \D, where G is a finite group. We show that, under suitable assumptions, there exists a group \Gamma and mutual actions by permutations \rhd: \Gamma \times G \to G and \lhd: \Gamma \times G \to \Gamma that make (G, \Gamma) into matched pair of groups endowed with a natural crossed action on \D such that \C is equivalent to a certain associated crossed extension \D^{(G, \Gamma)} of \D. Dually, we show that an exact sequence of finite tensor categories \vect_G \to \C \to \D induces an \Aut(G)-grading on \C whose neutral homogeneous component is a (Z(G), \Gamma)-crossed extension of a tensor subcategory of \D. As an application we prove that such extensions \C of \D are weakly group-theoretical fusion categories if and only if \D is a weakly group-theoretical fusion category. In particular, we conclude that every semisolvable semisimple Hopf algebra is weakly group-theoretical.
