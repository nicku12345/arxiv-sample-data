This work finishes a classification of U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)-symmetries on the Laurent extension \mathbb{C}_q\big[x^{\pm 1},y^{\pm 1}\big] of the quantum plane. After reproducing the partial results of a previous paper of the author related to symmetries with non-trivial action of the Cartan generator(s) of U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2) and the generic symmetries, a complete collection of non-generic symmetries is presented. Together, these collections constitute a complete list of U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)-symmetries on \mathbb{C}_q\big[x^{\pm 1},y^{\pm 1}\big].
