Let \pi:sl(n|n)\to A(n-1,n-1) be the natural epimorphism of Lie superalgebra. Then \dim\ker\pi=1. Let \pi^{(t)}:sl^{(t)}(n|n)\to A^{(t)}(n-1,n-1) be the natural epimorphism, where t=1,2,4. Let \{e_k|k\in{\mathbb{Z}}\} be the basis of \ker\pi^{(t)} with e_k\in sl^{(t)}(n|n)_{(a_tk+b_t)\delta}, where (a_1,b_1)=(1,0), (a_2,b_2)=(2,-1) and (a_4,b_4)=(4,-2). The main result of this paper is to explicitly describe an element of U_q(sl^{(t)}(n|n)) (and its multi-parameter version) corresponding to e_1 (i.e., k=1). As for U_q(sl^{(1)}(n|n)) (i.e., t=1), the author had already had explicit description for every k in 1999.
