Schrodinger-Virasoro Lie algebras are annihilation algebras of Lie conformal algebras of rank three, which are widely studied by mathematicians and physicists. Conformal algebras are also called H-pseudoalgebras, where H = k[s] is the polynomial algebra over a field k. In this article, we introduce and classify Schrodinger-Virasoro Lie H-pseudoalgebras. Meanwhile we also determine all Leibniz H-pseudoalgebras of rank two.
