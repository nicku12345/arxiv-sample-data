We determine finite-dimensional Hopf algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, whose Hopf coradical is isomorphic to a non-pointed basic Hopf algebra of dimension 24 and the infinitesimal braidings are simple objects, under the assumption that the diagrams are strictly graded. In particular, we obtain families of new finite-dimensional Hopf algebras without the dual Chevalley property.
