The notion and theory of the quantum space of all maps from a quantum space pioneered by So{\l}tan have been mainly focused on finite-dimensional C*-algebras which are matrix algebra bundles over a finite set S. We propose a modification of this notion to cover the case of C\left( X\right)  for general compact Hausdorff spaces X instead of finite sets S while taking into account of the topology of X. A notion of free product of copies of a unital C*-algebra topologically indexed by a compact Hausdorff space arises naturally, and satisfies some desired functoriality.
