Odd, positive-definite, integral, unimodular lattices N of rank 24 were classified by Borcherds. There are 273 isometry classes of such lattices. Associated to them are vertex superalgebras V_N of central charge c=24. We show that at least 267 of these vertex operator superalgebras contain an N=4 superconformal subalgebra of central charge c'=6. This is achieved by studying embeddings L+\subseteq N of a certain rank 6 lattice L+.
