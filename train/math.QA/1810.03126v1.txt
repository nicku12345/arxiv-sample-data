In \cite{GS1} the notion of braided Yangians of Reflection Equation type was introduced. Each of these algebras is associated with an involutive or Hecke symmetry R. Besides, the quantum analogs of certain symmetric polynomials (elementary symmetric ones, power sums) were suggested. In the present paper we show that these quantum symmetric polynomials commute with each other and consequently generate a commutative Bethe subalgebra. As an application, we get some Gaudin-type models and the corresponding Bethe subalgebras.
