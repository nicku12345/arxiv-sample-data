Let \mathcal{F}_{25} be the family of irreducible highest weight modules for the Virasoro algebra of central charge 25 which are not isomorphic to Verma modules. Let L(25,0) be the Virasoro vertex operator algebra of central charge 25. We prove that the fusion rules for the L(25,0)-modules in \mathcal{F}_{25} are in correspondence with the tensor rules for the irreducible finite dimensional representations of sl(2, \mathbb{C}), extending the known correspondence between modules for the Virasoro algebras of dual central charges 1 and 25.
