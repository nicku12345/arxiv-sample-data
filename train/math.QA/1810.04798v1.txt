There is a canonical derived Poisson structure on the universal enveloping algebra \mathcal{U}\mathfrak{a} of a (DG) Lie algebra \mathfrak{a} that is Koszul dual to a cyclic cocommutative (DG) coalgebra. Interesting special cases of this derived Poisson structure include (an analog of) the Chas-Sullivan bracket on string topology. We study how certain derived character of \mathfrak{a} intertwine this derived Poisson structure with the induced Poisson structure on the representation homology of \mathfrak{a}. In addition, we obtain an analog of one of our main results for associative algebras.
