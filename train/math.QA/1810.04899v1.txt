Herein we study conformal vectors of a Z-graded vertex algebra of (strong) CFT type. We prove that the full vertex algebra automorphism group transitively acts on the set of the conformal vectors of strong CFT type if the vertex algebra is simple. The statement is equivalent to the uniqueness of self-dual vertex operator algebra structures of a simple vertex algebra. As an application, we show that the full vertex algebra automorphism group of a simple vertex operator algebra of strong CFT type uniquely decomposes into the product of certain two subgroups and the vertex operator algebra automorphism group. Furthermore, we prove that the full vertex algebra automorphism group of the moonshine module over the field of real numbers is the Monster.
