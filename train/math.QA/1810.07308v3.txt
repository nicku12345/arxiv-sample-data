We study the family of Bethe subalgebras in the Yangian Y(\mathfrak{g}) parameterized by the corresponding adjoint Lie group G. We describe their classical limits as subalgebras in the algebra of polynomial functions on the formal Lie group G_1[[t^{-1}]]. In particular we show that, for regular values of the parameter, these subalgebras are free polynomial algebras with the same Poincare series as the Cartan subalgebra of the Yangian. Next, we extend the family of Bethe subalgebras to the De Concini--Procesi wonderful compactification \overline{G}\supset G and describe the subalgebras corresponding to generic points of any stratum in \overline{G} as Bethe subalgebras in the Yangian of the corresponding Levi subalgebra in \mathfrak{g}.
