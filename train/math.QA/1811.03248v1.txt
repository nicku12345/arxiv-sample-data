Associated with each finite subgroup \Gamma of \rm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) there is a family of noncommutative algebras O_\tau(\Gamma) quantizing \mathbb{C}^2/\!\!/\Gamma. Let G_\Gamma be the group of \Gamma-equivariant automorphisms of O_\tau. One of the authors earlier defined and studied a natural action of G_\Gamma on certain quiver varieties associated with \Gamma. He established a G_\Gamma-equivariant bijective correspondence between quiver varieties and the space of isomorphism classes of O_\tau-ideals. The main theorem in this paper states that when \Gamma is a cyclic group, the action of G_\Gamma on each quiver variety is transitive. This generalizes an earlier result due to Berest and Wilson who showed the transitivity of the automorphism group of the first Weyl algebra on the Calogero-Moser spaces. Our result has two important implications. First, it confirms the Bockland-Le Bruyn conjecture for cyclic quiver varieties. Second, it will be used to give a complete classification of algebras Morita equivalent to O_\tau(\Gamma).
