In this paper, we introduce non-standard deformations of (1+2)- and (2+1)-superspaces via a contraction using standard deformations of them. This deformed superspaces denoted by {\mathbb A}_h^{1|2} and {\mathbb A}_{h'}^{2|1}, respectively. We find a two-parameter R-matrix satisfying quantum Yang-Baxter equation and thus obtain a {\it new} two-parameter non-standard deformation of the supergroup {\rm GL}(1|2). Finally, we get a new superalgebra derived from the super-Hopf algebra of functions on the quantum superspace {\mathbb A}_{p,q}^{1|2}.
