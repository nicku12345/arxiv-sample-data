In this note, we describe two analogues of the Verlinde formula for modular categories in a twisted setting. The classical Verlinde formula for a modular category \mathscr{C} describes the fusion coefficients of \mathscr{C} in terms of the corresponding S-matrix S(\mathscr{C}). Now let us suppose that we also have an invertible \mathscr{C}-module category \mathscr{M} equipped with a \mathscr{C}-module trace. This gives rise to a modular autoequivalence F:\mathscr{C}\xrightarrow{\cong}\mathscr{C}. In this setting, we can define a crossed S-matrix S(\mathscr{C},\mathscr{M}). As our first twisted analogue of the Verlinde formula, we will describe the fusion coefficients for \mathscr{M} as a \mathscr{C}-module category in terms of the S-matrix S(\mathscr{C}) and the crossed S-matrix S(\mathscr{C},\mathscr{M}). In this twisted setting, we can also define a twisted fusion \mathbb{Q}^{ab}-algebra K_{\mathbb{Q}^{ab}}(\mathscr{C},F). As another analogue of the Verlinde formula, we describe the fusion coefficients of the twisted fusion algebra in terms of the crossed S-matrix S(\mathscr{C},\mathscr{M}).
