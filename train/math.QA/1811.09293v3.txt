We compute the factorisation homology of the four-punctured sphere and punctured torus over the quantum group \mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2) explicitly as categories of equivariant modules using the framework of `Integrating Quantum Groups over Surfaces' by Ben-Zvi, Brochier, and Jordan. We identify the algebra of invariants (quantum global sections) with the spherical double affine Hecke algebra of type (C^\vee_1,C_1), in the four-punctured sphere case, and with the `cyclic deformation' of U(su_2) in the punctured torus case. In both cases, we give an identification with the corresponding quantum Teichm\"uller space as proposed by Teschner and Vartanov as a quantization of the moduli space of flat connections.
