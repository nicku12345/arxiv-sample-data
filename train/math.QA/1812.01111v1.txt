We construct an explicit isomorphism between the quasitriangular quasi-Hopf algebra D^\omega(H) defined in \cite{bp} and a certain quantum double quasi-Hopf algebra. We give also new characterizations for a quasitriangular quasi-Hopf algebra to be ribbon and use them to construct some ribbon elements for D^\omega(H).
