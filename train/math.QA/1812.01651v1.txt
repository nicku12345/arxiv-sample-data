Let g be an affine Lie algebra with index set I = \{0, 1, 2, \cdots , n\} and g^L be its Langlands dual. It is conjectured that for each Dynkin node i \in I \setminus \{0\} the affine Lie algebra g has a positive geometric crystal whose ultra-discretization is isomorphic to the limit of certain coherent family of perfect crystals for g^L. In this paper we construct a positive geometric crystal V(D_5^{(1)}) in the level zero fundamental spin D_5^{(1)}- module W(\varpi_5). Then we define explicit 0-action on the level l known D_5^{(1)}- perfect crystal B^{5, l} and show that \{B^{5, l}\}_{l \geq 1} is a coherent family of perfect crystals with limit B^{5, \infty}. Finally we show that the ultra-discretization of V(D_5^{(1)}) is isomorphic to B^{5, \infty} as crystals which proves the conjecture in this case.
