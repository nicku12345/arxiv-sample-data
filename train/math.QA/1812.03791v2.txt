We study the pre-Lie algebra of specified Feynman graphs \wt{V}_{\Cal T} and we define a pre-Lie structure on its doubling space \wt{\Cal F}_{\Cal T}. We prove that \wt{\Cal F}_{\Cal T} is pre-Lie module on \wt{V}_{\Cal T} and we find some relations between the two pre-Lie structures. Also, we study the enveloping algebras of two pre-Lie algebras denoted respectively by (\wt {\Cal D'}_{\Cal T}, \bigstar, \Phi) and (\wt {\Cal H'}_{\Cal T}, \star, \Psi) and we prove that (\wt {\Cal D'}_{\Cal T}, \bigstar, \Phi) is a module-bialgebra on (\wt {\Cal H'}_{\Cal T}, \star, \Psi).
