For any integer d we introduce a prop RHra_d of d-oriented ribbon hypergraphs (in which "edges" can connect more than two vertices) and prove that there exists a canonical morphism  Holieb_d^\diamond \longrightarrow RHra_d from the minimal resolution Holieb_d^\diamond of the (degree shifted) prop of involutive Lie bialgebras into the prop of ribbon hypergraphs which is non-trivial on each generator of Holieb_d^\diamond. As an application we show that for any graded vector space W equipped with a family of cyclically (skew)symmetric higher products the associated vector space of cyclic words in elements of W has a combinatorial Holieb_d^\diamond-structure. As an illustration we construct for each natural number N\geq 1 an explicit combinatorial strongly homotopy involutive Lie bialgebra structure on the vector space of cyclic words in N graded letters which extends the well-known Schedler's necklace Lie bialgebra structure from the formality theory of the Goldman-Turaev Lie bialgebra in genus zero.
