We will partially classify spaces of characters of vertex operator algebras V with central charges 8 and 16, such that the spaces of characters is 3-dimensional and the characters forms a basis of the solution space of a third order monic modular linear differential equation with rational indicial roots.   Assuming a mild arithmetic condition, we show that the space of characters of V coincides with the space of characters of lattice vertex operators associated with integral lattices \sqrt{2}E_8 or the affine vertex operator algebra of type D_{20}^{(1)} for c=8, and the Barnes--Wall lattice \Lambda_{16}, the affine vertex operator algebras of type D_{16}^{(1)} with level 1 and type D_{28}^{(1)} with level 1 for c=16. (The central charge of the affine vertex operator algebra of type D_{28}^{(1)} with level 1 is 28, but the space of characters satisfies the differential equations for c=16.)   Supposing a mild condition on characters of V, then it uniquely determines (up to isomorphism) the spaces of characters of the lattice \sqrt{2}E_8 and the Barnes--Wall lattice \Lambda_{16}, respectively.   The reason why vertex operator algebras with central charges 8 and 16 are intensively studied is that there are solutions which do not depend on extra parameters (which represent conformal weights). This fact is well understood using the hypergeometric function 3F2. Hence we cannot apply our standard method to classify vertex operator algebras in which we are interested.   In appendix we classify c=4 vertex operator algebras with the same conditions mentioned above.
