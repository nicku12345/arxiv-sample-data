In this note we give explicit isomorphisms of 2-categories between various versions of the categorified quantum group associated to a simply-laced Kac-Moody algebra. These isomorphisms are convenient when working with the categorified quantum group. They make it possible to translate results from the gl(n) variant of the 2-category to the sl(n) variant and transfer results between various conventions in the literature. We also extend isomorphisms of finite type KLR algebras for different choices of parameters to the level of 2-categories.
