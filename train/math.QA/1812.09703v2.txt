Coisotropic reduction from Poisson geometry and deformation quantization is cast into a general and unifying algebraic framework: we introduce the notion of coisotropic triples of algebras for which a reduction can be defined. This allows to construct also a notion of bimodules for such triples leading to bicategories of bimodules for which we have a reduction functor as well. Morita equivalence of coisotropic triples of algebras is defined as isomorphism in the ambient bicategory and characterized explicitly. Finally, we investigate the classical limit of coisotropic triples of algebras and their bimodules and show that classical limit commutes with reduction in the bicategory sense.
