For a coalgebra C_k over field k, we define the "coalgebra extension problem" as the question: what multiplication laws can we define on C_k to make it a bialgebra over k? This paper answers this existence-uniqueness question for certain special coalgebras. We begin with the trigonometric coalgebra, comparing and contrasting it with the group-(bi)algebra k[\mathbb Z/2]. This leads to a generalization, the coalgebra dual to the group-algebra k[\mathbb Z/p], which we then investigate. We show the connections with other problems, and see that the answer to the coalgebra extension problem for these families depends interestingly on the base field k.
