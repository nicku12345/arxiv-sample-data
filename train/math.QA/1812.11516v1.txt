Suppose A is a not necessarily associative algebra with a derivation d. Then A may be considered as a system with two binary operations \succ  and \prec  defined by x\succ y = d(x)y, x\prec y = xd(y), x,y\in A. Suppose A satisfies some multi-linear polynomial identities. We show how to find the identities that hold for operations \prec  and \succ . It turns out that if A belongs to a variety governed by an operad Var then \succ  and \prec  satisfy the defining relations of the operad Var\circ Nov, where \circ  is the Manin white product of operads, Nov is the operad of Novikov algebras. Moreover, there are no other identities that hold for operations \succ , \prec  on an arbitrary differential Var-algebra.
