We study involutive set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation of multipermutation level 2. These solutions happen to fall into two classes -- distributive ones and non-distributive ones. The distributive ones can be effectively constructed using a set of abelian groups and a matrix of constants. Using this construction, we enumerate all distributive involutive solutions up to size 14. The non-distributive solutions can be also easily constructed, using a distributive solution and a permutation.
