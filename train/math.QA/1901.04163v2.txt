We define a series of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein Hopf algebras H_\beta with injective dimensions 3. Radford's Hopf algebra and Gelaki's Hopf algebra are homomorphic images of H_\beta. We determine its Grothendieck ring G_0(H_\beta). Meanwhile we can obtain Grothendieck rings of Gelaki's Hopf algebras and Radford's Hopf algebras U_{(N,\nu,\omega)} in \cite{R}, and non-isomorphic Hopf algebras with isomorphic Grothendieck rings.
