A braided fusion category is said to have Property \textbf{F} if the associated braid group representations factor over a finite group. We verify integral metaplectic modular categories have property \textbf{F} by showing these categories are group theoretical. For the special case of integral categories \mathcal{C} with the fusion rules of SO(8)_2 we determine the finite group G for which Rep(D^{\omega}G) is braided equivalent to \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}). In addition, we determine the associated classical link invariant, an evaluation of the 2-variable Kauffman polynomial at a point.
