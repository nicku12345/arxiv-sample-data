We prove that the spaces \operatorname{tot}\big(\Gamma(\Lambda^\bullet A^\vee \otimes_R\mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{poly}}^{\bullet}\big) and \operatorname{tot}\big(\Gamma(\Lambda^\bullet A^\vee)\otimes_R\mathcal{D}_{\operatorname{poly}}^{\bullet}\big) associated with a Lie pair (L,A) each carry an L_\infty algebra structure canonical up to an L_\infty isomorphism with the identity map as linear part. These two spaces serve, respectively, as replacements for the spaces of formal polyvector fields and formal polydifferential operators on the Lie pair (L,A), or more precisely, on the fibers of the map of differentiable stacks \mathscr{X}_A \to \mathscr{X}_L associated with the Lie pair (L,A). Consequently, both \mathbb{H}^\bullet_{\operatorname{CE}}(A,\mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{poly}}^{\bullet}) and \mathbb{H}^\bullet_{\operatorname{CE}}(A,\mathcal{D}_{\operatorname{poly}}^{\bullet}) admit canonical Gerstenhaber algebra structures. Our approach is based on homotopy transfer and the construction of a Fedosov dg Lie algebroid (i.e. a dg foliation on a Fedosov dg manifold).
