We provide elementary identities relating the three known types of non-symmetric interpolation Macdonald polynomials. In addition we derive a duality for non-symmetric interpolation Macdonald polynomials. We consider some applications of these results, in particular for binomial formulas involving non-symmetric interpolation Macdonald polynomials.
