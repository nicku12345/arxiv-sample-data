Let \mathfrak{g} be the derived subalgebra of a Kac-Moody Lie algebra of finite type or affine type, \mu a diagram automorphism of \mathfrak{g} and L(\mathfrak{g},\mu) the loop algebra of \mathfrak{g} associated to \mu. In this paper, by using the vertex algebra technique, we provide a general construction of current type presentations for the universal central extension \widehat{\mathfrak{g}}[\mu] of L(\mathfrak{g},\mu). The construction contains the classical limit of Drinfeld's new realization for (twisted and untwisted) quantum affine algebras ([Dr]) and the Moody-Rao-Yokonuma presentation for toroidal Lie algebras ([MRY]) as special examples. As an application, when \mathfrak{g} is of simply-laced type, we prove that the classical limit of the \mu-twisted quantum affinization of the quantum Kac-Moody algebra associated to \mathfrak{g} introduced in [CJKT1] is the universal enveloping algebra of \widehat{\mathfrak{g}}[\mu].
