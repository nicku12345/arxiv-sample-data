The positive part U^+_q of U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2) has a presentation with two generators A,B that satisfy the cubic q-Serre relations. We introduce a PBW basis for U^+_q, said to be alternating. Each element of this PBW basis commutes with exactly one of A, B, qAB-q^{-1}BA. This gives three types of PBW basis elements; the elements of each type mutually commute. We interpret the alternating PBW basis in terms of a q-shuffle algebra associated with affine \mathfrak{sl}_2. We show how the alternating PBW basis is related to the PBW basis for U^+_q found by Damiani in 1993.
