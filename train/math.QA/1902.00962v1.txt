Set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation form a meeting-ground of mathematical physics, algebra and combinatorics. Such a solution (X,r) consists of a set X and a bijective map r:X\times X\to X\times X which satisfies the braid relations. In this work we study the braided group G=G(X,r) of an involutive square-free solution (X,r) of finite order n and cyclic index p=p(X,r) and the group algebra \textbf{k} [G] over a field \textbf{k}. We show that G contains a G-invariant normal subgroup \mathcal{F}_p of finite index p^n, \mathcal{F}_p is isomorphic to the free abelian group of rank n. We describe explicitly the quotient braided group \widetilde{G}=G/\mathcal{F}_p of order p^n and show that X is embedded in \widetilde{G}. We prove that the group algebra \textbf{k} [G] is a free left (resp. right) module of finite rank p^n over its commutative subalgebra \textbf{k}[\mathcal{F}_p] and give an explicit free basis. The center of \textbf{k} [G] contains the subalgebra of symmetric polynomials in \textbf{k} [x_1^p, \cdots, x_n^p]. Classical results on group rings imply that \textbf{k}[G] is a left (and right) Noetherian domain of finite global dimension.
