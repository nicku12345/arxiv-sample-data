Let M be a set. A set-theoretical solution of the pentagon equation on M is a map s:M\times M\longrightarrow M\times M such that \begin{equation*} s_{23}\, s_{13}\, s_{12}=s_{12}\, s_{23}, \end{equation*} where s_{12}=s\times id_M, s_{23}=id_M \times s and s_{13}=(id_M \times \tau) s_{12}(id_M \times \tau), and \tau is the flip map, i.e., the permutation on M\times M given by \tau(x,y)=(y,x), for all x,y\in M. In this paper we give a complete description of the set-theoretical solutions of the form s(x,y)=(x\cdot y , x\ast y) when either (M,\cdot) or (M,\ast) is a group; moreover, we raise some questions.
