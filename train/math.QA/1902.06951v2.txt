In this paper, we study the structure and representation of a 6A-algebra which is a vertex operator algebra generated by two Ising vectors e,f with inner product \left\langle e,f\right\rangle =\frac{5}{2^{10}}. In particular, we prove the uniqueness of the vertex operator algebra structure of this 6A-algebra, classify the irreducible modules, and determine the fusion rules.
