We show that the Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra appears as a quotient of C(SU_{-1}(2)), which means that the corresponding quantum group G_{KP} can be regarded as a quantum subgroup of SU_{-1}(2). We combine the fact that corepresentation category of the Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra is a Tambara-Yamagami tensor category associated with the Krein 4-group and the method of graded twisting of Hopf algebras, to construct the Hopf *-homomorphism.
