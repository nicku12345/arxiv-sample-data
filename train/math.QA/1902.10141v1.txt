In this paper, we first discuss some properties of the Galois linear maps. We provide some equivalent conditions for Hopf algebras and Hopf (co)quasigroups as its applications. Then let H be a Hopf quasigroup with bijective antipode and G be the set of all Hopf quasigroup automorphisms of H. We introduce a new category \mathscr{C}_{H}(\alpha,\beta) with \alpha,\beta\in G over H and construct a new braided \pi-category \mathscr{C}(H) with all the categories \mathscr{C}_{H}(\alpha,\beta) as components.
