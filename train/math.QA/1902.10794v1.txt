We consider the principal subspaces of certain level k\geqslant 1 integrable highest weight modules and generalized Verma modules for the untwisted affine Lie algebras in types D, E and F. Generalizing the approach of G. Georgiev we construct their quasi-particle bases. We use the bases to derive presentations of the principal subspaces, calculate their character formulae and find some new combinatorial identities.
