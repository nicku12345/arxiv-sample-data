For a positive-definite, even, integral lattice L, the lattice vertex operator algebra V_L is known to be rational and C_2-cofinite, and thus the fusion products of its modules always exist. The fusion product of two untwisted irreducible V_L-modules is well-known, namely V_{L+\lambda} \boxtimes_{V_L} V_{L+\mu} = V_{L + \lambda + \mu}. In this paper, we determine the other two fusion products: V_{L+\lambda} \boxtimes_{V_L} V_L^{T_{\chi}} and V_L^{T_{\chi_1}} \boxtimes_{V_L} V_L^{T_{\chi_2}}.
