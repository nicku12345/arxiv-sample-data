Let H and K be the bosonizations of the Jordan and super Jordan plane by the group algebra of a cyclic group; the algebra K projects onto an algebra L that can be thought of as the quantum Borel of \mathfrak{sl}(2) at -1. The finite-dimensional simple modules over H and K, are classified; they all have dimension 1, respectively \le 2. The indecomposable L-modules of dimension \leq 5 are also listed. An interesting monoidal subcategory of \operatorname{rep} L is described.
