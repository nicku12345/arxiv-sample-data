In this paper, we first show for a slightly degenerate pre-modular fusion category \mathcal{C} that squares of dimensions of simple objects divide half of the dimension of \mathcal{C}, and that slightly degenerate fusion categories of FP-dimensions 2p^nd and 4p^nd are nilpotent, where p is an odd prime and d is an odd square-free integer. Then we classify slightly degenerate generalized Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories and weakly integral slightly degenerate fusion categories of particular dimensions.
