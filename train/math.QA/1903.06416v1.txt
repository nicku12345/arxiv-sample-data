In a seminal paper Drinfel'd explained how to associate to every classical r-matrix for a Lie algebra \lie g a twisting element based on \mathcal{U}(\lie g)[[\hbar]], or equivalently a left invariant star product of the corresponding symplectic structure \omega on the 1-connected Lie group G of g. In a recent paper, the authors solve the same problem by means of Fedosov quantization. In this short note we provide a connection between the two constructions by computing the characteristic (Fedosov) class of the twist constructed by Drinfel'd and proving that it is the trivial class given by  \frac{[\omega]}{\hbar}.
