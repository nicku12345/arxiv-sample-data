Based on the screened vertex operators associated with the affine screening operators, we introduce the formal power series f^{hat{gl}_N}(x,p|s,kappa|q,t) which we call the non-stationary Ruijsenaars function. We identify it with the generating function for the Euler characteristics of the affine Laumon spaces. When the parameters s and kappa are suitably chosen, the limit t rightarrow q of f^{hat{gl}_N}(x,p|s,kappa|q,q/t) gives us the dominant integrable characters of hat{sl}_N multiplied by 1/(p^N;p^N)_infty (i.e. the hat{gl}_1 character). Several conjectures are presented for f^{hat{gl}_N}(x,p|s,kappa|q,t), including the bispectral and the Poincare dualities, and the evaluation formula. Main Conjecture asserts that (i) one can normalize f^{hat{gl}_N}(x,p|s,kappa|q,t) in such a way that the limit kappa rightarrow 1 exists, and (ii) the limit f^{st.hat{gl}_N}(x,p|s|q,t) gives us the eigenfunction of the elliptic Ruijsenaars operator. The non-stationary affine q-difference Toda operator T^{hat{gl}_N}(kappa) is introduced, which comes as an outcome of the study of the Poincare duality conjecture in the affine Toda limit t rightarrow 0. Main Conjecture is examined also in the limiting cases of the affine q-difference Toda (t rightarrow 0), and the elliptic Calogero-Sutherland (q,t rightarrow 1) equations.
