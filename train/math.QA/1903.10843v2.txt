The structure of the C^*-algebra of functions on the quantum flag manifold SU_q(3)/\mathbb{T}^2 is investigated. Building on the representation theory of C(SU_q(3)), we analyze irreducible representations and the primitive ideal space of C(SU_q(3)/\mathbb{T}^2), with a view towards unearthing the `quantum sphere bundle' \mathbb{C} P_q^1 \to SU_q(3)/\mathbb{T}^2 \to \mathbb{C} P_q^2
