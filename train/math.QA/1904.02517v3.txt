We describe the double Yangian of the general linear Lie algebra \mathfrak{gl}_N by following a general scheme of Drinfeld. This description is based on the construction of the universal R-matrix for the Yangian. To make the exposition self contained, we include the proofs of all necessary facts about the Yangian itself. In particular, we describe the centre of the Yangian by using its Hopf algebra structure, and provide a proof of the analogue of the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for the Yangian based on its representation theory. This proof extends to the double Yangian, thus giving a description of its underlying vector space.
