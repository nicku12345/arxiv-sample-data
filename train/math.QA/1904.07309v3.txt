We consider the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov and dynamical operators, both differential and difference, in the context of the (\mathfrak{gl}_{k}, \mathfrak{gl}_{n})-duality for the space of polynomials in kn anticommuting variables. We show that the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov and dynamical operators naturally exchange under the duality.
