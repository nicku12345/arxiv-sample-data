In this work, we focus on the set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation which are of finite order and not necessarily bijective. We use the matched product of solutions as a unifying tool for treating these solutions of finite order, that also include involutive and idempotent solutions. In particular, we prove that the matched product of two solutions r_S and r_T is of finite order if and only if r_S and r_T are. Furthermore, we show that with sufficient information on r_S and r_T we can precisely establish the order of the matched product. Finally, we prove that if B is a finite semi-brace, then the associated solution r satisfies r^n=r, for an integer n closely linked with B.
