We prove an analog of Deligne's theorem for finite symmetric tensor categories \mathcal{C} with the Chevalley property over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 2. Namely, we prove that every such category \mathcal{C} admits a symmetric fiber functor to the symmetric tensor category \mathcal{D} of representations of the triangular Hopf algebra (k[\dd]/(\dd^2),1\ot 1 + \dd\ot \dd). Equivalently, we prove that there exists a unique finite group scheme G in \mathcal{D} such that \mathcal{C} is symmetric tensor equivalent to \Rep_{\mathcal{D}}(G). Finally, we compute the group H^2_{\rm inv}(A,K) of equivalence classes of twists for the group algebra K[A] of a finite abelian p-group A over an arbitrary field K of characteristic p>0, and the Sweedler cohomology groups H^i_{\rm{Sw}}(\mathcal{O}(A),K), i\ge 1, of the function algebra \mathcal{O}(A) of A.
