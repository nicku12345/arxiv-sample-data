In this paper, we introduce a new sequence \bar{N}_m to find a new estimation of the cardinality N_m of the minimal involutive square-free solution of level m. As an application, using the first values of \bar{N}_m, we improve the estimations of N_m obtained by Gateva-Ivanova and Cameron and by Lebed and Vendramin. Following the approach of the first part, in the last section we construct several new counterexamples to the Gateva-Ivanova's Conjecture.
