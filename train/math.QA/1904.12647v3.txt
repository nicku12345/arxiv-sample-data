We study the intermediate liberation problem for the real and complex unitary and reflection groups, namely O_N,U_N,H_N,K_N. For any of these groups G_N, the problem is that of understanding the structure of the intermediate quantum groups G_N\subset G_N^\times\subset G_N^+, in terms of the recently introduced notions of "soft" and "hard" liberation. We solve here some of these questions, our key ingredient being the generation formula H_N^{[\infty]}=<H_N,T_N^+>, coming via crossed product methods. Also, we conjecture the existence of a "contravariant duality" between the liberations of H_N and of U_N, as a solution to the lack of a covariant duality between these liberations.
