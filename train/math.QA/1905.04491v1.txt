We study homomorphisms between quantized generalized Verma modules M(V_{\Lambda})\stackrel{\phi_{\Lambda,\Lambda_1}}{\rightarrow}M(V_{\Lambda_1}) for {\mathcal U}_q(su(n,n)). There is a natural notion of degree for such maps, and if the map is of degree k, we write \phi^k_{\Lambda,\Lambda_1}. We examine when one can have a series of such homomorphisms \phi^1_{\Lambda_{n-1},\Lambda_{n}} \circ \phi^1_{\Lambda_{n-2}, \Lambda_{n-1}} \circ\cdots\circ \phi^1_{\Lambda,\Lambda_1} = \textrm{Det}_q, where \textrm{Det}_q denotes the map M(V_{\Lambda})\ni p\rightarrow \textrm{Det}_q\cdot p\in M(V_{\Lambda_n}). If, classically, su(n,n)^{\mathbb C}={\mathfrak p}^-\oplus(su(n)\oplus su(n)\oplus {\mathbb C})\oplus {\mathfrak p}^+, then \Lambda = (\Lambda_L,\Lambda_R,\lambda) and \Lambda_n =(\Lambda_L,\Lambda_R,\lambda+2). The answer is then that \Lambda must be one-sided in the sense that either \Lambda_L=0 or \Lambda_R=0 (non-exclusively). There are further demands on \lambda if we insist on {\mathcal U}_q({\mathfrak g}^{\mathbb C}) homomorphisms. However, it is also interesting to loosen this to considering only {\mathcal U}^-_q({\mathfrak g}^{\mathbb C}) homomorphisms, in which case the conditions on \lambda disappear. By duality, there result have implications on covariant quantized differential operators. We finish by giving an explicit, though sketched, determination of the full set of {\mathcal U}_q({\mathfrak g}^{\mathbb C}) homomorphisms \phi^1_{\Lambda,\Lambda_1}.
