We exhibit new examples of double quasi-Poisson brackets, based on some classification results and the method of fusion. This method was introduced by Van den Bergh for a large class of double quasi-Poisson brackets which are said differential, and our main result is that it can be extended to arbitrary double quasi-Poisson brackets. We also provide an alternative construction for the double quasi-Poisson brackets of Van den Bergh associated to quivers, and of Massuyeau-Turaev associated to the fundamental groups of surfaces.
