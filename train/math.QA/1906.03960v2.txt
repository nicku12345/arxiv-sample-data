We investigate a class of non-involutive solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation which generalize self-distributive (derived) solutions. In particular, we study generalized multipermutation solutions in this class. We show that the Yang-Baxter (permutation) groups of such solutions are nilpotent. We formulate the results in the language of biracks.
