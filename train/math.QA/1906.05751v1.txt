We describe explicitly the vertex algebra of (twisted) chiral differential operators on certain nilmanifolds and construct their logarithmic modules. This is achieved by generalizing the construction of vertex operators in terms of exponentiated scalar fields to Jacobi theta functions naturally appearing in these nilmanifolds. This provides with a non-trivial example of logarithmic vertex algebra modules, a theory recently developed by Bakalov.
