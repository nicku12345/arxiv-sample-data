We describe a method for quantization of Poisson Hopf algebras in \mathbb Q-linear symmetric monoidal categories. It is compatible with tensor products and can also be used to produce braided Hopf algebras. The main idea comes from the fact that nerves of groups are symmetric simplicial sets. Nerves of Hopf algebras then turn out to be braided rather than symmetric and nerves of Poisson Hopf algebras to be infinitesimally braided. The problem is thus solved via the standard machinery of Drinfeld associators.
