We introduce Hopf algebroid covariance on Woronowicz's differential calculus. Using it, we develop a general framework of noncommutative complex geometry that subsumes the one in \cite{MR3720811}. We present transverse complex and K\"ahler structures as examples and discuss the Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebroid. We prove noncommutative versions of the Hodge decomposition and Formality theorems for K\"ahler manifolds. Relation with existing literature is described.
