The representations of the quantum toroidal algebras have been widely studied by many authors. However, no one has constructed some finite dimensional modules for them while q is generic. In this paper, for all \mathfrak{g}-generic q, if \mathfrak{g} is not of type A_1, we prove that the quantum toroidal algebra U_q(\mathfrak{g}_{\rm tor}) has no nontrivial finite dimensional simple module.
