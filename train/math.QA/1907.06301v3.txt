We introduce the notion of quantum N-toroidal algebras uniformly, which is a natural generalization of the usual quantum toroidal algebras as well as extended quantized GIM algebras of N-fold affinization. We show that the quantum N-toroidal algebras are quotients of the extended quantized GIM algebras of N-fold affinization, which generalizes a well-known result of Birman and Moody for Lie algebras. Moreover, we construct a level-one vertex representation of the quantum N-toroidal algebra for type A.
