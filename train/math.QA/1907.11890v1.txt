We investigate the matched product of solutions associated with right and left shelves. First, we prove that the requirements to provide the matched product of solutions that come from shelves can be simplified. Then we give conditions for left non-degeneracy of the matched product. Later, we compute the structure shelf of the matched product of solutions. Finally, we prove that the structure shelf of the matched product does not depend on the choice of the actions.
