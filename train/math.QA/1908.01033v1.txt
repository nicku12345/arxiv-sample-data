In this note we discuss the possibility of constructing the cosimplicial complex for the multiplier Hopf algebras and extending the cyclicity operator to obtain the Hopf-cyclic cohomology for them. We show that the definition of modular pairs in involution for multiplier Hopf algebras and provide the definition of Hopf-cyclic cohomology for algebras of functions over discrete groups.
