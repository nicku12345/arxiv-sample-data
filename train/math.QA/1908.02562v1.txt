In this paper, we study the elliptic Kashiwara-Vergne Lie Algebra \mathfrak{krv}, which is a certain Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of derivations of the free Lie algebra in two generators. It has a natural bigrading, such that the Lie bracket is of bidegree (-1,-1). After recalling the graphical interpretation of this Lie algebra, we examine low degree elements of \mathfrak{krv}. More precisely, we find that \mathfrak{krv}^{(2,j)} is one-dimensional for even j and zero j odd. We also compute \operatorname{dim}(\mathfrak{krv})^{(3,m)} = \lfloor\frac{m-1}{2}\rfloor - \lfloor\frac{m-1}{3}\rfloor. In particular, we show that in those degrees there are no odd elements and also confirm Enriquez' conjecture in those degrees.
