In this paper, we continue with the ideas presented in [GVR17]. In this opportunity, we apply the fermionic action concept to classify in cohomology terms the minimal modular extensions of a super-Tannakian category. For this goal, we study some properties of equivariantization and de-equivariantization processes and cohomology data for the fermionic case.
