For quantized universal enveloping algebras we construct weight modules by inducing representations of the centralizer of the Cartan subalgebra in the quantized universal enveloping algebra. The induced modules arising from finite-dimensional weight modules the centralizer algebra are studied. In particular, we study the induction of one-dimensional modules, and this is related to the study of commutative subalgebras of the centralizer algebra. For the special case of U_q(\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})) we show that we get the admissible unitary representations corresponding to the non-compact real form U_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1)).
