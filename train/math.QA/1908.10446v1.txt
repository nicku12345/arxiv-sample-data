Let A be a finite dimensional unital commutative associative algebra and let B be a finite dimensional vertex A-algebroid such that its Levi factor is isomorphic to sl_2. Under suitable conditions, we construct an indecomposable non-simple \mathbb{N}-graded vertex algebra \overline{V_B} from the \mathbb{N}-graded vertex algebra V_B associated with the vertex A-algebroid B. We show that this indecomposable non-simple \mathbb{N}-graded vertex algebra \overline{V_B} is C_2-cofinite and has only two irreducible modules.
