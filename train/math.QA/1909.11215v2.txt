In the present paper we construct braid group actions on quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebras of type AIII/AIV. This completes the proof of a conjecture by Kolb and Pellegrini in the case where the underlying Lie algebra is \mathfrak{sl}_n. The braid group actions are defined on the generators of the coideal subalgebras and the defining relations and braid relations are verified by explicit calculations.
