We consider fundamental facts from the theory of Hopf superalgebras. We use them to construct the quantum double of the quantum superalgebra sl(2|1) at roots of unity. Thus we obtain a multiplicative formula for universal R-matrix. Next we construct an R-matrix to investigate parametrized family of centralizer algebras. We give multiplication laws in particular case and describe a structure of such algebras in the general case.
