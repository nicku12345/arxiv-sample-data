We prove that the skein categories of Walker--Johnson-Freyd satisfy excision. This allows us to conclude that skein categories are k-linear factorisation homology and taking the free cocompletion of skein categories recovers locally finitely presentable factorisation homology. An application of this is that the skein algebra of a punctured surface related to any quantum group with generic parameter gives a quantisation of the associated character variety.
