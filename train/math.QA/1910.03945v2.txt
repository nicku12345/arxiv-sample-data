In this paper, under the assumption that the diagonal coset vertex operator algebra C(L_{\mathfrak g}(k+l,0),L_{\mathfrak g}(k,0)\otimes L_{\mathfrak g}(l,0)) is rational and C_2-cofinite, the global dimension of C(L_{\mathfrak g}(k+l,0),L_{\mathfrak g}(k,0)\otimes L_{\mathfrak g}(l,0)) is obtained, the quantum dimensions of multiplicity spaces viewed as C(L_{\mathfrak g}(k+l,0),L_{\mathfrak g}(k,0)\otimes L_{\mathfrak g}(l,0))-modules are also obtained. As an application, a method to classify irreducible modules of C(L_{\mathfrak g}(k+l,0),L_{\mathfrak g}(k,0)\otimes L_{\mathfrak g}(l,0)) is provided. As an example, we prove that the diagonal coset vertex operator algebra C(L_{E_8}(k+2,0),L_{E_8}(k,0)\otimes L_{E_8}(2,0)) is rational, C_2-cofinite, and classify irreducible modules of C(L_{E_8}(k+2,0),L_{E_8}(k,0)\otimes L_{E_8}(2,0)).
