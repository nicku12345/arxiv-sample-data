The Yang-Baxter and pentagon equations are two well-known equations of Mathematical Physic. If S is a set, a map s:S\times S\to S\times S is said to be a set theoretical solution of the Yang-Baxter equation if  s_{23}\, s_{13}\, s_{12} = s_{12}\, s_{13}\, s_{23},  where s_{12}=s\times id_S, s_{23}=id_S\times s, and s_{13}=(id_S\times \tau)\,s_{12}\,(id_S\times \tau) and \tau is the flip map, i.e., the map on S\times S given by \tau(x,y)=(y,x). Instead, s is called a set-theoretical solution of the pentagon equation if  s_{23}\, s_{13}\, s_{12}=s_{12}\, s_{23}.  The main aim of this work is to display how solutions of the pentagon equation turn out to be a useful tool to obtain new solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Specifically, we present a new construction of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation involving two specific solutions of the pentagon equation. To this end, we provide a method to obtain solutions of the pentagon equation on the matched product of two semigroups, that is a semigroup including the classical Zappa product.
