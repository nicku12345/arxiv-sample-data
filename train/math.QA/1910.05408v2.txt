For n,m\in \mathbb{N}, let H_{n,m} be the dual of the Radford algebra of dimension n^{2}m. We present new finite-dimensional Nichols algebras arising from the study of simple Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H_{n,m}. Along the way, we describe the simple objects in {}^{H_{n,m}}_{H_{n,m}}\mathcal{YD} and their projective envelopes. Then, we determine those simple modules that give rise to finite-dimensional Nichols algebras for the case n=2. There are 18 possible cases. We present by generators and relations the corresponding Nichols algebras on five of these eighteen cases. As an application, we characterize finite-dimensional Nichols algebras over indecomposable modules for n=2=m and n=2, m=3, which recovers some results of the second and third author in the former case, and of Xiong in the latter.
