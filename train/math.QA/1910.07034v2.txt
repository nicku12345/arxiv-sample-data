We study a class of strictly weakly integral fusion categories \mathfrak{I}_{N, \zeta}, where N \geq 1 is a natural number and \zeta is a 2^Nth root of unity, that we call N-Ising fusion categories. An N-Ising fusion category has Frobenius-Perron dimension 2^{N+1} and is a graded extension of a pointed fusion category of rank 2 by the cyclic group of order \mathbb Z_{2^N}. We show that every braided N-Ising fusion category is prime and also that there exists a slightly degenerate N-Ising braided fusion category for all N > 2. We also prove a structure result for braided extensions of a rank 2 pointed fusion category in terms of braided N-Ising fusion categories.
