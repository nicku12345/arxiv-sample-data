We use zesting and symmetry gauging of modular tensor categories to analyze some previously unrealized modular data obtained by Grossman and Izumi. In one case we find all realizations and in the other we determine the form of possible realizations; in both cases all realizations can be obtained from quantum groups at roots of unity.
