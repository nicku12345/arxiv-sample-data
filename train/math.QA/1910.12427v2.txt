We provide a combinatorial description of the monoidal category generated by the fundamental representation of the small quantum group of \mathfrak{sl}_2 at a root of unity q of odd order. Our approach is diagrammatic, and it relies on an extension of the Temperley-Lieb category specialized at \delta = -q-q^{-1}.
