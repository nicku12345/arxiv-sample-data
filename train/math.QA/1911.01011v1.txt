We provide a deformation, \mathfrak{f}_{\beta}, of Lusztig algebra \mathbf{f}. Various quantum algebras in literatures, including half parts of two-parameter quantum algebras, quantum superalgebras, and multi-parameter quantum algebras/superalgebras, are all specializations of \mathfrak{f}_{\beta}. Moreover, \mathfrak{f}_{\beta} is isomorphic to Lusztig algebra \mathbf{f} up to a twist. As a consequence, half parts of those quantum algebras are isomorphic to Lusztig algebra \mathbf{f} over a big enough ground field up to certain twists. We further construct the entire algebra \mathbf U_{\beta,\xi} by Drinfeld double construction. As special cases, above quantum algebras all admit a Drinfeld double construction under certain assumptions.
