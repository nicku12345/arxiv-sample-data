Nichols algebras are fundamental objects in the construction of quantized enveloping algebras and in the classification of pointed Hopf algebras by lifting method of Andruskiewitsch and Schneider. Arithmetic root systems are invariants of Nichols algebras of diagonal type with a certain finiteness property. In the present paper, all rank 4 Nichols algebras of diagonal type with a finite arithmetic root system over fields of arbitrary characteristic are classified. Our proof uses the classification of the finite arithmetic root systems of rank 4.
