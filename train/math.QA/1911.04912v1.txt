We introduce a Sinkhorn-type algorithm for producing quantum permutation matrices encoding symmetries of graphs. Our algorithm generates square matrices whose entries are orthogonal projections onto one-dimensional subspaces satisfying a set of linear relations. We use it for experiments on the representation theory of the quantum permutation group and quantum subgroups of it. We apply it to the question whether a given finite graph (without multiple edges) has quantum symmetries in the sense of Banica. In order to do so, we run our Sinkhorn algorithm and check whether or not the resulting projections commute. We discuss the produced data and some questions for future research arising from it.
