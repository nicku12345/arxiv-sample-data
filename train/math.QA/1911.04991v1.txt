Racks and quandles are prominent set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We enumerate racks and quandles of orders n\le 13 up to isomorphism, improving upon the previously known results for n\le 8 and n\le 9, respectively. The enumeration is based on the classification of subgroups of small symmetric groups up to conjugation, on a representation of racks and quandles in symmetric groups due to Joyce and Blackburn, and on a number of theoretical and computational observations concerning the representation. We explicitly find representatives of isomorphism types of racks of order \le 11 and quandles of order \le 12. For the remaining orders we merely count the isomorphism types, relying in part on the enumeration of 2-reductive racks and 2-reductive quandles due to Jedli\v{c}ka, Pilitowska, Stanovsk\'y and Zamojska-Dzienio.
