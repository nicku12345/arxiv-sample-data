Let H be the 16-dimensional nontrivial (namely, noncommutative and noncocommutative) semisimple Hopf algebra H_{b:1} appeared in Kashina's work \cite{K00}. We obtain all simple Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H and then determine all finite-dimensional Nichols algebras satisfying \mathcal{B}(V)\cong \bigotimes_{i\in I}\mathcal{B}(V_i), where V=\bigoplus_{i\in I}V_i, each V_i is a simple object in _H^H\mathcal{YD}. Finally, we describe all liftings of those \mathcal{B}(V) over H.
