In this work, we introduce the {\mathbb Z}_3-graded differential algebra, denoted by \Omega(\widetilde{\rm GL}_q(2)), treated as the {\mathbb Z}_3-graded quantum de Rham complex of {\mathbb Z}_3-graded quantum group \widetilde{\rm GL}_q(2). In this sense, we construct left-covariant differential calculi on the {\mathbb Z}_3-graded quantum group \widetilde{\rm GL}_q(2).
