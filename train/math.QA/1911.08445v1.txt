This work presents a classification of U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)-symmetries on the quantum disc. The principal invariant of such classification, the grading jump, is introduced. It turns out that, under the present subjects, the grading jump can take only 3 values: 0, 1, -1. The subcollection of the complete collection of symmetries is extracted in such a way that the selected symmetries satisfy certain compatibility condition for involutions.
