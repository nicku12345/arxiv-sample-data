Tensor product of irreducible modules of highest weight over a semi-simple quantum group is semi-simple if and only if a natural contravariant form is non-degenerate when restricted to the span of singular vectors. We express this restriction through the extremal projector of the quantum group providing a computationally feasible criterion for complete reducibility of tensor products.
