In a vertex algebra setting, we consider non-local screening operators, which are associated to any non-integral lattice. We have previously shown that under certain restrictions these screening operators satisfy the relations of a quantum shuffle algebra or Nichols algebra, with a diagonal braiding associated to the non-locality and non-integrality.   In the present article, we take all finite-dimensional diagonal Nichols algebras, as classified by Heckenberger, and find all realisations of the braiding by a lattice that are compatible with reflections. Usually the realising lattices are unique or parametrised by one or two parameters. We then study the associated algebra of screenings with improved methods. Typically, for positive definite lattices we obtain the Nichols algebra, such as the positive part of the quantum group, and for negative definite lattices we obtain a certain extension of the Nichols algebra generalising the infinite quantum group with a large centre. Our result in particular covers so-called (p, p')-models and Lie superalgebras, which had been of interest to other research.
