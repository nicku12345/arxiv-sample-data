We take a fresh look at the geometrization of logic using the recently developed tools of `quantum Riemannian geometry' applied in the digital case over the field \Bbb F_2=\{0,1\}, extending de Morgan duality to this context of differential forms and connections. The 1-forms correspond to graphs and the exterior derivative of a subset amounts to the arrows that cross between the set and its complement. The line graph 0-1-2 has a non-flat but Ricci flat quantum Riemannian geometry. The previously known four quantum geometries on the triangle graph, of which one is curved, are revisited in terms of left-invariant differentials, as are the quantum geometries on the dual Hopf algebra, the group algebra of \Bbb Z_3. For the square, we find a moduli of four quantum Riemannian geometries, all flat, while for an n-gon with n>4 we find a unique one, again flat. We also propose an extension of de Morgan duality to general algebras and differentials over \Bbb F_2.
