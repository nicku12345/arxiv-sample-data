Suppose that we have a semisimple, connected, simply connected algebraic group G with corresponding Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. There is a Hopf pairing between the universal enveloping algebra U(\mathfrak{g}) and the coordinate ring O(G). By introducing a parameter q, we can consider quantum deformations U_q(\mathfrak{g}) and O_q(G) respectively, between which there again exists a Hopf pairing. We show that the category of crystals associated with U_q(\mathfrak{g}) is a monoidal category. We define subgroups of U_q(\mathfrak{g}) to be right coideal subalgebras, and subgroups of O_q(G) to be quotient left O_q(G)-module coalgebras. Furthermore, we discuss a categorical approach to subgroups of quantum groups which we hope will provide us with a link to crystal basis theory.
