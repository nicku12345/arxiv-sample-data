We study quadratic Lie conformal superalgebras associated with No\-vikov superalgebras. For every Novikov superalgebra (V,\circ), we construct an enveloping differential Poisson superalgebra U(V) with a derivation d such that u\circ v = ud(v) and \{u,v\} = u\circ v - (-1)^{|u||v|} v\circ u for u,v\in V. The latter means that the commutator Gelfand--Dorfman superalgebra of V is special. Next, we prove that every quadratic Lie conformal superalgebra constructed on a finite-dimensional special Gel'fand--Dorfman superalgebra has a finite faithful conformal representation. This statement is a step toward a solution of the following open problem: whether a finite Lie conformal (super)algebra has a finite faithful conformal representation.
