We study the pre-Lie algebra of rooted trees (\Cal T, \rightarrow) and we define a pre-Lie structure on its doubling space (V, \leadsto). Also, we find the enveloping algebras of the two pre-Lie algebras denoted respectively by (\Cal H', \star, \Gamma) and (\Cal D', \bigstar, \chi). We prove that (\Cal D', \bigstar, \chi) is a module-bialgebra on (\Cal H', \star, \Gamma) and we find some relations between the two pre-Lie structures.
