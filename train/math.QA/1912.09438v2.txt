We show that the hairy graph complex (HGC_{n,n},d) appears as an associated graded complex of the oriented graph complex (OGC_{n+1},d), subject to the filtration on the number of targets, or equivalently sources, called the fixed source graph complex. The fixed source graph complex (OGC_1,d_0) maps into the ribbon graph complex RGC, which models the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The full differential d on the oriented graph complex OGC_{n+1} corresponds to the deformed differential d+h on the hairy graph complex HGC_{n,n}, where h adds a hair. This deformed complex (HGC_{n,n},d+h) is already known to be quasi-isomorphic to standard Kontsevich's graph complex GC^2_n. This gives a new connection between the standard and the oriented version of Kontsevich's graph complex.
