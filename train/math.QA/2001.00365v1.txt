Let V be a vertex operator superalgebra with the natural order 2 automorphism \sigma. Under suitable conditions on V, the \sigma-fixed subspace V_{\bar 0} is a vertex operator algebra and the category C_{V_{\bar 0}} of V_{\bar 0}-modules is modular tensor category. In this paper, we prove that C_{V_{\bar 0}} is a fermionic modular tensor category and the M\"uger centralizer C_{V_{\bar 0}}^0 of the fermion in C_{V_{\bar 0}} is generated by the irreducible V_{\bar 0}-submodules of the V-modules. In particular, C_{V_{\bar 0}}^0 is a super-modular tensor category and C_{V_{\bar 0}} is a minimal modular extension of C_{V_{\bar 0}}^0. We provide a construction of a vertex operator V^l for each positive integer l such that C_{V^l_{\bar 0}} is minimal modular extension of C_{V_{\bar 0}}^0. We prove that these modular tensor categories C_{V^l_{\bar 0}} are uniquely determined, up to equivalence, by the congruence class of l modulo 16.
