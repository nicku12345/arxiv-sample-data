We find sufficient conditions for the construction of vertex algebraic intertwining operators, among generalized Verma modules for an affine Lie algebra \hat{\mathfrak{g}}, from \mathfrak{g}-module homomorphisms. When \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_2, these results extend previous joint work with J. Yang, but the method used here is different. Here, we construct intertwining operators by solving Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for three-point correlation functions associated to \hat{\mathfrak{g}}, and we identify obstructions to the construction arising from the possible non-existence of series solutions having a prescribed form.
