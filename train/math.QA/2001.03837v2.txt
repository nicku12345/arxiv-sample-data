It was shown by Ostrik (2003) and Natale (2017) that a collection of twisted group algebras in a pointed fusion category serve as explicit Morita equivalence class representatives of indecomposable, separable algebras in such categories. We generalize this result by constructing explicit Morita equivalence class representatives of indecomposable, separable algebras in group-theoretical fusion categories. This is achieved by providing the `free functor' \Phi from a pointed fusion category to a group-theoretical fusion category with a monoidal structure. Our algebras of interest are then constructed as the image of twisted group algebras under \Phi. We also show that twisted group algebras admit the structure of Frobenius algebras in a pointed fusion category, and we establish a Frobenius monoidal structure on \Phi as well. As a consequence, our algebras are Frobenius algebras in a group-theoretical fusion category, and like twisted group algebras in the pointed case, they also enjoy several good algebraic properties.
