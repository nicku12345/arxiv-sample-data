A first aim of this paper is to give sufficient conditions on left non-degenerate bijective set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation so that they are non-degenerate. In particular, we extend the results on involutive solutions obtained by Rump in [36] and answer in a positive way to a question posed by Ced\'o, Jespers, and Verwimp [19, Question 4.2]. Moreover, we develop a theory of extensions for left non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation that allows one to construct new families of set-theoretic solutions.
