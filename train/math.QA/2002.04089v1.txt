We show that any pivotal Hopf monoid H in a symmetric monoidal category \mathcal{C} gives rise to actions of mapping class groups of oriented surfaces of genus g \geq 1 with n \geq 1 boundary components. These mapping class group actions are given by group homomorphisms into the group of automorphisms of certain Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H. They are associated with edge slides in embedded ribbon graphs that generalise chord slides in chord diagrams. We give a concrete description of these mapping class group actions in terms of generating Dehn twists and defining relations. For the case where \mathcal{C} is finitely complete and cocomplete, we also obtain actions of mapping class groups of closed surfaces by imposing invariance and coinvariance under the Yetter-Drinfeld module structure.
