Let (H, \beta) be a monoidal Hom-Hopf algebra with the bijective antipode S, In this paper, we mainly construct the Drinfel'd codouble T(H)=(H^{op}\otimes H^{*}, \beta\otimes \beta^{*-1}) and \widehat{T(H)}=( H^{*}\otimes H^{op}, \beta^{*-1}\otimes \beta) in the setting of monoidal Hom-Hopf algebras. Then we prove both T(H) and \widehat{T(H)} are coquasitriangular. Finally, we discuss the relation between Drinfel'd codouble and Heisenberg double in the setting of monoidal Hom-Hopf algebras, which is a generalization of the part results in \cite{L94}.
