We provide isomorphism results for Hopf algebras that are obtained as graded twistings of function algebras on finite groups by cocentral actions of cyclic groups. More generally , we also consider the isomorphism problem for finite-dimensional Hopf algebras fitting into abelian cocentral extensions. We apply our classification results to a number of concrete examples involving special linear groups over finite fields, alternating groups and dihedral groups.
