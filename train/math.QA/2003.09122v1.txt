In this paper we use Lie conformal algebras to realize some moonshine type VOAs, whose Greiss algebras are Jordan algebras. On the other hand, we consider some free fields which realizes the corresponding simple VOAs. As an application, we can calculate the correlation functions of these VOAs in a relatively easy way.
