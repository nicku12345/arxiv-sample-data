Let V be a vertex operator algebra and g=\left(1\ 2\ \cdots k\right) be a k-cycle which is viewed as an automorphism of the vertex operator algebra V^{\otimes k}. It is proved that Dong-Li-Mason's associated associative algebra A_{g}\left(V^{\otimes k}\right) is isomorphic to Zhu's algebra A\left(V\right) explicitly. This result recovers a previous result that there is a one-to-one correspondence between irreducible g-twisted V^{\otimes k}-modules and irreducible V-modules.
