We describe the structure of a generalized near-group fusion category and present an example of this class of fusion categories which arises from the extension of a Fibonacci category. We then classify slightly degenerate generalized near-group fusion categories. We also prove a structure result for braided generalized Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories.
