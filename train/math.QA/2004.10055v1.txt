We discuss the gluing construction of class \mathcal{S} chiral algebras in derived setting. The gluing construction in non-derived setting was introduced by Arakawa to construct a family of vertex algebras of which the associated varieties give genus zero Moore-Tachikawa symplectic varieties. Motivated by the higher genus case, we introduce a dg vertex algebra version \mathsf{MT}_{\mathrm{ch}} of the category of Moore-Tachikawa symplectic varieties, where a morphism is given by a dg vertex algebra equipped with action of the universal affine vertex algebra, and composition of morphisms is given by the BRST reduction. We also show that the procedure taking the associated scheme of gives a functor from \mathsf{MT}_{\mathrm{ch}} to the category \mathsf{MT} of derived Moore-Tachikawa varieties, which would imply compatibility of gluing constructions in both categories.
