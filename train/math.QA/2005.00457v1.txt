The q-Onsager algebra \mathcal O_q is defined by two generators A, A^* and two relations, called the q-Dolan/Grady relations. Recently P. Baseilhac and S. Kolb found an automorphism L of \mathcal O_q, that fixes A and sends A^* to a linear combination of A^*, A^2A^*, AA^*A, A^*A^2. Let V denote an irreducible \mathcal O_q-module of finite dimension at least two, on which each of A, A^* is diagonalizable. It is known that A, A^* act on V as a tridiagonal pair of q-Racah type, giving access to four familiar elements K, B, K^\downarrow, B^\downarrow in {\rm End}(V) that are used to compare the eigenspace decompositions for A, A^* on V.   We display an invertible H \in {\rm End}(V) such that L(X)=H^{-1} X H on V for all X \in \mathcal O_q. We describe what happens when one of K, B, K^\downarrow, B^\downarrow is conjugated by H. For example H^{-1}KH=a^{-1}A-a^{-2}K^{-1} where a is a certain scalar that is used to describe the eigenvalues of A on V. We use the conjugation results to compare the eigenspace decompositions for A, A^*, L^{\pm 1}(A^*) on V. In this comparison we use the notion of an equitable triple; this is a 3-tuple of elements in {\rm End}(V) such that any two satisfy a q-Weyl relation. Our comparison involves eight equitable triples. One of them is a A - a^2 K, M^{-1}, K where M= (a K-a^{-1} B)(a-a^{-1})^{-1}. The map M appears in earlier work of S. Bockting-Conrad concerning the double lowering operator \psi of a tridiagonal pair.
