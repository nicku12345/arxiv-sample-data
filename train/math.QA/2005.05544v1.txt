We give a rigorous development of the construction of new braided fusion categories from a given category known as zesting. This method has been used in the past to provide categorifications of new fusion rule algebras, modular data, and minimal modular extensions of super-modular categories. Here we provide a complete obstruction theory and parameterization approach to the construction and illustrate its utility with several examples.
