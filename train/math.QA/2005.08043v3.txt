We present new examples of finite-dimensional Nichols algebra over fields of characteristic 2 starting from braided vector spaces that are not of diagonal type, admit realizations as Yetter-Drinfeld modules over finite abelian groups and are analogous to braidings over fields of odd characteristic with finite-dimensional Nichols algebras presented in arXiv:1905.03074. As these last ones, they are related to the Nichols algebras of finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension in characteristic 0 described in arXiv:1606.02521. New finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras over fields of characteristic 2 are obtained by bosonization with group algebras of suitable finite abelian groups.
