Let S be the spinor representation of U_q\mathfrak{so}_N, for N odd and q^2 not a rooot of unity. We show that the commutant of its action on S^{\otimes n} is given by a representation of the nonstandard quantum group U'_{-q^2}\mathfrak{so}_n. For N even, an analogous statement also holds for S=S_+\oplus S_- the direct sum of the irreducible spinor representations of U'_q\mathfrak{so}_N, with the commutant given by U'_{-q}\mathfrak{o}_n, a \mathbb{Z}/2-extension of U'_{-q}\mathfrak{so}_n. Similar statements also hold for fusion tensor categories with q a root of unity.
