The affine Hecke algebra \dot H_n of type A is often presented as a quotient of the braid algebra of n-braids in the annulus. This leads to diagrammatic representations in terms of braids in the annulus, subject to a quadratic relation for the simple Artin braids, as in the description by Graham and Lehrer in \cite{GL03}.   I show here that the use of more general framed oriented n-tangle diagrams in the annulus, subject to the Homfly skein relations, produces an algebra which is isomorphic to \dot H_n with an extended ring of coefficients. This setting allows the use of some attractive diagrams for elements of \dot H_n, using closed curves as well as braids, and gives neat pictures for its central elements.
