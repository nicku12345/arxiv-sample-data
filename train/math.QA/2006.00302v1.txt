A class of classical affine W-algebras are shown to be isomorphic as differential algebras to the coordinate rings of double coset spaces of certain prounipotent proalgebraic groups. As an application, integrable Hamiltonian hierarchies associated with them are constructed geometrically, generalizing the corresponding result of Feigin-Frenkel and Enriquez-Frenkel for the principal cases.
