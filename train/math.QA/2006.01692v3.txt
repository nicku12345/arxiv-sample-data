We introduce the notion of an oscillatory formal distribution supported at a point. We prove that a formal distribution is given by a formal oscillatory integral if and only if it is an oscillatory distribution that has a certain nondegeneracy property. We give an algorithm that recovers the jet of infinite order of the integral kernel of a formal oscillatory integral at the critical point from the corresponding formal distribution. We also prove that a star product \star on a Poisson manifold M is natural in the sense of Gutt and Rawnsley if and only if the formal distribution f \otimes g \mapsto (f \star g)(x) is oscillatory for every x \in M.
