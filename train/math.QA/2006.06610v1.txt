We summarize the definition of the Weyl groupoid in order to investigate quantum superalgebras. The Weyl groupoid of \mathfrak{sl}(2|1) is constructed to this end. We prove that in this case quantum superalgebras associated with Dynkin diagrams are isomorphic as superalgebras. It is shown how these quantum superalgebras considered as Hopf superalgebras are connected via twists and isomorphisms. We build a PBW basis for each quantum superalgebra, and investigate how quantum superalgebras are connected with their classical limits, i. e. Lie superbialgebras. We find explicit multiplicative formulas for universal R-matrices and describe relations between them for each realization.
