In this paper, for an arbitrary Kac-Moody Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} and a diagram automorphism \mu of \mathfrak{g} satisfying two linking conditions, we introduce and study a \mu-twisted quantum affinization algebra \mathcal{U}_{\hbar}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\mu) of \mathfrak{g}. When \mathfrak{g} is of finite type, \mathcal{U}_{\hbar}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\mu) is Drinfeld's current algebra realization of the twisted quantum affine algebra. And, when \mu=\mathrm{Id}, \mathcal{U}_{\hbar}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\mu) is the quantum affinization algebra introduced by Ginzburg-Kapranov-Vasserot. As the main results of this paper, we first prove a triangular decomposition of \mathcal{U}_{\hbar}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\mu). Second, we give a simple characterization of the affine quantum Serre relations on restricted \mathcal{U}_{\hbar}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\mu)-modules in terms of "normal order products". Third, we prove that the category of restricted \mathcal{U}_{\hbar}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\mu)-modules is a monoidal category and hence obtain a topological Hopf algebra structure on the "restricted completion" of \mathcal{U}_{\hbar}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\mu). Fourth, we study the classical limit of \mathcal{U}_{\hbar}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\mu) and abridge it to the quantization theory of extended affine Lie algebras. In particular, based on a classification result of Allison-Berman-Pianzola, we obtain the \hbar-deformation of nullity 2 extended affine Lie algebras.
