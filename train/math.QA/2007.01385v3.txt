By virtue of a novel formal geometric construction of the sheaf of Cherednik algebras from a previous work by the author we obtain results for the sheaves of Cherednik algebras, which until recently were viewed as intractable. First, for every orbit type stratum in a manifold X with an action by a finite group G, we define a trace density map for the Hochschild chain complex of the sheaf of Cherednik algebras, which generalizes the standard Engeli-Felder's trace density construction for the sheaf of differential operators. By means of these trace density maps we derive a quasi-isomorphism which computes the hypercohomology of the Hochschild chain complex \mathcal{C}_{\bullet} of the sheaf of formal Cherednik algebras. We show that its hypercohomology is isomorphic to the Chen-Ruan cohomology of the orbifold X/G with values in the field of Laurent series. We infer that the complex \mathcal{C}_{\bullet} has a well-defined Euler characteristic proportional to the topological Euler characteristic of X/G. Finally, we prove an algebraic index theorem for the algebra of global sections of the sheaf of formal Cherednik algebras.
