We study odd-dimensional modular tensor categories and maximally non-self dual (MNSD) modular tensor categories of low rank. We give lower bounds for the ranks of modular tensor categories in terms of the rank of the adjoint subcategory and the order of the group of invertible objects. As an application of these results, we prove that MNSD modular tensor categories of ranks 13 and 15 are pointed. In addition, we show that MNSD tensor categories of ranks 17, 19, 21 and 23 are either pointed or perfect.
