Let a reductive group G act on a smooth affine complex algebraic variety X. Let \mathfrak{g} be the Lie algebra of G and \mu:T^*(X)\to \mathfrak{g} be the moment map. If the moment map is flat, and for a generic character \chi:\mathfrak{g}\to\mathbb{C}, the action of G on \mu^{-1}(\chi) is free, then we show that for very generic characters \chi the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the ring of differential operators D(X) is simple.
