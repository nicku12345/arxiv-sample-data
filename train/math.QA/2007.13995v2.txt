We introduce higher level q-oscillator representations for the quantum affine (super)algebras of type C_n^{(1)},C^{(2)}(n+1) and B^{(1)}(0,n). These representations are constructed by applying the fusion procedure to the level one q-oscillator representations which were obtained through the studies of the tetrahedron equation. We prove that these higher level q-oscillator representations are irreducible. For type C_n^{(1)} and C^{(2)}(n+1), we compute their characters explicitly in terms of Schur polynomials.
