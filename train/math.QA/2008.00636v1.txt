We first determine the automorphism group of the twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro vertex operator algebra V_{\mathcal{L}}(\ell_{123},0).Then, for any integer t>1, we introduce a new Lie algebra \mathcal{L}_{t}, and show that \sigma_{t}-twisted V_{\mathcal{L}}(\ell_{123},0)(\ell_{2}=0)-modules are in one-to-one correspondence with restricted \mathcal{L}_{t}-modules of level \ell_{13}, where \sigma_{t} is an order t automorphism of V_{\mathcal{L}}(\ell_{123},0). At the end, we give a complete list of irreducible \sigma_{t}-twisted V_{\mathcal{L}}(\ell_{123},0)(\ell_{2}=0)-modules.
