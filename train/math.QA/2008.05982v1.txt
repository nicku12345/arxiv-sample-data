In this paper, we study (G,\chi_{\phi})-equivariant \phi-coordinated quasi modules for nonlocal vertex algebras. Among the main results, we establish several conceptual results, including a generalized commutator formula and a general construction of weak quantum vertex algebras and their (G,\chi_{\phi})-equivariant \phi-coordinated quasi modules. As an application, we also construct (equivariant) \phi-coordinated quasi modules for lattice vertex algebras by using Lepowsky's work on twisted vertex operators.
