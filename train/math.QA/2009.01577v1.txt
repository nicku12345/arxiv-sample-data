We show that the matrix embeddings in Bratteli diagrams are iterated direct sums of Hopf-Galois extensions (quantum principle bundles) for certain abelian groups. The corresponding strong universal connections are computed. We show that  M_{n}(\mathbb{C}) is a trivial quantum principle bundle for the Hopf algebra  \mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Z}_{n} \times \mathbb{Z}_{n}] . We conclude with an application relating known calculi on groups to calculi on matrices.
