In our previous publications we have introduced analogs of partial derivatives on the algebras U(gl(N)). In the present paper we compare two methods of introducing these analogs: via the so-called quantum doubles and by means of a coalgebraic structure. In the case N=2 we extend the quantum partial derivatives from U(u(2)) (the compact form of the algebra U(gl(2))) on a bigger algebra, constructed in two steps. First, we define the derivatives on a central extension of this algebra, then we prolongate them on some elements of the corresponding skew-field by using the Cayley-Hamilton identities for certain matrices with noncommutative entries. Eventual applications of this differential calculus are discussed.
