We use \cite{G} to study the algebra structure of twisted cotriangular Hopf algebras {}_J\mathcal{O}(G)_{J}, where J is a Hopf 2-cocycle for a connected nilpotent algebraic group G over \mathbb{C}. In particular, we show that {}_J\mathcal{O}(G)_{J} is an affine Noetherian domain with Gelfand-Kirillov dimension \dim(G), and that if G is unipotent and J is supported on G, then {}_J\mathcal{O}(G)_{J}\cong U(\g) as algebras, where \g={\rm Lie}(G). We also determine the finite dimensional irreducible representations of {}_J\mathcal{O}(G)_{J}, by analyzing twisted function algebras on (H,H)-double cosets of the support H\subset G of J. Finally, we work out several examples to illustrate our results.
