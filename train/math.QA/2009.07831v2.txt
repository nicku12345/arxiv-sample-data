For a finite group G, Turaev introduced the notion of a braided G-crossed fusion category. The classification of braided G-crossed extensions of braided fusion categories was studied by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik in terms of certain group cohomological data. In this paper we will define the notion of a G-crossed Frobenius \star-algebra and give a classification of (strict) G-crossed extensions of a commutative Frobenius \star-algebra R equipped with a given action of G, in terms of the second group cohomology H^2(G,R^\times). Now suppose that \mathcal{B} is a non-degenerate braided fusion category equipped with a braided action of a finite group G. We will see that the associated G-graded fusion ring is in fact a (strict) G-crossed Frobenius \star-algebra. We will describe this G-crossed fusion ring in terms of the classification of braided G-actions by Etingof, Nikshych, Ostrik and derive a Verlinde formula to compute its fusion coefficients.
