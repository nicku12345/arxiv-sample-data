For an abelian group  A , we study a close connection between braided crossed  A -categories with a trivialization of the  A -action and  A -graded braided tensor categories. Additionally, we prove that the obstruction to the existence of a trivialization of a categorical group action T on a monoidal category \mathcal{C} is given by an element O(T)\in H^2(G,\operatorname{Aut}_\otimes(\operatorname{Id}_{\mathcal{C}})). In the case that O(T)=0, the set of obstructions form a torsor over \operatorname{Hom}(G,\operatorname{Aut}_\otimes(\operatorname{Id}_{\mathcal{C}})), where \operatorname{Aut}_\otimes(\operatorname{Id}_{\mathcal{C}}) is the abelian group of tensor natural automorphisms of the identity.   The cohomological interpretation of trivializations, together with the homotopical classification of (faithfully graded) braided A-crossed tensor categories developed in arXiv:0909.3140, allows us to provide a method for the construction of faithfully A-graded braided tensor categories. We work out two examples. First, we compute the obstruction to the existence of trivializations for the braided crossed category associated with a pointed semisimple tensor category. In the second example, we compute explicit formulas for the braided \mathbb{Z}/2-crossed structures over Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories and, consequently, a conceptual interpretation of the results in arXiv:math/0011037 about the classification of braidings over Tambara-Yamagami categories.
