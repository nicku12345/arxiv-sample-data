We analyze the structure of the infinite jet algebra, or arc algebra, associated to level one Feigin-Stoyanovsky's principal subspaces. For A-series, we show that their Hilbert series can be computed either using the quantum dilogarithm or as certain generating functions over finite-dimensional representations of A-type quivers. In particular, we obtain new fermionic character formulas for level one A-type principal subspaces, which implies that they are classically free. We also analyze the infinite jet algebra of the principal subspace of the affine vertex algebra L_{1}(so(5)) and of L_{1}(so(8)). We give new conjectural expressions for their characters and provide strong evidence that they are also classically free.
