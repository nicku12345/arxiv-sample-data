We introduce analogues of the Fubini-Study metrics and the corresponding Levi-Civita connections on quantum projective spaces, following the approach of Beggs and Majid. We define the quantum metrics as two-tensors, symmetric in the appropriate sense, in terms of the differential calculi introduced by Heckenberger and Kolb. We define connections on these calculi and show that they are torsion free and cotorsion free, where the latter condition uses the quantum metric and is a weaker notion of metric compatibility.
