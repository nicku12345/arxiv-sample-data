We introduce left and right series of left semi-braces. This allows to define left and right nilpotent left semi-braces. We study the structure of such semi-braces and generalize some results, known for skew left braces, to left semi-braces. We study the structure of left semi-braces B such that the set of additive idempotents E is an ideal of B. Finally we introduce the concept of a nilpotent left semi-brace and we show that the multiplicative group of such semi-braces is nilpotent.
