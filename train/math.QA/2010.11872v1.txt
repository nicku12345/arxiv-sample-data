This paper is a contribution to the construction of non-semisimple modular categories. We show that, given such a modular category containing a modular subcategory the M\"uger centralizer is also modular. As a consequence, we obtain conditions under which relative monoidal centers give (non-semisimple) modular categories, and we also show that examples include representation categories of small quantum groups. We further derive conditions under which representations of more general quantum groups, braided Drinfeld doubles of Nichols algebras of diagonal type, give (non-semisimple) modular categories.
