In this note we prove an integral identity involving complex powers of generators of quantum group U_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}(3)) considered as certain positive operators in the setting of positive principal series representations. This identity represents a continuous analog of one of the Lusztig's relations between divided powers of generators of quantum groups, which play an important role in the study of irreducible modules \cite{Lu 1}. We also give definitions of arbitrary functions of U_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}(3)) generators and give another proofs for some of the known results concerning positive principal series representations of U_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}(3)).
