For any congruence subgroup \Gamma, we study the vertex operator algebra \Omega^{ch}(\mathbb H,\Gamma) constructed from the \Gamma-invariant global sections of the chiral de Rham complex on the upper half plane, which are holomorphic at all the cusps. We introduce an SL(2,\mathbb R)-invariant filtration on the global sections and show that the \Gamma-invariants on the graded algebra is isomorphic to certain copies of modular forms. We also give an explicit formula for the lifting of modular forms to \Omega^{ch}(\mathbb H,\Gamma) and compute the character formula of \Omega^{ch}(\mathbb H,\Gamma). Furthermore, we show that the vertex algebra structure modifies the Rankin-Cohen bracket, and the modified bracket becomes non-zero between constant modular forms involving the Eisenstein series.
