We study the simple Bershadsky-Polyakov algebra \mathcal W_k = \mathcal{W}_k(sl_3,f_{\theta}) at positive integer levels and classify their irreducible modules. In this way we confirm the conjecture from arXiv:1910.13781. Next, we study the case k=1. We discover that this vertex algebra has a Kazama-Suzuki-type dual isomorphic to the simple afine vertex superalgebra L_{k'} (osp(1 \vert 2)) for k'=-5/4. Using the free-field realization of L_{k'} (osp(1 \vert 2)) from arXiv:1711.11342, we get a free-field realization of \mathcal W_k and their highest weight modules. In a sequel, we plan to study fusion rules for \mathcal W_k.
