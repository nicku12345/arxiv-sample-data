Employing the algebraic structure of the left brace and the dynamical extensions of cycle sets, we investigate a class of indecomposable involutive set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation having specific imprimitivity blocks. Moreover, we study one-generator left braces of multipermutation level 2.
