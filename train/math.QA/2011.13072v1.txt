By using the ideas of Feigin and Stoyanovsky and Calinescu, Lepowsky and Milas we introduce and study the principal subspaces associated with the Etingof-Kazhdan quantum affine vertex algebra of integer level k\geqslant 1 and type A_1^{(1)}. We show that the principal subspaces possess the quantum vertex algebra structure, which turns to the usual vertex algebra structure of the principal subspaces of generalized Verma and standard modules at the classical limit. Moreover, we find their topological quasi-particle bases which correspond to the sum sides of certain Rogers-Ramanujan-type identities.
