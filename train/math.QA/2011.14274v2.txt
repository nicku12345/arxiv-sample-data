The Suzuki algebra A_{Nn}^{\mu \lambda} was introduced by Suzuki Satoshi in 1998, which is a class of cosemisimple Hopf algebras. In this paper, the author gives a complete set of simple Yetter-Drinfeld modules over the Suzuki algebra A_{N\,2n}^{\mu\lambda} and investigates the Nichols algebras over those simple Yetter-Drinfeld modules. The involved finite dimensional Nichols algebras of diagonal type are of Cartan type A_1, A_1\times A_1, A_2, Super type {A}_{2}(q;I_2) and the Nichols algebra \mathfrak{ufo}(8). And the 4m and m^2-dimensional Nichols algebras which discovered in \cite[section 3.7]{Andruskiewitsch2018} can be realized in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over A_{Nn}^{\mu \lambda}. Furthermore, we obtain that \dim\mathfrak{B}(V_{abe})=\infty under the condition b^2=(ae)^{-1}, b\in\Bbb{G}_{m} for m\geq 5, by using a result of Masuoka.
