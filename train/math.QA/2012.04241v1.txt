We generalize the FRT construction for the quiver-theoretical quantum Yang-Baxter equation and obtain a left bialgebroid \mathfrak{A}(w). There are some relations between the left bialgebroid  \mathfrak{A}(w) and a left bialgebroid A_{\sigma} by the FRT construction for the dynamical Yang-Baxter map.
