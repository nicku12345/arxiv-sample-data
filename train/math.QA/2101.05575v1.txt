Given a \mathrm{II}_1 subfactor N \subset M with finite index, we prove the existence of a universal Hopf \ast-algebra (or, a discrete quantum group in the analytic language) which acts on M such that the action preserves the canonical trace of M and N is in the fixed point subalgebra for the action. We call this Hopf \ast-algebra the quantum Galois group for the subfactor and compute it in some examples of interest, notably an arbitrary irreducible finite index depth two subfactor of type \mathrm{II}_1.
