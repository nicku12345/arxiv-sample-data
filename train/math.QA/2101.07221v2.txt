Given a tame differential calculus over a noncommutative algebra \mathcal{A} and an \mathcal{A}-bilinear pseudo-Riemannian metric g_0, consider the conformal deformation  g = k. g_0,  k being an invertible element of \mathcal{A}.We prove that there exists a unique connection \nabla on the bimodule of one-forms of the differential calculus which is torsionless and compatible with g. We derive a concrete formula connecting \nabla and the Levi-Civita connection for the pseudo-Riemannian metric g_0. As an application, we compute the Ricci and scalar curvature for a general conformal perturbation of the canonical metric on the noncommutative 2-torus as well as for a natural metric on the quantum Heisenberg manifold. For the latter, the scalar curvature turns out to be a negative constant.
