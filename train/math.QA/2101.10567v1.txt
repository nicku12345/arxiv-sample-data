In this paper, we investigate the Lie algebra structures of weight one subspaces of C_2-cofinite vertex operator superalgebras. We also show that for any positive integer k, vertex operator superalgebras L_{sl(1|n+1)}(k,0) and L_{osp(2|2n)}(k,0) have infinitely many irreducible admissible modules. As a consequence, we give a proof of the fact that L_{\mathfrak g}(k,0) is C_2-cofinite if and only if \mathfrak g is either a simple Lie algebra, or \mathfrak g=osp(1|2n), and k is a nonnegative integer. As an application, we show that L_{G(3)}(1,0) is a vertex operator superalgebra such that the category of L_{G(3)}(1,0)-modules is semisimple but L_{G(3)}(1,0) is not C_2-cofinite.
