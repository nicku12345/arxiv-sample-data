For the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group {\rm U}_q(\mathfrak{g}) associated with a simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}, we construct explicit generators of the centre Z({\rm U}_q(\mathfrak{g})), and determine the relations satisfied by the generators. For \mathfrak{g} of type A_n(n\geq 2), D_{2k+1}(k\geq 2) or E_6, the centre Z({\rm U}_q(\mathfrak{g})) is isomorphic to a quotient of a polynomial algebra in multiple variables, which is described in a uniform manner for all cases. For \mathfrak{g} of any other type, Z({\rm U}_q(\mathfrak{g})) is generated by n=rank(\mathfrak{g}) algebraically independent elements.
