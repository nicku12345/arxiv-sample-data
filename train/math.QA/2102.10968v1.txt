In this paper, we study nullity-2 toroidal extended affine Lie algebras in the context of   vertex algebras and their \phi-coordinated modules. Among the main results, we introduce a variant of   toroidal extended affine Lie algebras, associate vertex algebras to the variant Lie algebras, and   establish a canonical connection between modules for toroidal extended affine Lie algebras and   \phi-coordinated modules for these vertex algebras. Furthermore, by employing some results of Billig,   we obtain an explicit realization of irreducible modules for the variant Lie algebras.
