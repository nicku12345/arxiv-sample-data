Let V_{L} be the vertex algebra associated to a non-degenerate even lattice L, \theta the automorphism of V_{L} induced from the -1-isometry of L, and V_{L}^{+} the fixed point subalgebra of V_{L} under the action of \theta. In this series of papers, we classify the irreducible weak V_{L}^{+}-modules and show that any irreducible weak V_{L}^{+}-module is isomorphic to a weak submodule of some irreducible weak V_{L}-module or to a submodule of some irreducible \theta-twisted V_{L}-module.   In this paper (Part 1), we show that when the rank of L is 1, every non-zero weak V_{L}^{+}-module contains a non-zero M(1)^{+}-module, where M(1)^{+} is the fixed point subalgebra of the Heisenberg vertex operator algebra M(1) under the action of \theta.
