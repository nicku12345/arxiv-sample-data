In this paper, the author gives a complete set of simple Yetter-Drinfeld modules over Suzuki algebra A_{N\,2n+1}^{\mu\lambda} and investigates the Nichols algebras over those irreducible Yetter-Drinfeld modules. The finite dimensional Nichols algebras of diagonal type are of Cartan type A_1, A_1\times A_1, A_2, Super type {A}_{2}(q;I_2) and the Nichols algebra \mathfrak{ufo}(8). And the involved finite dimensional Nichols algebras of non-diagonal type are 12, 4m and m^2 dimensional. The left three unsolved cases are set as open problems.
