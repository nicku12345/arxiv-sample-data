We investigate the Nichols algebra \mathfrak{B}(V_{abe}) which are from the Yetter-Drinfeld category of Suzuki algebras. The 4n and n^2 dimensional Nichols algebras, first appeared in \cite{Andruskiewitsch2018}, are obtained again via a different method. And the connection between the Nichols algebra \mathfrak{B}(V_{abe}) and a class of combinatorial numbers on the subgroups of symmetric groups is established.
