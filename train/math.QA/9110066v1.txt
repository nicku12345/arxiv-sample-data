We establish a previously conjectured connection between p-adics and quantum groups. We find in Sklyanin's two parameter elliptic quantum algebra and its generalizations, the conceptual basis for the Macdonald polynomials, which ``interpolate'' between the zonal spherical functions of related real and p\--adic symmetric spaces. The elliptic quantum algebras underlie the Z_n\--Baxter models. We show that in the n \air \infty limit, the Jost function for the scattering of {\em first} level excitations in the Z_n\--Baxter model coincides with the Harish\--Chandra\--like c\--function constructed from the Macdonald polynomials associated to the root system A_1. The partition function of the Z_2\--Baxter model itself is also expressed in terms of this Macdonald\--Harish\--Chandra\ c\--function, albeit in a less simple way. We relate the two parameters q and t of the Macdonald polynomials to the anisotropy and modular parameters of the Baxter model. In particular the p\--adic ``regimes'' in the Macdonald polynomials correspond to a discrete sequence of XXZ models. We also discuss the possibility of ``q\--deforming'' Euler products.
