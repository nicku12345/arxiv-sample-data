These theories, which are surely some of the simplest possible quantum field theories, were introduced in a paper of Dijkgraaf and Witten. The path integral reduces to a finite sum, so it is quite amenable to direct mathematical study. Although the theory exisits in arbitrary dimensions, it is most interesting in 2+1~dimensions, where it has a ``modular structure.'' This is related to quantum groups, and the precise details may give clues as to what happens in other contexts.
