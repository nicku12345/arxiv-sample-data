The q--deformation U_q (h_4) of the harmonic oscillator algebra is defined and proved to be a Ribbon Hopf algebra.Associated with this Hopf algebra we define an infinite dimensional braid group representation on the Hilbert space of the harmonic oscillator, and an extended Yang--Baxter system in the sense of Turaev. The corresponding link invariant is computed in some particular cases and coincides with the inverse of the Alexander--Conway polynomial. The R matrix of U_q (h_4) can be interpreted as defining a baxterization of the intertwiners for semicyclic representations of SU(2)_q at q=e^{2 \pi i/N} in the N \rightarrow \infty limit.Finally we define new multicolored braid group representations and study their relation to the multivariable Alexander--Conway polynomial.
