We study the irreducible unitary highest weight representations, which are obtained from free field realizations, of W infinity algebras (W_{\infty}, W_{1+\infty}, W_{\infty}^{1,1}, W_{\infty}^M, W_{1+\infty}^N, W_{\infty}^{M,N}) with central charges (2, 1, 3, 2M, N, 2M+N). The characters of these representations are computed. We construct a new extended superalgebra W_{\infty}^{M,N}, whose bosonic sector is W_{\infty}^M\oplus W_{1+\infty}^N. Its representations obtained from a free field realization with central charge 2M+N, are classified into two classes: continuous series and discrete series. For the former there exists a supersymmetry, but for the latter a supersymmetry exists only for M=N.
