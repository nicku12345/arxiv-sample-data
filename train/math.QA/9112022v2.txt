We derive fusion rules for the composition of q-deformed classical representations (arising in tensor products of the fundamental representation) with semi-periodic representations of SL(N)_q at roots of unity. We obtain full reducibility into semi-periodic representations. On the other hand, heterogeneous \cR-matrices which intertwine tensor products of periodic or semi-periodic representations with q-deformed classical representations are given. These \cR-matrices satisfy all the possible Yang Baxter equations with one another and, when they exist, with the \cR-matrices intertwining homogeneous tensor products of periodic or semi-periodic representations. This compatibility between these two kinds of representations has never been used in physical models.
