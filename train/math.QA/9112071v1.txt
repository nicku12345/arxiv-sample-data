We show how the Turaev--Viro invariant can be understood within the framework of Chern--Simons theory with gauge group SU(2). We also describe a new invariant for certain class of graphs by interpreting the triangulation of a manifold as a graph consisiting of crossings and vertices with three lines. We further show, for S^3 and RP^3, that the Turaev-Viro invariant is the square of the absolute value of their respective partition functions in SU(2) Chern--Simons theory and give a method of evaluating the later in a closed form for lens spaces L_{p,1}.
