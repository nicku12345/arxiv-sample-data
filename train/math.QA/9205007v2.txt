In Rovelli and Smolin's loop representation of nonperturbative quantum gravity in 4 dimensions, there is a space of solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint having as a basis isotopy classes of links in R^3. The physically correct inner product on this space of states is not yet known, or in other words, the *-algebra structure of the algebra of observables has not been determined. In order to approach this problem, we consider a larger space H of solutions of the Hamiltonian constraint, which has as a basis isotopy classes of tangles. A certain algebra T, the ``tangle algebra,'' acts as operators on H. The ``empty state'', corresponding to the class of the empty tangle, is conjectured to be a cyclic vector for T. We construct simpler representations of T as quotients of H by the skein relations for the HOMFLY polynomial, and calculate a *-algebra structure for T using these representations. We use this to determine the inner product of certain states of quantum gravity associated to the Jones polynomial (or more precisely, Kauffman bracket).
