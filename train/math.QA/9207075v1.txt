Quantum superalgebras su_{q}(m\mid n) are studied in the framework of R-matrix formalism. Explicit parametrization of L^{(+)} and L^{(-)} matrices in terms of su_{q}(m\mid n) generators are presented. We also show that quantum deformation of nonsimple superalgebra su(n\mid n) requires its extension to u(n\mid n).
