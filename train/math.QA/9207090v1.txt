We show that multivariable colored link invariants are derived from the roots of unity representations of U_q(g). We propose a property of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of U_q(g), which is important for defining the invariants of colored links. For U_q(sl_2) we explicitly prove the property, and then construct invariants of colored links and colored ribbon graphs, which generalize the multivariable Alexander polynomial.
