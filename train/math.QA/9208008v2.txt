Braided groups and braided matrices are novel algebraic structures living in braided or quasitensor categories. As such they are a generalization of super-groups and super-matrices to the case of braid statistics. Here we construct braided group versions of the standard quantum groups U_q(g). They have the same FRT generators l^\pm but a matrix braided-coproduct \und\Delta L=L\und\tens L where L=l^+Sl^-, and are self-dual. As an application, the degenerate Sklyanin algebra is shown to be isomorphic to the braided matrices BM_q(2); it is a braided-commutative bialgebra in a braided category. As a second application, we show that the quantum double D(\usl) (also known as the `quantum Lorentz group') is the semidirect product as an algebra of two copies of \usl, and also a semidirect product as a coalgebra if we use braid statistics. We find various results of this type for the doubles of general quantum groups and their semi-classical limits as doubles of the Lie algebras of Poisson Lie groups.
