We introduce a large class of bicovariant differential calculi on any quantum group A, associated to Ad-invariant elements. For example, the deformed trace element on SL_q(2) recovers Woronowicz' 4D_\pm calculus. More generally, we obtain a sequence of differential calculi on each quantum group A(R), based on the theory of the corresponding braided groups B(R). Here R is any regular solution of the QYBE.
