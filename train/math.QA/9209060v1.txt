The physical interpretation of the main notions of the quantum group theory (coproduct, representations and corepresentations, action and coaction) is discussed using the simplest examples of q-deformed objects (quantum group F_q(GL(2)), quantum algebra sl_q(2), q-oscillator and F_q-covariant algebra.) Appropriate reductions of the covariant algebra of second rank q-tensors give rise to the algebras of the q-oscillator and the q-sphere. A special covariant algebra related to the reflection equation corresponds to the braid group in a space with nontrivial topology.
