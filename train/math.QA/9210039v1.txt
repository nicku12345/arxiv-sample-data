Using a geometrical approach to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, the quantum algebra {\cal U}_{\hbar}(sl_{2}) and its universal quantum R-matrix are explicitely constructed as functionals of the associated classical r-matrix. In this framework, the quantum algebra {\cal U}_{\hbar}(sl_{2}) is naturally imbedded in the universal envelopping algebra of the sl_{2} current algebra.
