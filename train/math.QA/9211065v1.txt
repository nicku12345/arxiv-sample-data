We consider the relations of generalized commutativity in the algebra of formal series  M_q (x^i ) , which conserve a tensor  I_q -grading and depend on parameters  q(i,k)  . We choose the  I_q -preserving version of differential calculus on  M_q . A new construction of the symmetrized tensor product for  M_q -type algebras and the corresponding definition of minimally deformed linear group  QGL(n)  and Lie algebra  qgl(n)  are proposed. We study the connection of  QGL(n)  and  qgl(n)  with the special matrix algebra  \mbox{Mat} (n,Q)  containing matrices with noncommutative elements. A definition of the deformed determinant in the algebra  \mbox{Mat} (n,Q)  is given. The exponential parametrization in the algebra  \mbox{Mat} (n,Q)  is considered on the basis of Campbell-Hausdorf formula.
