We show that the coefficients of decomposition into an irreducible components of the tensor powers of level r symmetric algebra of adjoint representation coincide with the Verlinder numbers. Also we construct (for sl(2)) the representations of a general linear group those dimensions are given by corresponding Verlinde's numbers.
