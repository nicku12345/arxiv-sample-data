For every partition of a positive integer n in k parts and every point of an infinite Grassmannian we obtain a solution of the k component differential-difference KP hierarchy and a corresponding Baker function. A partition of n also determines a vertex operator construction of the fundamental representations of the infinite matrix algebra gl_\infty and hence a \tau function. We use these fundamental representations to study the Gauss decomposition in the infinite matrix group Gl_\infty and to express the Baker function in terms of \tau-functions. The reduction to loop algebras is discussed.
