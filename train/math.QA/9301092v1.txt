Star products on the classical double group of a simple Lie group and on corresponding symplectic grupoids are given so that the quantum double and the "quantized tangent bundle" are obtained in the deformation description. "Complex" quantum groups and bicovariant quantum Lie algebras are discused from this point of view. Further we discuss the quantization of the Poisson structure on symmetric algebra S(g) leading to the quantized enveloping algebra U_{h}(g) as an example of biquantization in the sense of Turaev. Description of U_{h}(g) in terms of the generators of the bicovariant differential calculus on F(G_q) is very convenient for this purpose. Finally we interpret in the deformation framework some well known properties of compact quantum groups as simple consequences of corresponding properties of classical compact Lie groups. An analogue of the classical Kirillov's universal character formula is given for the unitary irreducible representation in the compact case.
