Braided differential operators \del^i are obtained by differentiating the addition law on the braided covector spaces introduced previously (such as the braided addition law on the quantum plane). These are affiliated to a Yang-Baxter matrix R. The quantum eigenfunctions \exp_R(\vecx|\vecv) of the \del^i (braided-plane waves) are introduced in the free case where the position components x_i are totally non-commuting. We prove a braided R-binomial theorem and a braided-Taylors theorem \exp_R(\veca|\del)f(\vecx)=f(\veca+\vecx). These various results precisely generalise to a generic R-matrix (and hence to n-dimensions) the well-known properties of the usual 1-dimensional q-differential and q-exponential. As a related application, we show that the q-Heisenberg algebra px-qxp=1 is a braided semidirect product \C[x]\cocross \C[p] of the braided line acting on itself (a braided Weyl algebra). Similarly for its generalization to an arbitrary R-matrix.
