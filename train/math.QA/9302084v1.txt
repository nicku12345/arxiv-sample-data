The most general R-matrix type state sum model for link invariants is constructed. It contains in itself all R-matrix invariants and is a generating function for "universal" Vassiliev link invariants. This expression is more simple than Kontsevich's expression for the same quantity, because it is defined combinatorially and does not contain any integrals, except for an expression for "the universal Drinfeld's associator".
