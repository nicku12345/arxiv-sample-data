Semi-infinite cohomology is constructed from scratch as the proper generalization of finite dimensional Lie algebra cohomology. The differential d and other operators are realized as universal inner deri- vations of a completed algebra, which acts on any appropriate semi-infinite complex. In particular, d is shown to be the unique derivation satisfying the "Cartan identity" and certain natural degree conditions. The proof that d is square-zero may well be the shortest (arguably, the only) one in print.
