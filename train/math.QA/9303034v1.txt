Classical W-algebras in higher dimensions have been recently constructed. In this letter we show that there is a finitely generated subalgebra which is isomorphic to the algebra of local diffeomorphisms in D dimensions. Moreover, there is a tower of infinitely many fields transforming under this subalgebra as symmetric tensorial one-densities. We also unravel a structure isomorphic to the Schouten symmetric bracket, providing a natural generalization of w_\infty in higher dimensions.
