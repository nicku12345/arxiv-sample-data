Let U_q(\hat{\cal G}) denote the quantized affine Lie algebra and U_q({\cal G}^{(1)}) the quantized {\em nontwisted} affine Lie algebra. Let {\cal O}_{\rm fin} be the category defined in section 3. We show that when the deformation parameter q is not a root of unit all integrable representations of U_q(\hat{\cal G}) in the category {\cal O}_{\rm fin} are completely reducible and that every integrable irreducible highest weight module over U_q({\cal G}^{(1)}) corresponding to q>0 is equivalent to a unitary module.
