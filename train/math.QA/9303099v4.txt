We calculate a large k asymptotic expansion of the exact surgery formula for Witten's SU(2) invariant of Seifert manifolds. The contributions of all flat connections are identified. An agreement with the 1-loop formula is checked. A contribution of the irreducible connections appears to contain only a finite number of terms in the asymptotic series. A 2-loop correction to the contribution of the trivial connection is found to be proportional to Casson's invariant.
