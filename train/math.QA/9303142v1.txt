We formulate a conjecture, stating that the algebra of n pairs of deformed Bose creation and annihilation operators is a factor-algebra of U_q[osp(1/2n)], considered as a Hopf algebra, and prove it for n=2 case. To this end we show that for any value of q U_q[osp(1/4)] can be viewed as a superalgebra, freely generated by two pairs B_1^\pm, B_2^\pm of deformed para-Bose operators. We write down all Hopf algebra relations, an analogue of the Cartan-Weyl basis, the "commutation" relations between the generators and a basis in U_q[osp(1/2n)] entirely in terms of B_1^\pm, B_2^\pm.
