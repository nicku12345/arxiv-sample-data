Recent work on the classification of conformal field theories with one primary field (the identity operator) is reviewed. The classification of such theories is an essential step in the program of classification of all rational conformal field theories, but appears impossible in general. The last managable case, central charge 24, is considered here. We found a total of 71 such theories (which have not all been constructed yet) including the monster module. The complete list of modular invariant partition functions has already appeared elsewhere \SchM. This paper contains an easily readable account of the method, as well as a few examples and some comments. (This is a compilation of contributions to workshops in Goteborg, Kiev, Corfu and Erice).
