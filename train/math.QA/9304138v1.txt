The Askey-Wilson algebra AW(3) with three generators is shown to serve as a hidden symmetry algebra underlying the Racah and (new) generalized Clebsch-Gordan problems for the quantum algebra sl_q(2). On the base of this hidden symmetry a simple method to calculate corresponding coefficients in terms of the Askey-Wilson polynomials is proposed.
