Let U_q(\hat{\cal G}) be a quantized affine Lie algebra. It is proven that the universal R-matrix R of U_q(\hat{\cal G}) satisfies the celebrated conjugation relation R^\dagger=TR with T the usual twist map. As applications, braid generators are shown to be diagonalizable on arbitrary tensor product modules of integrable irreducible highest weight U_q(\hat{\cal G})-module and a spectral decomposition formula for the braid generators is obtained which is the generalization of Reshetikhin's and Gould's forms to the present affine case. Casimir invariants are constructed and their eigenvalues computed by means of the spectral decomposition formula. As a by-product, an interesting identity is found.
