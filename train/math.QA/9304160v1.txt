The first ``Convegno Informale su Quantum Groups'' was held in Florence from February 3 to 6, 1993. This Convegno was conceived as an informal meeting to bring together all the italian people working in the field of quantum groups and related topics. We are very happy indeed that about 30 theoretical physicists decided to take part presenting many aspects of this interesting and live subject of research. We thank all the participants for the stimulating and nice atmosphere that has characterized the meeting. This paper has the intent to give a quick review in english of the contributions and related references. We think useful to include the complete addresses and coordinate data of the participants. It is our intention to diffuse these proceedings by e-mail trough electronic data banks.
