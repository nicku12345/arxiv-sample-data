A general formula for physical observables in Chern-Simons theory with an arbitrary compact Lie group G, on an arbitrary closed oriented three-dimensional manifold \cM is derived in terms of vacuum expectation values of Wilson loops in {\cal S}^3. Surgery presentation of \cM and the Kirby moves are implemented as the main ingredients of the approach. The case of G={\rm SU}(n) is explicitly calculated.
