It is shown that the finite dimensional irreducible representaions of the quantum matrix algebra  M_{ q,p}(2)  ( the coordinate ring of  GL_{q,p}(2) ) exist only when both q and p are roots of unity. In this case th e space of states has either the topology of a torus or a cylinder which may be thought of as generalizations of cyclic representations.
