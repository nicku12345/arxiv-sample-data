Quantum de Rham complexes on the quantum plane and the quantum group itself are constructed for the Zakrewski deformation of  Fun ( SL(2)) . As a by-product a new deformation of the two dimensional Heisenberg algeb ra is constructed which can be used to construct models of h-deformed quantum mechanics.
