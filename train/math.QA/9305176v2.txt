To construct a quantum group gauge theory one needs an algebra which is invariant under gauge transformations. The existence of this invariant algebra is closely related with the existence of a differential algebra \delta _{{\cal H}} G_{q} compatible with the Hopf algebra structure. It is shown that \delta _{{\cal H}} G_{q} exists only for the quantum group U_{q}(N) and that the quantum group SU_q(N) as a quantum gauge group is not allowed. The representations of the algebra \delta _{{\cal H}} G_{q} are con- structed. The operators corresponding to the differentials are realized via derivations on the space of all irreducible *-representations of U_q(2). With the help of this construction infinitesimal gauge transformations in two-dimensional classical space-time are described.
