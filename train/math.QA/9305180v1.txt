Representations of Quantum Groups U_q (g_n), g_n any semi simple Lie algebra of rank n, are constructed from arbitrary representations of rank n-1 quantum groups for q a root of unity. Representations which have the maximal dimension and number of free parameters for irreducible representations arise as special cases.
