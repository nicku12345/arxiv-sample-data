A method is developed to construct irreducible representations(irreps) of the quantum supergroup U_q(C(n+1)) in a systematic fashion. It is shown that every finite dimensional irrep of this quantum supergroup at generic q is a deformation of a finite dimensional irrep of its underlying Lie superalgebra C(n+1), and is essentially uniquely characterized by a highest weight. The character of the irrep is given. When q is a root of unity, all irreps of U_q(C(n+1)) are finite dimensional; multiply atypical highest weight irreps and (semi)cyclic irreps also exist. As examples, all the highest weight and (semi)cyclic irreps of U_q(C(2)) are thoroughly studied.
