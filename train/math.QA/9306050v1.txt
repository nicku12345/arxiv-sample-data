We examine the problem of determining which representations of the braid group on a Riemann surface are carried by the wave function of a quantized Abelian Chern-Simons theory interacting with non-dynamical matter. We generalize the quantization of Chern-Simons theory to the case where the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term, k, is rational, the Riemann surface has arbitrary genus and the total matter charge is non-vanishing. We find an explicit solution of the Schr\"odinger equation. We find that the wave functions carry a representation of the braid group as well as a projective representation of the discrete group of large gauge transformations. We find a fundamental constraint which relates the charges of the particles, q_i, the coefficient k and the genus of the manifold, g.
