The method of geometrical quantization of symplectic manifolds is applied to constructing infinite dimensional irreducible unitary representations of the algebra of functions on the compact quantum group SU_q(2). A formulation of the method for the general case SU_q(n) is suggested. (This work is the English version of the article submitted for publication in Algebra Analiz.)
