Using the previous obtained universal R-matrix for the quantized nontwisted affine Lie algebras U_q(A_1^{(1)}) and U_q(A_2^{(1)}), we determine the explicitly spectral-dependent universal R-matrix for the corresponding quantum Lie algebras U_q(A_1) and U_q(A_2). As their applications, we reproduce the well-known results in the fundamental representations and we also derive an extreamly explicit formula of the spectral-dependent R-matrix for the adjoint representation of U_q(A_2), the simplest non-trival case when the tensor product decomposition of the representation with itself has finite multiplicity.
