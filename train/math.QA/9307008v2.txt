This paper is an extended version of our previous short letter \cite{ZG2} and is attempted to give a detailed account for the results presented in that paper. Let U_q({\cal G}^{(1)}) be the quantized nontwisted affine Lie algebra and U_q({\cal G}) be the corresponding quantum simple Lie algebra. Using the previous obtained universal R-matrix for U_q(A_1^{(1)}) and U_q(A_2^{(1)}), we determine the explicitly spectral-dependent universal R-matrix for U_q(A_1) and U_q(A_2). We apply these spectral-dependent universal R-matrix to some concrete representations. We then reproduce the well-known results for the fundamental representations and we are also able to derive for the first time the extreamly explicit and compact formula of the spectral-dependent R-matrix for the adjoint representation of U_q(A_2), the simplest nontrival case when the tensor product of the representations is {\em not} multiplicity-free.
