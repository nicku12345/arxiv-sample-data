We argue that the algebra W_q(n), generated by n pairs of deformed q-bosons, does not allow a Hopfalgebra structure. To this end we show that it is impossible to define a comultiplication even for the usual, nondeformed case. We indicate how the comultiplication on U_q[osp(1/2n)] can be used in order to construct representations of deformed (not necessarily Hopf) algebras in tensor products of Fock spaces.
