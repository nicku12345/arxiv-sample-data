A method for obtaining complex analytic realizations for a class of deformed algebras based on their respective deformation mappings and their ordinary coherent states is introduced. Explicit results of such realizations are provided for the cases of the q-oscillators (q-Weyl-Heisenberg algebra) and for the su_{q}(2) and su_{q}(1,1) algebras and their co-products. They are given in terms of a series in powers of ordinary derivative operators which act on the Bargmann-Hilbert space of functions endowed with the usual integration measure. In the q\rightarrow 1 limit these realizations reduce to the usual analytic Bargmann realizations for the three algebras.
