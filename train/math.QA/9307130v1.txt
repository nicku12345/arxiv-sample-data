We study the algebra B_q(\ge) presented by Kashiwara and introduce intertwiners similar to q-vertex operators. We show that a matrix determined by 2-point functions of the intertwiners coincides with a quantum R-matrix (up to a diagonal matrix) and give the commutation relations of the intertwiners. We also introduce an analogue of the universal R-matrix for the Kashiwara algebra.
