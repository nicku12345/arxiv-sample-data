We consider two different types of deformations for the linear group  GL(n) which correspond to using of a general diagonal R-matrix. Relations between braided and quantum deformed algebras and their coactions on a quantum plane are discussed. We show that tensor-grading-preserving differential calculi can be constructed on braided groups , quantum groups and quantum planes for the case of the diagonal R-matrix.
