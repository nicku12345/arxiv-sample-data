By considering `coloured' braid group representation we have obtained a quantum group, which reduces to the standard GL_q(2) and GL_{p,q}(2) cases at some particular limits of the `colour' parameters. In spite of quite complicated nature, all of these new quantum group relations can be expressed neatly in the Heisenberg-Weyl form, for a nontrivial choice of the basis elements. Furthermore, it is possible to associate invariant Manin planes, parametrised by the `colour' variables, with such quantum group structure.
