The recently obtained results in \cite{ZG2} are used to compute the explicitly spectral-dependent R-matrix (or the intertwiners) on V_{(6)}(x)\otimes V_{(6)}(y) and V_{(3)}(x)\otimes V_{(6)}(y), where V_{(6)} and V_{(3)} are the 6-dimensional and fundamental representations of U_q(A_2), respectively. It appears that the R-matrix on V_{(3)}(x)\otimes V_{(6)}(y) depends on q in the different way from what one might usually think: q occurs in the R-matrix in fractional powers. It seems to be the first example in literatures of R-matrix with the new feature.
