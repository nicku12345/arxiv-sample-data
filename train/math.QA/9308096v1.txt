Considering a multi-dimensional q-oscillator invariant under the (non quantum) group U(n), we construct a q-deformed Levi-Civita epsilon tensor from the inner product states. The invariance of this q-epsilon tensor is shown to yield the quantum group SL_{q}(n) and establishes the relationship of the U(n) invariant q-oscillator to quantum groups and quantum group related oscillators. Furthermore the q-epsilon tensor provides the connection between SL_{q}(n) and the volume element of the quantum hyper plane.
