We introduce an addition law for the usual quantum matrices A(R) by means of a coaddition \underline{\Delta} t=t\otimes 1+1\otimes t. It supplements the usual comultiplication \Delta t=t\otimes t and together they obey a codistributivity condition. The coaddition does not form a usual Hopf algebra but a braided one. The same remarks apply for rectangular m\times n quantum matrices. As an application, we construct left-invariant vector fields on A(R) and other quantum spaces. They close in the form of a braided Lie algebra. As another application, the wave-functions in the lattice approximation of Kac-Moody algebras and other lattice fields can be added and functionally differentiated.
