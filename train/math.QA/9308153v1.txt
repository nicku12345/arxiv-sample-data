We classify positive energy representations with finite degeneracies of the Lie algebra W_{1+\infty}\/ and construct them in terms of representation theory of the Lie algebra \hatgl ( \infty R_m )\/ of infinite matrices with finite number of non-zero diagonals over the algebra R_m = \C [ t ] / ( t^{m + 1} )\/. The unitary ones are classified as well. Similar results are obtained for the sin-algebras.
