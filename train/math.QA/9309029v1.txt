We discuss multivariable invariants of colored links associated with the N-dimensional root of unity representation of the quantum group. The invariants for N>2 are generalizations of the multi-variable Alexander polynomial. The invariants vanish for disconnected links. We review the definition of the invariants through (1,1)-tangles. When (N,3)=1 and N is odd, the invariant does not vanish for the parallel link (cable) of the knot 3_1, while the Alexander polynomial vanishes for the cable link.
