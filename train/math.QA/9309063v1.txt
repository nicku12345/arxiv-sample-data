We provide an explicit formula for the invariant of 4-manifolds introduced by Crane and Yetter (in hep-th 9301062). A consequence of our result is the existence of a combinatorial formula for the signature of a 4-manifold in terms of local data from a triangulation. Potential physical applications of our result exist in light of the fact that the Crane-Yetter invariant is a rigorous version of ideas of Ooguri on B wedge F theory.
