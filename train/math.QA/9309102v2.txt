Recent work of Roberts has shown that the first surgical 4-manifold invariant of Broda and (up to an unspecified normalization factor) the state-sum invariant arising from the TQFT of Crane-Yetter are equivalent to the signature of the 4-manifold. Subsequently Broda defined another surgical invariant in which the 1- and 2-handles are treated differently. We use a refinement of Roberts' techniques developped by the authors in hep-th/9309063 to show that the "improved" surgical invariant of Broda also depends only on the signature and Euler character
