A quantum generalization of Rogers' five term, or ``pentagon'' dilogarithm identity is suggested. It is shown that the classical limit gives usual Rogers' identity. The case where the quantum identity is realized in finite dimensional space is also considered and the quantum dilogarithm is constructed as a function on Fermat curve, while the identity itself is equivalent to the restricted star-triangle relation introduced by Bazhanov and Baxter.
