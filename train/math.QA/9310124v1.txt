This short note is closely related to Sen-Zwiebach paper on gauge transformations in Batalin-Vilkovisky theory (hep-th 9309027). We formulate some conditions of physical equivalence of solutions to the quantum master equation and use these conditions to give a very transparent analysis of symmetry transformations in BV-approach. We prove that in some sense every quantum observable (i.e. every even function H obeying \Delta_{\rho}(He^S)=0) determines a symmetry of the theory with the action functional S satisfying quantum master equation \Delta_{\rho}e^S=0 \end
