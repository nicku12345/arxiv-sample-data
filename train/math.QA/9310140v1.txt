A global model of q-deformation for the quasi--orthogonal Lie algebras generating the groups of motions of the four--dimensional affine Cayley--Klein geometries is obtained starting from the three dimensional deformations. It is shown how the main algebraic classical properties of the CK systems can be implemented in the quantum case. Quantum deformed versions of either the space--time or space symmetry algebras (Poincar\'e (3+1), Galilei (3+1), 4D Euclidean as well as others) appear in this context as particular cases and several q-deformations for them are directly obtained.
