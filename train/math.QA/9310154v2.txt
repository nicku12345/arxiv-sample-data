We represent Feigin's construction [11] of lattice W algebras and give some simple results: lattice Virasoro and W_3 algebras. For simplest case g=sl(2) we introduce whole U_q(sl(2)) quantum group on this lattice. We find simplest two-dimensional module as well as exchange relations and define lattice Virasoro algebra as algebra of invariants of U_q(sl(2)). Another generalization is connected with lattice integrals of motion as the invariants of quantum affine group U_q(\hat{n}_{+}). We show that Volkov's scheme leads to the system of difference equations for the function from non-commutative variables.Continium limit of this lattice algebras are considered.
