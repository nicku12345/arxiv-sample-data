For any Hecke symmetry R there is a natural quantization A_n(R) of the Weyl algebra A_n. The aim of this paper is to study some general ring-theoretic aspects of A_n(R) and its relations to formal deformations of A_n. We also obtain further information on those quantizations obtained from some well-known Hecke symmetries.
