The quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations associated with the trigonometric R-matrix or the rational R-matrix of the A-type are considered. Jackson integral representations for solutions of these equations are described. Asymptotic solutions for a holonomic system of difference equations are constructed. Relations between the integral representations and the Bethe ansatz are indicated.
