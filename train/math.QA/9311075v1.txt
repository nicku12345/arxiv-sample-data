Pairing between the universal enveloping algebra U_q(sl(2)) and the algebra of functions over SL_q(2) is obtained in explicit terms. The regular representation of the quantum double is constructed and investigated. The structure of the root subspaces of the Casimir operator is revealed and described in terms of SL_q(2) elements.
