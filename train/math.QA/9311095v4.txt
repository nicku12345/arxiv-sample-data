We introduce and study the Koszul complex for a Hecke R-matrix. Its cohomologies, called the Berezinian, are used to define quantum superdeterminant for a Hecke R-matrix. Their behaviour with respect to Hecke sum of R-matrices is studied. Given a Hecke R-matrix in n-dimensional vector space, we construct a Hecke R-matrix in 2n-dimensional vector space commuting with a differential. The notion of a quantum differential supergroup is derived. Its algebra of functions is a differential coquasitriangular Hopf algebra, having the usual algebra of differential forms as a quotient. Examples of superdeterminants related to these algebras are calculated. Several remarks about Woronowicz's theory are made.
