We show that the external algebra \cal M on GL(N) can be equipped with the graded Poisson brackets compatible with the group action. We prove that there are only two graded Poisson-Lie structures (brackets) on \cal M and we obtain their explicit description. We realize that just these two structures appear as the quasiclassical limit of the bicovariant differential calculi on the quantum linear group GL_q (N).
