We show that every Lie algebra or superLie algebra has a canonical braiding on it, and that in terms of this its enveloping algebra appears as a flat space with braided-commuting coordinate functions. This also gives a new point of view about q-Minkowski space which arises in a similar way as the enveloping algebra of the braided Lie algebra gl_{2,q}. Our point of view fixes the signature of the metric on q-Minkowski space and hence also of ordinary Minkowski space at q=1. We also describe an abstract construction for left-invariant integration on any braided group.
