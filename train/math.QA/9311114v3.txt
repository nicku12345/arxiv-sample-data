The concept of universal T matrix, recently introduced by Fronsdal and Galindo in the framework of quantum groups, is here discussed as a generalization of the exponential mapping. New examples related to inhomogeneous quantum groups of physical interest are developed, the duality calculations are explicitly presented and it is found that in some cases the universal T matrix, like for Lie groups, is expressed in terms of usual exponential series.
