We discuss the differential algebras used in Connes' approach to Yang-Mills theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. These differential algebras generated by algebras of the form functions \otimes matrix are shown to be skew tensorproducts of differential forms with a specific matrix algebra. For that we derive a general formula for differential algebras based on tensor products of algebras. The result is used to characterize differential algebras which appear in models with one symmetry breaking scale.
