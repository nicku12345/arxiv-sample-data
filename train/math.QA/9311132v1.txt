In this paper the quantum integrals of the Hamiltonian of the quantum many-body problem with the interaction potential K/sinh^2(x) (Sutherland operator) are constructed as images of higher Casimirs of the Lie algebra gl(N) under a certain homomorphism from the center of U(gl(N)) to the algebra of differential operators in N variables. A similar construction applied to the affine gl(N) at the critical level k=-N defines a correspondence between higher Sugawara operators and quantum integrals of the Hamiltonian of the quantum many-body problem with the potential equal to constant times the Weierstrass function. This allows one to give a new proof of the Olshanetsky-Perelomov theorem stating that this Hamiltonian defines a completely integrable quantum system. We also give a new expression for eigenfunctions of the quantum integrals of the Sutherland operator as traces of intertwining operators between certain representations of gl(N).
