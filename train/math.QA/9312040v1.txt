The present paper describes the W--geometry of the Abelian finite non-periodic (conformal) Toda systems associated with the B,C and D series of the simple Lie algebras endowed with the canonical gradation. The principal tool here is a generalization of the classical Pl\"ucker embedding of the A-case to the flag manifolds associated with the fundamental representations of B_n, C_n and D_n, and a direct proof that the corresponding K\"ahler potentials satisfy the system of two--dimensional finite non-periodic (conformal) Toda equations. It is shown that the W--geometry of the type mentioned above coincide with the differential geometry of special holomorphic (W) surfaces in target spaces which are submanifolds (quadrics) of CP^N with appropriate choices of N. In addition, these W-surfaces are defined to satisfy quadratic holomorphic differential conditions that ensure consistency of the generalized Pl\"ucker embedding. These conditions are automatically fulfiled when Toda equations hold.
