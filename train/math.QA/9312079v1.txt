Highest weight representations of U_q(su(1,1)) with q=\exp \pi i/N are investigated. The structures of the irreducible hieghesat weight modules are discussed in detail. The Clebsch-Gordan decomposition for the tensor product of two irreducible representations is discussed. By using the results, a representation of SL(2,R)\otimes U_q(su(2)) is also presented in terms of holomorphic sections which also have U_q(su(2)) index. Furthermore we realise Z_N-graded supersymmetry in terms of the representation. An explicit realization of Osp(1 \vert 2) via the heighest weight representation of U_q(su(1,1)) with q^2=-1 is given.
