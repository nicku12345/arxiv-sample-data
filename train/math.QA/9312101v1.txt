A representation-theoretic approach to special functions was developed in the 40-s and 50-s in the works of I.M.Gelfand, M.A.Naimark, N.Ya.Vilenkin, and their collaborators. The essence of this approach is the fact that most classical special functions can be obtained as suitable specializations of matrix elements or characters of representations of groups. Another rich source of special functions is the theory of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients which describes the geometric juxtaposition of irreducible components inside the tensor product of two representations. Finally, in recent works on representations of (quantum) affine Lie algebras it was shown that matrix elements of intertwining operators between certain representations of these algebras are interesting special functions -- (q-)hypergeometric functions and their generalizations.   In this paper we suggest a general method of getting special functions from representation theory which unifies the three methods mentioned above and allows one to define and study many new special functions. We illustrate this method by a number of examples -- Macdonald's polynomials, eigenfunctions of the Sutherland operator, Lame functions.
