A new, formal, non-combinatorial approach to invariants of three-dimensional manifolds of Reshetikhin, Turaev and Witten in the framework of non-perturbative topological quantum Chern-Simons theory, corresponding to an arbitrary compact simple Lie group, is presented. A direct implementation of surgery instructions in the context of quantum field theory is proposed. An explicit form of the specialization of the invariant to the group SU(2) is derived.
