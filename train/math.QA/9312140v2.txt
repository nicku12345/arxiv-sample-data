We obtain an R-matrix or matrix representation of the Artin braid group acting in a canonical way on the vector space of every (super)-Lie algebra or braided-Lie algebra. The same result applies for every (super)-Hopf algebra or braided-Hopf algebra. We recover some known representations such as those associated to racks. We also obtain new representations such as a non-trivial one on the ring k[x] of polynomials in one variable, regarded as a braided-line. Representations of the extended Artin braid group for braids in the complement of S^1 are also obtained by the same method.
