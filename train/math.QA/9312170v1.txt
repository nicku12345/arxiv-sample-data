We clarify the relation between the approach to q-Minkowski space of Carow-Watamura et al. with an approach based on the idea of 2\times 2 braided Hermitean matrices. The latter are objects like super-matrices but with Bose-Fermi statistics replaced by braid statistics. We also obtain new R-matrix formulae for the q-Poincare group in this framework.
