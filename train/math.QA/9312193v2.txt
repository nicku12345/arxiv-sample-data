We give an elementary explicit construction of cell decomposition of the moduli space of projective structures on a two dimensional surface analogous to the decomposition of Penner/Strebel for moduli space of complex structures. The relations between projective structures and PGL(2,{\bf C}) flat connections are also described. (in the revised version uuencoded pictures are made printable)
