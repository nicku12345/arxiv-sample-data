We construct a cohomology theory controlling the deformations of a general Drinfel'd algebra. The picture presented here has two sides -- the combinatorial one related with the fact of the existence of a graded Lie algebra structure on the simplicial cochain complex of the associahedra, and the algebraic one related with the algebra of derivations on the bar construction.
