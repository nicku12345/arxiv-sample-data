Upto ten crossing number, there are two knots, 9_{42} and 10_{71} whose chirality is not detected by any of the known polynomials, namely, Jones invariants and their two variable generalisations, HOMFLY and Kauffman invariants. We show that the generalised knot invariants, obtained through SU(2) Chern-Simons topological field theory, which give the known polynomials as special cases, are indeed sensitive to the chirality of these knots.
