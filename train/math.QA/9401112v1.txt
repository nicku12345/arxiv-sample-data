We study the quantum matrix algebra R_{21}x_1x_2=x_2x_1 R and for the standard 2\times 2 case propose it for the co-ordinates of q-deformed Euclidean space. The algebra in this simplest case is isomorphic to the usual quantum matrices M_q(2) but in a form which is naturally covariant under the Euclidean rotations SU_q(2)\otimes SU_q(2). We also introduce a quantum Wick rotation that twists this system precisely into the approach to q-Minkowski space based on braided-matrices and their associated spinorial q-Lorentz group.
