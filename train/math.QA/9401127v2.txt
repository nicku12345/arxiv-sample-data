All possible graded Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of SL(2) are described. We prove that differential Poisson-Lie structures prolonging the Sklyanin brackets do not exist on SL(2). There are two and only two graded Poisson-Lie structures on SL (2) and neither of them can be obtained by a reduction of graded Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of GL(2). Both of them can be quantized and as a result we get a new graded algebra of quantum right-invariant forms on SL_q(2) with three generators.
