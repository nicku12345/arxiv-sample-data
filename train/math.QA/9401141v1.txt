The non-commutative differential calculus on quantum groups can be extended by introducing, in analogy with the classical case, inner product operators and Lie derivatives. For the case of \GL we show how this extended calculus induces by coaction a similar extended calculus, covariant under \GL, on the quantum plane. In this way, inner product operators and Lie derivatives can be introduced on the plane as well. The situation with other quantum groups and quantum spaces is briefly discussed. Explicit formulas are given for the two dimensional quantum plane.
