We study representations of the mapping class group of the punctured torus on the double of a finite dimensional possibly non-semisimple Hopf algebra that arise in the construction of universal, extended topological field theories. We discuss how for doubles the degeneracy problem of TQFT's is circumvented. We find compact formulae for the {\cal S}^{\pm 1}-matrices using the canonical, non degenerate forms of Hopf algebras and the bicrossed structure of doubles rather than monodromy matrices. A rigorous proof of the modular relations and the computation of the projective phases is supplied using Radford's relations between the canonical forms and the moduli of integrals. We analyze the projective SL(2, Z)-action on the center of U_q(sl_2) for q an l=2m+1-st root of unity. It appears that the 3m+1-dimensional representation decomposes into an m+1-dimensional finite representation and a 2m-dimensional, irreducible representation. The latter is the tensor product of the two dimensional, standard representation of SL(2, Z) and the finite, m-dimensional representation, obtained from the truncated TQFT of the semisimplified representation category of U_q(sl_2)\,.
