We study a possibility to define the (braided) comultiplication for the GLq(N)-covariant differential complexes on some quantum spaces. We discover such `differential bialgebras' (and Hopf algebras) on the bosonic and fermionic quantum hyperplanes (with additive coproduct) and on the braided matrix algebra BMq(N) with both multiplicative and additive coproducts. The latter case is related (for N=2) to the q-Minkowski space and q-Poincare algebra.
