It is shown that the well known Racah sum rule and Biedenharn-Elliott identity satisfied by the recoupling coefficients or by the 6-j symbols of the usual rotation SO(3) algebra can be extended to the corresponding features of the super-rotation osp(1|2) superalgebra. The structure of the sum rules is completely similar in both cases, the only difference concerns the signs which are more involved in the super-rotation case.
