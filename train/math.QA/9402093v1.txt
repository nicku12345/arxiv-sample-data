Polynomial invariants corresponding to the fundamental representation of the gauge group SU(N) are computed for arbitrary torus knots and links in the framework of Chern-Simons gauge theory making use of knot operators. As a result, a formula for the HOMFLY polynomial for arbitrary torus links is presented.
