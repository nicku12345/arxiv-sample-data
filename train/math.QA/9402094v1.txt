Explicit expressions for three series of R matrices which are related to a ``dilute'' generalisation of the Birman--Wenzl--Murakami are presented. Of those, one series is equivalent to the quantum R matrices of the D^{(2)}_{n+1} generalised Toda systems whereas the remaining two series appear to be new.
