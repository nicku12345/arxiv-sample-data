We translate effectively our earlier quantum constructions to the classical language and using Yang-Baxterisation of the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan algebra are able to construct Lax operators and associated r-matrices of classical integrable models. Thus new as well as known lattice systems of different classes are generated including new types of collective integrable models and canonical models with nonstandard r matrices.
