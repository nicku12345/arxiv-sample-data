We introduce a new construction of bilinear invariant forms on Lie algebras, based on the method of graded contractions. The general method is described and the \Bbb Z_2-, \Bbb Z_3-, and \Bbb Z_2\otimes\Bbb Z_2-contractions are found. The results can be applied to all Lie algebras and superalgebras (finite or infinite dimensional) which admit the chosen gradings. We consider some examples: contractions of the Killing form, toroidal contractions of su(3), and we briefly discuss the limit to new WZW actions.
