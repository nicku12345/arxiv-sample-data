A novel Hopf algebra  ( {\tilde G}_{r,s} ), depending on two deformation parameters and five generators, has been constructed. This  {\tilde G}_{r,s} Hopf algebra might be considered as some quantisation of classical GL(2) \otimes GL(1)  group, which contains the standard GL_q(2) quantum group (with  q=r^{-1} ) as a Hopf subalgebra. However, we interestingly observe that the two parameter deformed GL_{p,q}(2) quantum group can also be realised through the generators of this  {\tilde G}_{r,s} algebra, provided the sets of deformation parameters p,~q and r,~s are related to each other in a particular fashion. Subsequently we construct the invariant noncommutative planes associated with  {\tilde G}_{r,s} algebra and show how the two well known Manin planes corresponding to GL_{p,q}(2) quantum group can easily be reproduced through such construction. Finally we consider the `coloured' extension of GL_{p,q}(2) quantum group as well as corresponding Manin planes and explore their intimate connection with the `coloured' extension of {\tilde G}_{r,s} Hopf structure.
