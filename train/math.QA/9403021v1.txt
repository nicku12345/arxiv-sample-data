We extend the results of our previous paper from knots to links by using a formula for the Jones polynomial of a link derived recently by N. Reshetikhin. We illustrate this formula by an example of a torus link. A relation between the parameters of Reshetikhin's formula and the multivariable Alexander polynomial is established. We check that our expression for the Alexander polynomial satisfies some of its basic properties. Finally we derive a link surgery formula for the loop corrections to the trivial connection contribution to Witten's invariant of rational homology spheres.
