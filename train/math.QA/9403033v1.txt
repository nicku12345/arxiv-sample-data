We realize the Hopf algebra U_{q^{-1}}(so(N)) as an algebra of differential operators on the quantum Euclidean space {\bf R}_q^N. The generators are suitable q-deformed analogs of the angular momentum components on ordinary {\bf R}^N. The algebra Fun({\bf R}_q^N) of functions on {\bf R}_q^N splits into a direct sum of irreducible vector representations of U_{q^{-1}}(so(N)); the latter are explicitly constructed as highest weight representations.
