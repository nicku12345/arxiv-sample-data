Motivated by a recent paper of Fock and Rosly \cite{FoRo} we describe a mathematically precise quantization of the Hamiltonian Chern-Simons theory. We introduce the Chern-Simons theory on the lattice which is expected to reproduce the results of the continuous theory exactly. The lattice model enjoys the symmetry with respect to a quantum gauge group. Using this fact we construct the algebra of observables of the Hamiltonian Chern-Simons theory equipped with a *-operation and a positive inner product.
