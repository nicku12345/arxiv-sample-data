An important property of a Hopf algebra is its quasitriangularity and it is useful various applications. This property is investigated for quantum groups sl_2 at roots of 1. It is shown that different forms of the quantum group sl_2 at roots of 1 are either quasitriangular or have similar structure which will be called autoquasitriangularity. In the most interesting cases this property means that "braiding automorphism" is a combination of some Poisson transformation and an adjoint transformation with certain element of the tensor square of the algebra.
