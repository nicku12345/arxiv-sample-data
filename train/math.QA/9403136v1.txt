The elliptic-matrix quantum Olshanetsky-Perelomov problem is introduced for arbitrary root systems by means of an elliptic generalization of the Dunkl operators. Its equivalence with the double affine generalization of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation (in the induced representations) is established.
