A discrete DJS-hypergroup is constructed in connection with the linearization formula for the product of two spherical elements for a quantum Gelfand pair of two compact quantum groups. A similar construction is discussed for the case of a generalized quantum Gelfand pair, where the role of the quantum subgroup is taken over by a two-sided coideal in the dual Hopf algebra. The paper starts with a review of compact quantum groups, with an approach in terms of so-called CQG algebras. The paper concludes with some examples of hypergroups thus obtained.
