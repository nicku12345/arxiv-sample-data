We consider representations of quadratic R-matrix algebras by means of certain first order ordinary differential operators. These operators turn out to act as parameter shifting operators on the Gauss hypergeometric function and its limit cases and on classical orthogonal polynomials. The relationship with W. Miller's treatment of Lie algebras of first order differential operators will be discussed.
