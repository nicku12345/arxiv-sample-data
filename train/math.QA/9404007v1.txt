A new derivation of the quantum deformation of the 2 dimensional Euclidean Poincare group (cf S. Zakrzewski) is proposed. It is based on a contraction of the Hopf algebra Fun(SO_q(3)). The deformation parameter q is sent to one, as in the construction of the \kappa-Poincare deformed algebra. The quantum group obtained is dual to that algebra.
