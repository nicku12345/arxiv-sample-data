We show that some factors of the universal R-matrix generate a family of twistings for the standard Hopf structure of any quantized contragredient Lie (super)algebra of finite growth. As an application we prove that any two isomorphic superalgebras with different Cartan matrices have isomorphic q-deformations (as associative superalgebras) and their standard comultiplications are connected by such twisting. We present also an explicit relation between the generators of the second Drinfeld's realization and Cartan-Weyl generators of quantized affine nontwisted Kac-Moody algebras. Further development of the theory of quantum Cartan-Weyl basis, closely related with this isomorphism, is discussed. We show that Drinfeld's formulas of a comultiplication for the second realization are a twisting of the standard comultiplication by factors of the universal R-matrix. Finally, properties of the Drinfeld's comultiplication are considered.
