The general formula for the universal R-matrix for quantized nontwisted affine algebras by Khoroshkin and Tolstoy is applied for zero central charge highest weight modules of the quantized affine algebras. It is shown how the universal R-matrix produces the Gauss decomposition of trigonomitric R-matrix in tensor product of these modules. Explicit calculations for the simplest case of A_1^{(1)} are presented. As a consequence new formulas for the trigonometric R-matrix with a parameter in tensor product of U_q(sl_2)-Verma modules are obtained.
