An embedding method to get q-deformations for the non--semisimple algebras generating the motion groups of N--dimensional flat spaces is presented. This method gives a global and simultaneous scheme of q-deformation for all iso(p,q) algebras and for those ones obtained from them by some In\"on\"u--Wigner contractions, such as the N--dimensional Euclidean, Poincar\'e and Galilei algebras.
