We show that a general miraculous cancellation formula, the divisibility of certain characteristic numbers and some other topologiclal results are con- sequences of the modular invariance of elliptic operators on loop spaces. Previously we have shown that modular invariance also implies the rigidity of many elliptic operators on loop spaces.
