We present an analysis of the cocycle appearing in the vertex operator representation of simply-laced, affine, Kac-Moody algebras. We prove that it can be described in the context of R-commutative geometry, where R is a Yang-Baxter operator, as a strong R-commutative algebra. We comment on the Hochschild, cyclic and dihedral homology theories that appear in non-commutative geometry and their potential relation to string theory.
