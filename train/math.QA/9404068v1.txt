The general expression for the bicovariant bracket for odd generators of the external algebra on a Poisson-Lie group is given. It is shown that the graded Poisson-Lie structures derived before for GL(N) and SL(N) are the special cases of this bracket. The formula is the universal one and can be applied to the case of any matrix Lie group.
