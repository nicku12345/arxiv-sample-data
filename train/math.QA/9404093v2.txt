The commutator anomalies (Schwinger terms) of current algebras in 3+1 dimensions are computed in terms of the Wodzicki residue of pseudodifferential operators; the result can be written as a (twisted) Radul 2-cocycle for the Lie algebra of PSDO's. The construction of the (second quantized) current algebra is closely related to a geometric renormalization of the interaction Hamiltonian H_I=j_{\mu} A^{\mu} in gauge theory.
