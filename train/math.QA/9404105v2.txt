There are only two quantum group structures on the space of two by two unimodular matrices, these are the SL_q(2) and the SL_h(2) [9-13] quantum groups. One can not construct a differential geometry on  SL_q(2), which at the same time is bicovariant, has three generators, and satisfies the Liebnitz rule. We show that such a differential geometry exists for the quantum group SL_h(2) and derive all of its properties.
