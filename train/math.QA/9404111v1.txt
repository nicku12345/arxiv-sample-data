In this note, a new class of representations of the braid groups B_{N} is constructed. It is proved that those representations contain three kinds of irreducible representations: the trivial (identity) one, the Burau one, and an N-dimensional one. The explicit form of the N-dimensional irreducible representation of the braid group B_{N} is given here.
