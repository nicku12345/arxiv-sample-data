From Koornwinder's interpretation of big q-Legendre polynomials as spherical elements on the quantum SU(2) group an addition formula is derived for the big q-Legendre polynomial. The formula involves Al-Salam--Carlitz polynomials, little q-Jacobi polynomials and dual q-Krawtchouk polynomials. For the little q-ultraspherical polynomials a product formula in terms of a big q-Legendre polynomial follows by q-integration. The addition and product formula for the Legendre polynomials are obtained when q tends to 1.
