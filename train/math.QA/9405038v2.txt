We derive explicit integral formulas for eigenfunctions of quantum integrals of the Calogero-Sutherland-Moser operator with trigonometric interaction potential. In particular, we derive explicit formulas for Jack's symmetric functions. To obtain such formulas, we use the representation of these eigenfunctions by means of traces of intertwining operators between certain modules over the Lie algebra \frak gl_n, and the realization of these modules on functions of many variables.
