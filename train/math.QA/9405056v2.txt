As a generalization of our previous paper [GK], we formulate a residue formula and some simple behaviors of equivariant quantum cohomology applying to compute the quantum cohomology of partial flag manifolds F_{k_1,\cdots , k_l} with a try to give a rigorous definition of equivariant quantum cohomology.
