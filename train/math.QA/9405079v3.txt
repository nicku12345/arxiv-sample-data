Irreducible representations of quantum groups SL_q(2) (in Woronowicz' approach) were classified in J.Wang, B.Parshall, Memoirs AMS 439 in the~case of q being an~odd root of unity. Here we find the~irreducible representations for all roots of unity (also of an~even degree), as well as describe "the~diagonal part" of tensor product of any two irreducible representations. An~example of not completely reducible representation is given. Non--existence of Haar functional is proved. The~corresponding representations of universal enveloping algebras of Jimbo and Lusztig are provided. We also recall the~case of general~q. Our computations are done in explicit way.
