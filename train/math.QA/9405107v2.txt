We show that the \kappa-deformed Poincar\'e quantum algebra proposed for elementary particle physics has the structure of a Hopf agebra bicrossproduct U(so(1,3))\cobicross T. The algebra is a semidirect product of the classical Lorentz group so(1,3) acting in a deformed way on the momentum sector T. The novel feature is that the coalgebra is also semidirect, with a backreaction of the momentum sector on the Lorentz rotations. Using this, we show that the \kappa-Poincar\'e acts covariantly on a \kappa-Minkowski space, which we introduce. It turns out necessarily to be deformed and non-commutative. We also connect this algebra with a previous approach to Planck scale physics.
