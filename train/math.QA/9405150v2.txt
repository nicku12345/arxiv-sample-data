We construct representations \hat\pi_{\br} of the quantum algebra U_q(sl(n)) labelled by n-1 complex numbers r_i and acting in the space of formal power series of n(n-1)/2 non-commuting variables. These variables generate a flag manifold of the matrix quantum group SL_q(n) which is dual to U_q(sl(n)). The conditions for reducibility of \hat\pi_{\br} and the procedure for the construction of the q - difference intertwining operators are given. The representations and q - difference intertwining operators are given in the most explicit form for n=3. In the Note Added some general results for arbitrary n are given.
