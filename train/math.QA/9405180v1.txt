We investigate the spin 1/2 fermions on quantum two spheres. It is shown that the wave functions of fermions and a Dirac Operator on quantum two spheres can be constructed in a manifestly covariant way under the quantum group SU(2)_q. The concept of total angular momentum and chirality can be expressed by using q-analog of Pauli-matrices and appropriate commutation relations.
