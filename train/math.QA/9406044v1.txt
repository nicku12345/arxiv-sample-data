In this paper all deformations of the general linear group, subject to certain restrictions which in particular ensure a smooth passage to the Lie group limit, are obtained. Representations are given in terms of certains sets of creation and annihilation operators. These creation and annihilation operators may belong to a generalisation of the q-quark type or q-hadronic type, of q-boson or q-fermion type. We are also led to a natural definition of q-direct sums of q-algebras.
