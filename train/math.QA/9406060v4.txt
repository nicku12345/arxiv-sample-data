Asymptotic solutions to the quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation associated with \frak{gl}_{N+1} are constructed. The leading term of an asymptotic solution is the Bethe vector -- an eigenvector of the transfer-matrix of a quantum spin chain model. We show that the norm of the Bethe vector is equal to the product of the Hessian of a suitable function and an explicitly written rational function. This formula is an analogue of the Gaudin-Korepin formula for the norm of the Bethe vector. It is shown that, generically, the Bethe vectors form a base for the \frak{gl}_2 case.
