A representation theory of the quantized Poincar\'e (\kappa-Poincar\'e) algebra (QPA) is developed. We show that the representations of this algebra are closely connected with the representations of the non-deformed Poincar\'e algebra. A theory of tensor operators for QPA is considered in detail. Necessary and sufficient conditions are found in order for scalars to be invariants. Covariant components of the four-momenta and the Pauli-Lubanski vector are explicitly constructed.These results are used for the construction of some q-relativistic equations. The Wigner-Eckart theorem for QPA is proven.
