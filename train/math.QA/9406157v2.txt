The machinery of braided geometry introduced previously is used now to construct the \epsilon `totally antisymmetric tensor' on a general braided vector space determined by R-matrices. This includes natural q-Euclidean and q-Minkowski spaces. The formalism is completely covariant under the corresponding quantum group such as \widetilde{SO_q(4)} or \widetilde{SO_q(1,3)}. The Hodge * operator and differentials are also constructed in this approach.
