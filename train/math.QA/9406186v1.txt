We wish to report here on a recent approach to the non-commutative calculus on q-Minkowski space which is based on the reflection equations with no spectral parameter. These are considered as the expression of the invariance (under the coaction of the q-Lorentz group) of the commutation properties which define the different q-Minkowski algebras. This approach also allows us to discuss the possible ambiguities in the definition of q-Minkowski space {\cal M}_q and its differential calculus. The commutation relations among the generators of {\cal M}_q (coordinates), {\cal D}_q (derivatives), \Lambda_q (one-forms) and a few invariant (scalar) operators are established and compared with earlier results.
