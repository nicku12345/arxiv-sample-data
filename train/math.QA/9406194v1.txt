Studying the algebraic structure of the double {\cal D}Y(g) of the yangian Y(g) we present the triangular decomposition of {\cal D}Y(g) and a factorization for the canonical pairing of the yangian with its dual inside {\cal D}Y(g). As a consequence we obtain an explicit formula for the universal R-matrix R of {\cal D}Y(g) and demonstrate how it works in evaluation representations of Y(sl_2). We interprete one-dimensional factor arising in concrete representations of R as bilinear form on highest weight polynomials of irreducible representations of Y(g) and express this form in terms of {\it gamma-functions}.
