The aim of this lecture is to give a pedagogical explanation of the notion of a Poisson Lie structure on the external algebra of a Poisson Lie group which was introduced in our previous papers. Using this notion as a guide we construct quantum external algebras on SL_q(N) with proper (classical) dimension.
