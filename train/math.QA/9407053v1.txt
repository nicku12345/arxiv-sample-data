In this paper, we introduce an N\times N matrix \epsilon^{a\bar{b}} in the quantum groups SU_{q}(N) to transform the conjugate representation into the standard form so that we are able to compute the explicit forms of the important quantities in the bicovariant differential calculus on SU_{q}(N), such as the q-deformed structure constant {\bf C}_{IJ}^{~K} and the q-deformed transposition operator \Lambda. From the q-gauge covariant condition we define the generalized q-deformed Killing form and the m-th q-deformed Chern class P_{m} for the quantum groups SU_{q}(N). Some useful relations of the generalized q-deformed Killing form are presented. In terms of the q-deformed homotopy operator we are able to compute the q-deformed Chern-Simons Q_{2m-1} by the condition dQ_{2m-1}=P_{m}, Furthermore, the q-deformed cocycle hierarchy, the q-deformed gauge covariant Lagrangian, and the q-deformed Yang-Mills equation are derived.
