Chern-Simons gauge theory for compact semisimple groups is analyzed from a perturbation theory point of view. The general form of the perturbative series expansion of a Wilson line is presented in terms of the Casimir operators of the gauge group. From this expansion new numerical knot invariants are obtained. These knot invariants turn out to be of finite type (Vassiliev invariants), and to possess an integral representation. Using known results about Jones, HOMFLY, Kauffman and Akutsu-Wadati polynomial invariants these new knot invariants are computed up to type six for all prime knots up to six crossings. Our results suggest that these knot invariants can be normalized in such a way that they are integer-valued.
