We have new solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, from which we have constructed new link invariants containing more than two arbitrary parameters. This may be regarded as a generalization of the Jones' polynomial. We have also found another simpler invariant which discriminates only the linking structure of knots with each other, but not details of individual knot.
