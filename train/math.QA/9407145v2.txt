The notion of a translation map in a quantum principal bundle is introduced. A translation map is then used to prove that the cross sections of a quantum fibre bundle E(B,V,A) associated to a quantum principal bundle P(B,A) are in bijective correspondence with equivariant maps V\to P, and that a quantum principal bundle is trivial if it admits a cross section which is an algebra map. The vertical automorphisms and gauge transformations of a quantum principal bundle are discussed. In particular it is shown that vertical automorphisms are in bijective correspondence with \ad-covariant maps A\to P.
