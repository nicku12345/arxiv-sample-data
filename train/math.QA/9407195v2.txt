We construct the Euclidean Hopf algebra U_q(e^N) dual of Fun(\rn_q^N\lcross SO_{q^{-1}}(N)) by realizing it as a subalgebra of the differential algebra \DFR on the quantum Euclidean space \rn_q^N; in fact, we extend our previous realization \cite{fio4} of U_{q^{-1}}(so(N)) within \DFR through the introduction of q-derivatives as generators of q-translations. The fundamental Hilbert space representations of U_q(e^N) turn out to be of highest weight type and rather simple `` lattice-regularized '' versions of the classical ones. The vectors of a basis of the singlet (i.e. zero-spin) irrep can be realized as normalizable functions on \rn_q^N, going to distributions in the limit q\rightarrow 1.
