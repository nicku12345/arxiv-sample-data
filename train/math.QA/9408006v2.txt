The type-I simple Lie-superalgebras are sl(m|n) and osp(2|2n). We study the quantum deformations of their untwisted affine extensions U_q(sl(m|n)^{(1)}) and U_q(osp(2|2n)^{(1)}). We identify additional relations between the simple generators (``extra q-Serre relations") which need to be imposed to properly define \uqgh and U_q(osp(2|2n)^{(1)}). We present a general technique for deriving the spectral parameter dependent R-matrices from quantum affine superalgebras. We determine the R-matrices for the type-I affine superalgebra U_q(sl(m|n)^{(1)}) in various representations, thereby deriving new solutions of the spectral-dependent Yang-Baxter equation. In particular, because this algebra possesses one-parameter families of finite-dimensional irreps, we are able to construct R-matrices depending on two additional spectral-like parameters, providing generalizations of the free-fermion model.
