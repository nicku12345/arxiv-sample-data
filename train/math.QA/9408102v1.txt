Let H be a Hopf algebra in braided category \cal C. Crossed modules over H are objects with both module and comodule structures satisfying some comatibility condition. Category {\cal C}^H_H of crossed modules is braided and is concrete realization of general categorical construction. For quantum braided group (H,{\cal R}) corresponding braided category {\cal C}^{\cal R}_H of modules is identifyed with full subcategory in {\cal C}_H^H. Connection with crossproducts is discussed. Correct cross product in the class of quantum braided groups is built. Radford's--Majid's theorem gives equivalent condition for usual Hopf algebra to be crossproduct. Braided variant and analog of this theorem for quantum braided qroups are obtained.
