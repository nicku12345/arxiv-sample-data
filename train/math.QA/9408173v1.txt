A unified and systematic scheme for constraction of differential opreator realization of any irreducible representation of sl(n) is developed. The q-analogue of this unified scheme is used to constract q-difference operator realization of any irreducible representation of U_q(sl(n)). Explicit results for U_q(sl(2)), U_q(sl(3)) and U_q(sl(n)) are given.
