The concept of a quantum algebra is made easy through the investigation of the prototype algebras u_{qp}(2), su_q(2) and u_{qp}(1,1). The latter quantum algebras are introduced as deformations of the corresponding Lie algebras~; this is achieved in a simple way by means of qp-bosons. The Hopf algebraic structure of u_{qp}(2) is also discussed. The basic ingredients for the representation theory of u_{qp}(2) are given. Finally, in connection with the quantum algebra u_{qp}(2), we discuss the qp-analogues of the harmonic oscillator and of the (spherical and hyperbolical) angular momenta.
