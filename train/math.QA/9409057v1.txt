We give an overview of a new kind symmetry in physics which exists between observables and states and which is made possible by the language of Hopf algebras and quantum geometry. It has been proposed by the author as a feature of Planck scale physics. More recent work includes corresponding results at the semiclassical level of Poisson-Lie groups and at the level of braided groups and braided geometry.
