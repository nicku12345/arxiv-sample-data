In this paper which is the completion of [1], we construct the A_0(q)-algebra of Q-meromorphic functions on the quantum plane. This is the largest non-commutative, associative, A_0(q)-algebra of functions constructed on the quantum plane. We also define the notion of quantum subsets of R^2 which is a generalization of the notion of quantum disc and charactrize some of their properties. In the end we study the Q-homomorphisms of the quantum plane.
