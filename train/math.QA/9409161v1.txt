Using the technique developed by Fronsdal and Galindo (Lett. Math. Phys. 27 (1993) 57) for studying the Hopf duality between the quantum algebras Fun_{p,q}(GL(2)) and U_{p,q}(gl(2)), the Hopf structure of U_{p,q}(gl(1|1)), dual to Fun_{p,q}(GL(1|1)), is derived and the corresponding universal {\cal T}-matrix of Fun_{p,q}(GL(1|1)), embodying the suitably modified exponential relationship U_{p,q}(gl(1|1)) \rightarrow Fun_{p,q}(GL(1|1)), is obtained.
