We provide, with proofs, a complete description of the authors' construction of state-sum invariants announced in [CY], and its generalization to an arbitrary (artinian) semisimple tortile category. We also discuss the relationship of these invariants to generalizations of Broda's surgery invariants [Br1,Br2] using techniques developed in the case of the semi-simple sub-quotient of Rep(U_q(sl_2)) (q a principal 4r^{th} root of unity) by Roberts [Ro1]. We briefly discuss the generalizations to invariants of 4-manifolds equipped with 2-dimensional (co)homology classes introduced by Yetter [Y6] and Roberts [Ro2], which are the subject of the sequel.
