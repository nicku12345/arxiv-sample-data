Associated to the standard SU_{q}(n) R-matrices, we introduce quantum spheres S_{q}^{2n-1}, projective quantum spaces CP_{q}^{n-1}, and quantum Grassmann manifolds G_{k}(C_{q}^{n}). These algebras are shown to be homogeneous quantum spaces of standard quantum groups and are also quantum principle bundles in the sense of T Brzezinski and S. Majid (Comm. Math. Phys. 157,591 (1993)).
