The purpose of this paper is to introduce the cohomology of various algebras over an operad of moduli spaces including the cohomology of conformal field theories (CFT's) and vertex operator algebras (VOA's). This cohomology theory produces a number of invariants of CFT's and VOA's, one of which is the space of their infinitesimal deformations.
