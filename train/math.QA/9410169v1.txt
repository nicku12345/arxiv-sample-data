This paper is a continuation of our papers \cite{EK1, EK2}. In \cite{EK2} we showed that for the root system A_{n-1} one can obtain Macdonald's polynomials as weighted traces of intertwining operators between certain finite-dimensional representations of U_q(sl_n). The main goal of the present paper is to use this construction to give a representation-theoretic proof of Macdonald's inner product and symmetry identities for the root system A_{n-1}. The proofs are based on the techniques of ribbon graphs developed by Reshetikhin and Turaev. We also use the symmetry identities to derive recursive relations for Macdonald's polynomials.
