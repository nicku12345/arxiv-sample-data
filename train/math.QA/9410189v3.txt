We describe explicitly the canonical map \chi: Spec \ue(\a{g})\ \rightarrow \ Spec \ze, where \ue(\a{g}) is a quantum loop algebra at an odd root of unity \ve. Here \ze is the center of \ue(\a{g}) and Spec R stands for the set of all finite--dimensional irreducible representations of an algebra R. We show that Spec \ze is a Poisson proalgebraic group which is essentially the group of points of G over the regular adeles concentrated at 0 and \infty. Our main result is that the image under \chi of Spec \ue(\a{g}) is the subgroup of principal adeles.
