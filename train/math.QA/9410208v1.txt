In this note we prove the Davies-Foda-Jimbo-Miwa-Nakayashiki conjecture on the asymptotics of the composition of n quantum vertex operators for the quantum affine algebra U_q(\hat sl_2), as n goes to infinity. For this purpose we define and study the leading eigenvalue and eigenvector of the product of two components of the quantum vertex operator. This eigenvector and the corresponding eigenvalue were recently computed by M.Jimbo. The results of his computation are given in Section 4.
