We present a systematic introduction to the geometry of linear braided spaces. These are versions of \R^n in which the coordinates x_i have braid-statistics described by an R-matrix. From this starting point we survey the author's braided-approach to q-deformation: braided differentiation, exponentials, Gaussians, integration and forms, i.e. the basic ingredients for q-deformed physics are covered. The braided approach includes natural q-Euclidean and q-Minkowski spaces in R-matrix form.
