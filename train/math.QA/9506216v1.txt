A general addition formula for a two-parameter family of Askey-Wilson polynomials is derived from the quantum SU(2) group theoretic interpretation. This formula contains most of the previously known addition formulas for q-Legendre polynomials as special or limiting cases. A survey of the literature on addition formulas for q-special functions using quantum groups and quantum algebras is given.
