Starting from the addition formula for q-disk polynomials, which is an identity in non-commuting variables, we establish a basic analogue in commuting variables of the addition and product formula for disk polynomials. These contain as limiting cases the addition and product formula for little q-Legendre polynomials. As q tends to 1 the addition and product formula for disk polynomials are recovered.
