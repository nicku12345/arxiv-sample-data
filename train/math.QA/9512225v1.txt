We present a general survey of some recent developments regarding the construction of compact quantum symmetric spaces and the analysis of their zonal spherical functions in terms of q-orthogonal polynomials. In particular, we define a one-parameter family of two-sided coideals in \Uq(\gog\gol(n,\CC)) and express the zonal spherical functions on the corresponding quantum projective spaces as Askey-Wilson polynomials containing two continuous and one discrete parameter.
