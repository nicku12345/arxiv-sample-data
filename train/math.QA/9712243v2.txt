The conformal field theory based on the g/u(1)^d coset construction is treated as the WZNW theory for the affine Lie algebra \hat g with the constrained \hat u(1)^d subalgebra.Using a modification of the generalized canonical quantization method generators and primary fields of an extended symmetry algebra are found for arbitrary d.
