We develop a general theory of `quantum' diffeomorphism groups based on the universal comeasuring quantum group M(A) associated to an algebra A and its various quotients. Explicit formulae are introduced for this construction, as well as dual quasitriangular and braided R-matrix versions. Among the examples, we construct the q-diffeomorphisms of the quantum plane yx=qxy, and recover the quantum matrices M_q(2) as those respecting its braided group addition law.
