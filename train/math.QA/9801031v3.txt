Given M copies of a q-deformed Weyl or Clifford algebra in the defining representation of a quantum group G_q, we determine a prescription to embed them into a unique, inclusive G_q-covariant algebra. The different copies are "coupled" to each other and are naturally ordered into a "chain". In the case G_q=SL_q(N) a modified prescription yields an inclusive algebra which is even explicitly SL_q(M) X SL_q(N)-covariant, where SL_q(M) is a symmetry relating the different copies. By the introduction of these inclusive algebrae we significantly enlarge the class of G_q-covariant deformed Weyl/Clifford algebrae available for physical applications.
