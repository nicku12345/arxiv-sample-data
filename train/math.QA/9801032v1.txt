In this paper we employ the construction of Dirac bracket for the remaining current of sl(2)_q deformed Kac-Moody algebra when constraints similar to those connecting the sl(2)-WZW model and the Liouville theory are imposed and show that it satisfy the q-Virasoro algebra proposed by Frenkel and Reshetikhin. The crucial assumption considered in our calculation is the existence of a classical Poisson bracket algebra induced, in a consistent manner by the correspondence principle, mapping the quantum generators into commuting objects of classical nature preserving their algebra.
