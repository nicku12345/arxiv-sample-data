Elliptic current algebras E_{q,p}(\hat{g}) for arbitrary simply laced finite dimensional Lie algebra g are defined and their co-algebraic structures are studied. It is shown that under the Drinfeld like comultiplications, the algebra E_{q,p}(\hat{g}) is not co-closed for any g. However putting the algebras E_{q,p}(\hat{g}) with different deformation parameters together, we can establish a structure of infinite Hopf family of algebras. The level 1 bosonic realization for the algebra E_{q,p}(\hat{g}) is also established.
