It is well-known that the Macfarlane-Biedenharn q-oscillator and its generalization has no Hopf structure, whereas the Hong Yan q-oscillator can be endowed with a Hopf structure. In this letter, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct a general q-oscillator algebra which includes the Macfarlane-Biedenharn oscillator algebra and the Hong Yan oscillator algebra as special cases.
