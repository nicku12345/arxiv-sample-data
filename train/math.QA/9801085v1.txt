We use the idea of partial Gauss decomposition to study structures related to U_q(\widehat{{{\frak{gl}}}(n-1)}) inside U_q(\widehat{{{\frak{gl}}}(n)}) . This gives a description of U_q(\widehat{{{\frak{gl}}}(n)}) as an extension of U_q(\widehat{{{\frak{gl}}}(n-1)}) with Zamolodchikov algebras, We explain the connection of this new realization with form factors.
