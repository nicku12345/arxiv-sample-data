We construct a fully faithful functor from the category C_F of finite-dimensional representations of Felder's (dynamical) elliptic quantum group E_{tau,gamma}(gl(n)) to a cretain category D_B of (infinite-dimensional) representations of Belavin's quantum elliptic algebra B by difference operators, and a fully faithful functor from the category C_B of finite-dimensional representations of B to D_B. As a corollary, we show that the abelian subcategories of C_B and C_F generated by tensor products of vector representations are equivalent.
