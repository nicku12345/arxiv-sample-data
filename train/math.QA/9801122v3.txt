Let (M,g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and F_\lambda(M) the space of densities of degree \lambda on M. We study the space D^2_{\lambda,\mu}(M) of second-order differential operators from F_\lambda(M) to F_\mu(M). If (M,g) is conformally flat with signature p-q, then D^2_{\lambda,\mu}(M) is viewed as a module over the group of conformal transformations of M. We prove that, for almost all values of \mu-\lambda, the O(p+1,q+1)-modules D^2_{\lambda,\mu}(M) and the space of symbols (i.e., of second-order polynomials on T^*M) are canonically isomorphic. This yields a conformally equivariant quantization for quadratic Hamiltonians. We furthermore show that this quantization map extends to arbitrary pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and depends only on the conformal class [g] of the metric. As an example, the quantization of the geodesic flow yields a novel conformally equivariant Laplace operator on half-densities, as well as the well-known Yamabe Laplacian. We also recover in this framework the multi-dimensional Schwarzian derivative of conformal transformations.
