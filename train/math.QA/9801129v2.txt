Masuoka proved that for a prime p, semisimple Hopf algebras of dimension 2p over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0, are trivial (i.e. are either group algebras or the dual of group algebras). Westreich and the second author obtained the same result for dimension 3p, and then pushed the analysis further and among the rest obtained the same result for semisimple Hopf algebras H of dimension pq so that H and H^* are of Frobenius type (i.e. the dimensions of their irreducible representations divide the dimension of H). They concluded with the conjecture that any semisimple Hopf algebra H of dimension pq over k, is trivial. In this paper we use Theorem 1.4 in our previous paper q-alg/9712033 to prove that both H and H^* are of Frobenius type, and hence prove this conjecture.
