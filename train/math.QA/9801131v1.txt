We describe q-analogues of the 4-vertices in the Spin(4)-recoupling theory introduced by Barrett and Crane in gr-qc/9709028 using Kauffman-Lins SU(2)-recoupling theory in each factor and generalize them to obtain operators with the symmetry properties of unframed n-vertices. The elementary properties of the resulting invariants of embedded unframed graphs are examined.
