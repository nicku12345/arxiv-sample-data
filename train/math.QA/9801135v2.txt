For any simple Lie algebra g and any complex number q which is not zero or a nontrivial root of unity, we construct a dynamical quantum group (Hopf algebroid), whose representation theory is essentially the same as the representation theory of the quantum group U_q(g). This dynamical quantum group is obtained from the fusion and exchange relations between intertwining operators in representation theory of U_q(g), and is an algebraic structure standing behind these relations.
