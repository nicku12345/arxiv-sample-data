We investigate the structure of the elliptic algebra U_{q,p}(^sl_2) introduced earlier by one of the authors. Our construction is based on a new set of generating series in the quantum affine algebra U_q(^sl_2), which are elliptic analogs of the Drinfeld currents. They enable us to identify U_{q,p}(^sl_2) with the tensor product of U_q(^sl_2) and a Heisenberg algebra generated by P,Q with [Q,P]=1. In terms of these currents, we construct an L operator satisfying the dynamical RLL relation in the presence of the central element c. The vertex operators of Lukyanov and Pugai arise as `intertwiners' of U_{q,p}(^sl_2) for level one representation, in the sense to be elaborated on in the text. We also present vertex operators with higher level/spin in the free field representation.
