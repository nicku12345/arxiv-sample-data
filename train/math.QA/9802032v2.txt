We construct power series invariants of rational homology 3-spheres from quantum PSU(n)-invariants. The power series can be regarded as perturbative invariants corresponding to the contribution of the trivial connection in the hypothetical Witten's integral. This generalizes a result of Ohtsuki (the n=2 case) which led him to the definition of finite type invariants of 3-manifolds. The proof utilizes some symmetry properties of quantum invariants (of links) derived from the theory of affine Lie algebras and the theory of the Kontsevich integral.
