This is a survey of general aspects of the theory of braided Hopf algebras with emphasis on a special class of braided graded Hopf algebras named tobas. The interest on tobas arises from problems of classification of pointed Hopf algebras. We discuss tobas from different points of view following ideas of Lusztig, Nichols and Schauenburg. We then concentrate on braided Hopf algebras in the Yetter-Drinfeld category over H, where H is the group algebra of a non abelian finite group. We present some finite dimensional examples arising in an unpublished work by Milinski and Schneider.
