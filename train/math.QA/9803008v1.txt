We construct two-parameter deformation of an universal enveloping algebra U(g[u]) of a polynomial loop algebra g[u], where g is a finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra (or superalgebra). This new quantum Hopf algebra called the Drinfeldian D_{q\eta}(g) can be considered as a quantization of U(g[u]) in the direction of a classical r-matrix which is a sum of the simple rational and trigonometric r-matrices. The Drinfeldian D_{q\eta}(g) contains U_{q}(g) as a Hopf subalgebra, moreover U_{q}(g[u]) and Y_{\eta}(g) are its limit quantum algebras when the D_{q\eta}(g) deformation parameters \eta goes to 0 and q goes to 1, respectively. These results are easy generalized to a supercase, i.e. when g is a finite-dimensional contragredient simple superalgebra.
