The quantum general linear supergroup GLq(m|n) is defined and its structure is studied systematically. Quantum homogeneous supervector bundles are introduced following Connes' theory, and applied to develop the representation theory of GLq(m|n). Quantum Frobenius reciprocity is proven, and a Borel - Weil theorem is established for the irreducible covariant and contravariant tensor representations.
