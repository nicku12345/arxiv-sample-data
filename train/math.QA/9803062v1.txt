Combinatorial objects called rigged configurations give rise to q-analogues of certain Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. The Kostka-Foulkes polynomials and two-column Macdonald-Kostka polynomials occur as special cases. Conjecturally these polynomials coincide with the Poincare polynomials of isotypic components of certain graded GL(n)-modules supported in a nilpotent conjugacy class closure in gl(n).
