Let  \mathfrak{g}  be a quasitriangular Lie bialgebra over a field  K  of characteristic zero, and let  \mathfrak{g}^*  be its dual Lie bialgebra. We prove that the formal Poisson group  K\big[\big[\mathfrak{g}^*\big]\big]  is a braided Hopf algebra, thus generalizing a result due to Reshetikhin (in the case  \, \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{sl}(2,K) \, ). The proof is via quantum groups, using the existence of a quasitriangular quantization of  \mathfrak{g}^* , as well as the fact that this one provides also a quantization of  K\big[\big[\mathfrak{g}^*\big]\big] \, .
