We determine the space of 1-point correlation functions associated with the Moonshine module: they are precisely those modular forms of non-negative integral weight which are holomorphic in the upper half plane, have a pole of order at most 1 at infinity, and whose Fourier expansion has constant 0. There are Monster-equivariant analogues in which one naturally associates to each element in the Monster a modular form of fixed weight k, the case k=0 corresponding to the original ``Moonshine'' of Conway and Norton.
