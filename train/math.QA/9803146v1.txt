We study multivariable (bilateral) basic hypergeometric series associated with (type A) Macdonald polynomials. We derive several transformation and summation properties for such series including analogues of Heine's {}_2\phi_1 transformation, the q-Pfaff-Kummer and Euler transformations, the q-Saalsch\"utz summation formula and Sear's transformation for terminating, balanced {}_4\phi_3 series. For bilateral series, we rederive Kaneko's analogue of the {}_1\psi_1 summation formula and give multivariable extensions of Bailey's {}_2\psi_2 transformations.
