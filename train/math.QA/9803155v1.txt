It is known that symmetric orbits in {\bf g}^* for any simple Lie algebra {\bf g} are equiped with a Poisson pencil generated by the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau bracket and the reduced Sklyanin bracket associated to the "canonical" R-matrix. We realize quantization of this Poisson pencil on \cp type orbits (i.e. orbits in sl(n+1)^* whose real compact form is  CP^n) by means of q-deformed Verma modules.
