The universal R-matrix for a class of esoteric (non-standard) quantum groups {\cal U}_q(gl(2N+1)) is constructed as a twisting of the universal R-matrix {\cal R}_S of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum algebras. The main part of the twisting element {\cal F} is chosen to be the canonical element of appropriate pair of separated Hopf subalgebras (quantized Borel's {\cal B}(N) \subset {\cal U}_q(gl(2N+1))), providing the factorization property of {\cal F}. As a result, the esoteric quantum group generators can be expressed in terms of the Drinfeld-Jimbo ones.
