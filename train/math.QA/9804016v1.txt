If H is a Hopf algebra whose square of the antipode is the identity, v\in\l (V)\otimes H is a corepresentation, and \pi :H\to\l (W) is a representation, then u=(id\otimes\pi)v satisfies the equation (t\otimes id)u^{-1}=((t\otimes id)u)^{-1} of the vertex models for subfactors. A universal construction shows that any solution u of this equatio n arises in this way. A more elaborate construction shows that there exists a ``minimal'' triple (H,v,\pi) satisfying (id\otimes\pi)v=u. This paper is devoted to the study of this latter construction of Hopf algebras. If u is unitary we construct a \c^*-norm on H and we find a new description of the standard invariant of the subfactor associated to u. We discuss also the ``twisted'' (i.e. S^2\neq id) case.
