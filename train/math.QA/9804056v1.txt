Let H and K be two finite groups with a properly outer action on the II_1 factor M. We prove that the group type inclusions M^H \subset M \rtimes K, studied earlier by Bisch and Haagerup, have property T in the sense of Popa if and only if the group generated by H and K in the outer automorphism group of M has Kazhdan's property T. This construction yields irreducible, infinite depth subfactors with small Jones indices and property T standard invariant.
