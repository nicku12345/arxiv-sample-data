Two general families of new quantum deformed current algebras are proposed and identified both as infinite Hopf family of algebras, a structure which enable one to define ``tensor products'' of these algebras. The standard quantum affine algebras turn out to be a very special case of both algebra families, in which case the infinite Hopf family structure degenerates into standard Hopf algebras. The relationship between the two algebra families as well as their various special examples are discussed, and the free boson representation is also considered.
