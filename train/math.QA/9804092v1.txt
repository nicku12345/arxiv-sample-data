The author introduces the notion of a quantum form of an algebraic torus. In the case of diagonal algebraic torus we get the algebra of Laurent twisted polynomials. Quantum algebraic torus can be characterized in terms of exact sequences. The author study the center of QAT. In the case of roots of 1 the new examples of central simple algebras are constructed.
