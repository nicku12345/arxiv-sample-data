In this paper, we extend the Drinfeld current realization of quantum affine algebras U_q(\hat {\gg}) and of the Yangians in several directions: we construct current operators for non-simple roots of {\gg}, define a new braid group action in terms of the current operators and describe the universal R-matrix for the corresponding ``Drinfeld'' comultiplication in the form of infinite product and in the form of certain integrals over current operators.
