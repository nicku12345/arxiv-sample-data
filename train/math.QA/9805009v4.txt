Let \hat{\frak g} be an untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra. The quantum group U_h(\hat{\frak g}) (over \mathbb{C}[[h]]) is known to be a quasitriangular Hopf algebra: in particular, it has a universal  R --matrix, which yields an  R --matrix for each pair of representations of U_h(\hat{\frak g}). On the other hand, the quantum group U_q(\hat{\frak g}) (over \mathbb{C}(q) ) also has an  R --matrix for each pair of representations, but it has not a universal  R --matrix so that one cannot say that it is quasitriangular. Following Reshetikin, one introduces the (weaker) notion of braided Hopf algebra: then  U_q(\hat{\frak g}) is a braided Hopf algebra.   In this work we prove that also the unrestricted specializations of U_q(\hat{\frak g}) at roots of 1 are braided: in particular, specializing q at 1 we have that the function algebra F \big[ \hat{H} \big] of the Poisson proalgebraic group \hat{H} dual of \hat{G} (a Kac-Moody group with Lie algebra \hat{\frak g} \,) is braided. This is useful because, despite these specialized quantum groups are not quasitriangular, the braiding is enough for applications, mainly for producing knot invariants. As an example, the action of the  R --matrix on (tensor products of) Verma modules can be specialized at odd roots of 1.
