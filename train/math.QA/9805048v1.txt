An algebra homomorphism \psi from the nonstandard q-deformed (cyclically symmetric) algebra U_q(so_3) to the extension {\hat U}_q(sl_2) of the Hopf algebra U_q(sl_2) is constructed. Not all irreducible representations of U_q(sl_2) can be extended to representations of {\hat U}_q(sl_2). Composing the homomorphism \psi with irreducible representations of {\hat U}_q(sl_2) we obtain representations of U_q(so_3). Not all of these representations of U_q(so_3) are irreducible. Reducible representations of U_q(so_3) are decomposed into irreducible components. In this way we obtain all irreducible representations of U_q(so_3) when q is not a root of unity. A part of these representations turns into irreducible representations of the Lie algebra so_3 when q\to 1. Representations of the other part have no classical analogue. Using the homomorphism \psi it is shown how to construct tensor products of finite dimensional representations of U_q(so_3). Irreducible representations of U_q(so_3) when q is a root of unity are constructed. Part of them are obtained from irreducible representations of {\hat U}_q(sl_2) by means of the homomorphism \psi.
