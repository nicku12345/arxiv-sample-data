A classical result of Loday-Quillen and Tsygan states that the Lie algebra homology of the algebra of stable matrices over an associative algebra is isomorphic, as a Hopf algebra, to the exterior algebra of the cyclic homology of the algebra. In this paper we develop the necessary tools needed to extend extend this result to the category of L_{\infty} algebras.
