By using the Kang-Kashiwara-Misra-Miwa-Nakashima-Nakayashiki crystal base character formula for the basic A_2^{(1)}-module, and the principally specialized Weyl-Kac character formula, we obtain a Rogers-Ramanujan type combinatorial identity for colored partitions. The difference conditions between parts are given by the energy function of certain perfect A_2^{(1)}-crystal. We also recall some other identities for this type of colored partitions, but coming from the vertex operator constructions and with no apparent connection to the crystal base theory.
