We first give a pedagogical introduction to the differential calculus on q-groups and analize the relation between differential calculus and q-Lie algebra. Equivalent definitions of bicovariant differential calculus are studied and their geometrical interpretation is explained. Vectorfields, contraction operator and Lie derivative are defined and their properties discussed. After a review of the geometry of the (multiparametric) linear q-group GL_{q,r}(N) we construct the inhomogeneous q-group IGL_{q,r}(N) as a projection from GL_{q,r}(N+1), i.e. as a quotient of GL_{q,r}(N+1) with respect to a suitable Hopf algebra ideal.   The semidirect product structure of IGL_{q,r}(N) given by the GL_{q,r}(N) q-subgroup times translations is easily analized. A bicovariant calculus on IGL_{q,r}(N) is explicitly obtained as a projection from the one on GL_{q,r}(N+1). The universal enveloping algebra of IGL_{q,r}(N) and its R-matrix formulation are constructed along the same lines.   We proceed similarly in the orthogonal and symplectic case. We find the inhomogeneous multiparametric q-groups of the B_n,C_n,D_n series via a projection from B_{n+1}, C_{n+1},D_{n+1}. We give an R-matrix formulation and discuss real forms. We study their universal enveloping algebras and differential calculi. In particular we obtain the bicovariant calculus on a dilatation-free minimal deformation of the Poincar\'e group ISO_q(3,1).   The projection procedure is also used to construct differential calculi on multiparametric q-orthogonal planes in any dimension N. Real forms are studied and in particular we obtain a q-Minkowski space and its q-deformed phase-space with hermitian operators x^a and p_a.
