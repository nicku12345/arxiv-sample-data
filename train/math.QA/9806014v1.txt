Jordanian quantizations of Lie algebras are studied using the factorizable twists. For a restricted Borel subalgebras {\bf B}^{\vee} of sl(N) the explicit expressions are obtained for the twist element {\cal F}, universal {\cal R}-matrix and the corresponding canonical element {\cal T}. It is shown that the twisted Hopf algebra {\cal U}_{\cal F} ({\bf B}^{\vee}) is self dual. The cohomological properties of the involved Lie bialgebras are studied to justify the existence of a contraction from the Dinfeld-Jimbo quantization to the jordanian one. The construction of the twist is generalized to a certain type of inhomogenious Lie algebras.
