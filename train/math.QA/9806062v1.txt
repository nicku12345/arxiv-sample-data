We study unitarity of the induced representations from coisotropic quantum subgroups which were introduced in math.QA/9804138. We define a real structure on coisotropic subgroups which determines an involution on the homogeneous space. We give general invariance properties for functionals on the homogeneous space which are sufficient to build a unitary representation starting from the induced one. We present the case of the one-dimensional quantum Galilei group, where we have to use in all enerality our definition of quasi-invariant functional.
