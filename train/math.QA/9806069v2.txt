We consider the free {\bf C}-algebra {\cal B}_q with N generators \{\xi_i\}_{i = 1,...,N}, together with a set of N differential operators \{\partial_i\}_{i = 1,...,N} that act as twisted derivations on {\cal B}_q according to the rule \partial_i\xi_j = \delta_{ij} + q_{ij}\xi_j\partial_i; that is, \forall x \in {\cal B}_q, \partial_i(\xi_jx) = \delta_{ij}x + q_{ij}\xi_j\partial_i x, and \partial_i{\bf C} = 0. The suffix q on {\cal B}_q stands for \{q_{ij}\}_{i,j \in \{1,...,N\}} and is interpreted as a point in parameter space, q = \{q_{ij}\}\in {\bf C}^{N^2}. A constant C \in {\cal B}_q is a nontrivial element with the property \partial_iC = 0, i = 1,...,N. To each point in parameter space there correponds a unique set of constants and a differential complex. There are no constants when the parameters q_{ij} are in general position. We obtain some precise results concerning the algebraic surfaces in parameter space on which constants exist. Let {\cal I}_q denote the ideal generated by the constants. We relate the quotient algebras {\cal B}_q' = {\cal B}_q/{\cal I}_q to Yang-Baxter algebras and, in particular, to quantized Kac-Moody algebras. The differential complex is a generalization of that of a quantized Kac-Moody algebra described in terms of Serre generators. Integrability conditions for q-differential equations are related to Hochschild cohomology. It is shown that H^p({\cal B}_q',{\cal B}_q') = 0 for p \geq 1. The intimate relationship to generalized, quantized Kac-Moody algebras suggests an approach to the problem of classification of these algebras.
