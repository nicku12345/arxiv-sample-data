The goal of this paper is to give a new method of constructing finite-dimensional semisimple triangular Hopf algebras, including minimal ones which are non-trivial (i.e. not group algebras). The paper shows that such Hopf algebras are quite abundant. It also discovers an unexpected connection of such Hopf algebras with bijective 1-cocycles on finite groups and set-theoretical solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation defined by Drinfeld.
