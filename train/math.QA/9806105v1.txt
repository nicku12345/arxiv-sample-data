We show that a set of local admissible fields generates a vertex algebra. For an affine Lie algebra \tilde\goth g we construct the corresponding level k vertex operator algebra and we show that level k highest weight \tilde\goth g-modules are modules for this vertex operator algebra. We determine the set of annihilating fields of level k standard modules and we study the corresponding loop \tilde\goth g module---the set of relations that defines standard modules. In the case when \tilde\goth g is of type A_1^{(1)}, we construct bases of standard modules parameterized by colored partitions and, as a consequence, we obtain a series of Rogers-Ramanujan type combinatorial identities.
