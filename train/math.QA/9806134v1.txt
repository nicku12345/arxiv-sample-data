A representation of the Quantum Toroidal Algebra of type sl(N) is constructed on every irreducible integrable highest weight module of the Quantum Affine Algebra of type gl(N). As an intermediate step in the construction, we obtain a quantum analogue of the classical level-rank duality, describing the reciprocal decomposition of the q-Fock space with respect to mutually commutative actions of U_q(gl(N)^) of level L, and U_q(sl(L)^) of level N.
