Multiparametric quantum deformations of gl(2) are studied through a complete classification of gl(2) Lie bialgebra structures. From them, the non-relativistic limit leading to harmonic oscillator Lie bialgebras is implemented by means of a contraction procedure. New quantum deformations of gl(2) together with their associated quantum R-matrices are obtained and other known quantizations are recovered and classified. Several connections with integrable models are outlined.
