We compute the weights, i.e. the values at the minimal idempotents, for the Markov trace on the Hecke algebra of type B and type D. In order to prove the weight formula, we define representations of the Hecke algebra of type B onto a reduced Hecke algebre of type A. To compute the weights for type D we use the inclusion of the Hecke algebra of type D into the Hecke algebra of type B.
