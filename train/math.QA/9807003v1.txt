We study the Hopf equation which is equivalent to the pentagonal equation, from operator algebras. A FRT type theorem is given and new types of quantum groups are constructed. The key role is played now by the classical Hopf modules category. As an application, a five dimensional noncommutative noncocommutative bialgebra is given.
