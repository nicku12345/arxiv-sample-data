The deformed double covering of E(2) group, denoted by \tilde{E}_\kappa(2), is obtained by contraction from the SU_\mu(2). The contraction procedure is then used for producing a new examples of differential calculi: 3D-left covariant calculus on both \tilde{E}_\kappa(2) and the deformed Euclidean group E_\kappa(2) and two different 4D-bicovariant calculi on \tilde{E}_\kappa(2) which correspond to the one 4D-bicovariant calculi on E_\kappa(2) described in Ref.\cite{b14}.
