We study the Long dimodule category in conection with a nonlinear equation; we called the D-equation. The category of Long dimodules will play for the D-equation the same role as the category of Yetter-Drinfel'd (crossed) modules play for the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. A FRT type theorem is given and new class of coalgebras are introduced. Several new examples of noncommutative noncocomutative bialgebras are given.
