Dirac's contour representation is extended to parabose and parafermi systems by use of deformed algebra techniques. In this analytic representation the action of the paraparticle annihilation operator is equivalent to a deformed differentiation which encodes the statistics of the paraparticle. In the parafermi case, the derivative's ket-domain is degree p polynomials.
