Eigenstates of the parabose and parafermi creation operators are constructed. In the Dirac contour representation, the parabose eigenstates correspond to the dual vectors of the parabose coherent states. In order p=2, conserved-charge parabose creation operator eigenstates are also constructed. The contour forms of the associated resolutions of unity are obtained.
