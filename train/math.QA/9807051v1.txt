Drinfeld twist is applied to the Lie algebra gl(2) so that a two-parametric deformation of it is obtained, which is identical to the Jordanian deformation of the gl(2) obtained by Aneva et al. The same twist element is applied to deform the Lie superalgebra sl(1/2), since the gl(2) is embedded into the sl(1/2). By making use of the FRT-formalism, we construct a deformation of the Lie supergroup  SL(1/2).
