We construct ergodic actions of compact quantum groups on C^*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, and exhibit phenomena of such actions that are of a different nature from ergodic actions of compact Lie groups.   In particular, we construct: (1). ergodic actions of the compact quantum groups A_u(Q) on the Powers factors; (2). ergodic actions of the compact quantum groups A_u(n) on the hyperfinite II_1 factor; (3). ergodic actions of the compact quantum groups A_u(Q) on the Cuntz algebras; (4). ergodic actions of general compact quantum groups on their homogeneous spaces and an example of a non-homogeneous classical space that nevertheless admits an ergodic action of a compact quantum group.
