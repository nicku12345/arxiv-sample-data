A general construction is given for a class of invertible maps between the classical U(sl(2)) and the Jordanian U_{h}(sl(2)) algebras. Different maps are directly useful in different contexts. Similarity trasformations connecting them, in so far as they can be explicitly constructed, enable us to translate results obtained in terms of one to the other cases. Here the role of the maps is studied in the context of construction of twist operators between the cocommutative and noncocommutative coproducts of the U(sl(2)) and U_{h}(sl(2)) algebras respectively. It is shown that a particular map called the `minimal twist map' implements the simplest twist given directly by the factorized form of the {\cal R}_{h}-matrix of Ballesteros-Herranz. For other maps the twist has an additional factor obtainable in terms of the similarity transformation relating the map in question to the minimal one. The series in powers of h for the operator performing this transformation may be obtained up to some desired order, relatively easily. An explicit example is given for one particularly interesting case. Similarly the classical and the Jordanian antipode maps may be interrelated by a similarity transformation. For the `minimal twist map' the transforming operator is determined in a closed form.
