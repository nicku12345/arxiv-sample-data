We construct a commutative ring with identity which extends the ring of characters of finite dimensional representations of sl(3). It is generated by characters with values in the group ring Z[\tilde{W}] of the extended affine Weyl group of \hat{sl}(3)_k at k\not \in Q. The `quantised' version at rational level k+3=3/p realises the fusion rules of a WZW conformal field theory based on admissible representations of \hat{sl}(3)_k.
