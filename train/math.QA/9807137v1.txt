A model of particle interacting with quantum field is considered. The model includes as particular cases the polaron model and non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics. We show that the field operators obey q-commutation relations with q depending on time. After the stochastic (or van Hove) limit, due to the nonlinearity, the atomic and field degrees of freedom become entangled in the sense that the field and the atomic variables no longer commute but give rise to a new algebra with new commutation relations replacing the Boson ones. This new algebra allows to give a simple proof of the fact that the non crossing half-planar diagrams give the dominating contribution in a weak coupling regime and to calculate explicitly the correlations associated to the new algebra. The above results depend crucially on the fact that we do not introduce any dipole or multipole approximation.
