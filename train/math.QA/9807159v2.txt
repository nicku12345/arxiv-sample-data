We study one and two parameter quantizations of the function algebra on a semisimple orbit in the coadjoint representation of a simple Lie group subject to the condition that the multiplication on the quantized algebra is invariant under action of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group. We prove that the corresponding Poisson bracket must be the sum of the so-called R-matrix bracket and an invariant bracket. We classify such brackets for all semisimple orbits and show that they form a family of dimension equal to the rank equal to the second cohomology group of the orbit and then we quantize these brackets. A two parameter (or double) quantization corresponds to a pair of compatible Poisson brackets: the first is as described above and the second is the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau bracket on the orbit. Not all semisimple orbits admit a compatible pair of Poisson brackets. We classify the semisimple orbits for which such pairs exist and construct the corresponding two parameter quantization of these pairs in some of the cases.
