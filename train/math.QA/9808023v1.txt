(1) Utilizing a Braid group action on a completion of U_q(\hat{sl_{n+1}}), an algebra homomorphism from the toroidal algebra U_q(sl_{n+1,tor}) (n\ge 2) with fixed parameter to a completion of U_q(\hat{gl_{n+1}}) is obtained.   (2) The toroidal actions by Saito induces a level 0 U'_q(\hat{sl_{n+1}}) action on level 1 integrable highest weight modules of U_q(\hat{sl_{n+1}}). Another level 0 U'_q(\hat{sl_{n+1}}) action is defined by Jimbo, et al., in the case n=1. Using the fact that the intertwiners of U_q(\hat{sl_{n+1}}) modules are intertwiners of toroidal modules for an appropriate comultiplication, the relation between these two level 0 U'_q(\hat{sl_{n+1}}) actions is clarified.
