(2+2)-dimensional quantum mechanical q-phase space which is the semi-direct product of the quantum plane E_q(2)/U(1) and its dual algebra e_q(2)/u(1) is constructed. Commutation and the resulting uncertainty relations are studied. ``Quantum mechanical q-Hamiltonian'' of the motion over the quantum plane is derived and the solution of the Schroedinger equation for the q-semiclassical motion governed by the expectation value of that Hamiltonian is solved.
