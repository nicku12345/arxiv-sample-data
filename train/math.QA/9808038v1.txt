In this short note, we show that the Ginzburg-Vasserot map between the quantum affine algebra of type A_(n-1) and the equivariant K-theory group of the Steinberg Variety (of n-step flags in C^d) restricts and remains surjective at the level of the integral forms. In particular, this shows that the parametrization of irreducible, finite-dimensional modules and the Kazhdan-Lusztig multiplicity formulas are valid for the (restricted) specialization at roots of unity.
