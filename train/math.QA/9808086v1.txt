For the 9-dimensional bicovariant differential calculi on the Hopf algebra O(O_q(3)) several kinds of exterior algebras are examined. The corresponding dimensions, bicovariant subbimodules and eigenvalues of the antisymmetrizer are given. Exactly one of the exterior algebras studied by the authors has a unique left invariant form with maximal degree.
