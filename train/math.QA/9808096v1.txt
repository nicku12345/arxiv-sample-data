We introduce a generalized version of a q-Schur algebra (of parabolic type) for arbitrary Hecke algebras over extended Weyl groups. We describe how the decomposition matrix of a finite group with split BN-pair, with respect to a non-describing prime, can be partially described by the decomposition matrices of suitably chosen q-Schur algebras. We show that the investigated structures occur naturally in finite groups of Lie type.
