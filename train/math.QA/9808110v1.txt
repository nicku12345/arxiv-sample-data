2-Dim quantum Poincare` Group E_q(1,1) at roots of unity, its dual U_q(e(1,1)) and some of its homogeneous spaces are introduced. Invariant integrals on E_q(1,1) and its invariant discrete subgroup E(1,1\mid p) are constructed. *-Representations of the quantum algebra U_q(e(1,1)) constructed in the homogeneous space SO(1,1\mid p) are integrated to the pseudo-unitary representations of E_q(1,1) by means of the universal T-matrix. U_q(e(1,1)) is realized on the quantum plane E_q^{(1,1)} and the eigenfunctions of the complete set of observables are obtained in the angular momentum and momentum basis. The matrix elements of the pseudo-unitary irreducible representations are given in terms of the cut off q-exponential and q-Bessel functions whose properties we also investigate.
