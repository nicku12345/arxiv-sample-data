This paper finds for all orthogonal algebras (i.e. the B and D series) all modular invariant 1-loop partition functions at levels 1,2,3. Previously, only those at level 1 were classified. An extraordinary number of exceptionals appear at level 2 -- indeed this is the primary motivation for this paper -- and we find infinitely many new ones there. The only level 3 exceptionals occur for B_2 and D_7, and the latter appear to be new. The B_{2,3} and D_{7,3} exceptionals are cousins of the "E_6" and "E_8" exceptionals in the A-D-E classification for affine A_1, while the level 2 exceptionals are related to the lattice invariants of affine u(1).
