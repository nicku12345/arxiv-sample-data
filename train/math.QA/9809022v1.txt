Let L be the A_1 root lattice and G a finite subgroup of Aut(V_L), where V_L is the associated lattice VOA (in this case, Aut(V) is isomorphic to PSL(2,\Bbb C)). The fixed point subVOA, V^G was studied in q-alg/9710017, which finds a set of generators and determines the automorphism group when G is cyclic (from the "A-series") or dihedral (from the "D-series"). In the present article, we obtain analogous results for the remaining possibilities for G, that it belong to the "E-series": G\cong Alt_4, Alt_5 or Sym_4.
