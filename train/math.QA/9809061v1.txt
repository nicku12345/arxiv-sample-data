The spaces of linear differential operators on {\mathbb{R}}^n acting on tensor densities of degree \lambda and the space of functions on T^*{\mathbb{R}}^n which are polynomial on the fibers are not isomorphic as modules over the Lie algebra \Vect({\mathbb{R}}^n) of vector fields on {\mathbb{R}}^n. However, these modules are isomorphic as sl(n+1,{\mathbb{R}})-modules where sl(n+1,{\mathbb{R}})\subset \Vect({\mathbb{R}}^n) is the Lie algebra of infinitesimal projective transformations. In addition, such an sl_{n+1}-equivariant bijection is unique (up to normalization). This leads to a notion of projectively equivariant quantization and symbol calculus for a manifold endowed with a (flat) projective structure. We apply the sl_{n+1}-equivariant symbol map to study the \Vect(M)-modules of linear differential operators acting on tensor densities, for an arbitrary manifold M.
