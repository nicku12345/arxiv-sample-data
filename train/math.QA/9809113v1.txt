Skein modules are the main objects of an algebraic topology based on knots (or position). In the same spirit as Leibniz we would call our approach "algebra situs." When looking at the panorama of skein modules we see, past the rolling hills of homologies and homotopies, distant mountains - the Kauffman bracket skein module, and farther off in the distance skein modules based on other quantum invariants. We concentrate here on the basic properties of the Kauffman bracket skein module; properties fundamental in further development of the theory. In particular we consider the relative Kauffman bracket skein module, and we analyze skein modules of I-bundles over surfaces.
