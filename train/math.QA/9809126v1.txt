The lattice cell in the {i+1}^{st} row and {j+1}^{st} column of the positive quadrant of the plane is denoted (i,j). If \mu is a partition of n+1, we denote by \mu/ij the diagram obtained by removing the cell (i,j) from the (French) Ferrers diagram of \mu. We set \Delta_{\mu/ij}=\det \| x_i^{p_j}y_i^{q_j} \|_{i,j=1}^n, where (p_1,q_1),... ,(p_n,q_n) are the cells of \mu/ij, and let {\bf M}_{\mu/ij} be the linear span of the partial derivatives of \Delta_{\mu/ij}. The bihomogeneity of \Delta_{\mu/ij} and its alternating nature under the diagonal action of S_n gives {\bf M}_{\mu/ij} the structure of a bigraded S_n-module. We conjecture that {\bf M}_{\mu/ij} is always a direct sum of k left regular representations of S_n, where k is the number of cells that are weakly north and east of (i,j) in \mu. We also make a number of conjectures describing the precise nature of the bivariate Frobenius characteristic of {\bf M}_{\mu/ij} in terms of the theory of Macdonald polynomials. On the validity of these conjectures, we derive a number of surprising identities. In particular, we obtain a representation theoretical interpretation of the coefficients appearing in some Macdonald Pieri Rules.
