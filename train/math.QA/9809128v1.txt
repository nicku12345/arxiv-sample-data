This work studies the remarkable relationships that hold among certain m-tuples of the Garsia-Haiman modules  {\bf M}_\mu and corresponding elements of the Macdonald basis. We recall that {\bf M}_\mu is defined for a partition \mu\part n, as the linear span of derivatives of a certain bihomogeneous polynomial \Delta_ \mu(x,y) in the variables x_1,x_2,..., x_n, y_1,y_2,..., y_n. It has been conjectured by Garsia and Haiman that {\bf M}_\mu has n! dimensions and that its bigraded Frobenius characteristic is given by the symmetric polynomial {\widetilde{H}}_\mu(x;q,t)=\sum_{\lambda\part n} S_\lambda(X) {\widetilde{K}}_{\lambda\mu}(q,t) where the {\widetilde{K}}_{\lambda\mu}(q,t) are related to the Macdonald q,t-Kostka coefficients  K_{\lambda\mu}(q,t) by the identity {\widetilde{K}}_{\lambda\mu}(q,t)=K_{\lambda\mu}(q,1/t)t^{n(\mu)} with n(\mu) the x-degree of \Delta_ \mu(x;y). Computer data has suggested that as \nu varies among the immediate predecessors of a partition \mu, the spaces {\bf M}_\nu behave like a boolean lattice. We formulate a number of remarkable conjectures about the Macdonald polynomials. In particular we obtain a representation theoretical interpretation for some of the symmetries that can be found in the computed tables of q,t-Kostka coefficients.
