The notion of anyonic Wick algebras is introduced and the corresponding second quantisation procedure is discussed. Applications to the physics of 2D anyonic matter are presented. In particular the existence of thermodynamics in the infinite volume for the case of Leinaas-Myrheim potentials is presented. Additionally a new class of states corresponding to quasifree thermal states on some Wick algebras is described.
