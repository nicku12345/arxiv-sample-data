We show how the data of a finite dimensional weak C^*-Hopf algebra can be encoded into a pair (H,V) where H is a finite dimensional Hilbert space and V: H \o H --> H \o H is a partial isometry satisfying, among others, the pentagon equation. In case of V being unitary we recover the Baaj-Skandalis multiplicative unitary of the discrete compact type. Relation to the pseudo- multiplicative unitary approach proposed by J.-M. Vallin and M. Enock is also discussed.
