Using deformation quantization and suitable 2 by 2 quantum R-matrices we show that a list of Toda like classical integrable systems given by Y.B.Suris is quantum integrable in the sense that the classical conserved quantities (which are already in involution with respect to the Poisson bracket) commute with respect to the standard star-product of Weyl type in flat 2n-dimensional space.
