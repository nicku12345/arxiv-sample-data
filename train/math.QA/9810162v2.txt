It is shown, that each Lifting cocycle \Psi_{2n+1},\Psi_{2n+3},\Psi_{2n+5},... ([Sh1], [Sh2]) on the Lie algebra \Dif_n of polynomial differential operators on an n-dimensional complex vector space is the sum of two cocycles, its even and odd part. We study in more details the first case n=1. It is shown, that any nontrivial linear combination of two 3-cocycles on the Lie algebra \Dif_1, arising from the 3-cocycle~\Psi_3, is not cohomologous to zero, in a contradiction with the Feigin conjecture~[F]. The new conjecture on the cohomology H^\ndot_\Lie(\Dif_1;\C) is made.
