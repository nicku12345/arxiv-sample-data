We use the fusion construction in the twisted quantum affine algebras to obtain a unified method to deform the wedge product for classical Lie algebras. As a byproduct we uniformly realize all non-spin fundamental modules for quantized enveloping algebras of classical types, and show that they admit natural crystal bases as modules for the (derived) twisted quantum affine algebra. These crystal bases are parametrized in terms of the q-wedge products.
