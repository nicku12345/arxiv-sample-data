Yang-Baxter system related to quantum doubles is introduced and large class of both continuous and discrete symmetries of the solution manifold are determined. Strategy for solution of the system based on the symmetries is suggested and accomplished in the dimension two.The complete list of invertible solutions of the system is presented.
