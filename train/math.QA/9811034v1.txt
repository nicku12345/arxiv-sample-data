A simplified construction of representations is presented for the quantized enveloping algebra Uq(g), with g being a simple complex Lie algebra belonging to one of the four principal series A, B, C or D. The carrier representation space is the quantized algebra of polynomials in antiholomorphic coordinate functions on the big cell of a coadjoint orbit of K where K is the compact simple Lie group with the Lie algebra g - the compact form of g.
