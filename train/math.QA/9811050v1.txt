Recently N.Jing discovered a certain combinatorial identity from validity of the Serre relations in some vertex representations of quantum Kac-Moody algebras.   We generalize this identity, in particular, extending it from polynomials to elliptic functions, and interprete the obtained identities in terms of tensor products of evaluation representations of the quantum loop algebra U_q(\tilde{gl_2}) or the elliptic quantum group E_{\rho,\gamma}(sl_2).
