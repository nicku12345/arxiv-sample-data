The paper deals with three topics on coquasitriangular bialgebras. A characterization of universal r-forms in terms of Yetter-Drinfeld modules is given. All universal r-forms for the coordinate Hopf algebras of the quantum groups GL_q(N), SL_q(N), O_q(N) and Sp_q(N) are described. It is well-known that the square of the antipode of a coquasitriangular Hopf algebra A with universal r-form r can be expressed by means of the linear functional f_r(a)=r(a_{(1)}\otimes S(a_{(2)})), a\in A. For the standard compact matrix groups the functional f_r is related to the Woronowicz modular character f_{-2}.
