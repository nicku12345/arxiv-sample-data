We prove a direct analogue of the classical Duflo formula in the case of L_\infty-algebras. We conjecture an analogous formula in the case of an arbitrary Q-manifold. When G is a compact connected Lie group, the Duflo theorem for the Q-manifold (\Pi TG,d_{DR}) is exactly the Duflo theorem for the Lie algebra g = Lie G. The corresponding theorem for the Q-manifold (\Pi TM,d_{DR}), where M is an arbitrary smooth manifold, is a generalization of the Duflo theorem for the case of smooth manifolds. On the other hand, the Duflo theorem for the Q-manifold (\Pi \bar T_{hol} M, \bar\partial), where M is a complex manifold, is a generalization of the M.
