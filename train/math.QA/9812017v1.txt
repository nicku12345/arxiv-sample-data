Modified universal R-matrices, associated with the central extension (through the Drinfeld's double construction) of the quantum groups U_q(sl_n), are realized through an infinite dimensional spectral parameter dependent solution for the tetrahedron equation, provided a certain identity on q-exponentials holds true.
