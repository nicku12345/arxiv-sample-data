We give an interpretation of the double affine Hecke algebra of Cherednik as the (suitably regularized) algebra of double cosets of a group G by a subgroup J, extending the well known interpretations of finite and affine Hecke algebras. In this interpretation, G consists of K-points of a split reductive group where K is a 2-dimensional local field such as Q_p((t)) or F_q((t_1))((t_2)), and J is a certain analog of the Iwahori subgroup.
