We classify nontrivial deformations of the standard embedding of the Lie algebra \Vect(S^1) of smooth vector fields on the circle, into the Lie algebra~\PD(S^1) of pseudodifferential symbols on S^1. This approach leads to deformations of the central charge induced on \Vect(S^1) by the canonical central extension of \PD(S^1). As a result we obtain a quantized version of the second Bernoulli polynomial.
