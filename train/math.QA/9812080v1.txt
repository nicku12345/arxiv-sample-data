The symmetric Macdonald polynomials are able to be constructed out of the non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. This allows us to develop the theory of the symmetric Macdonald polynomials by first developing the theory of their non-symmetric counterparts. In taking this approach we are able to obtain new results as well as simpler and more accessible derivations of a number of the known fundamental properties of both kinds of polynomials.
