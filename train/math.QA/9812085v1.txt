Let (\Gamma,d) be the 3D-calculus or the 4D_{\pm}-calculus on the quantum group SU_q(2). We describe all pairs (\pi, F) of a *-representation \pi of O(SU_q(2)) and of a symmetric operator F on the representation space satisfying a technical condition concerning its domain such that there exist a homomorphism of first order differential calculi which maps dx into the commutator [iF,\pi(x)] for x\in O(SU_q(2)). As an application commutator representations of the 2-dimensional left-covariant calculus on Podles' quantum 2-sphere S^2_{qc} with c=0 are given.
