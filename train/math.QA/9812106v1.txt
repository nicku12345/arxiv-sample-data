In a recent paper it was shown that the response of an integrable QFT under variation of the Unruh temperature can be computed from a S-matrix preserving deformation of the form factor approach. We give explicit expressions for the deformed two-particle formfactors for various integrable models: The Sine-Gordon and SU(2) Thirring model, several perturbed minimal CFTs and the real coupling affine Toda series. A uniform pattern is found to emerge when both the S-matrix and the deformed form factors are expressed in terms Barnes' multi-periodic functions.
