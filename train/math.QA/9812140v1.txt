Any deformation of a Weyl or Clifford algebra can be realized through some change of generators in the undeformed algebra. Here we briefly describe and motivate our systematic procedure for constructing all such changes of generators for those particular deformations where the original algebra is covariant undersome Lie group and the deformed algebra is covariant under the corresponding quantum group.
