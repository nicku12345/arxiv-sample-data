q-vertex operators for quantum affine algebras have played important role in the theory of solvable lattice models and the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. Explicit constructions of these vertex operators for most level one modules are known for classical types except for type C_n^{(1)}, where the level -1/2 have been constructed. In this paper we survey these results for the quantum affine algebras of types A_n^{(1)}, B_n^{(1)}, C_n^{(1)} and D_n^{(1)}.
