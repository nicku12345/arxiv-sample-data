A bijection is defined from Littlewood-Richardson tableaux to rigged configurations. It is shown that this map preserves the appropriate statistics, thereby proving a quasi-particle expression for the generalized Kostka polynomials, which are q-analogues of multiplicities in tensor products of irreducible general linear group modules indexed by rectangular partitions.
