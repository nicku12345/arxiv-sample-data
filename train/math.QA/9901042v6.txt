The free analogues of U(n) in Woronowicz's compact quantum group theory are the quantum groups \{A_u(F)|F\in GL(n,\mathbb C)\} introduced by Van Daele and Wang. We classify here their irreducible representations. Their fusion rules turn to be related to the combinatorics of Voiculescu's circular variable. If F\bar{F}\in\mathbb R I_n we find an embedding A_u(F)_{red}\subset C(\mathbb T)*_{red}A_o(F), where A_o(F) is the deformation of SU(2) that we previously studied. We use the representation theory and Powers' method for showing that the reduced algebras A_u(F)_{red} are simple, with at most one trace.
