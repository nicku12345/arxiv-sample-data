An algebra homomorphism \psi from the q-deformed algebra U_q({\rm iso}_2) with generating elements I, T_1, T_2 and defining relations [I,T_2]_q=T_1, [T_1,I]_q=T_2, [T_2,T_1]_q=0 (where [A,B]_q=q^{1/2}AB-q^{-1/2}BA) to the extension {\hat U}_q({\rm m}_2) of the Hopf algebra U_q({\rm m}_2) is constructed. The algebra U_q({\rm iso}_2) at q=1 leads to the Lie algebra {\rm iso}_2 \sim {\rm m}_2 of the group ISO(2) of motions of the Euclidean plane. The Hopf algebra U_q({\rm m}_2) is treated as a Hopf q-deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of {\rm iso}_2 and is well-known in the literature. Not all irreducible representations of U_q({\rm m}_2) can be extended to representations of the extension {\hat U}_q({\rm m}_2). Composing the homomorphism \psi with irreducible representations of {\hat U}_q({\rm m}_2) we obtain representations of U_q({\rm iso}_2). Not all of these representations of U_q({\rm iso}_2) are irreducible. The reducible representations of U_q({\rm iso}_2) are decomposed into irreducible components. In this way we obtain all irreducible representations of U_q({\rm iso}_2) when q is not a root of unity. A part of these representations turns into irreducible representations of the Lie algebra iso_2 when q\to 1. Representations of the other part have no classical analogue.
