In this paper we answer the question: `what kind of a structure can a general multicategory be enriched in?' The answer is, in a sense to be made precise, that a multicategory of one type can be enriched in a multicategory of the type one level up.   In the case of ordinary categories this reduces to something surprising: a category may be enriched in an `fc-multicategory', a very general kind of 2-dimensional structure encompassing monoidal categories, plain multicategories, bicategories and double categories. (It turns out that fc-multicategories also provide a natural setting for the bimodules construction.) An extended application is given: the relaxed multicategories of Borcherds and Soibelman are explained in terms of enrichment.
