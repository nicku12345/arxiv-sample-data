We investigated the representation thoery of an Ariki-Koike algebra whose Poincare polynomial associated with the "bottom", i.e., the subgroup on which the symmetric group acts, is non-zero in the base field. We proved that the module category of such an Ariki-Koike algebra is Morita equivalent to the module category of a direct sum of tensor products of Hecke algebras associated with certain symmetric groups. We also generalized this Morita equivalence theorem to give a Morita equivalenve between a q-Schur^m algebra and a direct sum of tensor products of certain q-Schur algebras.
