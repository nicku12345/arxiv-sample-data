Let U be the quantum group with divided powers in p-th root of unity for prime p. For any two-sided cell A in the corresponding affine Weyl group one associates tensor ideal in the category of tilting modules over U. In this note we show that for any cell A there exists tilting module T from the corresponding tensor ideal such that biggest power of p which divides dim T is p^{a(A)} where a(A) is Lusztig's a-function. In new version some typos are corrected and exposition is improved following suggestions of the referee.
