Let U be the quantum group with divided powers in l-th root of unity and let u\subset U be the Frobenius kernel. V.Ginzburg and S.Kumar proved that the cohomology algebra of u with trivial coefficients is isomorphic to the functions algebra of the nilpotent cone of the corresponding Lie algebra. In this note we show that there exists tilting module T such that the cohomology of u with coefficients in T is isomorphic to the functions algebra of the closure of the subregular nilpotent orbit.
