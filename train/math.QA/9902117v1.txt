We describe, for a few small examples, the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface crossed with an interval. If the surface is a punctured torus the result is a quantization of the symmetric algebra in three variables (and an algebra closely related to a cyclic quantization of U(so_3). For a torus without boundary we obtain a quantization of "the symmetric homologies" of a torus (equivalently, the coordinate ring of the SL_2(C)-character variety of Z \oplus Z). Presentations are also given for the four punctured sphere and twice punctured torus. We conclude with an investigation of central elements and zero divisors.
