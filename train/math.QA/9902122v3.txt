Let p be an odd prime and r be relatively prime to p. Let G be a finite p-group. Suppose an oriented 3-manifold M-tilde has a free G-action with orbit space M. We consider certain Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev SU(2) invariants w_r(M). We will give a fomula for w_r(M) in terms of the defect of M-tilde --> M and the number of elements in G. We also give a version of this result if M and M-tilde contain framed links or colored fat graphs. We give similar formulas for non-free actions which hold for a specified finite set of values for r.
