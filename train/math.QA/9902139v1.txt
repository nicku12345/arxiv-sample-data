The trace of intertwining operators over the level one irreducible highest weight modules of the quantum affine algebra of type A_{N-1} is studied. It is proved that the trace function gives a basis of the solution space of the qKZ equation at a generic level. The highest-highest matrix element of the composition of intertwining operators is explicitly calculated. The integral formula for the trace is presented.
