A natural family of quantized matrix algebras is introduced. It includes the two best studied such. Located inside {\s U}_q(A_{2n-1}), it consists of quadratic algebras with the same Hilbert series as polynomials in n^2 variables. We discuss their general properties and investigate some members of the family in great detail with respect to associated varieties, degrees, centers, and symplectic leaves. Finally, the space of rank r matrices becomes a Poisson submanifold, and there is an associated tensor category of \rank\leq r matrices.
