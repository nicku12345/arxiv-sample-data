We prove that the global base of the modified quantum algebra of affine GL_N is compatible with the intersection cohomology base of the convolution algebra of the affine flag variety. As a consequence we prove a recent conjecture of Lusztig on the compatibility of the intersection cohomology base with respect to transfer maps.
