A group theoretical understanding of the two dimensional fractional supersymmetry is given in terms of the quantum Poincare group at roots of unity. The fractional supersymmetry algebra and the quantum group dual to it are presented and the pseudo-unitary, irreducible representations of them are obtained. The matrix elements of these representations are explicitly constructed.
