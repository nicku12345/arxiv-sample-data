Let A be a Z-graded associative algebra and let \rho be an irreducible N-graded representation of A on W with finite-dimensional homogeneous subspaces. Then it is proved that \rho(\tilde{A})=gl_{J}(W), where \tilde{A} is the completion of A with respect to a certain topology and gl_{J}(W) is the subalgebra of \End W, generated by homogeneous endomorphisms. It is also proved that an N-graded vector space W with finite-dimensional homogeneous spaces is the only continuous irreducible N-graded gl_{J}(W)-module up to equivalence, where gl_{J}(W) is considered as a topological algebra in a certain natural way, and that any continuous N-graded gl_{J}(W)-module is a direct sum of some copies of W. A duality for certain subalgebras of gl_{J}(W) is also obtained.
