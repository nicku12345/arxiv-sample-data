A detailed study is made of the noncommutative geometry of R^3_q, the quantum space covariant under the quantum group SO_q(3). For each of its two SO_q(3)-covariant differential calculi we find its metric, the corresponding frame and two torsion-free covariant derivatives that are metric compatible up to a conformal factor and which yield both a vanishing linear curvature. A discussion is given of various ways of imposing reality conditions. The delicate issue of the commutative limit is discussed at the formal algebraic level. Two rather different ways of taking the limit are suggested, yielding respectively S^2\times R and R^3 as the limit Riemannian manifold.
