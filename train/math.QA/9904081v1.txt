By studying ``points of the underlying quantum groups''of coquasitriangular Hopf (face) algebras, we construct ribbon categories for each lattice models without spectral parameter of both vertex and face type. Also, we give a classification of the braiding and the ribbon structure on quantized classical groups and modular tensor categories closely related to quantum SU(N)_L-invariants of 3-manifolds.
