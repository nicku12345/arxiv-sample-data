We find a new braided Hopf structure for the algebra satisfied by the entries of the braided matrix BSL_q(2). A new nonbraided algebra whose coalgebra structure is the same as the braided one is found to be a two parameter deformed algebra. It is found that this algebra is not a comodule algebra under adjoint coaction. However, it is shown that for a certain value of one of the deformation parameters the braided algebra becomes a comodule algebra under the coaction of this nonbraided algebra. The transmutation of the nonbraided algebra to the braided one is constructed explicitly.
