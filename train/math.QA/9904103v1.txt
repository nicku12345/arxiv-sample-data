We prove that, for the quon algebra, which interpolates between the Bose and Fermi statistics and depends on a free parameter q,it is possible to build an su(2) irreducible representation. One of the consequences of this fact is that the quons couple via the same angular momentum coupling rules obeyed by ordinary bosons and fermions.
