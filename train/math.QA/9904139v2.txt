We study finitely generated projective modules over noncommutative tori. We prove that for every module E with constant curvature connection the corresponding element [E] of the K-group is a generalized quadratic exponent and, conversely, for every positive generalized quadratic exponent \mu in the K-group one can find such a module E with constant curvature connection that [E] = \mu . In physical words we give necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of 1/2 BPS states in terms of topological numbers.
