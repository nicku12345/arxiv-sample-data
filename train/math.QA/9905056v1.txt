Let A \subset H be a finite centralizing extension of noetherian Hopf algebras, and let X denote the group of characters of H that restrict to the augmentation map on A. Our main results provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the fibers of the canonical surjection from spec H onto spec A to coincide with the X-orbits in spec H. In particular, all of the fibers are X-orbits if and only if the fiber over the augmentation ideal of A is an X-orbit.   An application to the representation theory of quantum function algebras, at roots of unity, is presented.
