In this paper, we present the hidden symmetry behind the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan-Semenov-Tian-Shansky realization of quantum affine superalgebras U_q(\hat {osp}(1,2)) and add the q-Serre relation to the Drinfeld realization of U_q(\hat {osp}(1,2)) (math.QA/9712011) derived from the FRTS realization.
