The q-deformed version of the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction is extended to the case of the algebra of 'complex size matrices'; this construction generalizes earlier results of B.Khesin and F.Malikov on universal DS reduction and follows the pattern of recent studies of q-deformed DS reduction which were started by E.Frenkel, N.Reshetikhin and one of the authors.
