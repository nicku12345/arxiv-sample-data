We show that the physical states of a 10 dimensional superstring moving on a torus form a generalized Kac-Moody superalgebra. This gives the first explicit realizations of these algebras. For a special torus the denominator function of this algebra is an automorphic form so that we can determine the simple roots. We call this algebra the fake monster superalgebra.
