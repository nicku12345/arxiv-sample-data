In 1978 Kostant suggested the Whittaker model of the center of the universal enveloping algebra U(g) of a complex simple Lie algebra g. The main result is that the center of U(g) is isomorphic to a commutative subalgebra in U(b), where b is a Borel subalgebra in g. This observation is used in the theory of principal series representations of the corresponding Lie group G and in the proof of complete integrability of the quantum Toda lattice.   In this paper we generalize the Kostant's construction to quantum groups. In our construction we use quantum analogues of regular nilpotent elements defined in math.QA/9812107.   Using the Whittaker model of the center of 5the algebra U_h(g) we define quantum deformations of Whittaker modules. The new Whittaker model is also applied to the deformed quantum Toda lattice recently studied by Etingof in math.QA/9901053. We give new proofs of his results which resemble the original Kostant's proofs for the quantum Toda lattice.
