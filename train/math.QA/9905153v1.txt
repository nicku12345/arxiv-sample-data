A formula is derived for the fixed point resolution matrices of simple current extended WZW-models and coset conformal field theories. Unlike the analogous matrices for unextended WZW-models, these matrices are in general not symmetric, and they may have field-dependent twists. They thus provide non-trivial realizations of the general conditions presented in earlier work with Fuchs and Schweigert.
