In this paper we classify triangular semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf algebras over any algebraically closed field k. Namely, we construct, for each positive integer N, relatively prime to the characteristic of k if it is positive, a bijection between the set of isomorphism classes of triangular semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf algebras of dimension N over k, and the set of isomorphism classes of quadruples (G,H,V,u), where G is a group of order N, H is a subgroup of G, V is an irreducible projective representation of H over k of dimension |H|^{1/2}, and u\in G is a central element of order \le 2.   This classification implies, in particular, that any triangular semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf algebra over k can be obtained from a group algebra by a twist. We also answer positively the question from our previous paper whether the group underlying a minimal triangular semisimple Hopf algebra is solvable. We conclude by showing that any triangular semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf algebra over k of dimension bigger than 1 contains a non-trivial grouplike element.   The classification uses Deligne's theorem on Tannakian categories and the results of a paper of Movshev in an essential way. The proof of solvability and existence of grouplike elements relies on a theorem of Howlett and Isaacs that any group of central type is solvable, which is proved using the classification of finite simple groups. The classification in positive characteristic relies also on the lifting functor from our previous paper.
