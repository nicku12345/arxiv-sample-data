A noncommutative algebra A, called an algebraic noncommutative geometry, is defined, with a parameter \epsilon in the centre. When \epsilon is set to zero, the commutative algebra A^0 of algebraic functions on an algebraic manifold M is obtained. This A^0 is a subalgebra of C(M), which is dense if M is compact. The generators of A define an immersion of M into R^n, and M inherits a Poisson structure as the limit of the commutator. Thus A is a quantisation of a Poisson manifold. If an ordering convention is prescribed for A then a star product on M is obtained. Homomorphism and isomorphisms between noncommutative geometries are defined, and the map from A to the Heisenberg algebra is used both to give an analogue of a coordinate chart, and to give A a quantum group structure. Examples of algebraic noncommutative geometries are given, which include R^n, T^\star S^2, T^2, S^2 and surfaces of rotation. A definition of a metric on M which can be extended to noncommutative geometry is given and this is used in an application of noncommutative geometry to the numerical analysis of surfaces.
