We introduce a new 2-parameter family of sigma models exhibiting Poisson-Lie T-duality on a quasitriangular Poisson-Lie group G. The models contain previously known models as well as a new 1-parameter line of models having the novel feature that the Lagrangian takes the simple form L=E(u^{-1}u_+,u^{-1}u_-) where the generalised metric E is constant (not dependent on the field u as in previous models). We characterise these models in terms of a global conserved G-invariance. The models on G=SU_2 and its dual G^\star are computed explicitly. The general theory of Poisson-Lie T-duality is also extended; we develop the Hamiltonian formulation and the reduction for constant loops to integrable motion on the group manifold. Finally, we generalise T-duality in the Hamiltonian formulation to group factorisations D=G\dcross M where the subgroups need not be dual or even have the same dimension and need not be connected to the Drinfeld double or to Poisson structures.
