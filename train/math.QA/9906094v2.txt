The Lie bialgebras of the (1+1) extended Galilei algebra are obtained and classified into four multiparametric families. Their quantum deformations are obtained, together with the corresponding deformed Casimir operators. For the coboundary cases quantum universal R-matrices are also given. Applications of the quantum extended Galilei algebras to classical integrable systems are explicitly developed.
