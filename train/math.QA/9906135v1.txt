We study quantization of a class of inhomogeneous Lie bialgebras which are crossproducts in dual sectors with Abelian invariant parts. This class forms a category stable under dualization and the double operations. The quantization turns out to be a functor commuting with them. The Hopf operations and the universal R-matrices are given in terms of generators. The quantum algebras obtained appear to be isomorphic to the universal enveloping Poisson-Lie algebras on the dual groups.
