We find the solution of the \hat{sl}(3)_k singular vector decoupling equations on 3-point functions for the particular case when one of the fields is of weight w_0\cdot k\Lambda_0. The result is a function with non-trivial singularities in the flag variables, namely a linear combination of 2F1 hypergeometric functions. This calculation fills in a gap in [1] and confirms the \hat{sl}(3)_k fusion rules determined there both for generic \kappa \not \in \IQ and fractional levels.   We have also analysed the fusion in \hat{sl}(3)_k using algebraic methods generalising those of Feigin and Fuchs and again find agreement with [1]. In the process we clarify some details of previous treatments of the fusion of \hat{sl}(2)_k fractional level admissible representations.
