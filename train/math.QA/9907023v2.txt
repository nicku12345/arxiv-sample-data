The action of the isometry algebra U_h(sl(2)) on the h-deformed Lobachevsky plane is found. The invariant distance and the invariant 2-point functions are shown to agree precisely with the classical ones. The propagator of the Laplacian is calculated explicitely. It is invariant only after adding a `non-classical' sector to the Hilbert space.
