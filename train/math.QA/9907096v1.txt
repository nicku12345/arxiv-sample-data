The Gromov-Witten invariants of a smooth, projective variety V, when twisted by the tautological classes on the moduli space of stable maps, give rise to a family of cohomological field theories and endow the base of the family with coordinates. We prove that the potential functions associated to the tautological \psi classes (the large phase space) and the \kappa classes are related by a change of coordinates which generalizes a change of basis on the ring of symmetric functions. Our result is a generalization of the work of Manin--Zograf who studied the case where V is a point. We utilize this change of variables to derive the topological recursion relations associated to the \kappa classes from those associated to the \psi classes.
