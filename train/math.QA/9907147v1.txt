The response of an integrable QFT under variation of the Unruh temperature has recently been shown to be computable from an S-matrix preserving (`replica') deformation of the form factor approach. We show that replica-deformed form factors of the SU(2)-invariant Thirring model can be found among the solutions of the rational sl_2-type quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation at generic level. We show that modulo conserved charge solutions the deformed form factors are in one-to-one correspondence to the ones at level zero and use this to conjecture the deformed form factors of the Noether current in our model.
