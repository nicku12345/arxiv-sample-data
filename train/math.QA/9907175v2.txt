We establish a q-analog of our recent work on vertex representations and the McKay correspondence. For each finite group \Gamma we construct a Fock space and associated vertex operators in terms of wreath products of \Gamma\times \mathbb C^{\times} and the symmetric groups.   An important special case is obtained when \Gamma is a finite subgroup of SU_2, where our construction yields a group theoretic realization of the representations of the quantum affine and quantum toroidal algebras of ADE type.
