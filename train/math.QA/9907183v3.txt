Basil Gordon, in the sixties, and George Andrews, in the seventies, generalized the Rogers-Ramanujan identities to higher moduli. These identities arise in many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. One of these areas is representation theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras, where various known interpretations of these identities have led to interesting applications. Motivated by their connections with Lie algebra representation theory, we give a new interpretation of a sum related to generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identities in terms of multi-color partitions.
