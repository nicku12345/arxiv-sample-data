An U(N)-invariant matrix model with d matrix variables is studied. It was shown that in the limit N\to \infty  and d\to 0 the model describes the knot diagrams. We realize the free partition function of the matrix model as the generalized expectation of a Hida distribution \Phi_{N,d}. This enables us to give a mathematically rigorous meaning to the partition function with interaction. For the generalized function \Phi_{N,d} we prove a Wick theorem and we derive explicit formulas for the propagators.
