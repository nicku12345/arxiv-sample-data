Quantum affine bundles are quantum principal bundles with affine quantum structure groups. A general theory of quantum affine bundles is presented. In particular, a detailed analysis of differential calculi over these bundles is performed, including the description of a natural differential calculus over the structure affine quantum group. A particular attention is given to the study of the specific properties of quantum affine connections and several purely quantum phenomena appearing in the context of quantum affine bundles. Various interesting constructions are presented. In particular, the main ideas are illustrated within the example of the quantum Hopf fibration.
