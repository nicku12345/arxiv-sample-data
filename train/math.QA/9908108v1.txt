In this paper, given a module W for a vertex operator algebra V and a nonzero complex number z we construct a canonical (weak) V\otimes V-module {\cal{D}}_{P(z)}(W) (a subspace of W^{*} depending on z). We prove that for V-modules W, W_{1} and W_{2}, a P(z)-intertwining map of type {W'\choose W_{1}W_{2}} ([H3], [HL0-3]) exactly amounts to a V\otimes V-homomorphism from W_{1}\otimes W_{2} into {\cal{D}}_{P(z)}(W). Using Huang and Lepowsky's one-to-one linear correspondence between the space of intertwining operators and the space of P(z)-intertwining maps of the same type we obtain a canonical linear isomorphism from the space {\cal{V}}^{W'}_{W_{1}W_{2}} of intertwining operators of the indicated type to \Hom_{V\otimes V}(W_{1}\otimes W_{2},{\cal{D}}_{P(z)}(W)). In the case that W=V, we obtain a decomposition of Peter-Weyl type for {\cal{D}}_{P(z)}(V), which are what we call the regular representations of V.
