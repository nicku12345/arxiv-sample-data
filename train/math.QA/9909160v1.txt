Let M be a manifold with an action of a Lie group G, \A the function algebra on M.   The first problem we consider is to construct a U_h(\g) invariant quantization, \A_h, of \A, where U_h(\g) is a quantum group corresponding to G.   Let s be a G invariant Poisson bracket on M. The second problem we consider is to construct a U_h(\g) invariant two parameter (double) quantization, \A_{t,h}, of \A such that \A_{t,0} is a G invariant quantization of s. We call \A_{t,h} a U_h(\g) invariant quantization of the Poisson bracket s.   In the paper we study the cases when G is a simple Lie group and M is the coadjoint representation \g^* of G or a semisimple orbit in this representation.   The paper is founded on the papers: J.Donin, Double quantization on the coadjoint representation of sl(n)^*, Czechoslovak J. of Physics, 47 (1997), no 11, 1115-1122, q-alg/9707031, and J.Donin, D.Gurevich, and S.Shnider, Double Quantization on Some Orbits in the Coadjoint Representations of Simple Lie Groups, Com. Math. Phys., 204 (1999), no. 1, 39-60, math/9807159, and contains some additional results.
