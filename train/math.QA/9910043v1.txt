We construct a differential and a Lie bracket on the space\linebreak \{\Hom (A^{\otimes k}, A^{\otimes l})\},_{k,l\ge 0} for any associative algebra A. The restriction of this bracket to the space \{\Hom (A^{\otimes k}, A)\},_{k\ge 0} is exactly the Gerstenhaber bracket. We discuss some formality conjecture related with this construction. We also discuss some applications to deformation theory.
