The notion of classical r-matrix is re-examined, and a definition suitable to differential (-difference) Lie algebras, -- where the standard definitions are shown to be deficient, -- is proposed, the notion of an {\mathcal O}-operator. This notion has all the natural properties one would expect form it, but lacks those which are artifacts of finite-dimensional isomorpisms such as not true in differential generality relation \mbox{End}\, (V) \simeq V^* \otimes V for a vector space V. Examples considered include a quadratic Poisson bracket on the dual space to a Lie algebra; generalized symplectic-quadratic models of such brackets (aka Clebsch representations); and Drinfel'd's 2-cocycle interpretation of nondegenate classical r-matrices.
