Motivated by the form of the noncommutative *-product in a system of open strings and Dp-branes with constant nonzero Neveu-Schwarz 2-form, we define a deformed multiplication operation on a quasitriangular Hopf algebra in terms of its R-matrix, and comment on some of its properties. We show that the noncommutative string theory *-product is a particular example of this multiplication, and comment on other possible Hopf algebraic properties which may underlie the theory.
