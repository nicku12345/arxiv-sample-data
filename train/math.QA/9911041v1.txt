In [ZH], R.B. Zhang found a way to link certain formal deformations of the Lie algebra o(2l+1) and the Lie superalgebra osp(1,2l). The aim of this article is to reformulate the Zhang transformation in the context of the quantum enveloping algebras "\`a la" Drinfeld-Jimbo and to show how this construction can explain the main theorem of [GL2]: the annihilator of a Verma module over the Lie superalgebra osp(1,2l) is generated by its intersection with the centralizer of the even part of the enveloping algbra.
