We describe properties of the nonstandard q-deformation U'_q({\rm so}_n) of the universal enveloping algebra U({\rm so}_n) of the Lie algebra {\rm so}_n which does not coincide with the Drinfeld--Jimbo quantum algebra U_q({\rm so}_n). Irreducible representations of this algebras for q a root of unity q^p=1 are given. These representations act on p^N-dimensional linear space (where N is a number of positive roots of the Lie algebra {\rm so}_n) and are given by r={\rm dim} {\rm so}_n complex parameters.
