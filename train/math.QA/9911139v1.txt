To a vector space V equipped with a non-quasiclassical involutary solution of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and a partition \lambda, we associate a vector space \Vl and compute its dimension. The functor V\mapsto \Vl is an analogue of the well-known Schur functor. The category generated by the objects \Vl is called the Schur-Weyl category. We suggest a way to construct some related twisted varieties looking like orbits of semisimple elements in sl(n)^*. We consider in detail a particular case of such "twisted orbits", namely the twisted non-quasiclassical hyperboloid and we define the twisted Casimir operator on it. In this case, we obtain a formula looking like the Weyl formula, and describing the asymptotic behavior of the function N(\la)=\{\sharp \la_i\leq\la\}, where \la_i are the eigenvalues of this operator.
