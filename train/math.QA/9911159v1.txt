Consider two families of closed oriented curves in a d-manifold. At each point of intersecction of a curve of one family with a curve of the other family, form a new closed curve by going around the first curve and then going around the second. Typically, an i-dimensional family and a j-dimensional family will produce an (i+j-d+2)-dimensional family. Our purpose is to describe mathematical structure behind such interactions.
