Invariant integrals on Hopf superalgebras, in particular, the classical and quantum Lie supergroups, are studied. The uniqueness (up to scalar multiples) of a left integral is proved, and a super version of Maschke's theorem is discussed. A construction of left integrals is developed for classical and quantum Lie supergroups. Applied to several classes of examples the construction yields the left integrals in explicit form.
