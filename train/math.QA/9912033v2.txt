In this paper we use the description of free group factors as the von Neumann algebras of Berezin's deformation of the upper half-plane, modulo PSL(2,{\Bbb Z}).   The derivative, in the deformation parameter, of the product in the corresponding algebras, is a positive Hochschild 2-cocycle, defined on a dense subalgebra. By analyzing the structure of the cocycle we prove that there is a generator \cal L for a quantum dynamical semigroup that implements the cocycle on a strongly dense subalgebra.   For x in the dense subalgebra, {\cal L}(x) is the (diffusion) operator  {\cal L}(x)=\Lambda(x)-(1/2)\{T,x\},  where \Lambda is the pointwise (Schur) multiplication operator with a symbol function related to the logarithm of the automorphic form \Delta. The operator T is positive and affiliated with the algebra {\cal A}_t and T corresponds to {\cal L}(1), in a sense to be made precise in the paper. After a suitable normalization, corresponding to a principal-value type method, adapted for II_1 factors, \Lambda becomes (completely) positive on a union of weakly dense subalgebras. Moreover the 2-cyclic cohomology cocycle associated to the deformation may be expressed in terms of \Lambda.
