The notion of 2-framed three-manifolds is defined. The category of 2-framed cobordisms is described, and used to define a 2-framed three-dimensional TQFT. Using skeletonization and special features of this category, a small set of data and relations is given that suffice to construct a 2-framed three-dimensional TQFT. These data and relations are expressed in the language of surgery.
