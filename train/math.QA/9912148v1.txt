We consider potential theory on Bratteli diagrams arising from Macdonald polynomials. The case of Hall-Littlewood polynomials is particularly interesting; the elements of the diagram are partitions, the branching multiplicities are integers, the combinatorial dimensions are Green's polynomials, and the Jordan form of a randomly chosen unipotent upper triangular matrix over a finite field gives rise to a harmonic function. The case of Schur functions yields natural deformations of the Young lattice and Plancharel measure. Many harmonic functions are constructed and algorithms for sampling from the underlying probability measures are given.
