If L is a complete ortholattice, f any partial function from L^n to L, then there is a complete ortholattice L* containing L as a subortholattice, and an ortholattice polynomial with coefficients in L* which represents f on L^n.   Iterating this construction long enough yields a complete ortholattice in which every function can be interpolated by a polynomial on any set of small enough cardinality.
