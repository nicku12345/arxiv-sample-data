As is well-known, the real quaternion division algebra  {\cal H} is algebraically isomorphic to a 4-by-4 real matrix algebra. But the real division octonion algebra {\cal O} can not be algebraically isomorphic to any matrix algebras over the real number field {\cal R}, because {\cal O} is a non-associative algebra over {\cal R}. However since {\cal O} is an extension of {\cal H} by the Cayley-Dickson process and is also finite-dimensional, some pseudo real matrix representations of octonions can still be introduced through real matrix representations of quaternions. In this paper we give a complete investigation to real matrix representations of octonions, and consider their various applications to octonions as well as matrices of octonions.
