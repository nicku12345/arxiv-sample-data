We construct large families of characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras by considering deformations of the Lie algebra g_{m,m-1}^{4} of type Q_{n},and which arises as a central extension fo the filiform Lie algebra L_{n}. By studying the graded cohomology spaces we obtain that the sill algebras are isomorphic to the nilradicals of solvable, complete Lie algebra laws. For extremal cocycles these laws are also rigid. Considering supplementary cocycles we construcy, for dimensions n>8, nonfiliform characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras and show that for certain deformations these are compatible with central extensions.
