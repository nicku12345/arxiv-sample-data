We classify the (n-5)-filiform Lie algebras which have the additional property of a non-abelian derived subalgebra. We show that this property is strongly related with the structure of the Lie algebra of derivations; explicitely we show that if a (n-5)-filiform algebra is characteristically nilpotent, then it must be 2-abelian. We also give applications of k-abelian Lie algebras to the construction of solvable rigis algebras, as well as to the theory of nilalgebras of parabolic subalgebras in the example of the exceptional simple model E_{6}.
