In this work large families of naturally graded nilpotent Lie algebras in arbitrary dimension and characteristic sequence (n,q,1), with n odd, satisfying the centralizer property, are given. This condtion constitutes a generalization, for a nilpotent Lie agebra, of the structural properties charactrizing the Lie algebra Q_{n}. By considering certain cohomological classes of the space H^{2}(\frak{g},\mathbb{C}), it is shown that, with few exceptions, the isomorphism classses of these algebras are given by central extensions of Q_{n} by \mathbb{C}^{p} which preserve the nilindex and the natural graduation.
