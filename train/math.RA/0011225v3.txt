By using the concept of weight graph associated to certain nilpotent Lie algebras \frak{g}, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for a semidirect product \frak{g}\oplus T_{i}, where T_{i}<T is a subalgebra of a maximal torus of derivations T of \frak{g} which induces a decomposition of \frak{g} into one dimensional weight spaces, to be 2-step solvable. In particular we show that the semidirect product of such a Lie algebra with its torus of derivations cannot be itself 2-step solvable.
