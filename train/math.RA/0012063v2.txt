\newcommand{\GLn}{\operatorname{GL}_n} \newcommand{\GL}{\GLn(C)}   Let F be a differential field with algebraically closed field of constants C. We prove that F< Y_{ij}>(X_{ij})\supset F< Y_{ij}> is a generic Picard-Vessiot extension of F for \GL. If E\supset F is any Picard-Vessiot extension with differential Galois group \GL then E\cong F(X_{ij}) as F- and \GL-modules and there are f_{ij}\in F such that F< Y_{ij}>(X_{ij})\supset F< Y_{ij}> specializes to E\supset F via  Y_{ij}\mapsto f_{ij}. The [f_{ij}]\in M_n(F) for which the image of the map  Y_{ij}\mapsto f_{ij} is a Picard-Vessiot extension of F with group \GL can be characterized as those [f_{ij}]\in M_n(F) for which the wronskians of the monomials in F< Y_{ij}>(X_{ij}) of degree less than or equal to k all map to non-zero elements under  Y_{ij}\mapstof_{ij}.
