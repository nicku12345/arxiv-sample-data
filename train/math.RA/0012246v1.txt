In this paper we consider the problem of classifying the (n-5)-filiform Lie algebras. This is the first index for which infinite parametrized families appear, as can be seen in dimension 7. Moreover we obtain large families of characteristic nilpotent Lie algebras with nilpotence index 5 and show that at least for dimension 10 there is a characteristic nilpotent Lie algebra with nilpotence index 4 which is the algebra of derivations of a nilpotent Lie algebra.
