We introduce the product by generators of complex nilpotent Lie algebras, which is a commutative product obtained from a central extension of the direct sum of Lie algebras. We show that the product preserves also the characteristic nilpotence provided that the multiplied algebras are S-algebras. In particular, this shows the existence of nonsplit characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras \frak{h} such that the quotient \frac{\dim \frak{h}-\dim Z(\frak{h})}{\dim Z(\frak{h})}  is as small as wanted.
