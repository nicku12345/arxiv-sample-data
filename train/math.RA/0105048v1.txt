In this work, we recall that every filiform Lie superalgebra is a deformation of the superalgebra L_{n,m}. We study the even cocycles which give this nilpotent deformations. A family of independent bilinear maps will help us to describe this cocycles. At the end an evaluation of the dimension of the space Z_0^2(L_{n,m},L_{n,m}) is established.
