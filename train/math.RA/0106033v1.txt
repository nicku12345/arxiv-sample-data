Let n be a positive integer, and let R be a (possibly infinite dimensional) finitely presented algebra over a computable field of characteristic zero. We describe an algorithm for deciding (in principle) whether R has at most finitely many equivalence classes of n-dimensional irreducible representations. When R does have only finitely many such equivalence classes, they can be effectively counted (assuming that k[x] posesses a factoring algorithm).
