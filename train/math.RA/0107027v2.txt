W. Crawley-Boevey has given a description of the set of dimension vectors of simple representations of the deformed preprojective algebras. In this note we give alternative descriptions. Note however that our descriptions depend on irreducibility of the quotient varieties, so they do NOT give a shorter proof of Crawley-Boevey's result.
