We classify gradings on matrix algebras by a finite abelian group. A grading is called good if all elementary matrices are homogeneous. For cyclic groups, all gradings on a matrix algebra over an algebraically closed field are good. We can count the number of good gradings by a cyclic group. Using descent theory, we classify non-good gradings on a matrix algebra that become good after a base extension.
