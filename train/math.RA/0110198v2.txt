Let A be a finite-dimensional division algebra containing a base field k in its center F. We say that A is defined over a subfield F_0 of F if A = A_0\otimes_{F_0} F for some F_0-subalgebra A_0 of A. We show that: (1) In many cases A can be defined over a rational extension of k. (2) If A has odd degree n \ge 5, then A is defined over a field F_0 of transcendence degree at most (n-1)(n-2)/2 over k. (3) If A is a Z/m \times Z/2-crossed product for some m \ge 2 (and in particular, if A is any algebra of degree 4) then A is Brauer equivalent to a tensor product of two symbol algebras. Consequently, M_m(A) can be defined over a field F_0 of transcendence degree at most 4 over k. (4) If A has degree 4 then the trace form of A can be defined over a field F_0 of transcendence degree at most 4. (In (1), (3), and (4) we assume that the center of A contains certain roots of unity.)
