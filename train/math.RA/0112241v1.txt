We compute the first and second cohomology groups with coefficients in the adjoint module of frobeniusian model algebras whose parameters move in a dense open subset of \mathbb{C}^{p-1}, and obtain upper bounds for the dimension of cohomology groups of frobeniusian Lie algebras. Moreover, it is shown that for a dense open subset of \mathbb{C}^{p-1} the deformations of model algebras also belong to the family. Therefore any frobeniusian non-model algebra contracts on some element of the model whose parameters move on a finite union of hyperplanes. Further applications as the nullity of Rim's quadratic map   sq_{1} are obtained.
