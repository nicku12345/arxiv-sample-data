This paper is concerned with the description of exceptional simple Lie algebras as octonionic analogues of the classical matrix Lie algebras. We review the Tits-Freudenthal construction of the magic square, which includes the exceptional Lie algebras as the octonionic case of a construction in terms of a Jordan algebra of hermitian 3x3 matrices (Tits) or various plane and other geometries (Freudenthal). We present alternative constructions of the magic square which explain its symmetry, and show explicitly how the use of split composition algebras leads to analogues of the matrix Lie algebras su(3), sl(3) and sp(6). We adapt the magic square construction to include analogues of su(2), sl(2) and sp(4) for all real division algebras.
