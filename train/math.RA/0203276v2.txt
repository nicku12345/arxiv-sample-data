The typical definition of the characteristic polynomial seems totally ad hoc to me. This note gives a canonical construction of the characteristic polynomial as the minimal polynomial of a "generic" matrix. This approach works not just for matrices but also for a very broad class of algebras including the quaternions, all central simple algebras, and Jordan algebras.   The main idea of this paper dates back to the late 1800s. (In particular, it is not due to the author.) This note is intended for a broad audience; the only background required is one year of graduate algebra.
