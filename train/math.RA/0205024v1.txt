In this paper it is proved that the ideal I_w of the weak polynomial identities of the superalgebra M_{1,1}(E) is generated by the proper polynomials [x_1,x_2,x_3] and [x_2,x_1][x_3,x_1][x_4,x_1]. This is proved for any infinite field F of characteristic different from 2. Precisely, if B is the subalgebra of the proper polynomials of F< X>, we determine a basis and the dimension of any multihomogeneous component of the quotient algebra B / B \cap I_w. We compute also the Hilbert series of this algebra. One of the main tools of the paper is a variant we found of the Knuth-Robinson-Schensted correspondence defined for single semistandard tableaux of double shape.
