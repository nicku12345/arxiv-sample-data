We develop the notion of deformations using a valuation ring as ring of coefficients. This permits to consider in particular the classical Gerstenhaber deformations of associative or Lie algebras as infinitesimal deformations and to solve the equation of deformations in a polynomial frame. We consider also the deformations of the enveloping algebra of a rigid Lie algebra and we define valued deformations for some classes of non associative algebras.
