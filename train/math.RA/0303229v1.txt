Given a group G acting on a ring R, one can construct the skew group ring R*G. Skew group rings have been studied in depth, but necessary and sufficient conditions for the simplicity of a general skew group ring are not known. In this paper, such conditions are given for certain types of skew group rings, with an emphasis on Von Neumann regular skew group rings. Next the results of the first section are used to construct a class of simple skew group rings. In particular, we obtain more efficient proofs of the simplicity of certain rings constructed by H. Kambara and J. Trlifaj.
