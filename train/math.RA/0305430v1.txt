The Amitsur-Levitski theorem asserts that M_n(F) satisfies a polynomial identity of degree 2n. (Here, F is a field and M_n(F) is the algebra of n \times n matrices over F). It is easy to give examples of subalgebras of M_n(F) that do satisfy an identity of lower degree and subalgebras of M_n(F) that satisfy no polynomial identity of degree \le 2n-2. Our aim in this paper is to give a full classification of the subalgebras of n \times n matrices that satisfy no nonzero polynomial of degree less than 2n.
