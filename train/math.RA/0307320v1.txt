Given an action of a monoid T on a ring A by ring endomorphisms, and an Ore subset S of T, a general construction of a fractional skew monoid ring S^{\rm op} * A * T is given, extending the usual constructions of skew group rings and of skew semigroup rings. In case S is a subsemigroup of a group G such that G=S^{-1}S, we obtain a G-graded ring S^{\rm op} * A * S with the property that, for each s\in S, the s-component contains a left invertible element and the s^{-1}-component contains a right invertible element. In the most basic case, where G is the additive group of integers and S=T is the submonoid of nonnegative integers, the construction is fully determined by a single ring endomorphism \alpha of A. If \alpha  is an isomorphism onto a proper corner pAp, we obtain an analogue of the usual skew Laurent polynomial ring, denoted by A[t_+,t_-;\alpha]. Examples of this construction are given, and it is proven that several classes of known algebras, including the Leavitt algebras of type (1,n), can be presented in the form A[t_+,t_-;\alpha]. Finally, mild and reasonably natural conditions are obtained under which S^{\rm op} * A * S is a purely infinite simple ring.
