In this paper I consider locally finite Lie algebras of characteristic zero satisfying the condition that for every finite number of elements x_{1}, x_{2},..., x_{k} of such an algebra L there is finite-dimensional subalgebra A which contains these elements and L(adA)^n\subset A for some integer n. For such algebras I prove several structure theorems that can be regarded as generalizations of the classical structure theorems of the finite-dimensional Lie algebras theory.
