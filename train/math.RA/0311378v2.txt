We introduce and discuss the notion of naturally full functor. The definition is similar to the definition of separable functor: a naturally full functor is a functorial version of a full functor, while a separable functor is a functorial version of a faithful functor. We study general properties of naturally full functors. We also discuss when functors between module categories and between categories of comodules over a coring are naturally full.
