Properties of higher characters are developed and applied to symmetric products and Frobenius algebras. A `constructive' proof of the Gel'fand-Kolmogorov theorem is given. Generalisations of that theorem and the Nullstellensatz to symmetric products are discussed.Applications to the theory of multi-symmetric functions are also discussed. It is proved that the first three characters determine the Jordan algebra associated to a Frobenius algebra and as a corollary one obtains the theorem of Hoehnke and Johnson that a finite group is determined by the first three characters of its regular representation.
