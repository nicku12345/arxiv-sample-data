We show which H^{op}-cleft extensions k#_\sigma H^{op} of the base field k for a dual quasitriangular Hopf algebra (H, r) are H-Azumaya. The result is given in terms of bijectivity of a map \theta_\sigma\colon H\to H^* defined in terms of r and the 2-cocycle \sigma, generalizing a well-known result for the commutative and cocommutative case. We illustrate the Theorem with an explicit computation for the Hopf algebras of type E(n).
