A noncommutative Jordan algebra of a specific type is attached to any (-1,-1)-balanced Freudenthal Kantor triple system, in such a way that the triple product in this system is determined by the binary product in the algebra. Over fields of characteristic zero, the simple noncommutative Jordan algebras of this type are classified.
