For every profinite group G, we construct two covariant functors \Delta_G and {\bf {\mathcal {AP}}}_G from the category of commutative rings with identity to itself, and show that indeed they are equivalent to the functor W_G introduced in [A. Dress and C. Siebeneicher, The Burnside ring of profinite groups and the Witt vectors construction, {\it Adv. in Math.} {\bf{70}} (1988), 87-132]. We call \Delta_G the generalized Burnside-Grothendieck ring functor and {\bf {\mathcal {AP}}}_G the aperiodic ring functor (associated with G). In case G is abelian, we also construct another functor {\bf Ap}_G from the category of commutative rings with identity to itself as a generalization of the functor {\bf Ap} introduced in [K. Varadarajan, K. Wehrhahn, Aperiodic rings, necklace rings, and Witt vectors, {\it Adv. in Math.} {\bf 81} (1990), 1-29]. Finally it is shown that there exist q-analogues of these functors (i.e, W_G, \Delta_G, {\bf {\mathcal {AP}}}_G, and {\bf Ap}_G) in case G=\hat C the profinite completion of the multiplicative infinite cyclic group.
