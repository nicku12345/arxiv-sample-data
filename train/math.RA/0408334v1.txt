We consider the Brauer group {\rm BM}'(k,G) of a group G (finite or infinite) over a commutative ring k with identity. A split exact sequence 1\longrightarrow {\rm Br}'(k)\longrightarrow {\rm BM}'(k,G)\longrightarrow {\rm Gal}(k,G) \longrightarrow 1 is obtained. This generalizes the Fr\"ohlich-Wall exact sequence from the case of a field to the case of a commutative ring, and generalizes the Picco-Platzeck exact sequence from the finite case of G to the infinite case of G. Here {\rm Br}'(k) is the Brauer-Taylor group of Azumaya algebras (not necessarily with unit). The method developed in this paper might provide a key to computing the equivariant Brauer group of an infinite quantum group.
