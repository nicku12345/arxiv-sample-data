State symmetries are defined as permutations which act on vector spaces of column vectors and square matrices, resulting in isotropy groups for specific vector spaces.   A large number of properties for such objects is shown, to provide a rigorous basis for future applications. The main statement characterises the state symmetry of vector sequences (v^{(i)}) which are generated by powers of a generator matrix M: v^{(i)}= M^i v^{(0)}.   A section of examples illustrates some applications of the theory.
