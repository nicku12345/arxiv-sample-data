We study the matrix equation XA-AX=X^p in M_n(K) for 1< p <n. It is shown that every matrix solution X is nilpotent and that the generalized eigenspaces of A are X-invariant. For A being a full Jordan block we describe how to compute all matrix solutions. Combinatorial formulas for A^mX^{\ell},X^{\ell}A^m and (AX)^{\ell} are given. The case p=2 is a special case of the algebraic Riccati equation.
