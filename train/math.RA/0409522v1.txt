We introduce and study bimeasurings from pairs of bialgebras to algebras. It is shown that the universal bimeasuring bialgebra construction, which arises from Sweedler's universal measuring coalgebra construction and generalizes the finite dual, gives rise to a contravariant functor on the category of bialgebras adjoint to itself. An interpretation of bimeasurings as algebras in the category of Hopf modules is considered.
