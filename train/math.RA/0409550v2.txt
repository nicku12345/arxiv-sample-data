One proves that each almost local-global semihereditary ring has the stacked basis property and is almost Bezout. If M is a finitely presented module, its torsion part tM is a direct sum of cyclic modules where the family of annhilators is an ascending chain of invertible ideals. These ideals are invariants of M. Moreover, M/tM is a direct sum of 2-generated ideals whose product is an invariant of M. The idempotents and the positive integers defined by the rank of M/tM are invariants of M too.
