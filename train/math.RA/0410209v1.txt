Let A be a commutative comodule algebra over a commutative bialgebra H. The group of invertible relative Hopf modules maps to the Picard group of A, and the kernel is described as a quotient group of the group of invertible grouplike elements of the coring A\ot H, or as a Harrison cohomology group. Our methods are based on elementary K-theory. The Hilbert 90 Theorem follows as a corollary. The part of the Picard group of the coinvariants that becomes trivial after base extension embeds in the Harrison cohomology group, and the image is contained in a well-defined subgroup E. It equals E if H is a cosemisimple Hopf algebra over a field.
