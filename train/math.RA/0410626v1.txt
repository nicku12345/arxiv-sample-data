We investigate Frobenius pairs between categories of comodules over rather general corings. We particularize to the case of the adjoint pair of functors associated to a morphism of corings over different base rings, which leads to a reasonable notion of Frobenius coring extension. When applied to corings stemming from entwining structures, we obtain new results in this setting.
