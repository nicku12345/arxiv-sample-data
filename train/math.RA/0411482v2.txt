If \hat{R} is the pure-injective hull of a valuation ring R, it is proved that \hat{R}\otimes\_RM is the pure-injective of M, for each finitely generated module M. Moreover, \hat{R}\otimes\_RM\simeq\oplus\_{1\leq k\leq n}\hat{R}/A\_k\hat{R}, where A\_1,...,A\_n is the annihilator sequence of M. The pure-injective hulls of uniserial or polyserial modules are also investigated. Any two pure-composition series of a countably generated polyserial module are isomorphic.
