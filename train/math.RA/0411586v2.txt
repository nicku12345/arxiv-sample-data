We introduce the notions of one-sided dirings, 3-irreducible left modules, 3-primitive left dirings, 3-semi-primitive left dirings, 3-primitive ideals and 3-radicals. The main results consists of two parts. The first part establishes two external characterizations of a 3-semi-primitive left diring. The second part characterizes the 3-radical of a left diring by using 3-primitive ideals.
