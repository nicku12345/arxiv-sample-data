Let R denote a 2-fir. The notions of F-independence and algebraic subsets of R are defined. The decomposition of an algebraic subset into similarity classes gives a simple way of translating the F-independence in terms of dimension of some vector spaces. In particular to each element a \in R is attached a certain algebraic set of atoms and the above decomposition gives a lower bound of the length of the atomic decompositions of a in terms of dimensions of certain vector spaces. A notion of rank is introduced and fully reducible elements are studied in details.
