We present classes of nonassociative algebras whose associator satisfies invariance conditions given by the action of the 3 order symmetric group. Amongst these algebras we find the wellknown Pre Lie or Vinberg algebras and the Lie admissible algebras. We study the corresponding noncoassociative cogebras.
