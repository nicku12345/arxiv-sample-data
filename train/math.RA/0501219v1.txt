The noncommutative (or mixed) trace algebra T_{nd} is generated by d generic n\times n matrices and by the algebra C_{nd} generated by all traces of products of generic matrices, n,d\geq 2. It is known that over a field of characteristic 0 this algebra is a finitely generated free module over a polynomial subalgebra S of the center C_{nd}. For n=3 and d=2 we have found explicitly such a subalgebra S and a set of free generators of the S-module T_{32}. We give also a set of defining relations of T_{32} as an algebra and a Groebner basis of the corresponding ideal. The proofs are based on easy computer calculations with standard functions of Maple, the explicit presentation of C_{32} in terms of generators and relations, and methods of representation theory of the general linear group.
