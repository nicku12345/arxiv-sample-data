The notion of binomial coefficients T \choose S of finite planar, reduced rooted trees T, S is defined and a recursive formula for its computation is shown. The nonassociative binomial formula (1 + x)^T = \displaystyle \sum_S {T \choose S} x^S for powers relative to T is derived. Similarly binomial coefficients  T \choose S, V of the second kind are introduced and it is shown that (x \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes x)^T= \displaystyle \sum_{S, V} {T \choose S, V} (x^S \otimes x^V) The roots \sqrt[T]{1+x}= (1 + x) ^{T^{-1}} which are planar power series f such that  f^T= 1+x are considered. Formulas for their coefficients are given.
