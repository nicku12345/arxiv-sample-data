Let i: A\to R be a ring morphism, and \chi: R\to A a right R-linear map with \chi(\chi(r)s)=\chi(rs) and \chi(1_R)=1_A. If R is a Frobenius A-ring, then we can define a trace map \tr: A\to A^R. If there exists an element of trace 1 in A, then A is right FBN if and only if A^R is right FBN and A is right noetherian. The result can be generalized to the case where R is an I-Frobenius A-ring, and the condition on the trace can be replaced by a weaker condition. We recover results of Garc\'{\i}a and del R\'{\i}o and by D\v{a}sc\v{a}lescu, Kelarev and Torrecillas on actions of group and Hopf algebras on FBN rings as special cases. We also obtain applications to extensions of Frobenius algebras, and to Frobenius corings with a grouplike element.
