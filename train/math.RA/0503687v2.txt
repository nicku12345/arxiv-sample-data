Let H be a Hopf algebra over a field k, and A an H-comodule algebra. The categories of comodules and relative Hopf modules are then Grothendieck categories with enough injectives. We study the derived functors of the associated Hom functors, and of the coinvariants functor, and discuss spectral sequences that connect them. We also discuss when the coinvariants functor preserves injectives.
