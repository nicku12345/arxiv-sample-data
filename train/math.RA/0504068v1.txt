The Faith-Menal conjecture says that every strongly right Johns ring is QF. The conjecture is also equivalent to say every right noetherian left FP-injective ring is QF. In this short article, we show that the conjecture is true under the condition(a proper generalization of left CS condition)that every nonzero complement left ideal is not small(a left ideal I is called small if for every left ideal K, K+I=R implies K=R). It is also proved that (1) R is QF if and only if R is a left and right mininjective ring with ACC on right annihilators in which S_{r}\subseteq ^{ess}R_{R}; (2) R is QF if and only if R is a right simple injective ring with ACC on right annihilators in which S_{r}\subseteq ^{ess}R_{R}. Several known results on QF rings are obtained as corollaries.
