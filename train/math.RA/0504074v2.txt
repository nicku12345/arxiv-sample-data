These results stem from a course on ring theory. Quantum planes are rings in two variables x and y such that yx=qxy where q is a nonzero constant. When q=1 a quantum plane is simply a commutative polynomial ring in two variables. Otherwise a quantum plane is a noncommutative ring. Our main interest is in quadratic forms belonging to a quantum plane. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for quadratic forms to be irreducible. We find prime quadratic forms and consider more general polynomials. Every prime polynomial is irreducible and either central or a scalar multiple of x or of y. Thus there can only be primes of degree 2 or more when q is a root of unity.
