The following theorem is proved:   Suppose M = (a_{i,j}) be a k \times k matrix with positive entries and a_{i,j}a_{i+1,j+1} > 4\cos ^2 \frac{\pi}{k+1} a_{i,j+1}a_{i+1,j} \quad (1 \leq i \leq k-1, 1 \leq j \leq k-1). Then \det M > 0 . The constant 4\cos ^2 \frac{\pi}{k+1} in this Theorem is sharp. A few other results concerning totally positive and multiply positive matrices are obtained.   Keywords: Multiply positive matrix; Totally positive matrix; Strictly totally positive matrix; Toeplitz matrix; Hankel matrix; P\'olya frequency sequence.
