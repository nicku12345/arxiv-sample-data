Let D be a division algebra such that D\t D^o is a Noetherian algebra, then any division subalgebra of D is a {\em finitely generated} division algebra. Let \D  be a finite set of commuting derivations or automorphisms of the division algebra D, then the group \Ev (\D) of common eigenvalues (i.e. {\em weights}) is a {\em finitely generated abelian} group. Typical examples of D are the quotient division algebra {\rm Frac} (\CD (X)) of the ring of differential operators \CD (X) on a smooth irreducible affine variety X over a field K of characteristic zero, and the quotient division algebra {\rm Frac} (U (\Gg)) of the universal enveloping algebra U(\Gg) of a finite dimensional Lie algebra \Gg . It is proved that the algebra of differential operators \CD (X) is isomorphic to its opposite algebra \CD (X)^o.
