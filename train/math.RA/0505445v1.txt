Let R be a ring, a right ideal I of R is called small if for every proper right ideal K of R, I+K\neq R. A ring R is called right small injective if every homomorphism from a small right ideal to R_{R} can be extended to an R-homomorphism from R_{R} to R_{R}. Properties of small injective rings are explored and several new characterizations are given for QF rings and PF rings, respectively.
