For a quotient algebra U of the tensor algebra we give explicit conditions on its relations for U being a PBW-deformation of an N-Koszul algebra A. We show there is a one-one correspondence between such deformations and a class of A_\infty-structures on the Yoneda algebra Ext_A^*(k,k) of A. We compute the PBW-deformations of the algebra whose relations are the anti-symmetrizers of degree N and also of cubic Artin-Schelter algebras.
