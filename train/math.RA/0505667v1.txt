Let A be a d\times n integer matrix whose column vectors generate the lattice \Z^d, and let D(R_A) be the ring of differential operators on the affine toric variety defined by A.   We show that the classification of A-hypergeometric systems and that of \Z^d-graded simple D(R_A)-modules (up to shift) are the same. We then show that the set of \Z^d-homogeneous primitive ideals of D(R_A) is finite. Furthermore, we give conditions for the algebra D(R_A) being simple.
