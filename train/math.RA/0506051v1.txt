This paper presents some results on simple exceptional Jordan algebra over algebraically closed field \Phi with characteristic not 2. Namely an example of simple decomposition of H(O_3) into the sum of two subalgebras of the type H(Q_3) is produced, and it is shown that this decomposition is the only possible in terms of the type of simple subalgebras.
