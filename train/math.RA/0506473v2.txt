In this paper we prove that in prime characteristic there is a functor -_{p-Leib} from the category of diassociative algebras to the category of restricted Leibniz algebras, generalizing the functor from associative algebras to restricted Lie algebras. Moreover we define the notion of restricted universal enveloping diassociative algebra Ud_{p}(g) of a restricted Leibniz algebra g and we show that Ud_{p} is left adjoint to the functor -_{p-Leib}. We also construct the restricted enveloping algebra, which classifies the restricted Leibniz modules.   In the last section we put a restricted pre-Lie structure on the tensor product of a Leibniz algebra by a Zinbiel algebra.
