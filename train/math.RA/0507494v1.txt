Let X be a singular affine normal variety with coordinate ring R and assume that there is an R-order admitting a stability structure such that the scheme of relevant semistable representations is smooth, then we construct a partial desingularization of X with classifiable remaining singularities. In dimension 3 this explains the omnipresence of conifold singularities in partial desingularizations of quotient singularities. In higher dimensions we have a small list of singularity types generalizing the role of the conifold singularity.
