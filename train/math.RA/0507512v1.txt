Let \mathbb{F} be the underlying base field of characteristic p>3  and denote by \mathcal{W} and \mathcal{S} the even parts of the finite-dimensional generalized Witt Lie superalgebra W and the special Lie superalgebra S, respectively. We first give the generator sets of the Lie algebras \mathcal{W} and \mathcal{S}. Using certain properties of the canonical tori of \mathcal{W} and \mathcal{S}, we then determine the derivation algebra of \mathcal{W} and the derivation space of \mathcal{S}  to \mathcal{W}, where \mathcal{W} is viewed as \mathcal{S} -module by means of the adjoint representation. As a result, we describe explicitly the derivation algebra of \mathcal{S}. Furthermore, we prove that the outer derivation algebras of \mathcal{W} and \mathcal{S}  are abelian Lie algebras or metabelian Lie algebras with explicit structure. In particular, we give the dimension formulae of the derivation algebras and outer derivation algebras of \mathcal{W} and \mathcal{S}. Thus we may make a comparison between the even parts of the (outer) superderivation algebras of W and S and the (outer) derivation algebras of the even parts of W and S, respectively.
