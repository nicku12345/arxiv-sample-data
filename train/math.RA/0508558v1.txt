The normal symmetric triality algebras (STA's) and the normal Lie related triple algebras (LRTA's) have been recently introduced by the second author, in connection with the principle of triality. It turns out that the unital normal LRTA's are precisely the structurable algebras extensively studied by Allison.   It will be shown that the normal STA's (respectively LRTA's) are the algebras that coordinatize those Lie algebras whose automorphism group contains a copy of the alternating (resp. symmetric) group of degree 4.
