In this paper we consider Lie superalgebras decomposable as the sum of two proper subalgebras. Any of these algebras has the form of the vector space sum L=A+B where A and B are proper simple subalgebras which need not be ideals of L, and the sum need not be direct.   The main result of this paper is the following: Let S = {osp}(m,2n) be a Lie superalgebra such that S=K+L where K, L are two proper basic simple subalgebras. Then m is even, m=2k and K \cong osp(2k-1,2n), L \cong sl(k,n).
