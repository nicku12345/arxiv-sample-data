Let \mathcal{W} and \mathcal{S} denote the even parts of the general Witt superalgebra W and the special superalgebra S over a field of characteristic  p>3, respectively. In this note, using the method of reduction on \mathbb{Z}-gradations, we determine the derivation space \mathrm{Der}(\mathcal{W}, W_{\bar{1}}) from \mathcal{W} into W_{\bar{1}}  and the derivation space \mathrm{Der}(\mathcal{S}, W_{\bar{1}}) from \mathcal{S} into W_{\bar{1}}.  In particular, the derivation space \mathrm{Der}(\mathcal{S}, S_{\bar{1}}) is determined.
