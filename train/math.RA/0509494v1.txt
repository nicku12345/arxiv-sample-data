For any row-finite graph E and any field K we construct the {\its Leavitt path algebra} L(E) having coefficients in K. When K is the field of complex numbers, then L(E) is the algebraic analog of the Cuntz Krieger algebra C^*(E) described in [8]. The matrix rings M_n(K) and the Leavitt algebras L(1,n) appear as algebras of the form L(E) for various graphs E. In our main result, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on E which imply that L(E) is simple.
