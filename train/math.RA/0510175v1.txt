Let R be an associative ring with identity. A unital right R-module M is called strongly finite dimensional if Sup\{{\rm G.dim} (M/N) | N\leq M\} < +\infty. Properties of strongly finite dimensional modules are explored. It is also proved that: (1)If R is left F-injective and strongly right finite dimensional, then R is left finite dimensional. (2) If R is right F-injective, then R is right finite dimensional if and only if R is semilocal. Thus the Faith-Menal conjecture is true if R is strongly right finite dimensional. Some known results are obtained as corollaries.
