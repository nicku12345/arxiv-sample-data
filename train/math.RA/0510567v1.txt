In this paper we consider the derivations for even part of the finite-dimensional Hamiltonian superalgebra H over a field of prime characteristic. We first introduce an ideal \frak{N} of H_{\bar{0}} and show that the derivation space from H_{\bar{0}} into W_{\bar{0}} can be obtained by the derivation space from \frak{N} into W_{\bar{0}}, the even part of the generalized Witt superalgebra W. For further application we also give the generating set of the ideal \frak{N}. Then we describe three series of exceptional derivations from  {H}_{\bar{0}} into W_{\bar{0}}. Finally, we determine all the derivations vanishing on the non-positive \mathbb{Z}-graded part of  H_{\bar{0}}, the odd \mathbb{Z}-homogeneous derivations, and negative \mathbb{Z}-homogeneous derivations from {H}_{\bar{0}} into W_{\bar{0}}.
