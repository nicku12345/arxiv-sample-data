We introduce the notion of Groebner S-basis of an ideal of the free associative algebra K<X> over a field K invariant under the action of a semigroup S of endomorphisms of the algebra. We calculate the Groebner S-bases of the ideal corresponding to the universal enveloping algebra of the free nilpotent of class 2 Lie algebra and of the T-ideal generated by the polynomial identity [x,y,z]=0, with respect to suitable semigroups S. In the latter case, if |X|>2, the ordinary Groebner basis is infinite and our Groebner S-basis is finite. We obtain also explicit minimal Groebner bases of these ideals.
