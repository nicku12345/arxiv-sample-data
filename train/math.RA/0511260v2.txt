Let A be a unital commutative associative algebra over a field of characteristic zero, \k be a Lie algebra, and \z a vector space, considered as a trivial module of the Lie algebra \g := A \otimes \k. In this paper we give a description of the cohomology space H^2(\g,\z) in terms of well accessible data associated to A and \k. We also discuss the topological situation, where A and \k are locally convex algebras.
