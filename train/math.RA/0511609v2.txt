We propose a class of infinite comatrix corings, and describe them as colimits of systems of usual comatrix corings. The infinite comatrix corings of El Kaoutit and G\'omez Torrecillas are special cases of our construction, which in turn can be considered as a special case of the comatrix corings introduced recently by G\'omez Torrecillas an the third author.
