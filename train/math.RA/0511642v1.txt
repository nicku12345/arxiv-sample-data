This is an English translation of the author's Ph.D. thesis, accumulating his results on a construction of Cohen-Macaulay modules over a polynomial ring that appeared in the study of Cauchy-Fueter equations. This construction is generalized from quaternions to arbitrary finite-dimensional associative algebras. We show that for maximally central algebras (as introduced by Azumaya) this construction produces Cohen-Macaulay modules and is an exact functor (tensoring with a bimodule, actually) and this class of algebras cannot be enlarged. For this class several invariants of the resulting modules are calculated via a fairly explicit description of their graded minimal free resolution, that is constructed from the Eagon-Northcott complex. These results have been published in Russ. Math. Surveys and Sbornik: Mathematics but for some proofs, a concise and complete exposition is presented here.
