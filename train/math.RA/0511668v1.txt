First we describe the Skjelbred-Sund method for classifying nilpotent Lie algebras. Then we use it to classify 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras over any field of characteristic not 2. The proof of this classification is essentially constructive: for a given 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra L, following the steps of the proof, it is possible to find a Lie algebra M that occurs in the list, and an isomorphism L --> M.
