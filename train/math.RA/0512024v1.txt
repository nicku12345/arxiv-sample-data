We consider wreath product decompositions for semigroups of triangular matrices. We exhibit an explicit wreath product decomposition for the semigroup of all n-by-n upper triangular matrices over a given field k, in terms of aperiodic semigroups and affine groups over k. In the case that k is finite this decomposition is optimal, in the sense that the number of group terms is equal to the group complexity of the semigroup. We also obtain some decompositions for semigroups of triangular matrices over more general rings and semirings.
