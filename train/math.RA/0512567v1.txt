In this paper, we study commutative zero-divisor semigroups determined by graphs. We prove a uniqueness theorem for a class of graphs. We show two classes of graphs that have no corresponding semigroups. In particular, any complete graph K_n together with more than three end vertices and any complete bipartite graph together with more than one end vertices have no corresponding semigroups. We also determine all possible zero-divisor semigroups whose zero-divisor graph is the com- plete graph K_3 together with two end vertices.
