Let G be an abelien group, \epsilon an anti-bicharacter of G and L a G-graded \epsilon Lie algebra (color Lie algebra) over \K a field of characteristic zero. We prove that all G-graded, positive filtered A such that the associated graded algebra is isomorphic to the G-graded \epsilon-symmetric algebra S(L), there is a G- graded \epsilon-Lie algebra L and a G-graded scalar two cocycle \omega\in\mathrm{Z}_{gr}^2(L,\K), such that A is isomorphic to  U_\omega(L) the generalized enveloping algebra of L associated with \omega. We also prove there is an isomorphism of graded spaces between the Hochschild cohomology of the generalized universal enveloping algebra U(L) and the generalized cohomology of color Lie algebra L.
