We initiate the study of \xi-groups and Hu-Liu Leibniz algebras, claim that alomost all simple Leibniz algebras and simple Hu-Liu Leibniz algebras are linear, and establish two passages. One is the passage from a special \mathcal{Z}_2-graded associative algebra to a Hu-Liu Leibniz algebra. The other one is the passage from a linear \xi-group to its tangent space which is a Hu-Liu Leibniz algebra.
