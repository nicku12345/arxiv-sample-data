An infinite magmatic bialgebra is a vector space endowed with an n-ary operation, and an n-ary cooperation, for each n, verifying some compatibility relations. We prove a rigidity theorem, analogue to the Hopf-Borel theorem for commutative bialgebras: any connected infinite magmatic bialgebra is of the form Mag^\infty(Prim H), where Mag^\infty(V) is the free infinite magmatic algebra over the vector space V.
