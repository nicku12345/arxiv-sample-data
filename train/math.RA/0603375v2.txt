A deformation U, of a graded K-algebra A is said to be of PBW type if grU is A. It has been shown for Koszul and N-Koszul algebras that the deformation is PBW if and only if the relations of U satisfy a Jacobi type condition. In particular, for these algebras the determination of the PBW property is a {\it finite} and explicitly determined linear algebra problem. We extend these results to an arbitrary graded K-algebra, using the notion of central extensions of algebras and a homological constant attached to A which we call the {\it complexity} of A.
