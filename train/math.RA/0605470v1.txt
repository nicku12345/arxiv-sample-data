A wide generalization of the classical theorem of A. Grothendieck asserting that for any faithfully flat extension of commutative rings, the corresponding relative Picard group and the Amitsur 1-cohomology group with values in the units-functor are isomorphic, is obtained. This implies some known results that are concerned with extending to non-commutative rings of Grothendieck's theorem.
