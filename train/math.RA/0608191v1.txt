The Lie superalgebras in the extended Freudenthal Magic Square in characteristic 3 are shown to be related to some known simple Lie superalgebras, specific to this characteristic, constructed in terms of orthogonal and symplectic triple systems, which are defined in terms of central simple degree three Jordan algebras.
