We introduce the category of bicomodules for a comonad in a Grothendieck category whose underlying functor is right exact and preserves direct sums. We characterize comonads with a separable forgetful functor by means of cohomology groups using cointegrations into bicomodules. We present two applications: the characterization of coseparable corings stated in [11], and the characterization of coseparable coalgebras coextensions stated in [16].
