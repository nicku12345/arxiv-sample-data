Amitsur's formula, which expresses det(A+B) as a polynomial in coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, is generalized for partial linearizations of the pfaffian of block matrices. As applications, in upcoming papers we determine generators for the SO(n)-invariants of several matrices and relations for the O(n)-invariants of several matrices over a field of arbitrary characteristic.
