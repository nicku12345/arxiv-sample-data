Let R=\oplus_{\Gamma\in\Gamma}R_{\gamma} be a \Gamma-graded K-algebra over a field K, where \Gamma is a totally ordered semigroup, and let I be an ideal of R. Considering the \Gamma-grading filtration FR of R and the \Gamma-filtration FA induced by FR for the quotient K-algebra A=R/I, we show that there is a \Gamma-graded K-algebra isomorphism G(A)\cong \bar{A}=R/<\hbox{\bf HT} (I)>, where G(A) is the associated \Gamma-graded K-algebra of A defined by FA, and <\hbox{\bf HT}(I)> is the \Gamma-graded ideal of R generated by the set of head terms of I. In the case that \Gamma is an ordered monoid with a well-ordering, this result enables us to lift many nice structural properties of \bar{A} to A theoretically, and the natural connection with Gr\"obner basis theory leads to effective realization lifting information from the associated monomial algebras in both commutative and noncommutative cases.
