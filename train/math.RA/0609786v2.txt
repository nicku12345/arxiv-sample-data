Constructions are given of Noetherian maximal orders that are finitely presented algebras over a field K, defined by monomial relations. In order to do this, it is shown that the underlying homogeneous information determines the algebraic structure of the algebra. So, it is natural to consider such algebras as semigroup algebras K[S] and to investigate the structure of the monoid S. The relationship between the prime ideals of the algebra and those of the monoid S is one of the main tools. Results analogous to fundamental facts known for the prime spectrum of algebras graded by a finite group are obtained. This is then applied to characterize a large class of prime Noetherian maximal orders that satisfy a polynomial identity, based on a special class of submonoids of polycyclic-by-finite groups. The main results are illustrated with new constructions of concrete classes of finitely presented algebras of this type.
