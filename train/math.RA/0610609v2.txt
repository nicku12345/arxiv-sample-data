Schunck classes, saturated formations and projectors were originally defined for finite soluble groups for which they provided families of intravariant subgroups. In this paper, I set out the analogous theory for finite-dimensional soluble restricted Lie algebras and investigate its links to the corresponding theory for ordinary Lie algebras over the same field.
