The Leibniz algebras appear as a generalization of the Lie algebras \cite{loday}. The classification of naturally graded p-filiform Lie algebras is known \cite{C-G-JM}, \cite{J.Lie.Theory}, \cite{AJM}, \cite{Ve}. In this work we deal with the classification of 2-filiform Leibniz algebras. The study of p-filiform Leibniz non Lie algebras is solved for p=0 (trivial) and p=1 \cite{Omirov1}. In this work we get the classification of naturally graded non Lie 2-filiform Leibniz algebras.
