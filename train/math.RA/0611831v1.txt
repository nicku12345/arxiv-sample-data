The Leibniz algebras appeared as a generalization of the Lie algebras. In this work we deal with the classification of nilpotent complex Leibniz algebras of low dimensions. Namely, the classification of nilpotent complex Leibniz algebras dimensions less than 3 is extended to the dimension four. {\it AMS Subject Classifications}: 16D70, 17A30, 17A60, 17B30 {\it Key words:} Leibniz algebra, associative algebra, nilpotence, nulfiliform Leibniz algebra, filiform Leibniz algebra.
