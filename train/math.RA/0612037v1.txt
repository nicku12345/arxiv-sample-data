We observe that the class of left and right artinian left and right morphic rings agrees with the class of artinian principal ideal rings. For R an artinian principal ideal ring and G a group, we characterize when RG is a principal ideal ring; for finite groups G, this characterizes when RG is a left and right morphic ring. This extends work of Passman, Sehgal and Fisher in the case when R is a field, and work of Chen, Li, and Zhou on morphic group rings.
