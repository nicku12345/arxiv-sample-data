Let K denote a field and let V denote a vector space over K with finite positive dimension. We consider a pair of linear transformations A:V \to V and A^*:V \to V that satisfy (i)--(iv) below:   (i) Each of A, A^* is diagonalizable.   (ii) There exists an ordering V_{0},V_{1},...,V_{d} of the eigenspaces of A such that A^* V_i \subseteq V_{i-1} + V_{i} + V_{i+1} for 0 \leq i \leq d, where V_{-1}=0, V_{d+1}=0.   (iii) There exists an ordering V^*_{0},V^*_{1},...,V^*_{\delta} of the eigenspaces of A^* such that A V^*_i \subseteq V^*_{i-1} + V^*_{i} + V^*_{i+1} for 0 \leq i \leq \delta, where V^*_{-1}=0, V^*_{\delta+1}=0.   (iv) There is no subspace W of V such that both AW \subseteq W, A^* W \subseteq W, other than W=0 and W=V.   We call such a pair a tridiagonal pair on V. In this note we obtain two results. First, we show that each of A,A^* is determined up to affine transformation by the V_i and V^*_i. Secondly, we characterize the case in which the V_i and V^*_i all have dimension one. We prove both results using a certain decomposition of V called the split decomposition.
