We provide more characterizations of varieties having a term Mal'cev modulo two functions F and G. We characterize varieties neutral in the sense of F, that is varieties satisfying R \subseteq F(R). We present examples of global operators satisfying the homomorphism property, in particular we show that many known commutators satisfy the homomorphism property.
