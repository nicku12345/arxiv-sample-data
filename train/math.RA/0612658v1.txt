In an earlier paper (D. S. Keeler, D. Rogalski, and J. T. Stafford, ``Naive noncommutative blowing up,'' Duke Math. J., 126 (2005), 491-546), we defined and investigated the properties of the naive blowup of an integral projective scheme X at a single closed point. In this paper we extend those results to the case when one naively blows up X at any suitably generic zero-dimensional subscheme Z. The resulting algebra A has a number of curious properties; for example it is noetherian but never strongly noetherian and the point modules are never parametrized by a projective scheme. This is despite the fact that the category of torsion modules in the quotient category qgr A is equivalent to the category of torsion coherent sheaves over X.   These results are used in the companion paper ``A class of noncommutative projective surfaces'' to prove that a large class of noncommutative surfaces can be written as naive blowups.
