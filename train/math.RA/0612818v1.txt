A basic theory of cowreath or extended distributive laws in the bicategory of unital bimodules, is deciphered. Precisely, we give in terms of tensor product over a scalar base ring, a simplest and equivalent definition for cowreath over coring and for comodule over cowreath. An adjunction connecting the category of comodules over the factor coring and the category of comodules over the coring arising from the cowreath products is also given. The dual notions i.e. wreaths over rings extension and their modules are included.
