For n\geq 4 we shall construct a family D(q) of non-commutative deformations of the coordinate algebra of a Kleinian singularity of type D_n depending on a polynomial q of degree n. We shall prove that every deformation of a type D Kleinian singularity which is not commutative is isomorphic to some D(q). We shall then consider in type D the family of deformations \mathcal{O}^{\boldsymbol{\lambda}} constructed by Crawley-Boevey and Holland. For each \mathcal{O}^{\boldsymbol{\lambda}} which is not commutative we shall exhibit an explicit isomorphism D(q)\cong \mathcal{O}^{\boldsymbol{\lambda}} for a suitable choice of q. This will enable us to prove that every deformation of a Kleinian singularity of type D_n is isomorphic to some \mathcal{O}^{\boldsymbol{\lambda}} and determine when two \mathcal{O}^{\boldsymbol{\lambda}} are isomorphic.
