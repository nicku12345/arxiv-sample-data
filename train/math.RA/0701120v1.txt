Let K be an infinite field and K< X> =K< X_1,...,X_n> the free associative algebra generated by X=\{X_1,...,X_n\} over K. It is proved that if I is a two-sided ideal of K< X> such that the K-algebra A=K< X> /I is almost commutative in the sense of [3], namely, with respect to its standard \mathbb{N}-filtration FA, the associated \mathbb{N}-graded algebra G(A) is commutative, then I is generated by a finite Gr\"obner basis. Therefor, every quotient algebra of the enveloping algebra U(\mathbf{g}) of a finite dimensional K-Lie algebra \mathbf{g} is, as a noncommutative algebra of the form A=K< X> /I, defined by a finite Gr\"obner basis in K< X>.
