Let K[x] be a polynomial algebra in a variable x over a commutative \Q-algebra K, and \G' be the monoid of K-algebra monomorphisms of K[x] of the type \s : x\mapsto x+\l_2x^2+... +\l_nx^n, \l_i\in K, \l_n is a unit of K. It is proved that for each \s \in \G' there are only finitely many distinct decompositions \s = \s_1... \s_s in \G'. Moreover, each such a decomposition is uniquely determined by the degrees of components: if \s = \s_1... \s_s= \tau_1... \tau_s then \s_1=\tau_1, >..., \s_s=\tau_s iff \deg (\s_1)=\deg (\tau_1), ..., \deg (\s_s)=\deg (\tau_s). Explicit formulae are given for the components \s_i via the coefficients \l_j and the degrees \deg (\s_k) (as an application of the inversion formula for polynomial automorphisms in {\em several} variables from \cite{Bav-inform}). In general, for a polynomial there are no formulae (in radicals) for its divisors (elementary Galois theory). Surprisingly, one can write such formulae where instead of the product of polynomials one considers their composition (as polynomial functions).
