Motivated by the orthogonality relations for irreducible characters of a finite group, we evaluate the sum of a finite group of linear characters of a Hopf algebra, at all grouplike and skew-primitive elements. We then discuss results for products of skew-primitive elements. Examples include groups, (quantum groups over) Lie algebras, the small quantum groups of Lusztig, and their variations (by Andruskiewitsch and Schneider).
