The notion of a formally smooth bimodule is introduced and its basic properties are analyzed. In particular it is proven that a B-A bimodule M which is a generator left B-module is formally smooth if and only if the M-Hochschild dimension of B is at most one. It is also shown that modules M which are generators in the category \sigma[M] of M-subgenerated modules provide natural examples of formally smooth bimodules.
