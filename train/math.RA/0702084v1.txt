A method of reducing general quaternion functions of first degree, i.e., linear quaternion functions, to quaternary canonical form is given. Linear quaternion functions, once reduced to canonical form, can be maintained in this form under functional composition. furthermore, the composition operation is symbolically identical to quaternion multiplication, making manipulation and reduction of systems of linear quaternion functions straight forward.
