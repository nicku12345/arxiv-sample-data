Many known results on finite von Neumann algebras are generalized, by purely algebraic proofs, to a certain class {\mathcal C} of finite Baer *-rings. The results in this paper can also be viewed as a study of the properties of Baer *-rings in the class {\mathcal C}.   First, we show that a finitely generated module over a ring from the class {\mathcal C} splits as a direct sum of a finitely generated projective module and a certain torsion module. Then, we define the dimension of any module over a ring from {\mathcal C} and prove that this dimension has all the nice properties of the dimension studied in [W. L\"{u}ck, Dimension theory of arbitrary modules over finite von Neumann algebras and L^2-Betti numbers I: Foundations, J. Reine Angew. Math. 495 (1998) 135--162] for finite von Neumann algebras. This dimension defines a torsion theory that we prove to be equal to the Goldie and Lambek torsion theories. Moreover, every finitely generated module splits in this torsion theory.   If R is a ring in {\mathcal C}, we can embed it in a canonical way into a regular ring Q also in {\mathcal C}. We show that K_0(R) is isomorphic to K_0(Q) by producing an explicit isomorphism and its inverse of monoids Proj (P)\to Proj (Q) that extends to the isomorphism of K_0(R) and K_0(Q).
