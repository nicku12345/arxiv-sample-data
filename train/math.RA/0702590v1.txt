The bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth projective variety is known to be equivalent to the triangulated category of perfect modules over a DG algebra. DG algebras, arising in this way, have to satisfy some compactness and smoothness conditions. In this paper, we describe a Serre functor on the category of perfect modules over an arbitrary compact and smooth DG algebra and use it to prove the existence of a non-degenerate pairing on the Hochschild homology of the DG algebra. This pairing is an algebraic analog of a well-known pairing on the Hodge cohomology of a smooth projective variety.
