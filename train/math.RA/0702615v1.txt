Let \mathfrak{g} be a solvable Lie algebra and Q an ad \mathfrak{g}-stable prime ideal of the symmetric algebra S(\mathfrak{g}) of \mathfrak{g}. If E is the set of non zero elements of S(\mathfrak{g})/Q which are eigenvectors for the adjoint action of \mathfrak{g} in S(\mathfrak{g})/Q, the localised algebra (S(\mathfrak{g})/Q)_{E} has a natural structure of Poisson algebra. We study this algebra here.
