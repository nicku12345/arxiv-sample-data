In a previous paper (From congruence identities to tolerance identities, in print on Acta Sci. Math. Szeged) we showed that, under certain conditions, a variety satisfies a given congruence identity if and only if it satisfies the same tolerance identity. Moreover, we mentioned that a parallel result holds for Mal'cev conditions arising from graphs. In the present note we give detailed definitions and state these more general results.
