We study skew inverse power series extensions R[[y^{-1};tau,delta]], where R is a noetherian ring equipped with an automorphism tau and a tau-derivation delta. We find that these extensions share many of the well known features of commutative power series rings. As an application of our analysis, we see that the iterated skew inverse power series rings corresponding to nth Weyl algebras are complete local, noetherian, Auslander regular domains whose right Krull dimension, global dimension, and classical Krull dimension, are all equal to 2n.
