We study group gradings on the Albert algebra and on the simple exceptional Lie algebra \frak{f}_4 over algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero. There are eight nontoral nonequivalent gradings on the Albert algebra (three of them being fine) and nine on \frak{f}_4 (also three of them fine).
