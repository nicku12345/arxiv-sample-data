The Donald-Flanigan conjecture asserts that for any finite group and for any field, the corresponding group algebra can be deformed to a separable algebra. The minimal unsolved instance, namely the quaternion group over a field of characteristic 2 was considered as a counterexample. We present here a separable deformation of the quaternion group algebra. In a sense, the conjecture for any finite group is open again.
