Let E be a primarily quasilocal field, M/E a finite Galois extension and D a central division E-algebra of index divisible by [M\colon E]. In addition to the main result of Part I, this part of the paper shows that if the Galois group G(M/E) is not nilpotent, then M does not necessarily embed in D as an E-subalgebra. When E is quasilocal, we find the structure of the character group of its absolute Galois group; this enables us to prove that if E is strictly quasilocal and almost perfect, then the divisible part of the multiplicative group E ^{\ast} equals the intersection of the norm groups of finite Galois extensions of E.
