Superinvolutions on graded associative algebras constitute a source of Lie and Jordan superalgebras. Graded versions of the classical Albert and Albert-Riehm Theorems on the existence of superinvolutions are proven. Surprisingly, the existence of superinvolutions of the first kind is a rare phenomenon, as nontrivial central division superalgebras are never endowed with this kind of superinvolutions.
