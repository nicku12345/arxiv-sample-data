Given a field F, an \'etale extension L/F and an Azumaya algebra A/L, one knows that there are extensions E/F such that A \otimes_F E is a split algebra over L \otimes_F E. In this paper we bound the degree of a minimal splitting field of this type from above and show that our bound is sharp in certain situations, even in the case where L/F is a split extension. This gives in particular a number of generalizations of the classical fact that when the tensor product of two quaternion algebras is not a division algebra, the two quaternion algebras must share a common quadratic splitting field.   In another direction, our constructions combined with results of Karpenko also show that for any odd prime number p, the generic algebra of index p^n, and exponent p cannot be expressed nontrivially as the corestriction of an algebra over any extension field if n < p^2.
