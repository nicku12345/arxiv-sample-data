We introduce a generalization of the notion of a Koszul algebra, which includes graded algebras with relations in different degrees, and we establish some of the basic properties of these algebras. This class is closed under twists, twisted tensor products, regular central extensions and Ore extensions. We explore the monomial algebras in this class and we include some well-known examples of algebras that fall into this class.
