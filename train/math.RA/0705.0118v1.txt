Let R and S be differential graded algebras. In this paper we give a characterisation of when a differential graded R-S-bimodule M induces a full embedding of derived categories M\otimes - :D(S)--> D(R). In particular, this characterisation generalises the theory of Geigle and Lenzing's homological epimorphisms of rings. Furthermore, there is an application of the main result to Dwyer and Greenlees's Morita theory.
