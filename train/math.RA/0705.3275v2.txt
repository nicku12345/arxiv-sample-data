A certain class of rank two pointed Hopf algebras is considered. The simple modules of their Drinfel'd double is described using Radford's method \cite{rad}. The socle of the tensor product of two such modules is computed and a formula similar to the one in \cite{one} is obtained in some conditions. Cases when such a tensor product is completely irreducible are also given in the last section.
