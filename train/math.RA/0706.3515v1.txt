A polynomial f(t) in an Ore extension K[t;S,D] over a division ring K is a Wedderburn polynomial if f(t) is monic and is the minimal polynomial of an algebraic subset of K. These polynomials have been studied in "Wedderburn polynomials over division rings,I (Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, Vol. 186, (2004), 43-76). In this paper, we continue this study and give some applications to triangulation, diagonalization and eigenvalues of matrices over a division ring in the general setting of (S,D)-pseudo-linear transformations. In the last section we introduce and study the notion of G-algebraic sets which, in particular, permits generalization of Wedderburn's theorem relative to factorization of central polynomials.
