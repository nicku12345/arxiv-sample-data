Necessary and sufficient conditions for an Ore extension S=R[x;\si,\de] to be a {\rm PI} ring are given in the case \si is an injective endomorphism of a semiprime ring R satisfying the {\rm ACC} on annihilators. Also, for an arbitrary endomorphism \tau of R, a characterization of Ore extensions R[x;\tau] which are {\rm PI} rings is given, provided the coefficient ring R is noetherian.
