The Broecker-Prestel local-global principle characterizes weak isotropy of quadratic forms over a formally real field in terms of weak isotropy over the henselizations and isotropy over the real closures of that field. A hermitian analogue of this principle is presented for algebras of index at most two. An improved result is also presented for algebras with a decomposable involution, algebras of pythagorean index at most two, and algebras over SAP and ED fields.
