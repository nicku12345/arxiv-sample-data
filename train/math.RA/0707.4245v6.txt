This paper shows that divisible abelian torsion groups are realizable as Brauer groups of quasilocal fields. It describes the isomorphism classes of Brauer groups of primarily quasilocal fields and solves the analogous problem concerning the reduced components of the Brauer groups of two basic types of Henselian valued absolutely stable fields. For a quasilocal field E and a finite separable extension R/E, we find two sufficient conditions for validity of the norm group equality N(R/E) = N(R_{0}/E), where R_{0} is the maximal abelian extension of E in R. This is used for deriving information on the arising specific relations between Galois groups and norm groups of finite Galois extensions of E.
