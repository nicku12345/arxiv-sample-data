We describe all possible universal localisations of a hereditary ring in terms of suitable full subcategories of the category of finitely presented modules. For these universal localisations we then identify the category of finitely presented bound modules over the universal localisation as being equivalent to a certain full subcategory of the category of finitely presented bound modules over the original ring. We also describe the abelian monoid of finitely generated projective modules over the universal localisation.
