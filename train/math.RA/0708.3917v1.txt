We define and study twisted support varieties for modules over an Artin algebra, where the twist is induced by an automorphism of the algebra. Under a certain finite generation hypothesis, we show that the twisted variety of a module satisfies Dade's Lemma and is one dimensional precisely when the module is periodic with respect to the twisting automorphism. As a special case we obtain results on DTr-periodic modules over Frobenius algebras.
