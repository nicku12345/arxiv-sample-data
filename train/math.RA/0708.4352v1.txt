We construct Jordan algebras over a locally ringed space using generalizations of the Tits process and the first Tits construction by Achhammer. Some general results on the structure of these algebras are obtained. Examples of Albert algebras over a Brauer-Severi variety with associated central simple algebra of degree 3 are given.
