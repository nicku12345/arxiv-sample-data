Let \sigma be an endomorphism and \delta an \sigma-derivation of a ring R. In this paper, we show that if R is (\sigma,\delta)-skew Armendariz and a\sigma(b)=0 implies ab=0 for a,b\in R. Then R is symmetric (respectively, reversible) if and only if R is \sigma-symmetric (respectively, \sigma-reversible) if and only if R[x;\sigma,\delta] is symmetric (respectively, reversible). Moreover, we study on the relationship between the Baerness, quasi-Baerness and p.q.-Baerness of a ring R and these of the Ore extension R[x;\sigma,\delta]. As a consequence we obtain a partial generalization of \cite{hong/2000}.
