We investigate properties of commutative subrings and ideals in non-commutative algebraic crossed products for actions by arbitrary groups. A description of the commutant of the base coefficient subring in the crossed product ring is given. Conditions for commutativity and maximal commutativity of the commutant of the base subring are provided in terms of the action as well as in terms of the intersection of ideals in the crossed product ring with the base subring, specially taking into account both the case of base rings without non-trivial zero-divisors and the case of base rings with non-trivial zero-divisors.
