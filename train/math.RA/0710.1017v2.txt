By a theorem due to Kato and Ohtake, any (not necessarily strict) Morita context induces an equivalence between appropriate subcategories of the module categories of the two rings in the Morita context. These are in fact categories of firm modules for non-unital subrings. We apply this result to various Morita contexts associated to a comodule \Sigma of an A-coring \cC. This allows to extend (weak and strong) structure theorems in the literature, in particular beyond the cases when any of the coring \cC or the comodule \Sigma is finitely generated and projective as an A-module. That is, we obtain relations between the category of \cC-comodules and the category of firm modules for a firm ring R, which is an ideal of the endomorphism algebra ^\cC(\Sigma). For a firmly projective comodule of a coseparable coring we prove a strong structure theorem assuming only surjectivity of the canonical map.
