We define Calabi-Yau and periodic Frobenius algebras over arbitrary base commutative rings. We define a Hochschild analogue of Tate cohomology, and show that the "stable Hochschild cohomology" of periodic CY Frobenius algebras has a Batalin-Vilkovisky and Frobenius algebra structure. Such algebras include (centrally extended) preprojective algebras of (generalized) Dynkin quivers, and group algebras of classical periodic groups. We use this theory to compute (for the first time) the Hochschild cohomology of many algebras related to quivers, and to simplify the description of known results. Furthermore, we compute the maps on cohomology from extended Dynkin preprojective algebras to the Dynkin ones, which relates our CY property (for Frobenius algebras) to that of Ginzburg (for algebras of finite Hochschild dimension).
