The notion of an n-ary group is a natural generalization of the notion of a group and has many applications in different branches. In this paper, the notion of (normal) fuzzy n-ary subgroup of an n-ary group is introduced and some related properties are investigated. Characterizations of fuzzy n-ary subgroups are given.
