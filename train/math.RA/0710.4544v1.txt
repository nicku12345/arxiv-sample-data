It is our goal to give an inductive description of quadratic Malcev superalgebras with reductive even part. We use the notion of double extension of Malcev superalgebras presented by H. Albuquerque and S. Benayadi and transfer to Malcev superalgebras the concept of generalized double extension for Lie superalgebras.
