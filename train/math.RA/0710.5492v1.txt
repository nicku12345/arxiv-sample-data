We prove a version of Koszul duality and the induced derived equivalence for Adams connected A_\infty-algebras that generalizes the classical Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel Koszul duality. As an immediate consequence, we give a version of the Bern\v{s}te{\u\i}n-Gel'fand-Gel'fand correspondence for Adams connected A_\infty-algebras.   We give various applications. For example, a connected graded algebra A is Artin-Schelter regular if and only if its Ext-algebra \Ext^\ast_A(k,k) is Frobenius. This generalizes a result of Smith in the Koszul case. If A is Koszul and if both A and its Koszul dual A^! are noetherian satisfying a polynomial identity, then A is Gorenstein if and only if A^! is. The last statement implies that a certain Calabi-Yau property is preserved under Koszul duality.
