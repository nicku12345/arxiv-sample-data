A ring R is called right \aleph_{0}-injective if every homomorphism from a countably generated right ideal of R to R_{R} can be extended to a homomorphism from R_{R} to R_{R}. In this note, some characterizations of \aleph_{0}-injective rings are given. It is proved that if R is semilocal, then R is right \aleph_{0}-injective if and only if every homomorphism from a countably generated small right ideal of R to R_{R} can be extended to one from R_{R} to R_{R}. It is also shown that if R is right noetherian and left \aleph_{0}-injective, then R is \emph{QF}. This result can be considered as an approach to the Faith-Menal conjecture.
