We study the generalization of the idea of a local quiver of a representation of a formally smooth algebra, to broader classes of finitely generated algebras. In this new setting we can construct for every semisimple representation M a local model and a non-commutative tangent cone. The representation schemes of these new algebras model the local structure and the tangent cone of the representation scheme of the original algebra at M. In this way one can try to classify algebras according to their local behavior. As an application we will show that the tangent cones of Calabi Yau 2 Algebras are always preprojective algebras. For Calabi Yau 3 Algebras the corresponding statement would be that the local model and the tangent cones derive from superpotentials. Although we do not have a proof in all cases, we will show that this will indeed hold in many cases.
