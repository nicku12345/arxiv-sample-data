The notion of double coset for semisimple finite dimensional Hopf algebras is introduced. This is done by considering an equivalence relation on the set of irreducible characters of the dual Hopf algebra. As an application formulae for the restriction of the irreducible characters to normal Hopf subalgebras are given.
