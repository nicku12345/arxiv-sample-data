We construct several families of Artin-Schelter regular algebras of global dimension four using double Ore extension and then prove that all these algebras are strongly noetherian, Auslander regular, Koszul and Cohen-Macaulay domains. Many regular algebras constructed in the paper are new and are not isomorphic to either a normal extension or an Ore extension of an Artin-Schelter regular algebra of global dimension three.
