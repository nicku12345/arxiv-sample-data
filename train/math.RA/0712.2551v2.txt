Take A to be a regular quadratic algebra of global dimension three. We observe that there are examples of A containing a dimension three regular cubic algebra C. If B is another dimension three regular quadratic algebra, also containing C as a subalgebra, then we can form the pushout algebra D of the inclusions i_1:C\hookrightarrow A and i_2:C\hookrightarrow B. We show that for a certain class of regular algebras C\hookrightarrow A,B, their pushouts D are regular quadratic algebras of global dimension four. Furthermore, some of the point module structures of the dimension three algebras get passed on to the pushout algebra D.
