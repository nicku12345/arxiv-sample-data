A subalgebra B of a Lie algebra L is {\em c-supplemented} in L if there is a subalgebra C of L with L = B + C and B \cap C \leq B_L, where B_L is the core of B in L. This is analogous to the corresponding concept of a c-supplemented subgroup in a finite group. We say that L is {\em c-supplemented} if every subalgebra of L is c-supplemented in L. We give here a complete characterisation of c-supplemented Lie algebras over a general field.
