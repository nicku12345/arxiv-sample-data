We define and study the symmetric version of differential torsion theories. We prove that the symmetric versions of some of the existing results on derivations on right modules of quotients hold for derivations on symmetric modules of quotients. In particular, we prove that the symmetric Lambek, Goldie and perfect torsion theories are differential.   We also study conditions under which a derivation on a right or symmetric module of quotients extends to a right or symmetric module of quotients with respect to a larger torsion theory. Using these results, we study extensions of ring derivations to maximal, total and perfect right and symmetric rings of quotients.
