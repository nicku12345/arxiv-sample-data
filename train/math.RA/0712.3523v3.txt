A torsion theory is called differential (higher differential) if a derivation (higher derivation) can be extended from any module to the module of quotients corresponding to the torsion theory. We study conditions equivalent to higher differentiability of a torsion theory. It is known that the Lambek, Goldie and any perfect torsion theories are differential. We show that these classes of torsion theories are higher differential as well. Then, we study conditions under which a higher derivation extended to a right module of quotients extends also to a right module of quotients with respect to a larger torsion theory. Lastly, we define and study the symmetric version of higher differential torsion theories. We prove that the symmetric versions of the results on higher differential (one-sided) torsion theories hold for higher derivations on symmetric modules of quotients. In particular, we prove that the symmetric Lambek, Goldie and any perfect torsion theories are higher differential.
