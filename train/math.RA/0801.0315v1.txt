Denote by \continuum=2^{\aleph_0} the cardinal of continuum. We construct an intriguing family (P_\alpha: \alpha\in\continuum) of prime z-ideals in \C_0(\reals) with the following properties:   If f\in P_{i_0} for some i_0\in\continuum, then f\in P_i for all but finitely many i\in \continuum;   \bigcap_{i\neq i_0} P_i \nsubset P_{i_0} for each \i_0\in \continuum.   We also construct a well-ordered increasing chain, as well as a well-ordered decreasing chain, of order type \kappa of prime z-ideals in \C_0(\reals) for any ordinal \kappa of cardinality \continuum.
