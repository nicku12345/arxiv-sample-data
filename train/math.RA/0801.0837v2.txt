In this paper, we study a subclass of the class of MD-algebras, i.e., the class of solvable real Lie algebras such that the K-orbits of its corresponding connected and simply connected Lie groups are either orbits of dimension zero or orbits with maximal dimensions. Our main result is to classify, up to isomorphism, all the 5-dimensional MD-algebras having commutative derived ideals.
