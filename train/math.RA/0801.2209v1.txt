In this paper it is proved that an irreducible weight module with finite-dimensional weight spaces over the Schr\"{o}dinger-Virasoro algebras is a highest/lowest weight module or a uniformly bounded module. Furthermore, indecomposable modules of the intermediate series over these algebras are completely determined.
