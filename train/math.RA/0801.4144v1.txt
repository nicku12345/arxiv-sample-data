Verma modules over the W-algebra W(2,2) were considered by Zhang and Dong, while the Harish-Chandra modules and irreducible weight modules over the same algebra were classified by Liu and Zhu etc. In the present paper we shall investigate the Lie bialgebra structures on the referred algebra, which are shown to be triangular coboundary.
