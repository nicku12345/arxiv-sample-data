We introduce an infinitesimal Hopf algebra of planar trees, generalising the construction of the non-commutative Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra. A non-degenerate pairing and a dual basis are defined, and a combinatorial interpretation of the pairing in terms of orders on the vertices of planar forests is given. Moreover, the coproduct and the pairing can also be described with the help of a partial order on the set of planar forests, making it isomorphic to the Tamari poset. As a corollary, the dual basis can be computed with a M\"obius inversion.
