It follows from a recent paper by Ding and Wang that any ring which is generalized supplemented as left module over itself is semiperfect. The purpose of this note is to show that Ding and Wang's claim is not true and that the class of generalized supplemented rings lies properly between the class of semilocal and semiperfect rings. Moreover we rectify their claim by introducing a wider notion of local submodules.
