A Vogan diagram is a Dynkin diagram of a Kac-Moody Lie algebra of finite or affine type overlayed with additional structures. This paper develops the theory of Vogan diagrams for almost compact real forms of indecomposable twisted affine Kac- Moody Lie algebras and shows that equivalence classes of Vogan diagrams correspond to isomorphism classes of almost compact real forms of twisted affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras as given by H. Ben Messaoud and G. Rousseau.
