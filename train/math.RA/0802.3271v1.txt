Recently, the classical Freudenthal Magic Square has been extended over fields of characteristic 3 with two more rows and columns filled with (mostly simple) Lie superalgebras specific of this characteristic. This Supermagic Square will be reviewed and some of the simple Lie superalgebras that appear will be shown to be isomorphic to the Tits-Kantor-Koecher Lie superalgebras of some Jordan superalgebras.
