When n is odd, a cohomology of type Hochschild for n-ary partially associative algebras has been defined in Gnedbaye's thesis. Unfortunately, the cohomology definition is not valid when n is even. This fact is found again in the computations of the n-ary partially associative free algebra.   In this work, we define in a first time two approachs of an Hochschild cohomology for n-ary partially associative algebras. First by reducing the space of cochains, secondly by using a graded version. Next we compute the free n-ary algebra, giving a basis of this algebra. At last we extend the notion of coalgebras to n-ary algebras.
