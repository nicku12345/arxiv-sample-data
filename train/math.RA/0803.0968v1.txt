We prove that a Lie nilpotent one-sided ideal of an associative ring R is contained in a Lie solvable two-sided ideal of R. An estimation of derived length of such Lie solvable ideal is obtained depending on the class of Lie nilpotency of the Lie nilpotent one-sided ideal of R. One-sided Lie nilpotent ideals contained in ideals generated by commutators of the form [... [ [r_1, r_{2}], ... ], r_{n-1}], r_{n}] are also studied.
