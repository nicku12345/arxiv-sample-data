We use the concept of a regular object with respect to another object in an arbitrary category, defined in \cite{dntd}, in order to obtain the transfer of regularity in the sense of Zelmanowitz between the categories R-mod and S-mod, when S is an excellent extension of the ring R. Consequently, we obtain a result of \cite{ps}: if S is an excellent extension of the ring R, then S is von Neumann regular ring if and only if R is also von Neumann regular ring. In the second part, using relative regular modules, we give a new proof of a classical result: the von Neumann regular property of a ring is Morita invariant. Finally, the von Neumann regularity of the Morita ring is investigated.
