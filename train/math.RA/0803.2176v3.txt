A ring R is called strongly clean if every element of R is the sum of a unit and an idempotent that commute.   By {\rm SRC} factorization, Borooah, Diesl, and Dorsey   \cite{BDD051} completely determined when {\mathbb M}_n(R) over a commutative local ring R is strongly clean.   We generalize the notion of {\rm SRC} factorization to commutative rings, prove that commutative n-{\rm SRC} rings (n\ge 2) are precisely the commutative local rings over which {\mathbb M}_n(R) is strongly clean, and characterize strong cleanness of matrices over commutative projective-free rings having {\rm ULP}. The strongly \pi-regular property (hence, strongly clean property) of {\mathbb M}_n(C(X,{\mathbb C})) with X a {\rm P}-space relative to {\mathbb C} is also obtained where C(X,{\mathbb C}) is the ring of complex valued continuous functions.
