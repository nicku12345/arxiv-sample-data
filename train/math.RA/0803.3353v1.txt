Let R be an associative ring with identity, C(R) denote the center of R, and g(x) be a polynomial in the polynomial ring C(R)[x]. R is called strongly g(x)-clean if every element r \in R can be written as r=s+u with g(s)=0, u a unit of R, and su=us. The relation between strongly g(x)-clean rings and strongly clean rings is determined, some general properties of strongly g(x)-clean rings are given, and strongly g(x)-clean rings generated by units are discussed.
