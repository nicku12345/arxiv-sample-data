In this paper, we define the Gr\"obner-Shirshov basis for a dialgebra. The Composition-Diamond lemma for dialgebras is given then. As results, we give Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases for the universal enveloping algebra of a Leibniz algebra, the bar extension of a dialgebra, the free product of two dialgebras, and Clifford dialgebra. We obtain some normal forms for algebras mentioned the above.
