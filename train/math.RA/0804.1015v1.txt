We prove that if a positively-graded ring R is Gorenstein and the associated torsion functor has finite cohomological dimension, then the corresponding noncommutative projective scheme {\rm Tails}(R) is a Gorenstein category in the sense of \cite{EEG}. Moreover, under this condition, a (right) recollement relating Gorenstein-injective sheaves in {\rm Tails}(R) and (graded) Gorenstein-injective R-modules is given.
