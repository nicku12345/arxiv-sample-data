Let R be a commutative local ring. It is proved that R is Henselian if and only if each R-algebra which is a direct limit of module finite R-algebras is strongly clean. So, the matrix ring \mathbb{M}_n(R) is strongly clean for each integer n>0 if R is Henselian and we show that the converse holds if either the residue class field of R is algebraically closed or R is an integrally closed domain or R is a valuation ring. It is also shown that each R-algebra which is locally a direct limit of module-finite algebras, is strongly clean if R is a \pi-regular commutative ring.
