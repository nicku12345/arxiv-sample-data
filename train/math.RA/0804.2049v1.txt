It is known that with precision till isomorphism that only and only loops M(F) = M_0(F)/<-1>, where M_0(F) denotes the loop, consisting from elements of all matrix Cayley-Dickson algebra C(F) with norm 1, and F be a subfield of arbitrary fixed algebraically closed field, are simple non-associative Moufang loops. In this paper it is proved that the simple loops M(F) they and only they are not embedded into a loops of invertible elements of any unitaly alternative algebras if \text{char} F \neq 2 and F is closed under square root operation. For the remaining Moufang loops such an embedding is possible. Using this embedding it is quite simple to prove the well-known finding: the finite Moufang p-loop is centrally nilpotent.
