Let L be a commutative Moufang loop (CML) with multiplication group \frak M, and let \frak F(L), \frak F(\frak M) be the Frattini subgroup and Frattini subgroup of L and \frak M respectively. It is proved that \frak F(L) = L if and only if \frak F(\frak M) = \frak M and is described the structure of this CLM. Constructively it is defined the notion of normalizer for subloops in CML. Using this it is proved that if \frak F(L) \neq L then L satisfies the normalizer condition and that any divisible subgroup of \frak M is an abelian group and serves as a direct factor for \frak M.
