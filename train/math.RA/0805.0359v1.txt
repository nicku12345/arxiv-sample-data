A ring R is called strongly clean if every element of R is the sum of a unit and an idempotent that commute with each other. A recent result of Borooah, Diesl and Dorsey \cite{BDD05a} completely characterized the commutative local rings R for which {\mathbb M}_n(R) is strongly clean. For a general local ring R and n>1, however, it is unknown when the matrix ring {\mathbb M}_n(R) is strongly clean. Here we completely determine the local rings R for which {\mathbb M}_2(R) is strongly clean.
