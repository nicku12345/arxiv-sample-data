Let A=K< X_1,...,X_n> /< {\cal G}> be a K-algebra defined by a finite Gr\"obner basis {\cal G}. It is shown how to use the Ufnarovski graph \Gamma ({\bf LM}({\cal G})) and the graph of n-chains \Gamma_{\rm C}({\bf LM}({\cal G})) to calculate gl.dimG^{\mathbb{N}}(A) and gl.dim\widetilde{A}, where G^{\mathbb{N}}(A), respectively \widetilde{A}, is the associated \mathbb{N}-graded algebra of A, respectively the Rees algebra of A with respect to the \mathbb{N}-filtration FA of A induced by a weight \mathbb{N}-grading filtration of K< X_1,...,X_n>.
