Models of the exceptional simple modular Lie superalgebras in characteristic p\geq 3, that have appeared in the classification due to Bouarroudj, Grozman and Leites of the Lie superalgebras with indecomposable symmetrizable Cartan matrices, are provided. The models relate these exceptional Lie superalgebras to some low dimensional nonassociative algebraic systems.
