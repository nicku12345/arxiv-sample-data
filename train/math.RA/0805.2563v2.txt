Let K be a field. We attach to each finite poset \mathbb P a von Neumann regular K-algebra Q_K(\mathbb P) in a functorial way. We show that the monoid of isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective Q_K(\mathbb P)-modules is the abelian monoid generated by \mathbb P with the only relations given by p=p+q whenever q<p in \mathbb P. This extends the class of monoids for which there is a positive solution to the realization problem for von Neumann regular rings.
