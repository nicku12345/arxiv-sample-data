Given two rings R \subseteq S, S is said to be a minimal ring extension of R if R is a maximal subring of S. In this article, we study minimal extensions of an arbitrary ring R, with particular focus on those possessing nonzero ideals that intersect R trivially. We will also classify the minimal ring extensions of prime rings, generalizing results of Dobbs, Dobbs & Shapiro, and Ferrand & Olivier on commutative minimal extensions.
