In this paper we classify the laws of three-dimensional and four-dimensional nilpotent Jordan algebras over the field of complex numbers. We describe the irreducible components of their algebraic varieties and extend contractions and deformations among them. In particular, we prove that J2 and J3 are irreducible and that J4 is the union of the Zariski closures of two rigid Jordan algebras.
