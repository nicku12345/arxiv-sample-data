We study central simple algebras with involution of the first kind that become hyperbolic over the function field of the conic associated to a given quaternion algebra Q. We classify these algebras in degree~4 and give an example of such a division algebra with orthogonal involution of degree~8 that does not contain Q with its canonical involution, even though it contains Q and is totally decomposable into a tensor product of quaternion algebras with involution.
