Building on the work of K. Chiba (J. Algebra 263 (2003), 75-87), we present sufficient conditions for the completion of a division ring with respect to the metric defined by a discrete valuation function to contain a free field, i.e. the universal field of fractions of a free associative algebra. Several applications to division rings generated by torsion-free nilpotent groups, skew Laurent series and related division rings are discussed.
