The paper is an implementation in low dimensional cases of the classification method presented before by Rakhimov and Bekbaev. We give a complete classification of a subclass of complex filiform Leibniz algebras obtained from the naturally graded non-Lie filiform Leibniz algebras. A hypothetic formula for the adapted number of isomorphism classes is given.
