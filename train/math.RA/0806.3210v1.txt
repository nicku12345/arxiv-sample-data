We prove the following generalization of the classical Shephard-Todd-Chevalley Theorem. Let G be a finite group of graded algebra automorphisms of a skew polynomial ring A:=k_{p_{ij}}[x_1,...,x_n]. Then the fixed subring A^G has finite global dimension if and only if G is generated by quasi-reflections. In this case the fixed subring A^G is isomorphic a skew polynomial ring with possibly different p_{ij}'s. A version of the theorem is proved also for abelian groups acting on general quantum polynomial rings.
