An involution # on an associative ring R is \textit{formally real} if a sum of nonzero elements of the form r^# r where r \in R is nonzero. Suppose that R is a central simple algebra (i.e. R=M_n(D) for some integer n and central division algebra D) and # is an involution on R of the form r^# = a^{-1} r^\ast a, where \ast is some transpose involution on R and a is an invertible matrix such that a^\ast=\pm a. In section 1 we characterize formal reality of # in terms of a and \ast|_D. In later sections we apply this result to the study of formal reality of involutions on crossed product division algebras. We can characterize involutions on D=(K/F,\Phi) that extend to a formally real involution on the split algebra D \otimes_F K \cong M_n(K). Every such involution is formally real but we show that there exist formally real involutions on D which are not of this form. In particular, there exists a formally real involution # for which the hermitian trace form x \mapsto \tr(x^#x) is not positive semidefinite.
