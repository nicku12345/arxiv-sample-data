In this paper, we introduce (almost) skew 2-nomial algebras and look for a one-sided or two-sided Gr\"obner basis theory for such algebras at a modest level. That is, we establish the existence of a skew multiplicative K-basis for every skew 2-nomial algebra, and we explore the existence of a (left, right, or two-sided) monomial ordering for an (almost) skew 2-nomial algebra. As distinct from commonly recognized algebras holding a Gr\"obner basis theory (such as algebras of the solvable type [K-RW] and some of their homomorphic images), a subclass of skew 2-nomial algebras that have a left Gr\"obner basis theory but may not necessarily have a two-sided Gr\"obner basis theory, respectively a subclass of skew 2-nomial algebras that have a right Gr\"obner basis theory but may not necessarily have a two-sided Gr\"obner basis theory, are determined such that numerous quantum binomial algebras (which provide binomial solutions to the Yang-baxter equation [Laf], [G-I2]) are involved.
