Let k be an algebraically closed base field of characteristic zero. The category equivalence between central simple algebras and irreducible, generically free PGL_n-varieties is extended to the context of central simple algebras with involution. The associated variety of a central simple algebra with involution comes with an action of the semidirect product P_{n,\tau}:=PGL_n\rtimes<\tau>, where \tau is the automorphism of \PGLn given by \tau(h)=(h^{-1})^transpose. Basic properties of an involution are described in terms of the action of P_{n,\tau} on the associated variety, and in particular in terms of the stabilizer in general position for this action.
