The determination of the maximal ranks of a set of a given type of tensors is a basic problem both in theory and application. In statistical applications, the maximal rank is related to the number of necessary parameters to be built in a tensor model. Based on this classical theorem by Bosch we will show the tight bound for 2 x n x n tensors by simple row and column operations, symmetrization and mathematical induction, which has been given by several authors based on eigenvalue theories.
