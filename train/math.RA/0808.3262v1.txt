Let L be a finite dimensional Lie algebra over a field F. It is well known that the solvable radical S(L) of the algebra L is a characteristic ideal of L if \char F=0 and there are counterexamples to this statement in case \char F=p>0. We prove that the sum S(L) of all solvable ideals of a Lie algebra L (not necessarily finite dimensional) is a characteristic ideal of L in the following cases: 1) \char F=0; 2) S(L) is solvable and its derived length is less than \log_{2}p. Some estimations (in characteristic 0) for the derived length of ideals I+D(I)+... +D^{k}(I) are obtained where I is a solvable ideal of L and D\in Der(L).
