Let \mathcal{A}=(A_{1},...,A_{n},...) be a finite or infinite sequence of 2\times2 matrices with entries in an integral domain. We show that, except for a very special case, \mathcal{A} is (simultaneously) triangularizable if and only if all pairs (A_{j},A_{k}) are triangularizable, for 1\leq j,k\leq\infty. We also provide a simple numerical criterion for triangularization.   Using constructive methods in invariant theory, we define a map (with the minimal number of invariants) that distinguishes simultaneous similarity classes for non-commutative sequences over a field of characteristic \neq2. We also describe canonical forms for sequences of 2\times2 matrices over algebraically closed fields, and give a method for finding sequences with a given set of invariants.
