Motivated by the study of von Neumann regular skew groups as carried out by Alfaro, Ara and del Rio in 1995 we investigate regular and biregular Hopf module algebras. If A is an algebra with an action by an affine Hopf algebra H, then any H-stable left ideal of A is a direct summand if and only if A^H is regular and the invariance functor (-)^H induces an equivalence of A^H-Mod to the Wisbauer category of A as A# H-module. Analogously we show a similar statement for the biregularity of A relative to H where A^H is replaced by R=Z(A)\cap A^H using the module theory of A as a module over A\otimes A^{op} \bowtie H the envelopping Hopf algebroid of A and H. We show that every two-sided H-stable ideal of A is generated by a central H-invariant idempotent if and only if R is regular and A_m is H-simple for all maximal ideals m of R. Further sufficient conditions are given for A# H and A^H to be regular.
