The class of finitely presented algebras over a field K with a set of generators a_{1},..., a_{n} and defined by homogeneous relations of the form a_{1}a_{2}... a_{n} =a_{\sigma (a)} a_{\sigma (2)} ... a_{\sigma (n)}, where \sigma runs through a subset H of the symmetric group \Sym_{n} of degree n, is introduced. The emphasis is on the case of a cyclic subgroup H of \Sym_{n} of order n. A normal form of elements of the algebra is obtained. It is shown that the underlying monoid, defined by the same (monoid) presentation, has a group of fractions and this group is described. Properties of the algebra are derived. In particular, it follows that the algebra is a semiprimitive domain. Problems concerning the groups and algebras defined by arbitrary subgroups H of \Sym_{n} are proposed.
