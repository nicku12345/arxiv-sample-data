The famous Gelfand formula \rho(A)= \limsup_{n\to\infty}\|A^{n}\|^{1/n} for the spectral radius of a matrix is of great importance in various mathematical constructions. Unfortunately, the range of applicability of this formula is substantially restricted by a lack of estimates for the rate of convergence of the quantities \|A^{n}\|^{1/n} to \rho(A). In the paper this deficiency is made up to some extent. By using the Bochi inequalities we establish explicit computable estimates for the rate of convergence of the quantities \|A^{n}\|^{1/n} to \rho(A). The obtained estimates are then extended for evaluation of the joint spectral radius of matrix sets.
