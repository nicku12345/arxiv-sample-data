We study centralizers of elements in domains. We generalize a result of the author and Small, showing that if A is a finitely generated noetherian domain and a\in A is not algebraic over the extended centre of A, then the centralizer of a has Gelfand-Kirillov dimension at most one less than the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of A. In the case that A is a finitely generated noetherian domain of GK dimension 3 over the complex numbers, we show that the centralizer of an element a A that is not algebraic over the extended centre of A satisfies a polynomial identity.
