In 1996 Jespers and Wang classified finite semigroups whose integral semigroup ring has finitely many units. In a recent paper, Iwaki-Juriaans-Souza Filho continued this line of research by partially classifying the finite semigroups whose rational semigroup algebra %over a field of characteristic zero, contains a {\mathbb{Z}}-order with hyperbolic unit group. In this paper we complete this classification by handling the case in which the semigroup is semi-simple.
