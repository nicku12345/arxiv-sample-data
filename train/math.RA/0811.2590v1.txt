We compute the dimension of the center of the 0-Hecke algebra \mathcal{H}_n and of the Nilcoxeter algebra \mathcal{NC}_n using a calculus of diagrams on the M\"{o}bius band. In the case of the Nilcoxeter algebra, this calculus is shown to produce a basis for Z(\mathcal{NC}_n) and the table of multiplication in this basis is shown to be trivial. We conjecture that a basis for Z(\mathcal{H}_n) can also be obtained in a specific way from this topological calculus.
