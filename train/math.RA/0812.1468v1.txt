In order to simultaneously generalize matrix rings and group graded crossed products, we introduce category crossed products. For such algebras we describe the center and the commutant of the coefficient ring. We also investigate the connection between on the one hand maximal commutativity of the coefficient ring and on the other hand nonemptyness of intersections of the coefficient ring by nonzero twosided ideals.
