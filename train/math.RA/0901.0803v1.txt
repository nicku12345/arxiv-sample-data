A skew meadow is a non-commutative ring with an inverse operator satisfying two special equations and in which the inverse of zero is zero. All skew fields and products of skew fields can be viewed as skew meadows. Conversely, we give an embedding of non-trivial skew meadows into products of skew fields, from which a completeness result for the equational logic of skew fields is derived. The relationship between regularity conditions on rings and skew meadows is investigated.
