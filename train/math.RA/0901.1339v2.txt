In this paper we investigate Lie bialgebra structures on the Schr\"odinger-Virasoro algebra \LL. Surprisingly, we find out an interesting fact that not all Lie bialgebra structures on the Schr\"odinger-Virasoro algebra are triangular coboundary, which is different from the related known results of some Lie algebras related to the Virasoro algebra.
