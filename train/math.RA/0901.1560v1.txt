It is proved that localizations of injective R-modules of finite Goldie dimension are injective if R is an arithmetical ring satisfying the following condition: for every maximal ideal P, R_P is either coherent or not semicoherent. If, in addition, each finitely generated R-module has finite Goldie dimension, then localizations of finitely injective R-modules are finitely injective too. Moreover, if R is a Pr\"ufer domain of finite character, localizations of injective R-modules are injective.
