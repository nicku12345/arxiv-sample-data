If R is a valuation domain of maximal ideal P with a maximal immediate extension of finite rank it is proven that there exists a finite sequence of prime ideals P=L_0\supset L_1\supset...\supset L_m\supseteq 0 such that R_{L_j}/L_{j+1} is almost maximal for each j, 0\leq j\leq m-1 and R_{L_m} is maximal if L_m\ne 0. Then we suppose that there is an integer n\geq 1 such that each torsion-free R-module of finite rank is a direct sum of modules of rank at most n. By adapting Lady's methods, it is shown that n\leq 3 if R is almost maximal, and the converse holds if R has a maximal immediate extension of rank \leq 2.
