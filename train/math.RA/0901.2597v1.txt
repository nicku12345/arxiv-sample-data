The purpose of this article is to study determinants of matrices which are known as generalized Pascal triangles (see [1]). We present a factorization by expressing such a matrix as a product of a unipotent lower triangular matrix, a Toeplitz matrix and a unipotent upper triangular matrix. The determinant of a generalized Pascal matrix equals thus the determinant of a Toeplitz matrix. This equality allows us to evaluate a few determinants of generalized Pascal matrices associated to certain sequences. In particular, we obtain families of quasi-Pascal matrices whose principal minors generate any arbitrary linear subsequences F(nr+s) or L(nr+s), (n=1, 2, 3, ...) of Fibonacci or Lucas sequence.
