The property of degeneration of modular graded Lie algebras, first investigated by B. Weisfeiler, is analyzed. Transitive irreducible graded Lie algebras L=\sum_{i\in \mathbb Z}L_i, over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>2, with classical reductive component L_0 are considered. We show that if a non-degenerate Lie algebra L contains a transitive degenerate subalgebra L' such that \dim L'_1>1, then L is an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra.
