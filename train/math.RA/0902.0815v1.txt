Let R be a 2-torsion free \sigma-prime ring. It is shown here that if U\not\subset Z(R) is a \sigma-Lie ideal of R and a, b in R such that aUb=\sigma(a)Ub=0, then either a=0 or b=0. This result is then applied to study the relationship between the structure of R and certain automorphisms on R. To end this paper, we describe additive maps d: R \longrightarrow R such that d(u^2) = 2ud(u) where u\in U, a nonzero \sigma-square closed Lie ideal of R.
