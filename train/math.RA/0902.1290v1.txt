This article discusses the concept of Boolean spaces endowed with a Boolean valued inner product and their matrices. A natural inner product structure for the space of Boolean n-tuples is introduced. Stochastic boolean vectors and stochastic and unitary Boolean matrices are studied. A dimension theorem for orthonormal bases of a Boolean space is proven. We characterize the invariant stochastic Boolean vectors for a Boolean stochastic matrix and show that they can be used to reduce a unitary matrix. Finally, we obtain a result on powers of stochastic and unitary matrices.
