We study the connection between small-overlap conditions and automaticity of semigroups. We restrict the discussion to conditions that imply embeddability and under which each relation decomposes into at least seven pieces. For these hyperbolic-like conditions we show how to construct an automatic structure. Furthermore, we show that the naive approach of considering just geodesics fails in our case.
