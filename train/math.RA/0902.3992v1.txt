Let R be a ring and \sigma an endomorphism of R. In this note, we study the transfert of the symmetry (\sigma-symmetry) and reversibility (\sigma-reversibility) from R to its skew power series ring R[[x;\sigma]]. Moreover, we study on the relationship between the Baerness, quasi-Baerness and p.p.-property of a ring R and these of the skew power series ring R[[x;\sigma]] in case R is right \sigma-reversible. As a consequence we obtain a generalization of \cite{hong/2000}.
