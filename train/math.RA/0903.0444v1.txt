The existence and construction of common invariant cones for families of real matrices is considered. The complete results are obtained for 2x2 matrices (with no additional restrictions) and for families of simultaneously diagonalizable matrices of any size. Families of matrices with a shared dominant eigenvector are considered under some additional conditions.
