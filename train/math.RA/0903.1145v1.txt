Novikov superalgebras are related to the quadratic conformal superalgebras which correspond to the Hamiltonian pairs and play fundamental role in the completely integrable systems. In this note, we divide Novikov superalgebras into two types: N and S. Then we show that the Novikov superalgebras of dimension up to 3 are of type N.
