It is proved that over every countable field K there is a nil algebra R such that the algebra obtained from R by extending the field K contains noncommutative free subalgebras of arbitrarily high rank.   It is also shown that over every countable field K there is an algebra R without noncommutative free subalgebras of rank two such that the algebra obtained from R by extending the field K contains a noncommutative free subalgebra of rank two.   This answers a question of Makar-Limanov
