If R is a semiartinian Von Neumann regular ring, then the set \Prim_{R} of primitive ideals of R, ordered by inclusion, is an artinian poset in which all maximal chains have a greatest element. Moreover, if \Prim_{R} has no infinite antichains, then the lattice \BL_{2}(R) of all ideals of R is anti-isomorphic to the lattice of all upper subsets of \Prim_{R}. Since the assignment U\mapsto r_R(U) defines a bijection from any set \Simp_R of representatives of simple right R-modules to \Prim_{R}, a natural partial order is induced in \Simp_R, under which the maximal elements are precisely those simple right R-modules which are finite dimensional over the respective endomorphism division rings; these are always R-injective. Given any artinian poset I with at least two elements and having a finite cofinal subset, a lower subset I'\sbs I and a field D, we present a construction which produces a semiartinian and unit-regular D-algebra D_I having the following features: (a) \Simp_{D_I} is order isomorphic to I; (b) the assignment H\mapsto\Simp_{D_I/H} realizes an anti-isomorphism from the lattice \BL_{2}(D_I) to the lattice of all upper subsets of \Simp_{D_I}; (c) a non-maximal element of \Simp_{D_I} is injective if and only if it corresponds to an element of I', thus D_I is a right V-ring if and only if I' = I; (d) D_I is a right \emph{and} left V-ring if and only if I is an antichain; (e) if I has finite dual Krull length, then D_I is (right and left) hereditary; (f) if I is at most countable and I' = \vu, then D_I is a countably dimensional D-algebra.
