We prove that for a noetherian semilocal ring R with exactly k isomorphism classes of simple right modules the monoid V^*(R) of isomorphism classes of countably generated projective right (left) modules, viewed as a submonoid of V^*(R/J(R)), is isomorphic to the monoid of solutions in (\No \cup\{\infty\})^k of a system consisting of congruences and diophantine linear equations. The converse also holds, that is, if M is a submonoid of (\No \cup\{\infty\})^k containing an order unit (n_1,..., n_k) of \No^k which is the set of solutions of a system of congruences and linear diophantine equations then it can be realized as V^*(R) for a noetherian semilocal ring such that R/J(R)\cong M_{n_1}(D_1)\times ... \times M_{n_k}(D_k) for suitable division rings D_1,..., D_k.
