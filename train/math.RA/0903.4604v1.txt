In this paper we investigate the description of the complex Leibniz superalgebras with nilindex n+m, where n and m (m\neq 0) are dimensions of even and odd parts, respectively. In fact, such superalgebras with characteristic sequence equal to (n_1, ..., n_k | m_1, ..., m_s) (where n_1+... +n_k=n, m_1+ ... + m_s=m) for n_1\geq n-1 and (n_1, ..., n_k | m) were classified in works \cite{FilSup}--\cite{C-G-O-Kh1}. Here we prove that in the case of (n_1, ..., n_k| m_1, ..., m_s), where n_1\leq n-2 and m_1 \leq m-1 the Leibniz superalgebras have nilindex less than n+m. Thus, we complete the classification of Leibniz superalgebras with nilindex n+m.
