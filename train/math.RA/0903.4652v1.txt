Crystalline graded rings are generalizations of certain classes of rings like generalized twisted group rings, generalized Weyl algebras, and generalized skew crossed products. When the base ring is a commutative Dedekind domain, two constructions are given for producing maximal graded orders. On the way, a new concept appears, so-called, spectrally twisted group. Some general properties of it are studied. At the end of the paper several examples are considered.
