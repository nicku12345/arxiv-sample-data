Let A be a bi-Koszul algebra, we describe all possible A_\infty-algebra structures on the Ext-algebra E(A), and prove that E(A) must be [m_2, m_3]-finitely generated. An equivalent description for a connected graded algebra to be a bi-Koszul algebra is given in terms of A_\infty-language. The case that E(A) is endowed with minimal number of multiplications is discussed for decomposition.
