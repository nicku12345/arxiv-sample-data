The class of finitely presented algebras over a field K with a set of generators a_{1},..., a_{n} and defined by homogeneous relations of the form a_{1}a_{2}... a_{n} =a_{\sigma (1)} a_{\sigma (2)} ... a_{\sigma (n)}, where \sigma runs through \Alt_{n}, the alternating group, is considered. The associated group, defined by the same (group) presentation, is described. A description of the radical of the algebra is found. It turns out that the radical is a finitely generated ideal that is nilpotent and it is determined by a congruence on the underlying monoid, defined by the same presentation.
