An algebra \mathcal{A} of real or complex valued functions defined on a set \mathbf{T} shall be called \textit{homotonic} if \mathcal{A} is closed under forming of absolute values, and for all f and g in \mathcal{A}, the product f\times g satisfies |f\times g|\le|f|\times|g|. Our main purpose in this paper is two-fold: To show that the above definition is equivalent to an earlier definition of homotonicity, and to provide a simple inequality which characterizes sub-multiplicativity and strong stability for weighted sup norms on homotonic algebras.
