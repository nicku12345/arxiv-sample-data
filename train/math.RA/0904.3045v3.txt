In this paper, we study the relation between m-strongly Gorenstein projective (resp. injective) modules and n-strongly Gorenstein projective (resp. injective) modules whenever m \neq n, and the homological behavior of n-strongly Gorenstein projective (resp. injective) modules. We introduce the notion of n-strongly Gorenstein flat modules. Then we study the homological behavior of n-strongly Gorenstein flat modules, and the relation between these modules and n-strongly Gorenstein projective (resp. injective) modules.
