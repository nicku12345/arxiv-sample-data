We prove that two semigroups with local units are Morita equivalent if and only if they have a joint enlargement. This approach to Morita theory provides a natural framework for understanding McAlister's theory of the local structure of regular semigroups. In particular, we prove that a semigroup with local units is Morita equivalent to an inverse semigroup precisely when it is a regular locally inverse semigroup.
