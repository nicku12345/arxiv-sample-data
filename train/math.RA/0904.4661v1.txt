In this paper we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for strongly group graded rings to be simple. For a strongly group graded ring R = \bigoplus_{g\in G} R_g the grading group G acts, in a natural way, as automorphisms of the commutant of the neutral component subring R_e in R and of the center of R_e. We show that if R is a strongly G-graded ring where R_e is maximal commutative in R, then R is a simple ring if and only if R_e is G-simple (i.e. there are no nontrivial G-invariant ideals). We also show that if R_e is commutative (not necessarily maximal commutative) and the commutant of R_e is G-simple, then R is a simple ring. These results apply to G-crossed products in particular. A skew group ring R_e \rtimes_{\sigma} G, where R_e is commutative, is shown to be a simple ring if and only if R_e is G-simple and maximal commutative in R_e \rtimes_{\sigma} G. As an interesting example we consider the skew group algebra C(X) \rtimes_{\tilde{h}} \mathbb{Z} associated to a topological dynamical system (X,h). We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for simplicity of C(X) \rtimes_{\tilde{h}} \mathbb{Z} with respect to the dynamics of the dynamical system (X,h), but also with respect to algebraic properties of C(X) \rtimes_{\tilde{h}} \mathbb{Z}. Furthermore, we show that for any strongly G-graded ring R each nonzero ideal of R has a nonzero intersection with the commutant of the center of the neutral component.
