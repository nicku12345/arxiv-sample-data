We call a monoidal category {\mathcal C} a Serre category if for any C, D \in {\mathcal C} such that C\ot D is semisimple, C and D are semisimple objects in {\mathcal C}. Let H be an involutory Hopf algebra, M, N two H-(co)modules such that M \otimes N is (co)semisimple as a H-(co)module. If N (resp. M) is a finitely generated projective k-module with invertible Hattory-Stallings rank in k then M (resp. N) is (co)semisimple as a H-(co)module. In particular, the full subcategory of all finite dimensional modules, comodules or Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over H the dimension of which is invertible in k are Serre categories.
