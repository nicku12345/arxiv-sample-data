We investigate the ascending Loewy socle series of Leavitt path algebras L_K(E) for an arbitrary graph E and field K. We classify those graphs E for which L_K(E)=S_{\lambda} for some element S_{\lambda} of the Loewy socle series. We then show that for any ordinal \lambda there exists a graph E so that the Loewy length of L_K(E) is \lambda. Moreover, \lambda \leq \omega  (the first infinite ordinal) if E is a row-finite graph.
