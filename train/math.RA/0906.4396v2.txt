Let K\langle X\rangle =K\langle X_1,...,X_n\rangle be the free algebra of n generators over a field K, and let R\langle X\rangle =R\langle X_1,...,X_n\rangle be the free algebra of n generators over an arbitrary commutative ring R. In this semi-expository paper, it is clarified that any monic Gr\"obner basis in K\langle X\rangle may give rise to a monic Gr\"obner basis of the same type in R\langle X\rangle, and vice versa. This fact turns out that many important R-algebras have defining relations which form a monic Gr\"obner basis, and consequently, such R-algebras may be studied via a nice PBW structure theory as that developed for quotient algebras of K\langle X\rangle in ([LWZ], [Li2, 3]).
