Let K be a field and R=\oplus_{p\in\mathbb{N}}R_p an \mathbb{N}-graded K-algebra, which has an SM K-basis (i.e. a skew multiplicative K-basis) such that R holds a Gr\"obner basis theory. It is proved that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of Gr\"obner bases in R and the set of dh-closed homogeneous Gr\"obner bases in the polynomial algebra R[t]; and that the similar result holds true if R and R[t] are replaced respectively by the free algebra K< X_1,...,X_n> and the free algebra K< X_1,...,X_n,T>. Moreover, it is shown that dh-closed graded ideals in R[t] and K< X_1,...,X_n, T> can be realized by dh-closed homogeneous Gr\"obner bases. The latter result indeed tells us that algebras defined by dh-homogeneous Gr\"obner bases can be studied as Rees algebras effectively via more simpler algebras as demonstrated in ([7], [8]).
