Given a ring R, we study the bimodules M for which the trivial extension R\propto M is morphic. We obtain a complete characterization in the case where R is left perfect, and we prove that R\propto Q/R is morphic when R is a commutative reduced ring with classical ring of quotients Q. We also extend some known results concerning the connection between morphic rings and unit regular rings.
