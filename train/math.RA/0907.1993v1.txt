This paper is a continuation of the papers J. Pure Appl. Algebra, 210 (2007), 437--445 and J. Algebra Appl., 8 (2009), 219--227. Namely, we introduce and study a doubly filtered set of classes of modules of finite Gorenstein projective dimension, which are called (n,m)-strongly Gorenstein projective ((n,m)-SG-projective for short) for integers n\geq 1 and m\geq 0. We are mainly interested in studying syzygies of these modules. As consequences, we show that a module M has Gorenstein projective dimension at most m if and only if M\oplus G is (1,m)-SG-projective for some Gorenstein projective module G. And, over rings of finite left finitistic flat dimension, that a module of finite Gorenstein projective dimension has finite projective dimension if and only if it has finite flat dimension.
