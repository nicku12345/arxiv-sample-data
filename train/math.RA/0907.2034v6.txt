We study \delta-derivations -- a construction simultaneously generalizing derivations and centroid. First, we compute \delta-derivations of current Lie algebras and of modular Zassenhaus algebra. This enables us to provide examples of Lie algebras having 1/2-derivations which are divisors of zero, thus answering negatively a question of Filippov. Second, we note that \delta-derivations allow, in some circumstances, to construct examples of non-semigroup gradings of Lie algebras, in addition to the recent ones discovered by Elduque. Third, we note that utilizing the construction of the Grassmann envelope allows to obtain results about \delta-(super)derivations of Lie superalgebras from the corresponding results about Lie algebras. In this way, we prove that prime Lie superalgebras do not possess nontrivial \delta-(super)derivations, generalizing the recent result of Kaygorodov.
