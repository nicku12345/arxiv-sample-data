The Cayley-Dickson algebras R (real numbers), C (complex numbers), H (quaternions), O (octonions), S (sedenions), and T (trigintaduonions) have attracted the attention of several mathematicians and physicists because of their important applications in both pure mathematics and theoretical physics. This paper deals with the determination of the subalgebra structure of the algebra T by analyzing the loop T_L of order 64 generated by its 32 basis elements. The analysis shows that T_L is a non-associative finite invertible loop (NAFIL) with 373 non-trivial subloops of orders 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 all of which are normal. These subloops generate subalgebras of T of dimensions 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 which form the elements of its structure.
