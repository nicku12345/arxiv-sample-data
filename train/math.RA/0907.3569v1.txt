This paper deals with the variety of commutative nonassociative algebras satisfying the identity L_x^3+ \gamma L_{x^3} = 0, \gamma \in K. Correa et al proved that if \gamma = 0,1 then any such finitely generated algebra is nilpotent. Here we generalize this result by proving that if \gamma \neq -1, then any such algebra is locally nilpotent. Our results require characteristic \neq 2,3.
