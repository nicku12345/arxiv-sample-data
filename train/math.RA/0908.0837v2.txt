Leavitt path algebras associate to directed graphs a \mathbb Z-graded algebra and in their simplest form recover the Leavitt algebras L(1,n). In this note, we introduce iterated Leavitt path algebras associated to directed weighted graphs which have natural \oplus \mathbb Z grading and in their simplest form recover the Leavitt algebras L(n,k). We also characterize Leavitt path algebras which are strongly graded.
