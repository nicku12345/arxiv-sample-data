In this paper, by using Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases, we show that in the following classes, each (resp. countably generated) algebra can be embedded into a simple (resp. two-generated) algebra: associative differential algebras, associative \Omega-algebras, associative \lambda-differential algebras. We show that in the following classes, each countably generated algebra over a countable field k can be embedded into a simple two-generated algebra: associative algebras, semigroups, Lie algebras, associative differential algebras, associative \Omega-algebras, associative \lambda-differential algebras. Also we prove that any countably generated module over a free associative algebra k< X> can be embedded into a cyclic k< X>-module, where |X|>1. We give another proofs of the well known theorems: each countably generated group (resp. associative algebra, semigroup, Lie algebra) can be embedded into a two-generated group (resp. associative algebra, semigroup, Lie algebra).
