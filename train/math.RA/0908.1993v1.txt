In this paper, we establish the Composition-Diamond lemma for \lambda-differential associative algebras over a field K  with multiple operators. As applications, we obtain Gr\"{o}bner-Shirshov bases of free \lambda-differential Rota-Baxter algebras. In particular, linear bases of free \lambda-differential Rota-Baxter algebras are obtained and consequently, the free \lambda-differential Rota-Baxter algebras are constructed by words.
