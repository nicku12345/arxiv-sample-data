For any field \K and integer n\geq 2 we consider the Leavitt algebra L_\K(n); for any integer d\geq 1 we form the matrix ring S = M_d(L_\K(n)). S is an associative algebra, but we view S as a Lie algebra using the bracket [a,b]=ab-ba for a,b \in S. We denote this Lie algebra as S^-, and consider its Lie subalgebra [S^-,S^-]. In our main result, we show that [S^-,S^-] is a simple Lie algebra if and only if char(\K) divides n-1 and char(\K) does not divide d. In particular, when d=1 we get that [L_\K(n)^-,L_\K(n)^-] is a simple Lie algebra if and only if char(\K) divides n-1.
