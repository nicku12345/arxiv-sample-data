In this paper, we establish the Composition-Diamond lemma for associative nonunitary Rota-Baxter algebras with weight \lambda. As applications, we obtain a linear basis of a free commutative Rota-Baxter algebra without unity and show that every countably generated Rota-Baxter algebra with weight 0 can be embedded into a two-generated Rota-Baxter algebra.
