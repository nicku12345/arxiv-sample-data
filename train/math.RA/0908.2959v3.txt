We prove new necessary and sufficient conditions for a morphism of coalgebras to be a monomorphism, different from the ones already available in the literature. More precisely, \phi: C \to D is a monomorphism of coalgebras if and only if the first cohomology groups of the coalgebras C and D coincide if and only if \sum_{i \in I}\epsilon(a^{i})b^{i} = \sum_{i \in I} a^{i} \epsilon(b^{i}), for all \sum_{i \in I}a^{i} \otimes b^{i} \in C \square_{D} C. In particular, necessary and sufficient conditions for a Hopf algebra map to be a monomorphism are given.
