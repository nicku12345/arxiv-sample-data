Given a unital associative ring S and a subring R, we say that S is an ideal (or Dorroh) extension of R if for some ideal I of S, S = R + I, where the sum is direct. In this note we investigate the ideal structure of an arbitrary ideal extension of an arbitrary ring R. In particular, we describe the Jacobson and upper nil radicals of such a ring, in terms of the Jacobson and upper nil radicals of R, and we determine when such a ring is prime and when it is semiprime. We also classify all the prime and maximal ideals of an ideal extension S of R, under certain assumptions on the ideal I. These are generalizations of earlier results in the literature.
