Motivated by the construction of new examples of Artin-Schelter regular algebras of global dimension four, J.J. Zhang and J. Zhang (2008) introduced an algebra extension A_P[y_1,y_2;\sigma,\delta,\tau] of A, which they called a double Ore extension. This construction seems to be similar to that of a two-step iterated Ore extension over A. The aim of this paper is to describe those double Ore extensions which can be presented as iterated Ore extensions of the form A[y_1;\sigma_1, \delta_1][y_2;\sigma_2, \delta_2]. We also give partial answers to some questions posed in Zhang and Zhang (2008).
