Let D be a division ring with the center F and D^* be the multiplicative group of D. In this paper we study locally nilpotent maximal subgroups of D^*. We give some conditions that influence the existence of locally nilpotent maximal subgroups in division ring with infinite center. Also, it is shown that if M is a locally nilpotent maximal subgroup that is algebraic over F, then either it is the multiplicative group of some maximal subfield of D or it is center by locally finite. If, in addition we assume that F is finite and M is nilpotent, then the second case cannot occur, i.e. M is the multiplicative group of some maximal subfield of D.
