In this paper, we study the moduli space of 2|1-dimensional complex associative algebras, which is also the moduli space of codifferentials on the tensor coalgebra of a 1|2-dimensional complex space. We construct the moduli space by considering extensions of lower dimensional algebras. We also construct miniversal deformations of these algebras. This gives a complete description of how the moduli space is glued together via jump deformations.
