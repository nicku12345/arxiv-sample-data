We study surjective homomorphisms f:\prod_I A_i\to B of not-necessarily-associative algebras over a commutative ring k, for I a generally infinite set; especially when k is a field and B is countable-dimensional over k.   Our results have the following consequences when k is an infinite field, the algebras are Lie algebras, and B is finite-dimensional:   If all the Lie algebras A_i are solvable, then so is B.   If all the Lie algebras A_i are nilpotent, then so is B.   If k is not of characteristic 2 or 3, and all the Lie algebras A_i are finite-dimensional and are direct products of simple algebras, then (i) so is B, (ii) f splits, and (iii) under a weak cardinality bound on I, f is continuous in the pro-discrete topology. A key fact used in getting (i)-(iii) is that over any such field, every finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra L can be written L=[x_1,L]+[x_2,L] for some x_1, x_2\in L, which we prove from a recent result of J.M.Bois.   The general technique of the paper involves studying conditions under which a homomorphism on \prod_I A_i must factor through the direct product of finitely many ultraproducts of the A_i.   Several examples are given, and open questions noted.
