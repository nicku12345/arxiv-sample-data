A characterization of right (left) quasi-duo skew polynomial rings of endomorphism type and skew Laurent polynomial rings are given. In particular, it is shown that (1) the polynomial ring R[x] is right quasi-duo iff R[x] is commutative modulo its Jacobson radical iff R[x] is left quasi-duo, (2) the skew Laurent polynomial ring is right quasi-duo iff it is left quasi-duo. These extend some known results concerning a description of quasi-duo polynomial rings and give a partial answer to the question posed by Lam and Dugas whether right quasi-duo rings are left quasi-duo.
