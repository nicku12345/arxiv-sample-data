We consider sets of operations on a set A that are closed under permutation of variables, addition of dummy variables and composition. We describe these closed sets in terms of a Galois connection between operations and systems of pointed multisets, and we also describe the closed sets of the dual objects by means of necessary and sufficient closure conditions. Moreover, we show that the corresponding closure systems are uncountable for every A with at least two elements.
