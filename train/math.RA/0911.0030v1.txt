Let A be a finite non-singleton set. For |A|=2 we show that the partial clone consisting of all selfdual monotone partial functions on A is not finitely generated, while it is the intersection of two finitely generated maximal partial clones on A. Moreover for |A| >= 3 we show that there are pairs of finitely generated maximal partial clones whose intersection is a non-finitely generated partial clone on A.
