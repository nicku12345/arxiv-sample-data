Let V denote a vector space with finite positive dimension. We consider an ordered pair of linear transformations A: V\to V and A^*: V\to V that satisfy (i) and (ii) below:   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A^* is diagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A^* is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A is diagonal.   We call such a pair a Leonard pair on V. In this paper, we characterize the Leonard pairs using the notion of a tail. This notion is borrowed from algebraic graph theory.
