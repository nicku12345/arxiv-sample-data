In this paper, building on prior joint work by Mallios and Ntumba, we show that \mathcal A-\textit{transvections} and \textit{singular symplectic }\mathcal A-\textit{automorphisms} of symplectic \mathcal A-modules of finite rank have properties similar to the ones enjoyed by their classical counterparts. The characterization of singular symplectic \mathcal A-automorphisms of symplectic \mathcal A-modules of finite rank is grounded on a newly introduced class of pairings of \mathcal A-modules: the \textit{orthogonally convenient pairings.} We also show that, given a symplectic \mathcal A-module \mathcal E of finite rank, with \mathcal A a \textit{PID-algebra sheaf}, any injective \mathcal A-morphism of a \textit{Lagrangian sub-\mathcal A-module} \mathcal F of \mathcal E into \mathcal E may be extended to an \mathcal A-symplectomorphism of \mathcal E such that its restriction on \mathcal F equals the identity of \mathcal F. This result also holds in the more general case whereby the underlying free \mathcal A-module \mathcal E is equipped with two symplectic \mathcal A-structures \omega_0 and \omega_1, but with \mathcal F being Lagrangian with respect to both \omega_0 and \omega_1. The latter is the analog of the classical \textit{Witt's theorem} for symplectic \mathcal A-modules of finite rank.
