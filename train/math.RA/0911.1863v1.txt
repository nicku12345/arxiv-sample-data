In this paper, as part of a project initiated by A. Mallios consisting of exploring new horizons for \textit{Abstract Differential Geometry} (\grave{a} la Mallios), \cite{mallios1997, mallios, malliosvolume2, modern}, such as those related to the \textit{classical symplectic geometry}, we show that results pertaining to biorthogonality in pairings of vector spaces do hold for biorthogonality in pairings of \mathcal A-modules. However, for the \textit{dimension formula} the algebra sheaf \mathcal A is assumed to be a PID. The dimension formula relates the rank of an \mathcal A-morphism and the dimension of the kernel (sheaf) of the same \mathcal A-morphism with the dimension of the source free \mathcal A-module of the \mathcal A-morphism concerned. Also, in order to obtain an analog of the Witt's hyperbolic decomposition theorem, \mathcal A is assumed to be a PID while topological spaces on which \mathcal A-modules are defined are assumed \textit{connected}.
