This paper generalises a result for upper triangular matrix rings to the situation of upper triangular matrix DGA's. An upper triangular matrix DGA has the form (R,S,M) where R and S are differential graded algebras and M is a DG-left-R-right-S-bimodule. We show that under certain conditions on the DG-module M and with the existance of a DG-R-module X, from which we can build the derived category D(R), that there exists a derived equivalence between the upper triangular matrix DGAs (R,S,M) and (S,M',R'), where the DG-bimodule M' is obtained from M and X and R' is the endomorphism DGA of a K-projective resolution of X.
