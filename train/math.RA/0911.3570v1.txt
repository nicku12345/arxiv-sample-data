A classification of all four-dimensional power-commutative real division algebras is given.   It is shown that every four-dimensional power-commutative real division algebra is an isotope of a particular kind of a quadratic division algebra. The description of such isotopes in dimension four and eight is reduced to the description of quadratic division algebras. In dimension four this leads to a complete and irredundant classification. As a special case, the finite-dimensional power-commutative real division algebras that have a unique non-zero idempotent are characterised.
