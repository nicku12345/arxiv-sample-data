A square matrix is called {\it Hessenberg} whenever each entry below the subdiagonal is zero and each entry on the subdiagonal is nonzero. Let V denote a nonzero finite-dimensional vector space over a field \fld. We consider an ordered pair of linear transformations A: V \to V and A^*: V \to V which satisfy both (i), (ii) below. \begin{enumerate} \item There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is Hessenberg and the matrix representing A^* is diagonal.   \item There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is diagonal and the matrix representing A^* is Hessenberg. \end{enumerate}   \noindent We call such a pair a {\it thin Hessenberg pair} (or {\it TH pair}). This is a special case of a {\it Hessenberg pair} which was introduced by the author in an earlier paper. We investigate several bases for V with respect to which the matrices representing A and A^* are attractive. We display these matrices along with the transition matrices relating the bases. We introduce an "oriented" version of A,A^* called a TH system. We classify the TH systems up to isomorphism.
