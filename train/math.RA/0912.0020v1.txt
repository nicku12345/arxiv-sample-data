It is shown that any finite-dimensional homomorphic image of an inverse limit of nilpotent not-necessarily-associative algebras over a field is nilpotent. More generally, this is true of algebras over a general commutative ring k, with "finite-dimensional" replaced by "of finite length as a k-module".   These results are obtained by considering the multiplication algebra M(A) of an algebra A (the associative algebra of k-linear maps A -> A generated by left and right multiplications by elements of A), and its behavior with respect to nilpotence, inverse limits, and homomorphic images.   As a corollary, it is shown that a finite-dimensional homomorphic image of an inverse limit of finite-dimensional solvable Lie algebras over a field of characteristic 0 is solvable.   Examples are given showing that infinite-dimensional homomorphic images of inverse limits of nilpotent algebras can have properties far from those of nilpotent algebras; in particular, properties that imply that they are not residually nilpotent.   Several open questions and directions for further investigation are noted.
