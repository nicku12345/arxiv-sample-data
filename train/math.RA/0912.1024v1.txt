In this paper we study symmetrizable intersection matrices, namely generalized intersection matrices introduced by P. Slodowy such that they are symmetrizable. Every such matrix can be naturally associated with a root basis and a Weyl root system. Using d-fold affinization matrices we give a classification, up to braid-equivalence, for all positive semi-definite symmetrizable intersection matrices. We also give an explicit structure of the Weyl root system for each d-fold affinization matrix in terms of the root system of the corresponding Cartan matrix and some special null roots.
