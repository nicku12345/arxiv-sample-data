We find particular relations which we call "Bernoulli-type" in some noncommutative polynomial ring with a single nontrivial relation. More precisely, our ring is isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of a two-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebra. From these Bernoulli-type relations in our ring, we can obtain a representation on a certain left ideal with the Bernoulli numbers as structure constants.
