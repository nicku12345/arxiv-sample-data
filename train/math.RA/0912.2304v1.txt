We describe some interesting graded rings which are generated by degree-3 elements inside the Sklyanin algebra S, and prove that they have many good properties. Geometrically, these rings R correspond to blowups of the Sklyanin P^2 at 7 or fewer points. We show that the rings R are exactly those degree-3-generated subrings of S which are maximal orders in the quotient ring of the 3-Veronese of S.
