For a given abelian group G, we classify the isomorphism classes of G-gradings on the simple restricted Lie algebras of types W(m;1) and S(m;1) (m>=2), in terms of numerical and group-theoretical invariants. Our main tool is automorphism group schemes, which we determine for the simple restricted Lie algebras of types S(m;1) and H(m;1). The ground field is assumed to be algebraically closed of characteristic p>3.
