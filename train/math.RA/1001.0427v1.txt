The principal filtration of the infinite-dimensional odd Contact Lie superalgebra over a field of characteristic p>2 is proved to be invariant under the automorphism group by investigating ad-nilpotent elements and determining certain invariants such as subalgebras generated by some ad-nilpotent elements. Then, it is proved that two automorphisms coincide if and only if they coincide on the -1 component with respect to the principal grading. Finally, all the odd Contact superalgebras are classified up to isomorphisms.
