In this paper, we generalize the concepts of level and sublevels of a composition algebra to algebras obtained by the Cayley-Dickson process. In 1967, R. B. Brown constructed, for every t\in \Bbb{N}, a division algebra A_{t} of dimension 2^{t} over the power-series field K\{X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{t}\}. This gives us the possibility to construct a division algebra of dimension 2^{t} and prescribed level 2^{k}  k, t\in \Bbb{N}^{*}.
