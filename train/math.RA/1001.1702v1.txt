This paper deals with the classification of Leibniz central extensions of a naturally graded filiform Lie algebra. We choose a basis with respect to that the table of multiplication has a simple form. In low dimensional cases isomorphism classes of the central extensions are given. In parametric family orbits cases invariant functions (orbit functions) are provided.
