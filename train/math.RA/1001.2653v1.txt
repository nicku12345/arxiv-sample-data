The question of whether or not any zero torsion linear map on a non abelian real Lie algebra g is necessarily an extension of some CR-structure is considered and answered in the negative. Two examples are provided, one in the negative and one in the positive.In both cases, the computation up to equivalence of all zero torsion linear maps on g is used for an explicit description of the equivalence classes of integrable complex structures on the direct product g x g.
