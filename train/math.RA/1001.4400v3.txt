Following Artin and Zhang's formulation of noncommutative projective geometry, we classify up a family of skew polynomial quadratic algebras up to graded Morita equivalence and their corresponding noncommutative projective spaces up to birational equivalences. We also study their point varieties and provide examples of non-isomorphic noncommutative projective spaces.
