This paper unifies several generalizations of coherent rings in one notion. Namely, we introduce n-\mathscr{X}-coherent rings, where \mathscr{X} is a class of modules and n is a positive integer, as those rings for which the subclass \mathscr{X}_n of n-presented modules of \mathscr{X} is not empty, and every module in \mathscr{X}_n is n+1-presented. Then, for each particular class \mathscr{X} of modules, we find correspondent relative coherent rings. Our main aim is to show that the well-known Chase's, Cheatham and Stone's, Enochs', and Stenstrom's characterizations of coherent rings hold true for any n-\mathscr{X}-coherent rings.
