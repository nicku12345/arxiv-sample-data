In this paper, we compare (n,m)-purities for different pairs of positive integers (n,m). When R is a commutative ring, these purities are not equivalent if R doesn't satisfy the following property: there exists a positive integer p such that, for each maximal ideal P, every finitely generated ideal of R_P is p-generated. When this property holds, then the (n,m)-purity and the (n,m')-purity are equivalent if m and m' are integers \geq np. These results are obtained by a generalization of Warfield's methods. There are also some interesting results when R is a semiperfect strongly \pi-regular ring. We also compare (n,m)-flatnesses and (n,m)-injectivities for different pairs of positive integers (n,m). In particular, if R is right perfect and right self (\aleph_0,1)-injective, then each (1,1)-flat right R-module is projective. In several cases, for each positive integer p, all (n,p)-flatnesses are equivalent. But there are some examples where the (1,p)-flatness is not equivalent to the (1,p+1)-flatness.
