Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0. For a loop \circlearrowleft, denote its path coalgebra by k\circlearrowleft. In this paper, all the finite-dimensional commutative Hopf algebras over the sub coalgebras of k\circlearrowleft are given. As a direct consequence, all the commutative infinitesimal groups \mathcal{G} with dim_{k}Lie(\mathcal{G})=1 are classified.
