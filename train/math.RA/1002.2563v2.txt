For every finite p-group G of order p^n with derived subgroup of order p^m, Rocco in \cite{roc} proved that the order of tensor square of G is at most p^{n(n-m)}. This upper bound has been improved recently by author in \cite{ni}. The aim of the present paper is to obtain a similar result for a non-abelian nilpotent Lie algebra of finite dimension. More precisely, for any given n-dimensional non-abelian nilpotent Lie algebra L with derived subalgebra of dimension m we have \mathrm{dim} (L\otimes L)\leq (n-m)(n-1)+2. Furthermore for m=1, the explicit structure of L is given when the equality holds.
