We describe the groups of inner and outer automorphisms of the free metabelian nilpotent Lie algebra of finite rank over a field of characteristic 0. To obtain this result we first describe the groups of inner and continuous outer automorphisms of the completion with respect to the formal power series topology of the free metabelian Lie algebra finite rank.
