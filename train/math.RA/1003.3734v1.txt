In this paper we investigate Lie bialgebra structures on a twisted Schr\"{o}dinger-Virasoro type algebra \LL. All Lie bialgebra structures on \LL are triangular coboundary, which is different from the relative result on the original Schr\"{o}dinger-Virasoro type Lie algebra. In particular, we find for this Lie algebra that there are more hidden inner derivations from itself to \LL\otimes\LL and we develop one method to search them.
