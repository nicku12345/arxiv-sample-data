We consider the following question: When are rings of differential operators coherent? If A is a finitely generated smooth domain over a field k of characteristic 0, then the ring D of differential operators on A is a Noetherian ring and a finitely generated k-algebra. However, when k has characteristic p > 0 or when A is singular, this is no longer true. In fact, Bernstein, Gelfand and Gelfand showed that for the cubic cone A = k[x,y,z]/(x^3 + y^3 + z^3), the ring D is neither Noetherian nor finitely generated if k has characteristic 0, and the same is true for the polynomial ring A = k[x_1, \dots, x_n] if k has characteristic p > 0. In this paper, we prove that the ring D of differential operators on a finitely generated, smooth and connected algebra A over a field k of characteristic p > 0 is coherent, and conjecture that same holds for the cubic cone in characteristic 0. We argue that the question of coherence is the more fundamental one, and use some interesting results of Bavula to study holonomic D-modules on A = k[x_1, \dots, x_n] in characteristic p > 0.
