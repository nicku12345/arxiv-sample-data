For iterated Ore extensions satisfying a polynomial identity we present an elementary way of erasing derivations. As a consequence we recover some results obtained by Haynal in "PI degree parity in q-skew polynomial rings" (J. Algebra 319, 2008, 4199-4221). We also prove, under mild assumptions on R_n=R[x_1;\si_1,\de_1]...[x_n;\si_n;\de_n] that the Ore extension R[x_1;\si_1]...[x_n;\si_n] exists and is PI if R_n is PI.
