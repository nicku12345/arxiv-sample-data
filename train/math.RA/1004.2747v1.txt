We prove the Freiheitssatz for Poisson algebras in characteristic zero. We also give a proof of the tameness of automorphisms for two generated free Poisson algebras and prove that an analogue of the commutator test theorem is equivalent to the two dimensional classical Jacobian conjecture using the Freiheitssatz and Jung's Theorem.
