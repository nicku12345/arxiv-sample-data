We show that the Hochschild cohomology of a monomial algebra over a field of characteristic zero vanishes from degree two if the first Hochschild cohomology is semisimple as a Lie algebra. We also prove that first Hochschild cohomology of a radical square zero algebra is reductive as a Lie algebra. In the case of the multiple loops quiver, we obtain the Lie algebra of square matrices of size equal to the number of loops.
