A module M is called H-supplemented if for every submodule A of M there is a direct summand A' of M such that A+X=M holds if and only if A'+X=M for any submodule X of M. (Equivalently, for each X\leq M, there exists a direct summand D of M such that (X+D)/D\ll M/D and (X+D)/X\ll M/X.) Direct summands and sums of H-supplemented modules are studied and a question posed by Mohamed and M\"uller in 1990 is answered in the negative.
