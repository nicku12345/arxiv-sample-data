In this paper, we firstly establish Composition-Diamond lemma for \Omega-algebras. We give a Gr\"{o}bner-Shirshov basis of the free L-algebra as a quotient algebra of a free \Omega-algebra, and then the normal form of the free L-algebra is obtained. We secondly establish Composition-Diamond lemma for L-algebras. As applications, we give Gr\"{o}bner-Shirshov bases of the free dialgebra and the free product of two L-algebras, and then we show four embedding theorems of L-algebras: 1) Every countably generated L-algebra can be embedded into a two-generated L-algebra. 2) Every L-algebra can be embedded into a simple L-algebra. 3) Every countably generated L-algebra over a countable field can be embedded into a simple two-generated L-algebra. 4) Three arbitrary L-algebras A, B, C over a field k can be embedded into a simple L-algebra generated by B and C if |k|\leq \dim(B*C) and |A|\leq|B*C|, where B*C is the free product of B and C.
