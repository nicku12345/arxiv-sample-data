It is well known that a direct sum of CLS-modules is not, in general, a CLS-module. It is proved that if M=M_1\oplus M_2, where M_1 and M_2 are CLS-modules such that M_1 and M_2 are relatively ojective (or M_1 is M_2-ejective), then M is a CLS-module and some known results are generalized. Tercan [8] proved that if a module M=M_{1}\oplus M_{2} where M_{1} and M_{2} are CS-modules such that M_{1} is M_{2}-injective, then M is a CS-module if and only if Z_{2}(M) is a CS-module. Here we will show that Tercan's claim is not true.
