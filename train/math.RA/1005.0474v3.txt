We introduce the notion of characteristic function of a quaternionic matrix, whose roots are the left eigenvalues. We prove that for all 2\times 2 matrices and for 3\times 3 matrices having some zero entry outside the diagonal there is a characteristic function which is a polynomial. For the other 3\times 3 matrices the characteristic function is a rational function with one point of discontinuity. We prove that Hamilton-Cayley theorem holds in all cases.
