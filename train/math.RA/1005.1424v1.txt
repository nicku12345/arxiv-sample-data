This paper studies commuting matrices in max algebra and nonnegative linear algebra. Our starting point is the existence of a common eigenvector, which directly leads to max analogues of some classical results for complex matrices. We also investigate Frobenius normal forms of commuting matrices, particularly when the Perron roots of the components are distinct. For the case of max algebra, we show how the intersection of eigencones of commuting matrices can be described, and we consider connections with Boolean algebra which enables us to prove that two commuting irreducible matrices in max algebra have a common eigennode.
