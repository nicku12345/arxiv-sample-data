A ring R is called a left APP-ring if the left annihilator l_{R}(Ra) is right s-unital as an ideal of R for any a\in R. Let R be a ring, (S,\leq) a strictly ordered monoid and \omega:S\longrightarrow {\rm End}(R) a monoid homomorphism. The skew generalized power series ring [[R^{S,\leq},\omega]] is a common generalization of (skew) polynomial rings, (skew) power series rings, (skew) Laurent polynomial rings, (skew) group rings, and Malcev-Neumann Laurent series rings. We study the left APP-property of the skew generalized power series ring [[R^{S,\leq},\omega]]. It is shown that if (S,\leq) is a strictly totally ordered monoid, \omega:S\longrightarrow {\rm Aut}(R) a monoid homomorphism and R a ring satisfying descending chain condition on right annihilators, then [[R^{S,\leq},\omega]] is left APP if and only if for any S-indexed subset A of R, the ideal l_{R}\big(\sum_{a\in A}\sum_{s\in S}R\omega_{s}(a)\big) is right s-unital.
