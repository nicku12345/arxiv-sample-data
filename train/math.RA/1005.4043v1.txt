In this paper we compute the cohomology of certain special cases of nilpotent algebras in a complex \zt-graded vector space of arbitrary finite dimension. These algebras are generalizations of the only two nontrivial complex 2-dimensional nilpotent algebras, one from the moduli space of 1|1-dimensional algebras, and the other from the space of nongraded 2-dimensional algebras.
