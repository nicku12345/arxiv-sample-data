Let R be a ring. R is called a right countably \Sigma-C2 ring if every countable direct sum copies of R_{R} is a C2 module. The following are equivalent for a ring R: (1) R is a right countably \Sigma-C2 ring. (2) The column finite matrix ring \mathbb{C}\mathbb{F}\mathbb{M}_{\mathbb{N}}(R) is a right C2 (or C3) ring. (3) Every countable direct sum copies of R_{R} is a C3 module. (4) Every projective right R-module is a C2 (or C3) module. (5) R is a right perfect ring and every finite direct sum copies of R_{R} is a C2 (or C3) module. This shows that right countably \Sigma-C2 rings are just the rings whose right finitistic projective dimension rFPD(R)=sup\{Pd_{R}(M)| M is a right R-module with Pd_{R}(M)<\infty\}=0, which were introduced by Hyman Bass in 1960.
