Let K be a field, let E be a finite directed graph, and let L_K(E) be the Leavitt path algebra of E over K. We show that for a prime ideal P in L_K(E), the following are equivalent: \begin{enumerate} \item P is primitive; \item P is rational; \item P is locally closed in {\rm Spec}(L_K(E)). \end{enumerate} We show that the prime spectrum {\rm Spec}(L_K(E)) decomposes into a finite disjoint union of subsets, each of which is homeomorphic to {\rm Spec}(K) or to {\rm Spec}(K[x,x^{-1}]). In the case that K is infinite, we show that L_K(E) has a rational K^{\times}-action, and that the indicated decomposition of {\rm Spec}(L_K(E)) is induced by this action.
