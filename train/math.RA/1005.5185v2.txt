The notion of a \mathcal{K}_2-algebra was recently introduced by Cassidy and Shelton as a generalization of the notion of a Koszul algebra. The Yoneda algebra of any connected graded algebra admits a canonical A_{\infty}-algebra structure. This structure is trivial if the algebra is Koszul. We study the A_{\infty}-structure on the Yoneda algebra of a \mathcal{K}_2-algebra. For each non-negative integer n we prove the existence of a \mathcal{K}_2-algebra B and a canonical A_{\infty}-algebra structure on the Yoneda algebra of B such that the higher multiplications m_i are nonzero for all 3 \leq i \leq n+3. We also provide examples which show that the \mathcal{K}_2 property is not detected by any obvious vanishing patterns among higher multiplications.
