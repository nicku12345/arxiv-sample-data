Let \BB be the Lie algebra of Block type with basis \{L_{\a,i}|\,\a,i\in\Z, i\geq0\} and relations [L_{\a,i},L_{\b,j}]=\left((\a-1)(j+1)-(\b-1)(i+1)\right)L_{\a+\b,i+j}. In the present paper, the derivation algebra and the automorphism group of \BB are explicitly described. In particular, it is shown that the outer derivation space is 1-dimensional and the inner automorphism group of \BB is trivial.
