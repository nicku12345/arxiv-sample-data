In the present paper we extend and improve the results of \cite{bl, br} for the tensor square of Lie algebras. More precisely, for any Lie algebra L with L/L^2 of finite dimension, we prove L\otimes L\cong L\square L\oplus L\wedge L and Z^{\wedge}(L)\cap L^2=Z^{\otimes}(L). Moreover, we show that L\wedge L is isomorphic to derived subalgebra of a cover of L, and finally we give a free presentation for it.
