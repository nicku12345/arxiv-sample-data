The aim of this paper is to extend Gerstenhaber formal deformations of algebras to the case of Hom-Alternative and Hom-Malcev algebras. We construct deformation cohomology groups in low dimensions.   Using a composition construction, we give a procedure to provide deformations of alternative algebras (resp. Malcev algebras) into Hom-alternative algebras (resp. Hom-Malcev algebras). Then it is used to supply examples for which we compute some cohomology invariants.
