Pseudo-effect algebras are partial algebraic structures, that were introduced as a non-commutative generalization of effect algebras. In the present paper, lattice ordered pseudo-effect algebras are considered as possible algebraic non-commutative analogs of non-commutative non-standard reasoning. To this aim, the interplay among conjunction, implication and negation connectives is studied. It turns out that in the non-commutative reasoning, all these connectives are doubled. In particular, there are two negations and two pairs consisting of conjunction and implication, related by residuation laws. The main result of the paper is a characterization of lattice pseudo-effect algebras in terms of so-called pseudo Sasaki algebras. We also show that all pseudo-effect algebras can be characterized in terms of certain partially defined double residuated structures.
