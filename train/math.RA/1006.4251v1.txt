The relationship between Jordan and Lie coalgebras is established. We prove that from any Jordan coalgebra \langle A, \Delta\rangle, it is possible to construct a Lie coalgebra \langle L(A), \Delta_{L}\rangle. Moreover, any dual algebra of the coalgebra \langle L(A), \Delta_{L}\rangle corresponds to a Lie algebra that can be determined from the dual algebra for \langle A,\Delta\rangle, following the Kantor--Koecher--Tits process. The structure of subcoalgebras and coideals of the coalgebra \langle L(A), \Delta_{L}\rangle is characterized.
