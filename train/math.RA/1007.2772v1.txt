I.P. Shestakov constructed an example of a unital simple special Jordan superalgebra over the field of real numbers. It turned out to be a subsuperalgebra of the Jordan superalgebra of vector type, but not isomorphic to a superalgebra of this type. Moreover, its superalgebra of fractions is isomorphic to a Jordan superalgebra of vector type. Author constructed a similar example of a Jordan superalgebra over a field of characteristic~0 in which the equation t^2+1=0. In this article we present an~example of a Jordan superalgebra with the same properties over an arbitrary field of characteristic 0. A similar example of a superalgebra is found in the Cheng-Kac superalgebra.
