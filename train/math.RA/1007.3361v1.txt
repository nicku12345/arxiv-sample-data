Let R be a ring with unity. The graph \Gamma(R) is a graph with vertices as elements of R, where two distinct vertices a and b are adjacent if and only if Ra+Rb=R. Let \Gamma_2(R) is the subgraph of \Gamma(R) induced by the non-unit elements. H.R. Maimani et al. [H.R. Maimani et al., Comaximal graph of commutative rings, J. Algebra 319 (2008) 1801-1808] proved that: ``If R is a commutative ring with unity and the graph \Gamma_2(R)\backslash J(R) is n-partite, then the number of maximal ideals of R is at most n." The proof of this result is not correct. In this paper we present a correct proof for this result. Also we generalize some results given in the aforementioned paper for the non-commutative rings.
