Let L be the free m-generated metabelian nilpotent of class c Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0. An automorphism f of L is called normal if f(I)=I for every ideal I of the algebra L. Such automorphisms form a normal subgroup N(L) of Aut(L) containing the group of inner automorphisms. We describe the group of normal automorphisms of L and the quotient group of Aut(L) modulo N(L).
