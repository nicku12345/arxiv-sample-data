In this paper, we present the construction of a geometric object, called a generalized flag geometry, (X^+;X^-), corresponding to a (2k +1)-graded Lie algebra g=g_k\oplus\dots\oplus g_{-k}. We prove that (X^+;X^-) can be realized inside the space of inner filtrations of g and we use this realization to construct "algebraic bundles" on X^+ and X^- and some sections of these bundles. Thanks to these constructions, we can give a realization of g as a Lie algebra of polynomial maps on the positive part of g, n^+_1:=g_1\oplus\dots\oplus g_k, and a trivialization in n^+_1 of the action of the group of automorphisms of g by "birational"maps.
