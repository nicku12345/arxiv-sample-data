An algorithm to give an explicit description of all the solutions to any tropical linear system A\odot x=B\odot x is presented. The given system is converted into a finite (rather small) number p of pairs (S,T) of classical linear systems: a system S of equations and a system T of inequalities. The notion, introduced here, that makes p small, is called compatibility. The particular feature of both S and T is that each item (equation or inequality) is bivariate, i.e., it involves exactly two variables; one variable with coefficient 1, and the other one with -1. S is solved by Gaussian elimination. We explain how to solve T by a method similar to Gaussian elimination. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of sub--special matrix. The procedure applied to T is, therefore, called sub--specialization.
