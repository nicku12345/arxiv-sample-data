Let f,g\in Z[X] be monic polynomials of degree n and let C,D\in M_n(Z) be the corresponding companion matrices. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the subalgebra Z< C,D> to be a sublattice of finite index in the full integral lattice M_n(Z), in which case we compute the exact value of this index in terms of the resultant of f and g. If R is a commutative ring with identity we determine when R< C,D>=M_n(R), in which case a presentation for M_n(R) in terms of C and D is given.
