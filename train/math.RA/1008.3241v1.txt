A subsemigroup S of an inverse semigroup Q is a left I-order in Q if every element in Q can be written as a^{-1}b where a,b \in S and a^{-1} is the inverse of a in the sense of inverse semigroup theory. If we insist on a and b being \mathcal{R}-related in Q, then we say that S is a straight left I-order in Q. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a semigroup to be a left I-order in a bisimple inverse \omega-semigroup.
