Let \L_m be the scheme of the laws defined by the Jacobi's identities on \K^m with \K a field. A deformation of \g\in\L_m, parametrized by a local \K-algebra \A, is a local \K-algebra morphism from the local ring of \L_m at \phi_m to \A. The problem to classify all the deformation equivalence classes of a Lie algebra with given base is solved by "versal" deformations. First, we give an algorithm for computing versal deformations. Second, we prove there is a bijection between the deformation equivalence classes of an algebraic Lie algebra \phi_m=\mathrm{R}\ltimes\phi_n in \L_m and its nilpotent radical \phi_n in the \mathrm{R}-invariant scheme \L_n^{\mathrm{R}} with reductive part \mathrm{R}, under some conditions. So the versal deformations of \phi_m in \L_m is deduced to those of \phi_n in \L_n^{\mathrm{R}}, which is a more simple problem. Third, we study versality in central extensions of Lie algebras. Finally, we calculate versal deformations of some Lie algebras.
