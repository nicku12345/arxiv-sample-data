A celebrated theorem of P.M.Cohn says that for any two division rings (not necessarily finite dimensional) over a field F, their amalgamated product over F is a domain which can be embedded in a division ring. Note that even with the two initial division rings begin finite dimensional over their centers, the resulting division ring is never finite dimensional over its center. Perhaps this led Lance Small to ask the following question. Assume F_1 and F_2 are fields with the same characteristic. Small asked whether any two division algebras D_1/F_1 and D_2/F_2 can be embedded in some third division algebra E/F. We start with a surprisingly straightforward counterexample, but then show that a positive solution exists for division algebras finitely generated over a common subfield which is either algebraically closed or the prime subfield.
