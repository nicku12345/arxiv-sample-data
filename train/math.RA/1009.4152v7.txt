In this paper we introduce an algebra embedding \iota:K< X >\to S from the free associative algebra K< X > generated by a finite or countable set X into the skew monoid ring S = P * \Sigma defined by the commutative polynomial ring P = K[X\times N^*] and by the monoid \Sigma = < \sigma > generated by a suitable endomorphism \sigma:P\to P. If P = K[X] is any ring of polynomials in a countable set of commuting variables, we present also a general Gr\"obner bases theory for graded two-sided ideals of the graded algebra S = \bigoplus_i S_i with S_i = P \sigma^i and \sigma:P \to P an abstract endomorphism satisfying compatibility conditions with ordering and divisibility of the monomials of P. Moreover, using a suitable grading for the algebra P compatible with the action of \Sigma, we obtain a bijective correspondence, preserving Gr\"obner bases, between graded \Sigma-invariant ideals of P and a class of graded two-sided ideals of S. By means of the embedding \iota this results in the unification, in the graded case, of the Gr\"obner bases theories for commutative and non-commutative polynomial rings. Finally, since the ring of ordinary difference polynomials P = K[X\times N] fits the proposed theory one obtains that, with respect to a suitable grading, the Gr\"obner bases of finitely generated graded ordinary difference ideals can be computed also in the operators ring S and in a finite number of steps up to some fixed degree.
