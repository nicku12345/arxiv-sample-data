A duality theorem of the bounded derived category of quasi-finite comodules over an artinian coalgebra is established. Let A be a noetherian complete basic semiperfect algebra over an algebraically closed field, and C be its dual coalgebra. If A is Artin-Schelter regular, then the local cohomology of A is isomorphic to a shift of twisted bimodule {}_1C_{\sigma^*} with \sigma a coalgebra automorphism. This yields that the balanced dualinzing complex of A is a shift of the twisted bimodule {}_{\sigma^*}A_1. If \sigma is an inner automorphism, then A is Calabi-Yau.
