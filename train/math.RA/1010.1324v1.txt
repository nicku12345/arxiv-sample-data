The Temperley-Lieb and Brauer algebras and their cyclotomic analogues, as well as the partition algebra, are all examples of twisted semigroup algebras. We prove a general theorem about the cellularity of twisted semigroup algebras of regular semigroups. This theorem, which generalises a recent result of East about semigroup algebras of inverse semigroups, allows us to easily reproduce the cellularity of these algebras.
