In this paper the main results in arXiv:0901.3179v3, related to the matrix representation of polynomial maps, are restated in traditional way of linear algebra assuming that variable vectors are presented as column vectors. Some new results related to that subject are also included. Here one can find the behavior of the matrices of polynomial maps with respect to the change of variables (coordinate system), matrix representations for symmetric and antisymmetric multi-linear maps. It is shown also that the offered representations are in good concordance with known operations over such multi-linear maps.
