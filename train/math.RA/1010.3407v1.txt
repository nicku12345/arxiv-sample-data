It is shown that every multiplicative right Hom-alternative algebra is both Hom-power associative and Hom-Jordan admissible. Multiplicative right Hom-alternative algebras admit Albert-type decompositions with respect to idempotents. Multiplication operators defined by idempotents in right Hom-alternative algebras are studied. Hom-versions of some well-known identities in right alternative algebras are proved.
