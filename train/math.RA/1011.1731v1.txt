Some basic properties of Hom-Leibniz algebras are found. These properties are the Hom-analogue of corresponding well-known properties of Leibniz algebras. Considering the Hom-Akivis algebra associated to a given Hom-Leibniz algebra, it is observed that the Hom-Akivis identity leads to an additional property of Hom-Leibniz algebras, which in turn gives a necessary and sufficient condition for Hom-Lie admissibility of Hom-Leibniz algebras. A necessary and sufficient condition for Hom-power associativity of Hom-Leibniz algebras is also found.
