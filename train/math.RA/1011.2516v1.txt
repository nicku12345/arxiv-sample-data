We generalize to the case of Lie superalgebras the classical symplectic double extension of symplectic Lie algebras introduced in [2]. We use this concept to give an inductive description of nilpotent homogeneous-symplectic Lie superalgebras. Several examples are included to show the existence of homogeneous quadratic symplectic Lie superalgebras other than even-quadratic even-symplectic considered in [6]. We study the structures of even (resp. odd)-quadratic odd (resp. even)-symplectic Lie superalgebras and odd-quadratic odd-symplectic Lie superalgebras and we give its inductive descriptions in terms of quadratic generalized double extensions and odd quadratic generalized double extensions. This study complete the inductive descriptions of homogeneous quadratic symplectic Lie superalgebras started in [6]. Finally, we generalize to the case of homogeneous quadratic symplectic Lie superargebras some relations between even-quadratic even-symplectic Lie superalgebras and Manin superalgebras established in [6].
