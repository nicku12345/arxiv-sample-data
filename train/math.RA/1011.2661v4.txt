This paper characterizes the quasilocal fields from the class of Henselian valued fields with totally indivisible value groups, which possess finite separable extensions of nontrivial defect. We show that, for any prime number q, a divisible subgroup T in the multiplicative group of complex numbers is realizable as the Brauer group of such a quasilocal field of residual characteristic q unless q = 2 and the 2-component of T is trivial.
