A homogeneous symmetric structure on an associative superalgebra A is a non-degenerate, supersymmetric, homogeneous (i.e. even or odd) and associative bilinear form on A. In this paper, we show that any associative superalgebra with non null product can not admit simultaneously even-symmetric and odd-symmetric structure. We prove that all simple associative superalgebras admit either even-symmetric or odd-symmetric structure and we give explicitly, in every case, the homogeneous symmetric structures. We introduce some notions of generalized double extensions in order to give inductive descriptions of even-symmetric associative superalgebras and odd-symmetric associative superalgebras. We obtain also an other interesting description of odd-symmetric associative superalgebras whose even parts are semi-simple bimodules without using the notions of double extensions.
