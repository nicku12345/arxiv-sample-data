Based on invariant algebras, we introduce representations^{6-th} of Lie algebras and representations^{< 4-th>} of Leibniz algebras, give the extended P-B-W Theorems in the context of the new representations of Lie algebras and Leibniz algebras, and generalize the Hopf-algebra structure on the enveloping algebras of Lie Algebras.
