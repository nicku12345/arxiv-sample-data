This paper develops a duality theory for connected cochain DG algebras, with particular emphasis on the non-commutative aspects.   One of the main items is a dualizing DG module which induces a duality between the derived categories of DG left-modules and DG right-modules with finitely generated cohomology.   As an application, it is proved that if the canonical module A / A^{\geq 1} has a semi-free resolution where the cohomological degree of the generators is bounded above, then the same is true for each DG module with finitely generated cohomology.
