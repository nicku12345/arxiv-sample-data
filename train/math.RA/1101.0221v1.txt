Let \mathcal A and \mathcal B be unital rings and \mathcal M be a (\mathcal A, \mathcal B)-bimodule, which is faithful as a left \mathcal A-module and also as a right \mathcal B-module. Let {\mathcal U}={\rm Tri}(\mathcal A, \mathcal M, \mathcal B) be the associated triangular ring. It is shown that every additive generalized Jordan (triple) higher derivation on \mathcal U is a generalized higher derivation.
