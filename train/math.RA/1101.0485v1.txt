The derivations of the Cheng-Kac Jordan superalgebras are studied. It is shown that, assuming -1 is a square in the ground field, the Lie superalgebra of derivations of a Cheng-Kac Jordan superalgebra is isomorphic to the Lie superalgebra obtained from a simpler Jordan superalgebra (a Kantor double superalgebra of vector type) by means of the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction. This is done by exploiting the S4-symmetry of the Cheng-Kac Jordan superalgebra.
