Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and let A be a finitely generated k-algebra that is a domain whose Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is in [2,3). We show that if A has a nonzero locally nilpotent derivation then A has quadratic growth. In addition to this, we show that A either satisfies a polynomial identity or A is isomorphic to a subalgebra of \mathcal{D}(X), the ring of differential operators on an irreducible smooth affine curve X, and A is birationally isomorphic to \mathcal{D}(X).
