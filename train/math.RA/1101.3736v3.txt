We study two families of integer vectors playing a crucial part in the structural theory of cluster algebras: the \gg-vectors parameterizing cluster variables, and the \cc-vectors parameterizing the coefficients. We prove two identities relating these vectors to each other. The proofs depend on the sign-coherence assumption for \cc-vectors that still remains unproved in full generality.
