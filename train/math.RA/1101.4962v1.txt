In this paper we consider a multicriteria aggregation model where local utility functions of different sorts are aggregated using Sugeno integrals, and which we refer to as Sugeno utility functions. We propose a general approach to study such functions via the notion of pseudo-Sugeno integral (or, equivalently, pseudo-polynomial function), which naturally generalizes that of Sugeno integral, and provide several axiomatizations for this class of functions. Moreover, we address and solve the problem of factorizing a Sugeno utility function as a composition of a Sugeno integral with local utility functions, if such a factorization exists.
