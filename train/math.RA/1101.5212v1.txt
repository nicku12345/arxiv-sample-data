We consider generalization of wellknown construction Kantor Double J({\Gamma}, {,}) (KKM Double, Kantor-King-McCrimmon Double), where basic algebra {\Gamma} is nonunital algebra. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for a generalized Kantor double to be Jordan. We also describe \delta-superderivations of a generalized Kantor double whose even part is prime.
