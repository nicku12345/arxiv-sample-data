This paper concerns the associative lower central series ideals M_i of the free algebra A_n on n generators. Namely, we study the successive quotients N_i=M_i/M_{i+1}, which admit an action of the Lie algebra W_n of vector fields on \Bbb C^n. We bound the degree |\lambda| of tensor field modules F_\lambda appearing in the Jordan-H\"older series of each N_i, confirming a recent conjecture of Arbesfeld and Jordan. As an application, we compute these decompositions for small n and i.
