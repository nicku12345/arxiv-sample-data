Let K be a field, let \sigma be an automorphism of K, and let \delta be a derivation of K. We show that if D is one of K(x;\sigma) or K(x;\delta), then D either contains a free algebra over its center on two generators, or every finitely generated subalgebra of D satisfies a polynomial identity. As a corollary, we are able to show that the quotient division ring of any iterated Ore extension of an affine domain satisfying a polynomial identity either again satisfies a polynomial identity or it contains a free algebra over its center on two variables.
