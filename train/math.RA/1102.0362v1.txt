Smoktunowicz, Lenagan, and the second-named author recently gave an example of a nil algebra of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension at most three. Their construction requires a countable base field, however. We show that for any field k and any monotonically increasing function f(n) which grows super-polynomially but subexponentially there exists an infinite-dimensional finitely generated nil k-algebra whose growth is asymptotically bounded by f(n). This construction gives the first examples of nil algebras of subexponential growth over uncountable fields.
