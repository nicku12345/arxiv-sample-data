The paper establishes an one-to-one correspondence between simple Moufang loops and Paige loops constructed over Galois extension over prime field in its algebraic closure. Using this connection it describes fully the family of nonassociative finite simple Moufang loops.It describes the generators, the loop structure of subloops, the automorphism group of nonassociative simple Moufang loops.
