Artin solved Hilbert's 17^{th} problem by showing that every positive semidefinite polynomial can be realized as a sum of squares of rational functions. Pfister gave a bound on the number of squares of rational functions: if p is a positive semi-definite polynomial in n variables, then there is a polynomial q so that q^2p is a sum of at most 2^n squares.   As shown by D'Angelo and Lebl, the analog of Pfister's theorem fails in the case of Hermitian polynomials. Specifically, it was shown that the rank of any multiple of the polynomial \|z\|^{2d} \equiv (\sum_j |z_j|^2)^d is bounded below by a quantity depending on d. Here we prove that a similar result holds in a free \ast-algebra.
