The distance of an operation from being associative can be "measured" by its associative spectrum, an appropriate sequence of positive integers. Associative spectra were introduced in a publication by B. Cs\'ak\'any and T. Waldhauser in 2000 for binary operations (see arXiv:1102.2124). We generalize this concept to p-ary operations, interpret associative spectra in terms of equational theories, and use this interpretation to find a characterization of fine spectra, to construct polynomial associative spectra, and to show that there are continuously many different spectra. Furthermore, an equivalent representation of bracketings is studied.
