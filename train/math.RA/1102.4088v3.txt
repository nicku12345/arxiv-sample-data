This paper is an attempt to show that, parallel to Elliott's classification of AF C^*-algebras by means of K-theory, the graded K_0-group classifies Leavitt path algebras completely. In this direction, we prove this claim at two extremes, namely, for the class of acyclic graphs (graphs with no cycles) and comet and polycephaly graphs (graphs which each head is connected to a cycle or a collection of loops).
