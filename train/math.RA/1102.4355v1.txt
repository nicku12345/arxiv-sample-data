We determine all composition-closed equational classes of Boolean functions. These classes provide a natural generalization of clones and iterative algebras: they are closed under composition, permutation and identification (diagonalization) of variables and under introduction of inessential variables (cylindrification), but they do not necessarily contain projections. Thus the lattice formed by these classes is an extension of the Post lattice. The cardinality of this lattice is continuum, yet it is possible to describe its structure to some extent.
