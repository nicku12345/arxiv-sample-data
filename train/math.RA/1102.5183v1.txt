Let \BB be a class of Lie algebras of Block type with basis \{L_{\a,i}|\a,i\in\Z, i\geq 0\} and relations [L_{\a,i},L_{\b,j}]=(\b(i+q)-\a(j+q))L_{\a+\b,i+j}, where q is a positive integer. In this paper, it is shown that \BB are different from each other for distinct positive integers q's. The automorphism groups, the derivation algebras and the central extensions of all \BB are also uniformly and explicitly described, which generalize some previous results.
