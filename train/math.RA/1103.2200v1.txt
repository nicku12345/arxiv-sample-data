Let R be any associative ring with unity and \mathcal{X} be a class of R-modules of closed under direct sum (and summands) and with extension closed. We prove that every complex has an C(\mathcal{X^{*}})-cover (C(\mathcal{X^{*}})-envelope) if every module has an \mathcal{X}-cover (\mathcal{X}-envelope) where C(\mathcal{X^{*}}) is the class of complexes of modules in \mathcal{X} such that it is closed under direct and inverse limit.
