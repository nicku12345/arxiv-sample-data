In this paper we develop a structure called Link Algebra, in which we present a Set with two binary operations and an axiom system developed from the study of graph theory and set/antiset theory, sowing main theorems and definitions. Once introduced Link Algebra, we will show the aplication on graph theory, like defining Paths, cycles and stars. Finally, we will se an alternative axiomatizations with Multisets and ordered pairs to algebraicaly define mutli, pseudo and oriented graphs.
