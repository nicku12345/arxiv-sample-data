Let p,q be coprime integers such that |p|+|q|>2. We characterize the matrices A\in\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C}) such that A^p and A^q are similar. If A is invertible, we prove that A is a polynomial in A^p and A^q. To achieve this, we study the matrix equation B^{-1}A^pB=A^q. We show that for such matrices, B^{-1}AB and A commute. When A is diagonalizable, A is a root of I_n and B^{-1}AB is a power of A. We explicitly solve the previous equation when A has n distinct eigenvalues or when A has a sole eigenvalue. In the second part, we completely solve the 2\times{2} case of the more general matrix equation A^{r}B^{s}A^{r'}B^{s'}=\pm{I}_2.
