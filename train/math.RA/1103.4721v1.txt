The present work is devoted to the extension of some general properties of automorphisms and derivations which are known for Lie algebras to finite dimensional complex Leibniz algebras. The analogues of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition for derivations and the multiplicative decomposition for automorphisms of finite dimensional complex Leibniz algebras are obtained.
