Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. In this paper, we obtain the structure theorems for semisimple Hopf algebras of dimension 9q^2 over k, where q is a prime number. We also prove that odd-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebras over k of dimension less than 600 are of Frobenius type.
