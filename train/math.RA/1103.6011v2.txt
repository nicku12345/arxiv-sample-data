We find a basis of the free Malcev algebra on three free generators over a field of characteristic zero. The specialty and semiprimity of this algebra are proved. In addition, we prove the decomposability of this algebra into subdirect sum of the free Lie algebra rank three and the free algebra of rank three of variety of Malcev algebras generated by a simple seven-dimensional Malcev algebra.
