The notion of the higher rank numerical range \Lambda_{k}(L(\lambda)) for matrix polynomials L(\lambda)=A_{m}\lambda^{m}+...+A_{1}\lambda+A_{0} is introduced here and some fundamental geometrical properties are investigated. Further, the sharp points of \Lambda_{k}(L(\lambda)) are defined and their relation to the numerical range w(L(\lambda)) is presented. A connection of \Lambda_{k}(L(\lambda)) with the vector-valued higher rank numerical range \Lambda_{k}(A_{0},..., A_{m}) is also discussed.
