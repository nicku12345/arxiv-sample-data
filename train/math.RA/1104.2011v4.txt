In this paper we classify the maximal subsemigroups of the \emph{full transformation semigroup} \Omega^\Omega, which consists of all mappings on the infinite set \Omega, containing certain subgroups of the symmetric group \sym(\Omega) on \Omega. In 1965 Gavrilov showed that there are five maximal subsemigroups of \Omega^\Omega containing \sym(\Omega) when \Omega is countable and in 2005 Pinsker extended Gavrilov's result to sets of arbitrary cardinality.   We classify the maximal subsemigroups of \Omega^\Omega on a set \Omega of arbitrary infinite cardinality containing one of the following subgroups of \sym(\Omega): the pointwise stabiliser of a non-empty finite subset of \Omega, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on \Omega, or the stabiliser of a partition of \Omega into finitely many subsets of equal cardinality. If G is any of these subgroups, then we deduce a characterisation of the mappings f,g\in \Omega^\Omega such that the semigroup generated by G\cup \{f,g\} equals \Omega^\Omega.
