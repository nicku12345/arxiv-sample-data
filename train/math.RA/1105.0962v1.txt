This paper finds a classification, up-to an isomorphism, of abelian torsion groups realizable as Brauer groups of major types of Henselian valued primarily quasilocal fields with totally indivisible value groups. When E is a quasilocal field with such a valuation, it shows that the Brauer group of E is divisible and embeddable in the quotient group of the additive group of rational numbers by the subgroup of integers.
