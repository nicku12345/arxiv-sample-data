This paper presents an infinite family of Koszul self-injective algebras whose Hochschild cohomology ring is finite-dimensional. Moreover, for each N \geq 5 we give an example where the Hochschild cohomology ring has dimension N. This family of algebras includes and generalizes the 4-dimensional Koszul self-injective local algebras of Buchweitz, Green, Madsen and Solberg, which were used to give a negative answer to Happel's question, in that they have infinite global dimension but finite-dimensional Hochschild cohomology.
