We prove the Freiheitssatz for Novikov algebras in characteristic zero. It is also proved that the variety of Novikov algebras is generated by a Novikov algebra on the space of polynomials k[x] in a single variable x over a field k with respect to the multiplication f\circ g=\partial(f)g. It follows that the base rank of the variety of Novikov algebras equals 1.
