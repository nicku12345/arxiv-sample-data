Let R be an affine PI-algebra over an algebraically closed field k and let G be an affine algebraic k-group that acts rationally by algebra automorphisms on R. For R prime and G a torus, we show that R has only finitely many G-prime ideals if and only if the action of G on the center of R is multiplicity free. This extends a standard result on affine algebraic G-varieties. Under suitable hypotheses on R and G, we also prove a PI-version of a well-known result on spherical varieties and a version of Schelter's catenarity theorem for G-primes.
