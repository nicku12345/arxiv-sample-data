Let q be a prime number, k an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, and H a non-trivial semisimple Hopf algebra of dimension 2q^3. This paper proves that H can be constructed either from group algebras and their duals by means of extensions, or from Radford's biproduct H\cong R#kG, where kG is the group algebra of G of order 2, R is a semisimple Yetter-Drinfeld Hopf algebra in {}^{kG}_{kG}\mathcal{YD} of dimension q^3.
