For each subchain X' of a chain X, let T_{RE}(X, X') denote the semigroup under composition of all full regressive transformations, \alpha:X\rightarrow X' satisfying x\alpha\leq x for all x\in X. Necessary and sufficient conditions for T_{RE}(X,X') and T_{RE}(Y,Y') to be isomorphic are given. This isomorphism theorem is applied to classify the semigroup of regressive transformations T_{RE}(X,X') where X are familiar subchains of \R, the chain of real numbers.
