This paper is devoted to a study of the automorphism groups of three series of finite dimensional special odd Hamiltonian superalgebras \mathfrak{g} over a field of prime characteristic. Our aim is to characterize the connections between the automorphism groups of \mathfrak{g} and the automorphism groups of the corresponding underlying superalgebras. Precisely speaking, we embed the former into the later. Moreover, we determine the images of the normal series of the automorphism groups and homogeneous automorphism groups of \mathfrak{g.}
