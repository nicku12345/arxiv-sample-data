In this paper, among other results, there are described (complete) simple - simultaneously ideal- and congruence-simple - endomorphism semirings of (complete) idempotent commutative monoids; it is shown that the concepts of simpleness, congruence-simpleness and ideal-simpleness for (complete) endomorphism semirings of projective semilattices (projective complete lattices) in the category of semilattices coincide iff those semilattices are finite distributive lattices; there are described congruence-simple complete hemirings and left artinian congruence-simple complete hemirings. Considering the relationship between the concepts of "Morita equivalence" and "simpleness" in the semiring setting, we have obtained the following results: The ideal-simpleness, congruence-simpleness and simpleness of semirings are Morita invariant properties; A complete description of simple semirings containing the infinite element; The representation theorem - "Double Centralizer Property" - for simple semirings; A complete description of simple semirings containing a projective minimal one-sided ideal; A characterization of ideal-simple semirings having either infinite elements or a projective minimal one-sided ideal; A confirmation of Conjecture of [Kat04a] and solving Problem 3.9 of [Kat04b] in the classes of simple semirings containing either infinite elements or projective minimal left (right) ideals, showing, respectively, that semirings of those classes are not perfect and the concepts of "mono-flatness" and "flatness" for semimodules over semirings of those classes are the same. Finally, we give a complete description of ideal-simple, artinian additively idempotent chain semirings, as well as of congruence-simple, lattice-ordered semirings.
