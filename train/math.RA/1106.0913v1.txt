Recently, the author characterized all artinian square-free rings with identity. Here, those results are extended to the setting of rings with local units. We use this characterization of square-free rings to derive many results similar to the artinian case and to determine, in cohomological terms, exactly when a square-free ring has an associated square-free algebra structure.
