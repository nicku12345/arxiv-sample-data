We study the structure of the nilpotent commutator \nb of a nilpotent matrix B. We show that \nb intersects all nilpotent orbits for conjugation if and only if B is a square--zero matrix. We describe nonempty intersections of \nb with nilpotent orbits in the case the n \times n matrix B has rank n-2. Moreover, we give some results on the maximal nilpotent orbit that \nb intersects nontrivially.
