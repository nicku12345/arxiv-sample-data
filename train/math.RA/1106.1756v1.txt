Whereas Holm proved that the ring of differential operators on a generic hyperplane arrangement is finitely generated as an algebra, the problem of its Noetherian properties is still open. In this article, after proving that the ring of differential operators on a central arrangement is right Noetherian if and only if it is left Noetherian, we prove that the ring of differential operators on a central 2-arrangement is Noetherian. In addition, we prove that its graded ring associated to the order filtration is not Noetherian when the number of the consistuent hyperplanes is greater than 1.
