Superderivations for the eight families of finite or infinite dimensional graded Lie superalgebras of Cartan-type over a field of characteristic p>3 are completely determined by a uniform approach: The infinite dimensional case is reduced to the finite dimensional case and the latter is further reduced to the restrictedness case, which proves to be far more manageable. In particular, the outer superderivation algebras of those Lie superalgebras are completely determined.
