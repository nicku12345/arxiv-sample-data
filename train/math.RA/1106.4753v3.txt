We present the plactic algebra on an arbitrary alphabet set A by row generators and column generators respectively. We give Gr\"{o}bner-Shirshov bases for such presentations. In the case of column generators, a finite Gr\"{o}bner-Shirshov basis is given if A is finite. From the Composition-Diamond lemma for associative algebras, it follows that the set of Young tableaux is a linear basis of plactic algebra. As the result, it gives a new proof that Young tableaux are normal forms of elements of plactic monoid. This result was proved by D.E. Knuth \cite{Knuth} in 1970, see also Chapter 5 in \cite{M.L}.
