We describe a method for classifying the Novikov algebras with a given associated Lie algebra. Subsequently we give the classification of the Novikov algebras of dimension 3 over R and C, as well as the classification of the 4-dimensional Novikov algebras over C whose associated Lie algebra is nilpotent. In particular this includes a list of all 4-dimensional commutative associative algebras over C.
