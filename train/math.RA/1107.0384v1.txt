A ring R is called right SSP (SIP) if the sum (intersection) of any two direct summands of R_{R} is also a direct summand. Left sides can be defined similarly. The following are equivalent: (1) R is right SSP. (2) R is right C3 and right SIP. (3) R is left C3 and left SIP. (4) R is left SSP. It is also shown that (1) R is a von-Neumann regular ring if and only if \mathbb{M}_{2}(R) is right SSP if and only if \mathbb{M}_{n}(R) is right SSP for some n>1; (2) R is a semisimple ring if and only if the column finite matrix ring \mathbb{C}\mathbb{F}\mathbb{M}_{\Lambda}(R) is right SSP for a countably infinite set \Lambda if and only if the column finite matrix ring \mathbb{C}\mathbb{F}\mathbb{M}_{\Lambda}(R) is right SSP for any infinite set \Lambda. Some known results are improved.
