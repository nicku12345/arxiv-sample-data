The concept of an I-matrix in the full 2\times 2 matrix ring M_2(R/I), where R is an arbitrary UFD and I is a nonzero ideal in R, is introduced. We obtain a concrete description of the centralizer of an I-matrix \hat B in M_2(R/I) as the sum of two subrings \mathcal S_1 and \mathcal S_2 of M_2(R/I), where \mathcal S_1 is the image (under the natural epimorphism from M_2(R) to M_2(R/I)) of the centralizer in M_2(R) of a pre-image of \hat B, and where the entries in \mathcal S_2 are intersections of certain annihilators of elements arising from the entries of \hat B. It turns out that if R is a PID, then every matrix in M_2(R/I) is an I-matrix. However, this is not the case if R is a UFD in general. Moreover, for every factor ring R/I with zero divisors and every n\ge 3 there is a matrix for which the mentioned concrete description is not valid.
