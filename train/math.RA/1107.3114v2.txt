For a field K and directed graph E, we analyze those elements of the Leavitt path algebra L_K(E) which lie in the commutator subspace [L_K(E), L_K(E)]. This analysis allows us to give easily computable necessary and sufficient conditions to determine which Lie algebras of the form [L_K(E), L_K(E)] are simple, when E is row-finite (i.e., has finite out-degree) and L_K(E) is simple.
