Given two baric algebras (A_1,\omega_1) and (A_2,\omega_2) we describe a way to define a new baric algebra structure over the vector space A_1\oplus A_2, which we shall denote (A_1\bowtie A_2,\omega_1\bowtie\omega_2). We present some easy properties of this construction and we show that in the commutative and unital case it preserves indecomposability. Algebras of the form A_1\bowtie A_2 in the associative, coutable-dimensional, zero-characteristic case are classified.
