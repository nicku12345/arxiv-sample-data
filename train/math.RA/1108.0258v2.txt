Let \Gamma be a cancelation monoid with the neutral element e. Consider a \Gamma-graded ring A=\oplus_{\gamma\in\Gamma}A_{\gamma}, which is not necessarily commutative. It is proved that A_e, the degree-e part of A, is a local ring in the classical sense if and only if the graded two-sided ideal \mathfrak{M} of A generated by all non-invertible homogeneous elements is a proper ideal. Defining a \Gamma-graded local ring A in terms of this equivalence, it is proved that any two minimal homogeneous generating sets of a finitely generated \Gamma-graded A-module have the same number of generators, and furthermore, that most of the basic homological properties of the local ring A_e hold true for A (at least) in the \Gamma-graded context.
