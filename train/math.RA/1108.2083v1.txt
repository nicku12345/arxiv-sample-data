Let M be a left module over a ring R and I an ideal of R. We call (P, f) a (locally)projective I-cover of M if f is an epimorphism from P to M, P is (locally)projective, Kerf\subseteq IP, and whenever P=Kerf+X, then there is a projective summand Y of P in Kerf such that P=Y\oplus X. This definition generalizes (locally)projective covers. We characterize I-semiregular and I-semiperfect rings which are defined by Yousif and Zhou [19] using (locally)projective I-covers in section 2 and 3. I-semiregular and I-semiperfect rings are characterized by projectivity classes in section 4. Finally, the notion of I-supplemented modules are introduced and I-semiregular and I-semiperfect rings are characterized by I-supplemented modules. Some well known results are obtained as corollaries.
