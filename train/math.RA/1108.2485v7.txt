In this paper we represent a new form of condition for the consistency of the matrix equation AXB=C. If the matrix equation AXB=C is consistent, we determine a form of general solution which contains both reproductive and non-reproductive solutions. Also, we consider applications of the concept of reproductivity for obtaining general solutions of some matrix systems which are in relation to the matrix equation AXB=C.
