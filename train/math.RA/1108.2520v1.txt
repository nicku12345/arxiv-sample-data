It is shown that if a bilinear map f: A x B --> C of modules over a commutative ring k is nondegenerate (i.e., if no nonzero element of A annihilates all of B, and vice versa), and A and B are Artinian, then A and B are of finite length.   Some consequences are noted. Counterexamples are given to some attempts to generalize the above statement to balanced bilinear maps of bimodules over noncommutative rings, while the question is raised whether other such generalizations are true.
