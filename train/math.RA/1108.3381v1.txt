Let M be a left module over a ring R and I an ideal of R. M is called an I-supplemented module (finitely I-supplemented module) if for every submodule (finitely generated submodule) X of M, there is a submodule Y of M such that X+Y=M, X\cap Y\subseteq IY and X\cap Y is PSD in Y. This definition generalizes supplemented modules and \delta-supplemented modules. We characterize I-semiregular, I-semiperfect and I-perfect rings which are defined by Yousif and Zhou [15] using I-supplemented modules. Some well known results are obtained as corollaries.
