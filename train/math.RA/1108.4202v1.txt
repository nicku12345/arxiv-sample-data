The simple 7-dimensional Malcev algebra M is isomorphic to the irreducible \mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})-module V(6) with binary product [x,y] = \alpha(x \wedge y) defined by the \mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})-module morphism \alpha\colon \Lambda^2 V(6) \to V(6). Combining this with the ternary product (x,y,z) = \beta(x \wedge y) \cdot z defined by the \mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})-module morphism \beta\colon \Lambda^2 V(6) \to V(2) \approx \s gives M the structure of a generalized Lie triple system, or Lie-Yamaguti algebra. We use computer algebra to determine the polynomial identities of low degree satisfied by this binary-ternary structure.
