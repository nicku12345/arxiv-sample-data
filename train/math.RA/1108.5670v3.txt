We consider associative algebras over a field. An algebra variety is said to be {\em Lie nilpotent} if it satisfies a polynomial identity of the kind [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] = 0 where [x_1,x_2] = x_1x_2 - x_2x_1 and [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] is defined inductively by [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]=[[x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n-1}],x_n]. By Zorn's Lemma every non-Lie nilpotent variety contains a minimal such variety, called {\em almost Lie nilpotent}, as a subvariety. A description of almost Lie nilpotent varieties for algebras over a field of characteristic 0 was made up by Yu.Mal'cev. We find a list of non-prime almost Lie nilpotent varieties of algebras over a field of positive characteristic.
