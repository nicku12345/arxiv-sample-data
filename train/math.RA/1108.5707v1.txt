It is proven each ring R for which every indecomposable right module is pure-projective is right pure-semisimple. Each commutative ring R for which every indecomposable module is pure-injective is a clean ring and for each maximal ideal P, R_P is a maximal valuation ring. Complete discrete valuation domain of rank one are examples of non-artinian semi-perfect rings with pure-injective indecomposable modules.
