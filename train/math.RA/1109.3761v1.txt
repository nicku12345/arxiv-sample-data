It is a small step toward the Koszul-type algebras. The piecewise-Koszul algebras are, in general, a new class of quadratic algebras but not the classical Koszul ones, simultaneously they agree with both the classical Koszul and higher Koszul algebras in special cases. We give a criteria theorem for a graded algebra A to be piecewise-Koszul in terms of its Yoneda-Ext algebra E(A), and show an A_{\infty}-structure on E(A). Relations between Koszul algebras and piecewise-Koszul algebras are discussed. In particular, our results are related to the third question of Green-Marcos' [6].
