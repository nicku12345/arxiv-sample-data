In this paper, we present a new method for solving standard quaternion equations. Using this method we reobtain the known formulas for the solution of a quadratic quaternion equation, and provide an explicit solution for the cubic quaternion equation, as long as the equation has at least one pure imaginary root. We also discuss the number of essential pure imaginary roots of a two-sided quaternion polynomial.
