Generalizing the notion of a Koszul algebra, a graded k-algebra A is K2 if its Yoneda algebra is generated as an algebra in cohomology degrees 1 and 2. We prove a strong theorem about K2 factor algebras of Koszul algebras and use that theorem to show the Stanley-Reisner face ring of a simplicial complex is K2 whenever the Alexander dual simplicial complex is (sequentially) Cohen-Macaulay.
