Chen, Fox, Lyndon 1958 \cite{CFL58} and Shirshov 1958 \cite{Sh58} introduced non-associative Lyndon-Shirshov words and proved that they form a linear basis of a free Lie algebra, independently. In this paper we give another approach to definition of Lyndon-Shirshov basis, i.e., we find an anti-commutative Gr\"{o}bner-Shirshov basis S of a free Lie algebra such that Irr(S) is the set of all non-associative Lyndon-Shirshov words, where Irr(S) is the set of all monomials of N(X), a basis of the free anti-commutative algebra on X, not containing maximal monomials of polynomials from S. Following from Shirshov's anti-commutative Gr\"{o}bner-Shirshov bases theory \cite{S62a2}, the set Irr(S) is a linear basis of a free Lie algebra.
