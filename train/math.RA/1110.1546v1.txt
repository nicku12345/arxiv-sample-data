We study some (Hopf) algebraic properties of circulant matrices, inspired by the fact that the algebra of circulant n\times n matrices is isomorphic to the group algebra of the cyclic group with n elements. We introduce also a class of matrices that generalize both circulant and skew circulant matrices, and for which the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be read directly from their entries.
