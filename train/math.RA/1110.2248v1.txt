Let K<X> =K<X_1,...,X_n> be the free K-algebra on X={X_1,...,X_n} over a field K, which is equipped with a weight \mathbb{N}-gradation (i.e., each X_i is assigned a positive degree), and let {\cal G} be a finite homogeneous Gr\"obner basis for the ideal I=<{\cal G}> of K<X> with respect to some monomial ordering \prec on K<X>. It is proved that if the monomial algebra K<X>/<{\bf LM}({\cal G})> is semi-prime, where {\bf LM}({\cal G}) is the set of leading monomials of {\cal G} with respect to \prec, then the \mathbb{N}-graded algebra A=K<X>/I is semiprimitive (in the sense of Jacobson). In the case that {\cal G} is a finite non-homogeneous Gr\"obner basis with respect to a graded monomial ordering \prec_{gr}, and the \mathbb{N}-filtration FA of the algebra A=K<X>/I induced by the \mathbb{N}-grading filtration FK<X> of K<X> is considered, if the monomial algebra K<X>/<{\bf LM}({\cal G})> is semi-prime, then it is proved that the associated \mathbb{N}-graded algebra G(A) and the Rees algebra \widetilde{A} of A determined by FA are all semiprimitive.
