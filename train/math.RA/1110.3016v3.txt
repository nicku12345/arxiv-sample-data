Let R be a unitary commutative real algebra and K\subseteq Hom(R,\mathbb{R}), closed with respect to the product topology. We consider R endowed with the topology \mathcal{T}_K, induced by the family of seminorms \rho_{\alpha}(a):=|\alpha(a)|, for \alpha\in K and a\in R. In case K is compact, we also consider the topology induced by \|a\|_K:=\sup_{\alpha\in K}|\alpha(a)| for a\in R. If K is Zariski dense, then those topologies are Hausdorff. In this paper we prove that the closure of the cone of sums of 2d-powers, \sum R^{2d}, with respect to those two topologies is equal to Psd(K):=\{a\in R:\alpha(a)\geq 0,\textrm{for all}\alpha\in K\}. In particular, any continuous linear functional L on the polynomial ring R=\mathbb{R}[X_1,...,X_n] with L(h^{2d})\ge0 for each h\in R is integration with respect to a positive Borel measure supported on K. Finally we give necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure the continuity of a linear functional with respect to those two topologies.
