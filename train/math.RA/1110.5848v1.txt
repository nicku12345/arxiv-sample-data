We reformulate the definition of a zero product determined algebra in terms of tensor products and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for an algebra to be zero product determined. These conditions allow us to prove that the direct sum \bigoplus_{i \in I} A_i of algebras for any index set I is zero product determined if and only if each of the component algebras A_i is zero product determined. As an application, every parabolic subalgebra of a finite-dimensional reductive Lie algebra, over an algebraically-closed field of characteristic zero, is zero product determined. In particular, every such reductive Lie algebra is zero product determined.
