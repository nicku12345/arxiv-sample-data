Let H and L be quantum groupoids. If H has a quasitriangular structure, then we show that L induces a Hopf algebra C_{L}(L_s) in the category _{H}\mathcal{M}, which generalizes the transmutation theory introduced by Majid. Furthermore, if H is commutative, we can construct a Hopf algebra C_H(H_s)_F in the category _H\mathcal{M}_F for a weak invertible unit 2-cocycle F, which generalizes the results in \cite{D83}. Finally, we consider the relation between two Hopf algebras: C_H(H_s)_F and C_{\widetilde H}(\widetilde{H}_s), and obtain that they are isomorphic as objects in the category _{\widetilde H}\mathcal{M}, where (\widetilde H, \widetilde{\mathcal{R}}) is a new quasitriangular quantum groupoid induced by (H, \mathcal{R}).
