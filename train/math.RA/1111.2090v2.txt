Given a ring R, we define its right i-profile (resp. right p-profile) to be the collection of injectivity domains (resp. projectivity domains) of its right R-modules. We study the lattice theoretic properties of these profiles and consider ways in which properties of the profiles may determine the structure of rings and viceversa. We show that the i-profile is isomorphic to an interval of the lattice of linear filters of right ideals of R, and is therefore modular and coatomic. In particular, we give a practical characterization of the i-profile of a right artinian ring. We show through an example that the p-profile is not necessarily a set, and also characterize the right p-profile of a right perfect ring. The study of rings in terms of their (i- or p-)profile was inspired by the study of rings with no (i- or p-) middle class, initiated in recent papers by Er, L\'opez-Permouth and S\"okmez, and by Holston, L\'opez-Permouth and Orhan-Ertas. In this paper, we obtain further results about these rings and we also use our results to provide a characterization of a special class of QF-rings in which the injectivity and projectivity domains of any module coincide.
