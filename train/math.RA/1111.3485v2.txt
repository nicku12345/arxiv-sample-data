We give a constructive proof of the theorem of Bass and Milnor saying that if G is a finite abelian group then the Bass units of the integral group ring \Z G generate a subgroup of finite index in its units group \U(\Z G). Our proof provides algorithms to represent some units that contribute to only one simple component of \Q G and generate a subgroup of finite index in \U(\Z G) as product of Bass units. We also obtain a basis B formed by Bass units of a free abelian subgroup of finite index in \U(\Z G) and give, for an arbitrary Bass unit b, an algorithm to express b^{\varphi(|G|)} as a product of a trivial unit and powers of at most two units in this basis B.
