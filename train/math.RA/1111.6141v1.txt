In this short note we study the links of certain prime ideals of a noetherian ring R. We first give the definition of a link krull symmetric noetherian ring R. We then prove theorem 9 that states that for any linked prime ideals P' and Q' of the polynomial ring R[X] where R is a link krull symmetric noetherian ring, if The prime ideal P' is extended then Q' is also an extended prime ideal of R[X]. An application of theorem 9 is then given in theorem 12 for the ring R[X] when R is assumed to be a fully bounded noetherian ring.
