In this paper we will study k-commuting mappings of generalized matrix algebras. The general form of arbitrary k-commuting mapping of a generalized matrix algebra is determined. It is shown that under mild assumptions, every k-commuting mapping of a generalized matrix algebra takes a certain form which is said to be proper. A number of applications related to k-commuting mappings are presented. These results extend the existing works of Cheung, Du and Wang \cite{Cheung2, DuWang1} to the case of generalized matrix
