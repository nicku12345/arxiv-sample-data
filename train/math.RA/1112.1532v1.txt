The concept of an I-matrix in the full 2\times 2 matrix ring M_2(R/I), where R is an arbitrary UFD and I is a nonzero ideal in R, was introduced in \cite{mar}. Moreover a concrete description of the centralizer of an I-matrix \hat B in M_2(R/I) as the sum of two subrings \mathcal S_1 and \mathcal S_2 of M_2(R/I) was also given, where \mathcal S_1 is the image (under the natural epimorphism from M_2(R) to M_2(R/I)) of the centralizer in M_2(R) of a pre-image of \hat B, and where the entries in \mathcal S_2 are intersections of certain annihilators of elements arising from the entries of \hat B. In the present paper, we obtain results for the case when I is a principal ideal <k>, k\in R a nonzero nonunit. Mainly we solve two problems. Firstly we find necessary and sufficient conditions for when \mathcal S_1\subseteq\mathcal S_2, for when \mathcal S_2\subseteq \mathcal S_1 and for when \mathcal S_1=\mathcal S_2. Secondly we provide a formula for the number of elements in the centralizer of \hat B for the case when R/<k> is finite.
