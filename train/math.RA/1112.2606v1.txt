We classify combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations giving a Hopf subalgebra of the Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs of the considered Quantum Field Theory. We first treat single equations with an arbitrary number (eventually infinite) of insertion operators. we distinguish two cases; in the first one, the Hopf subalgebra generated by the solution is isomorphic to the Fa\`a di Bruno Hopf algebra or to the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions; in the second case, we obtain the dual of the enveloping algebra of a particular associative algebra (seen as a Lie algebra). We also treat systems with an arbitrary finite number of equations, with an arbitrary number of insertion operators, with at least one of degree 1 in each equation.
