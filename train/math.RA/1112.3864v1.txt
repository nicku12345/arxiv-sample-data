This paper studies absolute retracts in congruence modular varieties of universal algebras. It is shown that every absolute retract with finite dimensional congruence lattice is a product of subdirectly irreducible algebras. Further, every absolute retract in a residually small variety is the product of an abelian algebra and a centerless algebra.
