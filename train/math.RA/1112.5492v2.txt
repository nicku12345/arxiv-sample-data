Let A,B be finite dimensional G-graded algebras over an algebraically closed field K with char(K)=0, where G is an abelian group, and let Id_G(A) be the set of graded identities of A (res. Id_G(B)). We show that if A,B are G-simple then there is a graded embedding of A in B iff Id_G(B) is contained in Id_G(A). We also give a weaker generalization for the case where A is G-semisimple and B is arbitrary.
