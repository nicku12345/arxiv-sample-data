In this paper we present the definition of quasi-bases for modules over a ring that is commutative but not necessarily division and discuss properties that guarantee the existence of quasi-bases. Based on this result we further prove that every finitely generated module over L^{0}(\mathcal{F},K) has a quasi-basis, where K is the scalar field of real numbers or complex numbers and L^{0}(\mathcal{F},K) is the algebra of equivalence classes of K--valued random variables defined on a probability space (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P).
