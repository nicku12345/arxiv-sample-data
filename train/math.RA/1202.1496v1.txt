In this paper, the definitions of soft {\Gamma}-semirings and soft sub {\Gamma}-semi rings are introduced with the aid of the concept of soft set theory introduced by Molodtsov. In the mean time, some of their properties and structural characteristics are investigated and discussed. Thereafter, several illustrative examples are given.
