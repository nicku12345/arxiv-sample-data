A.S. Dugas and R. Mart\'{i}nez-Villa proved in \cite[Corollary 5.1]{dm} that if there exists a stable equivalence of Morita type between the k-algebras \Lambda and \Gamma, then it is possible to replace \Lambda by a Morita equivalent k-algebra \Delta such that \Gamma is a subring of \Delta and the induction and restriction functors induce inverse stable equivalences. In this note we give an affirmative answer to a question of Alex Dugas about the existence of a \Gamma-coring structure on \Delta. We do this by showing that \Delta is a Frobenius extension of \Gamma.
