Let \mathcal{G}=[A & M N & B] be a generalized matrix algebra defined by the Morita context (A, B,_AM_B,_BN_A, \Phi_{MN}, \Psi_{NM}). In this article we mainly study the question of whether there exist proper Jordan derivations for the generalized matrix algebra \mathcal{G}. It is shown that if one of the bilinear pairings \Phi_{MN} and \Psi_{NM} is nondegenerate, then every antiderivation of \mathcal{G} is zero. Furthermore, if the bilinear pairings \Phi_{MN} and \Psi_{NM} are both zero, then every Jordan derivation of \mathcal{G} is the sum of a derivation and an antiderivation. Several constructive examples and counterexamples are presented.
