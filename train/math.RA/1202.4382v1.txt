Let k be an arbitrary field of characteristic 0. We prove that the group of automorphisms of a free Poisson field P(x,y) in two variables x,y over k is isomorphic to the Cremona group \mathrm{Cr}_2(k). We also prove that the universal enveloping algebra P(x_1,...,x_n)^e of a free Poisson field P(x_1,...,x_n) is a free ideal ring and give a characterization of the Poisson dependence of two elements of P(x_1,...,x_n) via universal derivatives.
