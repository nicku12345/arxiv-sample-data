We establish an order-preserving bijective correspondence between the sets of coclosed elements of some bounded lattices related by suitable Galois connections. As an application, we deduce that if M is a finitely generated quasi-projective left R-module with S=End_R(M) and N is an M-generated left R-module, then there exists an order-preserving bijective correspondence between the sets of coclosed left R-submodules of N and coclosed left S-submodules of Hom_R(M,N).
