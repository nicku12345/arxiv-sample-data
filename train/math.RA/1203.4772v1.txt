In this paper we show that the method for describing solvable Lie algebras with given nilradical by means of non-nilpotent outer derivations of the nilradical is also applicable to the case of Leibniz algebras. Using this method we extend the classification of solvable Lie algebras with naturally graded filiform Lie algebra to the case of Leibniz algebras. Namely, the classification of solvable Leibniz algebras whose nilradical is a naturally graded filiform Leibniz algebra is obtained.
