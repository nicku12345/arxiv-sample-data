We prove the analog of Amitsur's conjecture on asymptotic behavior for codimensions of several generalizations of polynomial identities for finite dimensional associative algebras over a field of characteristic 0, including G-identities for any finite (not necessarily Abelian) group G and H-identities for a finite dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H. In addition, we prove that the Hopf PI-exponent of Sweedler's 4-dimensional algebra with the action of its dual equals 4.
