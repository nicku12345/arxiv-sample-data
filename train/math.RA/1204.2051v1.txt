The paper deals with the classification of a subclass of finite-dimensional Zinbiel algebras: the naturally graded p-filiform Zinbiel algebras. A Zinbiel algebra is the dual to Leibniz algebra in Koszul sense. We prove that there exists, up to isomorphism, only one family of naturally graded p-filiform Zinbiel algebras under hypothesis n-p \geq 4.
