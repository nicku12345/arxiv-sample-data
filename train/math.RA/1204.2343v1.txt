Let R be an arbitrary ring with identity and M a right R-module with S= End_R(M). In this paper we introduce \pi-Rickart modules as a generalization of generalized right principally projective rings as well as that of Rickart modules. The module M is called {\it \pi-Rickart} if for any f\in S, there exist e^2=e\in S and a positive integer n such that r_M(f^n)=eM. We prove that several results of Rickart modules can be extended to \pi-Rickart modules for this general settings, and investigate relations between a \pi-Rickart module and its endomorphism ring.
