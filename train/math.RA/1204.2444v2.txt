Let R be an arbitrary ring with identity and M a right R-module with S = End_R(M). In this paper we introduce dual \pi-Rickart modules as a generalization of \pi-regular rings as well as that of dual Rickart modules. The module M is called {\it dual \pi-Rickart} if for any f\in S, there exist e^2=e\in S and a positive integer n such that Imf^n=eM. We prove that some results of dual Rickart modules can be extended to dual \pi-Rickart modules for this general settings. We investigate relations between a dual \pi-Rickart module and its endomorphism ring.
