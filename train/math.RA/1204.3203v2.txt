We describe and study a four parameters deformation of the two products and the coproduct of the Hopf algebra of plane posets. We obtain a family of braided Hopf algebras, generally self-dual. We also prove that in a particular case (when the second parameter goes to zero and the first and third parameters are equal), this deformation is isomorphic, as a self-dual braided Hopf algebra, to a deformation of the Hopf algebra of free quasi-symmetric functions.
