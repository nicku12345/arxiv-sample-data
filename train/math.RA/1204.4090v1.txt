This paper studies the operad of linearly compatible di-algebras, denoted by As^{2}, which is a nonsymmetric operad encoding the algebras with two binary operations that satisfy individual and sum associativity conditions. We also prove that the operad As^{2} is exactly the Koszul dual operad of the operad ^{2}As encoding totally compatible di-algebras. We show that the operads As^{2} and ^{2}As are Koszul by rewriting method. We make explicit the Homotopy Transfer Theorem for As^{2}-algebras.
