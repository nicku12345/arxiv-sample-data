Given a nilpotent Lie algebra \mathfrak n we construct a spectral sequence which is derived from a filtration of its Chevalley-Eilenberg differential complex and converges to the Lie algebra cohomology of \mathfrak n. The limit of this spectral sequence gives a grading for the Lie algebra cohomology, except for the cohomology groups of degree 0, 1, \dim \mathfrak n-1 and \dim\mathfrak n as we shall prove. We describe the spectral sequence associated to a nilpotent Lie algebra which is a direct sum of two ideals, one of them of dimension one, in terms of the spectral sequence of the co-dimension one ideal. Also, we compute the spectral sequence corresponding to each real nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension less than or equal to six.
