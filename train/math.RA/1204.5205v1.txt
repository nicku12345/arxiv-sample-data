Let R be a ring, \sigma an endomorphism of R, I a right ideal in S=R[x;\sigma] and M_R a right R-module. We give a generalization of McCoy's Theorem \cite{mccoy}, by showing that, if r_S(I) is \sigma-stable or \sigma-compatible. Then \;r_S(I)\neq 0 implies r_R(I)\neq 0. As a consequence, if R[x;\sigma] is semicommutative then R is \sigma-skew McCoy. Moreover, we show that the Nagata extension R\oplus_{\sigma}M_R is semicommutative right McCoy when R is a commutative domain.
