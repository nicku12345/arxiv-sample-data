It is shown that in every multiplicative right Hom-alternative algebra, a Hom-type generalization of the Mikheev identity holds. It is then inferred that a multiplicative right Hom-alternative algebra with an injective twisting map and without Hom-nilpotent elements or left zero-divisors must be a Hom-alternative algebra.
