We present a novel approach to the construction of new finite algebras and describe the congruence lattices of these algebras. Given a finite algebra (B_0, \dots), let B_1, B_2, \dots, B_K be sets that either intersect B_0 or intersect each other at certain points. We construct an \emph{overalgebra} (A, F_A), by which we mean an expansion of (B_0, \dots) with universe A = B_0 \cup B_1 \cup \cdots \cup B_K, and a certain set F_A of unary operations that includes mappings e_i satisfying e_i^2 = e_i and e_i(A) = B_i, for 0\leq i \leq K. We explore two such constructions and prove results about the shape of the new congruence lattices Con(A, F_A) that result. Thus, descriptions of some new classes of finitely representable lattices is one contribution of this paper. Another, perhaps more significant contribution is the announcement of a novel approach to the discovery of new classes of representable lattices, the full potential of which we have only begun to explore.
