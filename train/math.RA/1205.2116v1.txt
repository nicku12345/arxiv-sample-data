In this paper we prove our main theorem, namely, theorem (8), which states that a link Q\rightarrowP, of prime ideals Q and P of a noetherian ring R that are {\sigma}-semistable with respect to a fixed automorphism {\sigma} of R, induces a link Q0\rightarrowP0 of the semiprime ideals Q0 and P0 of the ring R,where Q0 and P0 are the largest {\sigma}- invariant or {\sigma}- stable ideals contained in the prime ideals Q and P. We also prove a converse to this theorem.
