Left unital Kantor triple systems will be shown to correspond to structurable algebras endowed with an involutive automorphism. A related result is proved for (-1,-1) Freudenthal-Kantor triple systems. Some consequences for the associated 5-graded Lie algebras and superalgebras are deduced too. In particular, left unital (-1,-1) Freudenthal-Kantor triple systems are shown to be intimately related to Lie superalgebras graded over the root system of type B(0,1).
