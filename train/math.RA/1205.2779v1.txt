In the paper we describe the derivations of complex n-dimensional naturally graded filiform Leibniz algebras NGF_1, NGF_2\ \text{and} \ \ NGF_3. We show that the dimension of the derivation algebras of NGF_1 and NGF_2 equals n+1 and n+2, respectively, while the dimension of the derivation algebra of NGF_3 is equal to 2n-1. The second part of the paper deals with the description of the derivations of complex n-dimensional filiform non Lie Leibniz algebras, obtained from naturally graded non Lie filiform Leibniz algebras. It is well known that this class is split into two classes denoted by FLb_n and SLb_n. Here we found that for L\in FLb_n we have n-1 \leq dim\ Der(L)\leq n+1 and for algebras L from SLb_n the inequality n-1\leq dim\ Der(L) \leq n+2 holds true.
