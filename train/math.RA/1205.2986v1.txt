We focus in this text on the adaptation to the study of shuffles of the main combinatorial tool in the theory of free Lie algebras, namely the existence of a universal algebra of endomorphisms for tensor and other cocommutative Hopf algebras: the family of Solomon's descent algebras of type A. We show that there exists similarly a natural endomorphism algebra for commutative shuffle algebras, which is a natural extension of the Malvenuto-Reutenauer Hopf algebra of permutations, or algebra of free quasi-symmetric functions. We study this new algebra for its own, establish freeness properties, study its generators, bases, and also feature its relations to the internal structure of shuffle algebras.
