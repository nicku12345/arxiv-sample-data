Let V denote a vector space with finite positive dimension. We consider an ordered pair of linear transformations A: V\to V and A^*: V\to V that satisfy (i) and (ii) below.   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A^* is diagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A^* is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A is diagonal.   We call such a pair a Leonard pair on V. Arlene Pascasio recently obtained a characterization of the Q-polynomial distance-regular graphs using the intersection numbers a_i. In this paper, we extend her results to a linear algebraic level and obtain a characterization of Leonard pairs. Pascasio's argument appears to rely on the underlying combinatorial assumptions, so we take a different approach that is algebraic in nature.
