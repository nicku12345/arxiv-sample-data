Let c(x_1,...,x_d) be a multihomogeneous central polynomial for the n\times n matrix algebra M_n(K) over an infinite field K of positive characteristic p. We show that there exists a multihomogeneous polynomial c_0(x_1,...,x_d) of the same degree and with coefficients in the prime field F_p which is central for the algebra M_n(F) for any (possibly finite) field F of characteristic p. The proof is elementary and uses standard combinatorial techniques only.
