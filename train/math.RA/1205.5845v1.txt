This paper deals with the quasi-Armendariz ring in general setting. We generalize the notions of quasi-Armendariz and \alpha-skew Armendariz ring to quasi \alpha-Armendariz and quasi \alpha-skew Armendariz ring and investigate their properties. We also consider the quasi Armendariz properties of Laurent type rings.
