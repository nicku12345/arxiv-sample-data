Let (\FormR) be a form ring such that A is quasi-finite R-algebra (i.e., a direct limit of module finite algebras) with identity. We consider the hyperbolic Bak's unitary groups \GU(2n,\FormR), n\ge 3. For a form ideal (I,\Gamma) of the form ring (\FormR) we denote by \EU(2n,I,\Gamma) and \GU(2n,I,\Gamma) the relative elementary group and the principal congruence subgroup of level (I,\Gamma), respectively. Now, let (I_i,\Gamma_i) , i=0,...,m, be form ideals of the form ring (A,\Lambda). The main result of the present paper is the following multiple commutator formula [\big[\EU(2n,I_0,\Gamma_0),&\GU(2n,I_1,\Gamma_1),\GU(2n, I_2,\Gamma_2),..., \GU(2n,I_m,\Gamma_m)\big]= &\big[\EU(2n,I_0,\Gamma_0),\EU(2n,I_1,\Gamma_1),\EU(2n,I_2,\Gamma_2),..., \EU(2n, I_m, \Gamma_m)\big],] which is a broad generalization of the standard commutator formulas. This result contains all previous results on commutator formulas for classical like-groups over commutative and finite-dimensional rings.
