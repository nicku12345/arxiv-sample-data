Let R be a commutative additively idempotent semiring. In this paper, some properties and characterizations for permanents of matrices over R are established, and several inequalities for permanents are given. Also, the adjiont matrices of matriecs over R are considered. Partial results obtained in this paper generalize the corresponding ones on fuzzy matrices, on lattice matrices and on incline matrices.
