N-derivation is the natural generalization of derivation and triple derivation. Let {\cal L} be a finitely generated Lie algebra graded by a finite dimensional Cartan subalgebra. In this paper, a sufficient condition for Lie N-derivation algebra of {\cal L} coinciding with Lie derivation algebra of {\cal L} is given. As applications, any N-derivation of Schr\"{o}dinger-Virasoro algebra, generalized Witt algebras, Kac-Moody algebras and their Borel subalgebras, is a derivation.
