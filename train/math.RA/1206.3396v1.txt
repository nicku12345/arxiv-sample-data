For a ring R with an automorphism \sigma, an n-additive mapping \Delta:R\times R\times... \times R \rightarrow R is called a skew n-derivation with respect to \sigma if it is always a \sigma-derivation of R for each argument. Namely, it is always a \sigma-derivation of R for the argument being left once n-1 arguments are fixed by n-1 elements in R. In this short note, starting from Bre\v{s}ar Theorems, we prove that a skew n-derivation (n\geq 3) on a semiprime ring R must map into the center of R.
