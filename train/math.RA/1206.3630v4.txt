Let K be a perfect field, L be an extension field of K and A,B\in\mathcal{M}_n(K). If A has n distinct eigenvalues in L that are explicitly known, then we can check if A,B are simultaneously triangularizable over L.   Now we assume that A,B have a common invariant proper vector subspace of dimension k over an extension field of K and that \chi_A, the characteristic polynomial of A, is irreducible over K. Let G be the Galois group of \chi_A. We show the following results i) If k\in{1,n-1}, then A,B commute. ii) If 1\leq k\leq n-1 and G=\mathcal{S}_n or G=\mathcal{A}_n, then AB=BA. iii) If 1\leq k\leq n-1 and n is a prime number, then AB=BA. Yet, when n=4,k=2, we show that A,B do not necessarily commute if G is not \mathcal{S}_4 or \mathcal{A}_4. Finally we apply the previous results to solving a matrix equation.
