In this paper, firstly as a short note, we prove that a left derivation of a semiprime \Gamma-ring M must map M into its center, which improves a result by Paul and Halder and some results by Asci and Ceran. Also we prove that a semiprime \Gamma-ring with a strong commutativity preserving derivation on itself must be commutative and that a strong commutativity preserving endomorphism on a semiprime \Gamma-ring M must have the form \sigma(x)=x+\zeta(x) where \zeta is a map from M into its center, which extends some results by Bell and Daif to semiprime \Gamma-rings.
