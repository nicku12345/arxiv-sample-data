Similar to the idea of relative projectivity, we introduce the notion of relative subprojectivity, which is an alternative way to measure the projectivity of a module. Given modules M and N, M is said to be {\em N-subprojective} if for every epimorphism g:B \rightarrow N and homomorphism f:M \rightarrow N, then there exists a homomorphism h:M \rightarrow B such that gh=f. For a module M, the {\em subprojectivity domain of M} is defined to be the collection of all modules N such that M is N-subprojective. A module is projective if and only if its subprojectivity domain consists of all modules. Opposite to this idea, a module M is said to be {\em subprojectively poor}, or {\em sp-poor} if its subprojectivity domain is as small as conceivably possible, that is, consisting of exactly the projective modules. Properties of subprojectivity domains and sp-poor modules are studied. In particular, the existence of an sp-poor module is attained for artinian serial rings.
