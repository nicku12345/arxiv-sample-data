In this paper, we introduce the notion of bigraft algebra, generalizing the notions of left and right graft algebras. We give a combinatorial description of the free bigraft algebra generated by one generator and we endow this algebra with a Hopf algebra structure, and a pairing. Next, we study the Koszul dual of the bigraft operad and we give a combinatorial description of the free dual bigraft algebra generated by one generator. With the help of a rewriting method, we prove that the bigraft operad is Koszul. Finally, we define the notion of infinitesimal bigraft bialgebra and we prove a rigidity theorem for connected infinitesimal bigraft bialgebras.
