Let \Lambda be a commutative Noetherian ring, and let I be a proper ideal of \Lambda, R=\Lambda /I. Consider the polynomial rings T=\Lambda [x_1,...x_n] and A=R[x_1,...,x_n]. Suppose that linear equations are solvable in \Lambda. It is shown that linear equations are solvable in R (thereby theoretically Gr\"obner bases for ideals of A are well defined and constructible) and that practically Gr\"obner bases in A with respect to any given monomial ordering can be obtained by constructing Gr\"obner bases in T, and moreover, all basic applications of a Gr\"obner basis at the level of A can be realized by a Gr\"obner basis at the level of T. Typical applications of this result are demonstrated respectively in the cases where \Lambda=D is a PID, \Lambda =D[y_1,...,y_m] is a polynomial ring over a PID D, and \Lambda =K[y_1,...,y_m] is a polynomial ring over a field K.
