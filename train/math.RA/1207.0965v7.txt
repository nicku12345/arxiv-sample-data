The present paper shows that if q \in \mathbb P or q = 0, where \mathbb P is the set of prime numbers, then there exist characteristic q fields E _{q,k}\colon \ k \in \mathbb N, of Brauer dimension Brd(E _{q,k}) = k and infinite absolute Brauer p-dimensions abrd_{p}(E _{q,k}), for all p \in \mathbb P not dividing q ^{2} - q. This ensures that Brd_{p}(F _{q,k}) = \infty , p \dagger q ^{2} - q, for every finitely-generated transcendental extension F _{q,k}/E _{q,k}. We also prove that each sequence a _{p}, b _{p}, p \in \mathbb P, satisfying the conditions a _{2} = b _{2} and 0 \le b _{p} \le a _{p} \le \infty , equals the sequence abrd_{p}(E), {\rm Brd}_{p}(E), p \in \mathbb P, for a field E of characteristic zero.
