We study the class of ADS rings and modules introduced by Fuchs. We give some connections between this notion and classical notions such as injectivity and quasi-continuity. A simple ring R such that R is ADS as a right R-module must be either right self-injective or indecomposable as a right R-module. Under certain conditions we can construct a unique ADS hull up to isomorphism. We introduce the concept of completely ADS modules and characterize completely ADS semiperfect right modules as direct sum of semisimple and local modules.
