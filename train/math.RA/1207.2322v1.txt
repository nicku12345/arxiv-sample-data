Given a Bravais colouring of planar modules \M_n:=\Z[\xi_n], where \xi_n is a primitive nth root of unity, two important colour groups arise: the colour symmetry group H, which permutes the colours of a given colouring of \M_n, and the colour preserving group K, a normal subgroup of H that fixes the colours. This paper gives a complete characterisation of H and K for all \ell-colourings of \M_n for values of n for which \M_n has class number one.
