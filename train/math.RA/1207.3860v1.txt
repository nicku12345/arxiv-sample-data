Let X be one of the finite-dimensional simple graded Lie superalgebras of Cartan type W, S, H, K, HO, KO, SHO or SKO over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>3. In this paper we prove that X can be generated by one element except the ones of type W, HO, KO or SKO in certain exceptional cases, in which X can be generated by two elements. As a subsidiary result, we also prove that certain classical Lie superalgebras or their relatives can be generated by one or two elements.
