Let k_q[x, x^{-1}, y] be the localization of the quantum plane k_q[x, y] over a field k, where 0\neq q\in k. Then k_q[x, x^{-1}, y] is a graded Hopf algebra, which can be regarded as the non-negative part of the quantum enveloping algebra U_q({\mathfrak sl}_2). Under the assumption that q is not a root of unity, we investigate the coalgebra automorphism group of k_q[x, x^{-1}, y]. We describe the structures of the graded coalgebra automorphism group and the coalgebra automorphism group of k_q[x, x^{-1}, y], respectively.
