We initiate the investigation of the projective variety E(r,g) of elementary subalgebras of dimension r of a (p-restricted) Lie algebra g for some r > 0 and demonstrate that this variety encodes considerable information about the representations of g. For various choices of g and r, we identify the geometric structure of E(r,g). We show that special classes of (restricted) representations of g lead to algebraic vector bundles on E(r,g). For g = Lie(G) the Lie algebra of an algebraic group G, rational representations of G enable us to realize familiar algebraic vector bundles on G-orbits of E(r, g).
