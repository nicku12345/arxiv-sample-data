It is shown that Golod-Shaferevich algebras of a reduced number of defining relations contain noncommutative free subalgebras in two generators, and that these algebras can be homomorphically mapped onto prime, Noetherian algebras with linear growth. It is also shown that Golod-Shafarevich algebras of a reduced number of relations cannot be nil.
