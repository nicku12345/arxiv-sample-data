This paper determines the Brauer p-dimension Brd_{p}(K) and the absolute Brauer p-dimension abrd_{p}(K) of a Henselian valued field (K, v), for a prime p \neq {\rm char}(\widehat K), under restrictions on the residue field \widehat K, such as the condition abrd_{p}(\widehat K) = 0. It describes the set \Sigma_{0} of sequences {\rm abrd}_{p}(E), {\rm Brd}_{p}(E), p \in \mathbb P, where \mathbb P is the set of prime numbers and E runs across the class of Henselian fields with char(\widehat E) = 0 and a projective absolute Galois group \mathcal{G}_{\widehat E}. Specifically, \Sigma_{0} contains a sequence a_{p}, b_{p} \in \mathbb N \cup \{0, \infty \}, p \in \mathbb P, whenever a_{2} \le 2b_{2} and a_{p} \ge b_{p}, for each p. Similar results are obtained in characteristic q > 0.
