Verbally prime algebras are important in PI theory. They are well known over a field K of characteristic zero: 0 and K<T> (the trivial ones), M_n(K), M_n(E), M_{ab}(E). Here K<T> is the free associative algebra with free generators T, E is the infinite dimensional Grassmann algebra over K, M_n(K) and M_n(E) are the n\times n matrices over K and over E, respectively. Moreover M_{ab}(E) are certain subalgebras of M_{a+b}(E), defined below. The generic algebras of these algebras have been studied extensively. Procesi gave a very tight description of the generic algebra of M_n(K). The situation is rather unclear for the remaining nontrivial verbally prime algebras.   In this paper we study the centre of the generic algebra of M_{11}(E) in two generators. We prove that this centre is a direct sum of the field and a nilpotent ideal (of the generic algebra). We describe the centre of this algebra. As a corollary we obtain that this centre contains nonscalar elements thus we answer a question posed by Berele.
