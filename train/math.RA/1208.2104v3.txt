We investigate a new class of Lie algebras, which are tame locally extended affine Lie algebras of nullity 1. It is an infinite-rank analog of affine Lie algebras, and their centerless cores are a local version of loop algebras. Such algebras are called locally affine Lie algebras and locally loop algebras. We classify both of them.
