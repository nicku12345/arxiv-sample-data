Gelfand, Retakh, Serconek and Wilson, in \cite{GRSW}, defined a graded algebra A_\Gamma attached to any finite ranked poset \Gamma - a generalization of the universal algebra of pseudo-roots of noncommutative polynomials. This algebra has since come to be known as the splitting algebra of \Gamma. The splitting algebra has a secondary filtration related to the rank function on the poset and the associated graded algebra is denoted here by A'_\Gamma. We calculate the cohomology algebra (and coalgebra) of A'_\Gamma explicitly. As a corollary to this calculation we have a proof that A'_\Gamma is Koszul (respectively quadratic) if and only if \Gamma is Cohen-Macaulay (respectively uniform). We show by example that the cohomology algebra (resp. coalgebra) of A_\Gamma may be strictly smaller that the cohomology algebra (resp. coalgebra) of A'_\Gamma.
