In this work, it is proposed a method for computing Noncommutative Gr\"obner bases over a valuation n{\oe}therian ring. We have generalized the fundamental theorem on normal forms over an arbitrary ring. The classical method of dynamical commutative Gr\"obner bases is generalized for Buchberger's algorithm over R=\mathcal{V}<x_1,...,x_m> a free associative algebra with non-commuting variables, where \mathcal{V}=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} or \mathcal{V}=\mathbb{Z}.   The process proposed, generalizes previous known technics for the computation of Commutative Gr\"obner bases over a valuation n{\oe}therian ring and/or Noncommutative Gr\"obner bases over a field.
