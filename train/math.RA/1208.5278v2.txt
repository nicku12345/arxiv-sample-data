This paper aims to study the low dimensional cohomology of Hom-Lie algebras and q-deformed W(2,2) algebra. We show that the q-deformed W(2,2) algebra is a Hom-Lie algebra. Also, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the equivalence classes of one dimensional central extensions of a Hom-Lie algebra and its second cohomology group, leading us to determine the second cohomology group of the q-deformed W(2,2) algebra. In addition, we generalize some results of derivations of finitely generated Lie algebras with values in graded modules to Hom-Lie algebras. As application we compute all \a^k-derivations and in particular the first cohomology group of the q-deformed W(2,2) algebra.
