It is proved that if D is a UFD and R is a D-algebra, such that U(R)\cap D\neq U(D), then R has a maximal subring. In particular, if R is a ring which either contains a unit x which is not algebraic over the prime subring of R, or R has zero characteristic and there exists a natural number n>1 such that \frac{1}{n}\in R, then R has a maximal subring. It is shown that if R is a reduced ring with |R|>2^{2^{\aleph_0}} or J(R)\neq 0, then any R-algebra has a maximal subring. Residually finite rings without maximal subrings are fully characterized. It is observed that every uncountable UFD has a maximal subring. The existence of maximal subrings in a noetherian integral domain R, in relation to either the cardinality of the set of divisors of some of its elements or the height of its maximal ideals, is also investigated.
