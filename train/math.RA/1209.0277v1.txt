We construct a seven-term exact sequence involving low degree cohomology spaces of a Lie algebra \Lg, an ideal \Lh of \Lg and the quotient \Lg / \Lh with coefficients in a \Lg-module. The existence of such a sequence follows from the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence associated to the Lie algebra extension. However, some of the maps occurring in this induced sequence are not always explicitly known or easy to describe. In this article, we give alternative maps that yield an exact sequence of the same form, making use of the interpretations of the low-dimensional cohomology spaces in terms of derivations, extensions etc. The maps are constructed using elementary methods. Although we don't know whether the new maps coincide with the ones induced by the spectral sequence, the alternative sequence can certainly be useful, especially since we include straight-forward cocycle descriptions of the constructed maps.
