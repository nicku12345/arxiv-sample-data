Let p be an odd prime, D_{2p} be the dihedral group of order 2p, and F_{2} be the finite field with two elements. If * denotes the canonical involution of the group algebra F_2D_{2p}, then bicyclic units are unitary units. In this note, we investigate the structure of the group \mathcal{B}(F_2D_{2p}), generated by the bicyclic units of the group algebra F_2D_{2p}. Further, we obtain the structure of the unit group \mathcal{U}(F_2D_{2p}) and the unitary subgroup \mathcal{U}_*(F_2D_{2p}), and we prove that both \mathcal{B}(F_2D_{2p}) and \mathcal{U}_*(F_2D_{2p}) are normal subgroups of \mathcal{U}(F_2D_{2p}).
