Consider the space M_n^{nor} of square normal matrices X=(x_{ij}) over \mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}, i.e., -\infty\le x_{ij}\le0 and x_{ii}=0. Endow M_n^{nor} with the tropical sum \oplus and multiplication \odot. Fix a real matrix A\in M_n^{nor} and consider the set \Omega(A) of matrices in M_n^{nor} which commute with A. We prove that \Omega(A) is a finite union of alcoved polytopes; in particular, \Omega(A) is a finite union of convex sets. The set \Omega^A(A) of X such that A\odot X=X\odot A=A is also a finite union of alcoved polytopes. The same is true for the set \Omega'(A) of X such that A\odot X=X\odot A=X.   A topology is given to M_n^{nor}. Then, the set \Omega^{A}(A) is a neighborhood of the identity matrix I. If A is strictly normal, then \Omega'(A) is a neighborhood of the zero matrix. In one case, \Omega(A) is a neighborhood of A. We give an upper bound for the dimension of \Omega'(A). We explore the relationship between the polyhedral complexes span A, span X and span (AX), when A and X commute. Two matrices, denoted \underline{A} and \bar{A}, arise from A, in connection with \Omega(A). The geometric meaning of them is given in detail, for one example. We produce examples of matrices which commute, in any dimension.
