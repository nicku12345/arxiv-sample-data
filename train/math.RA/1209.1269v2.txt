We compute the rank of the group of central units in the integral group ring \Z G of a finite strongly monomial group G. The formula obtained is in terms of the strong Shoda pairs of G. Next we construct a virtual basis of the group of central units of \Z G for a class of groups G properly contained in the finite strongly monomial groups. Furthermore, for another class of groups G inside the finite strongly monomial groups, we give an explicit construction of a complete set of orthogonal primitive idempotents of \Q G.   Finally, we apply these results to describe finitely many generators of a subgroup of finite index in the group of units of \Z G, this for metacyclic groups G of the form G=C_{q^m}\rtimes C_{p^n} with p and q different primes and the cyclic group C_{p^n} of order p^n acting faithfully on the cyclic group C_{q^m} of order q^m.
