The genetic product of the groupoids, originating in the theory of DNA recombination, is introduced. It permits a natural generalization of the classical genetic algorithm. The full characterization of all three-element genetic groupoids gives an approach to construct the new classes of genetic algorithms. In the conclusion, we formulate some open problems in the theory of the genetic groupoids.
