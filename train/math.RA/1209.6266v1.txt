In the category of Hom-Leibniz algebras we introduce the notion of representation as adequate coefficients to construct the chain complex to compute the Leibniz homology of Hom-Leibniz algebras. We study universal central extensions of Hom-Leibinz algebras and generalize some classical results, nevertheless it is necessary to introduce new notions of \alpha-central extension, universal \alpha-central extension and \alpha-perfect Hom-Leibniz algebra. We prove that an \alpha-perfect Hom-Lie algebra admits a universal \alpha-central extension in the categories of Hom-Lie and Hom-Leibniz algebras and we obtain the relationships between both. In case \alpha = Id we recover the corresponding results on universal central extensions of Leibniz algebras.
