We study algebras A, over a field of characteristic zero, satisfying (x^p, x^q, x^r)=0 for p, q, r in {1, 2}. The existence of a unit element in such algebras leads to the third power-associativity. If, in addition, A has degree \leq 4 then A is power-commutative. We deduce that any 4-dimensional real division algebra, with unit element, satisfying (x^p, x^q, x^r)=0 is quadratic. This persists for (x, x^q, x^r)=0 if we replace the word "unit" by "left-unit".
