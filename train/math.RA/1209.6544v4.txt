Matrix congruence can be used to mimic linear maps between homogeneous quadratic polynomials in n variables. We introduce a generalization, called standard-form congruence, which mimics affine maps between non-homogeneous quadratic polynomials. Canonical forms under standard-form congruence for three-by-three matrices are derived. This is then used to give a classification of algebras defined by two generators and one degree two relation. We also apply standard-form congruence to classify homogenizations of these algebras.
