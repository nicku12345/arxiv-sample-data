Let K be an infinite field such that its characteristic is not 2. We show that, for every A\in\mathcal{M}_n(K) such that \mathrm{rank}(A)\geq n/2, there exists B\in\mathcal{M}_n(K) such that B is similar to A and A+B is invertible. Let K be a subfield of \mathbb{R}. We show that, if n is even, then for every X\in\mathcal{M}_n(K), \det(AX+XA)\geq 0 if and only if either \mathrm{rank}(A)<n/2 or there exists \alpha\in K,\alpha\leq 0, such that A^2=\alpha I_n.
