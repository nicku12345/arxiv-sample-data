Two are the objectives of the present paper. First we study properties of a differentially simple commutative ring R with respect to a set D of derivations of R. Among the others we investigate the relation between the D-simplicity of R and that of the local ring RP with respect to a prime ideal P of R and we prove a criterion about the D- simplicity of R in case where R is a 1-dimensional (Krull dimension) finitely generated algebra over a field of characteristic zero and D is a singleton set. The above criterion was quoted without proof in an earlier paper of the author. Second we construct a special class of iterated skew polynomial rings defined with respect to finite sets of derivations of a ring R (not necessarily commutative) commuting to each other. The important thing in this class is that, if R is a commutative ring, then its differential simplicity is the necessary and sufficient condition for the simplicity of the corresponding skew polynomial ring.
