Since the introduction of Askey-Wilson algebras by Zhedanov in 1991, the classification of the finite-dimensional irreducible modules of Askey-Wilson algebras remains open. A universal analog \triangle_q of the Askey-Wilson algebras was recently studied. In this paper, we consider a family of infinite-dimensional \triangle_q-modules. By the universal property of these \triangle_q-modules, we classify the finite-dimensional irreducible \triangle_q-modules when q is not a root of unity.
