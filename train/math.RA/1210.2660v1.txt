We prove that if a field k is infinite, char(k)=0 and k has not nontrivial automorphisms then automorphic equivalence of representations of Lie algebras coincide with geometric equivalence. We achieve our result by consideration of 1-sorted objects. We suppose that our method can be perspective in the further researches.
