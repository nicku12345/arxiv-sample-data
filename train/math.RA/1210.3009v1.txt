It is known that a 2\times 2 quaternionic matrix has one, two or an infinite number of left eigenvalues, but the available algebraic proofs are difficult to generalize to higher orders. In this paper a different point of view is adopted by computing the topological degree of a characteristic map associated to the matrix and discussing the rank of the differential. The same techniques are extended to 3\times 3 matrices, which are still lacking a complete classification.
