The aim of this paper is to try to answer Herstein's question concerning simple rings with involution, namely: If R is a simple ring with an involution of the first kind, with dim_{Z(R)}R > 4 and \Char(Z(R))\neq 2, is it true that S^2=R? We shall see that in such a ring R, R=S^3. We shall bring two possible criteria, each shows when R=S^2. The first criterion: There exist x,y \in S such that xy-yx \neq 0 and xSy \subseteq S^2 \Leftrightarrow S^2=R. The second criterion: There exist x,y \in S such that xy+yx \neq 0 and xKy \subseteq S^2 \Leftrightarrow S^2=R. Actually, those results are true without any restriction on the dimension of R over Z(R). In the special case of matrices (with the transpose involution and with the symplectic involution) over a field of characteristic not equal to 2, it is not difficult to find, for example, x,y \in S such that xy-yx \neq 0 and for every s \in S, xsy \in S^2. Therefore, proving Herstein's remark that for matrices the answer is known to be positive. Similar results for K^6, K^4, K+KSK, KS+K^2, SKS and S^2K can also be found.
