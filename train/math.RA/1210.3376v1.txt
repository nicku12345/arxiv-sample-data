Let L be a join-distributive lattice with length n and width(Ji L) \leq k. There are two ways to describe L by k-1 permutations acting on an n-element set: a combinatorial way given by P.H. Edelman and R.E. Jamison in 1985 and a recent lattice theoretical way of the second author. We prove that these two approaches are equivalent. Also, we characterize join-distributive lattices by trajectories.
