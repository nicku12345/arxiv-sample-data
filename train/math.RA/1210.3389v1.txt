Let A be a connected graded noncommutative monomial algebra. We associate to A a finite graph \Gamma(A) called the CPS graph of A. Finiteness properties of the Yoneda algebra Ext_A(k,k) including Noetherianity, finite GK dimension, and finite generation are characterized in terms of \Gamma(A). We show these properties, notably finite generation, can be checked by means of a terminating algorithm.
