Vatne and Green & Marcos have independently studied the Koszul-like homological properties of graded algebras that have defining relations in degree 2 and exactly one other degree. We contrast these two approaches, answer two questions posed by Green & Marcos, and find conditions that imply the corresponding Yoneda algebras are generated in the lowest possible degrees.
