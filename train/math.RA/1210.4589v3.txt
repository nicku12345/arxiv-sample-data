Known classification results allow us to find the number of (equivalence classes of) fine gradings on matrix algebras and on classical simple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field \mathbb{F} (assuming \mathrm{char} \mathbb{F}\ne 2 in the Lie case). The computation is easy for matrix algebras and especially for simple Lie algebras of type B_r (the answer is just r+1), but involves counting orbits of certain finite groups in the case of Series A, C and D. For X\in\{A,C,D\}, we determine the exact number of fine gradings, N_X(r), on the simple Lie algebras of type X_r with r\le 100 as well as the asymptotic behaviour of the average, \hat N_X(r), for large r. In particular, we prove that there exist positive constants b and c such that \exp(br^{2/3})\le\hat N_X(r)\le\exp(cr^{2/3}). The analogous average for matrix algebras M_n(\mathbb{F}) is proved to be a\ln n+O(1) where a is an explicit constant depending on \mathrm{char} \mathbb{F}.
