An Ore extension over a polynomial algebra \mathbb{F}[x] is either a quantum plane, a quantum Weyl algebra, or an infinite-dimensional unital associative algebra \mathsf{A}_h generated by elements x,y, which satisfy yx-xy = h, where h\in \mathbb{F}[x]. We investigate the family of algebras \mathsf{A}_h as h ranges over all the polynomials in \mathbb{F}[x]. When h \neq 0, these algebras are subalgebras of the Weyl algebra \mathsf{A}_1 and can be viewed as differential operators with polynomial coefficients. We give an exact description of the automorphisms of \mathsf{A}_h over arbitrary fields \mathbb{F} and describe the invariants in \mathsf{A}_h under the automorphisms. We determine the center, normal elements, and height one prime ideals of \mathsf{A}_h, localizations and Ore sets for \mathsf{A}_h, and the Lie ideal [\mathsf{A}_h,\mathsf{A}_h]. We also show that \mathsf{A}_h cannot be realized as a generalized Weyl algebra over \mathbb{F}[x], except when h \in \mathbb{F}. In two sequels to this work, we completely describe the derivations and irreducible modules of \mathsf{A}_h over any field.
