We describe isomorphisms between strongly triangular matrix rings that were defined earlier in Berkenmeier et al. (2000) as ones having a complete set of triangulating idempotents, and we show that the so-called triangulating idempotents behave analogously to idempotents in semiperfect rings. This study yields also a way to compute theoretically the automorphism groups of such rings in terms of corresponding automorphism groups of certain subrings and bimodules involved in their structure.
