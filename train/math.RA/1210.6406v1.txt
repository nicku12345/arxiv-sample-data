In this paper we consider some classical varieties of linear algebras over the field which has characteristic 0. For every considered variety we take a category of the finite generated free algebras of this variety. And for every this category we calculate the quotient group of the group of the all automorphisms of this category over the subgroup of the all inner automorphisms. This quotient group measures difference between the geometric equivalence and automorphic equivalence of algebras from this variety.
