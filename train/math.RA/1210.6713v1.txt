Tensor type data are used recently in various application fields, and then a typical rank is important. Let 3\leq m\leq n. We study typical ranks of m\times n\times (m-1)n tensors over the real number field. Let \rho be the Hurwitz-Radon function defined as \rho(n)=2^b+8c for nonnegative integers a,b,c such that n=(2a+1)2^{b+4c} and 0\leq b<4. If m \leq \rho(n), then the set of m\times n\times (m-1)n tensors has two typical ranks (m-1)n,(m-1)n+1. In this paper, we show that the converse is also true: if m > \rho(n), then the set of m\times n\times (m-1)n tensors has only one typical rank (m-1)n.
