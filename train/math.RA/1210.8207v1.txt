The aim of this paper is to give relations between the category of finetely generated graded modules over the homogeneized Weyl algebra B_{n}, the finetely generated modules over the Weyl algebra A_{n} and the finetely generated graded modules over the Yoneda algebra B_{n}^{!} of B_{n}. We will give these relations both at the level of the categories of modules and at the level of the derived categories.
