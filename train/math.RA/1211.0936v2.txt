In this paper we study the homogenized algebra B of the enveloping algebra U of the Lie algebra sl(2,C). We look first to connections between the category of graded left B- modules and the category of U-modules, then we prove B is Koszul and Artin-Schelter regular of global dimension four, hence its Yoneda algebra % B^{!} is selfinjective of radical five zero, the structure of B^{!} is given. We describe next the category of homogenized Verma modules, which correspond to the lifting to B of the usual Verma modules over U, and prove that such modules are Koszul of projective dimension two. It was proved in [MZ] that all graded stable components of a selfinjective Koszul algebra are of type ZA_{\infty}, we characterize here the graded B^{!}% -modules corresponding under Koszul duality to the homogenized Verma modules, and prove that they are located at the mouth of a regular component, in this way we obtain a family of components over a wild algebra indexed by C. The paper ends with the description of a family of weight modules over B which corresponds to the weight modules over U and with a description of the category of B - modules corresponding to the Gelfand's category % \mathcal{O} of U-modules .
