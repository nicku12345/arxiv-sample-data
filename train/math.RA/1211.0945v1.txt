The paper is dedicated to the study of certain non commutative graded AS Gorenstein algebras \Lambda .   The main result of the paper is that for Koszul algebras \Lambda  with Yoneda algebra \Gamma , such that both \Lambda  and \Gamma  are graded AS Gorenstein noetherian of finite local cohomology dimension on both sides, there are dualities of triangulated categories: \underline{gr}_{\Lambda}[\Omega ^{-1}] \cong D^{b}(Qgr_{\Gamma}) and \underline{gr}_{\Gamma}[\Omega ^{-1}] \cong D^{b}(Qgr_{\Lambda}) where, and Qgr_{\Gamma} is the category of tails, this is: the category of finitely generated graded modules gr_{\Gamma} divided by the modules of finite length, and D^{b}(Qgr_{\Gamma}) the corresponding derived category and \underline{gr}_{\Lambda}[\Omega^{-1}] the stabilization of the category of finetely generated graded \Lambda -modules, module the finetely generated projective modules.
