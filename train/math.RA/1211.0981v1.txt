The aim of this paper is two fold:   First to study finite groups G of automorphisms of the homogenized Weyl algebra B_{n}, the skew group algebra B_{n}\ast G, the ring of invariants B_{n}^{G}, and the relations of these algebras with the Weyl algebra A_{n}, with the skew group algebra A_{n}\ast G, and with the ring of invariants A_{n}^{G}. Of particular interest is the case n=1.   In the on the other hand, we consider the invariant ring \QTR{sl}{C}[X]^{G} of the polynomial ring K[X] in n generators, where G is a finite subgroup of Gl(n,\QTR{sl}{C}) such that any element in G different from the identity does not have one as an eigenvalue. We study the relations between the category of finitely generated modules over \QTR{sl}{C}[X]^{G} and the corresponding category over the skew group algebra \QTR{sl}{C}% [X]\ast G. We obtain a generalization of known results for n=2 and G a finite subgroup of Sl(2,C). In the last part of the paper we extend the results for the polynomial algebra C[X] to the homogenized Weyl algebra B_{n}.
