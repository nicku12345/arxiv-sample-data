We study injective hulls of simple modules over differential operator rings R[\theta; d], providing necessary conditions under which these modules are locally Artinian. As a consequence we characterize Ore extensions of S=K[x][\theta;\sigma, d] for d a K-linear derivation and \sigma a K-linear automorphism of K[x] such that injective hulls of simple S-modules are locally Artinian.
