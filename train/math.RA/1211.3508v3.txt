The purpose of this this paper is to generalize the functors arising from the theory of Witt vectors duto to Cartier. Given a polynomial g(q)\in \mathbb Z[q], we construct a functor {\overline {W}}^{g(q)} from the category of \mathbb Z[q]-algebras to that of commutative rings. When q is specialized into an integer m, it produces a functor from the category of commutative rings with unity to that of commutative rings. In a similar way, we also construct several functors related to {\overline { W}}^{g(q)}. Functorial and structural properties such as induction, restriction, classification and unitalness will be investigated intensively.
