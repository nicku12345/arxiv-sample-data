We prove Suslin's local-global principle for principal congruence subgroups of Chevalley groups. Let G be a Chevalley--Demazure group scheme with a root system \Phi\ne A_1 and E its elementary subgroup. Let R be a ring and I an ideal of R. Assume additionally that R has no residue fields of 2 elements if \Phi=C_2 or G_2.   Theorem. Let g\in G(R[X],XR[X]). Suppose that for every maximal ideal \m of R the image of g under the localization homomorphism at \m belongs to E(R_\m[X],IR_\m[X]). Then, g\in E(R[X],IR[X]).   The theorem is a common generalization of the result of E.Abe for the absolute case (I=R) and H.Apte--P.Chattopadhyay--R.Rao for classical groups. It is worth mentioning that for the absolute case the local-global principle was obtained by V.Petrov and A.Stavrova in more general settings of isotropic reductive groups.
