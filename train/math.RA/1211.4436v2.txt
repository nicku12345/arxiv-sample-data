We consider a class of infinite-dimensional, modular, graded Lie algebras, which includes the graded Lie algebra associated to the Nottingham group with respect to its lower central series. We identify two subclasses of Nottingham Lie algebras as loop algebras of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras of Hamiltonian Cartan type. A property of Laguerre polynomials of derivations, which is related to toral switching, plays a crucial role in our constructions.
