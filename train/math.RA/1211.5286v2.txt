A *-ring R is called a strongly nil-*-clean ring if every element of R is the sum of a projection and a nilpotent element that commute with each other. In this article, we show that R is a strongly nil-*-clean ring if and only if every idempotent in R is a projection, R is periodic, and R/J(R) is Boolean. For any commutative *-ring R, we prove that the algebraic extension R[i] where i^2=\mu i+\eta for some \mu,\eta\in R is strongly nil-*-clean if and only if R is strongly nil-*-clean and \mu\eta is nilpotent. The relationships between Boolean *-rings and strongly nil-*-clean rings are also obtained.
