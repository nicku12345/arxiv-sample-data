A plane poset is a finite set with two partial orders, satisfying a certain incompatibility condition. The set PP of isoclasses of plane posets owns two products, and an infinitesimal Hopf algebra structure is defined on the vector space H_PP generated by PP, using the notion of biideals of plane posets. We here define a partial order on PP, making it isomorphic to the set of partitions with the weak Bruhat order. We prove that this order is compatible with both products of PP; moreover, it encodes a non degenerate Hopf pairing on the infinitesimal Hopf algebra H_PP.
