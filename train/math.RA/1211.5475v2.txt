We give new characterizations of the algebra \mathscr{L}_n(\mathbb{F}_{q^n}) formed by all linearized polynomials over the finite field \mathbb{F}_{q^n} after briefly surveying some known ones. One isomorphism we construct is between \mathscr{L}_n(\mathbb{F}_{q^n}) and the composition algebra \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^\vee\otimes_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}\mathbb{F}_{q^n}. The other isomorphism we construct is between \mathscr{L}_n(\mathbb{F}_{q^n}) and the so-called Dickson matrix algebra \mathscr{D}_n(\mathbb{F}_{q^n}). We also further study the relations between a linearized polynomial and its associated Dickson matrix, generalizing a well-known criterion of Dickson on linearized permutation polynomials. Adjugate polynomial of a linearized polynomial is then introduced, and connections between them are discussed. Both of the new characterizations can bring us more simple approaches to establish a special form of representations of linearized polynomials proposed recently by several authors. Structure of the subalgebra \mathscr{L}_n(\mathbb{F}_{q^m}) which are formed by all linearized polynomials over a subfield \mathbb{F}_{q^m} of \mathbb{F}_{q^n} where m|n are also described.
