Let n\geq2 be a natural number. Let M_n(\mathbb{K}) be the ring of all n \times n matrices over a field \mathbb{K}. Fix natural number k satisfying 1<k\leq n. Under a mild technical assumption over \mathbb{K} we will show that additive maps G:M_n(\mathbb{K})\to M_n(\mathbb{K}) such that [G(x),x]=0 for every rank-k matrix x\in M_n(\mathbb{K}) are of form \lambda x + \mu(x), where \lambda\in Z, \mu:M_n(\mathbb{K})\to Z, and Z stands for the center of M_n(\mathbb{K}). Furthermore, we shall see an example that there are additive maps such that [G(x),x]=0 for all rank-1 matrices that are not of the form \lambda x + \mu(x). We will also discuss the m-additive case.
