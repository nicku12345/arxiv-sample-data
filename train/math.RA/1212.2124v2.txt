We say that a subring R_0 of a ring R is semi-invariant if R_0 is the ring of invariants in R under some set of ring endomorphisms of some ring containing R. We show that R_0 is semi-invariant if and only if there is a ring S\supseteq R and a set X\subseteq S such that R_0=\Cent_R(X):={r\in R \suchthat xr=rx \forall x\in X}; in particular, centralizers of subsets of R are semi-invariant subrings.   We prove various properties of semi-invariant subrings and show how they can be used for various applications including: (1) The center of a semiprimary (resp. right perfect) ring is semiprimary (resp. right perfect). (2) If M is a finitely presented module over a "good" semiperfect ring (e.g. an inverse limit of semiprimary rings), then (M) is semiperfect, hence M has a Krull-Schmidt decomposition. (This generalizes results of Bjork and Rowen). (3) If \rho is a representation of a monoid or a ring over a module with a "good" semiperfect endomorphism ring (in the sense of (2)), then \rho has a Krull-Schmidt decomposition. (4) If S is a "good" commutative semiperfect ring and R is an S-algebra that is f.p.\ as an S-module, then R is semiperfect. (5) Let R\subseteq S be rings and let M be a right S-module. If (M_R) is semiprimary (resp. right perfect), then (M_S) is semiprimary (resp. right perfect).
