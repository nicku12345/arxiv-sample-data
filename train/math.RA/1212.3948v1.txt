Using the idea of quasi-ideals of P-regular nearrings, the concept of bi-ideals of P-regular nearrings is generalized, which is an extension of the concept of quasi-ideals of P-regular nearrings and some interesting characterizations of bi-ideals are obtained. As a result, we prove that every element of a bi-ideal B of a P-regular nearring can be represented as the sum of two elements of P and Q. Moreover, every element of the finite intersection \displaystyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}B_{i} of bi-ideals of a P-regular distributive nearring N can be represented as the sum of two elements of P and B_{1}NB_{2}N...NB_{n-1}NB_{n}.
