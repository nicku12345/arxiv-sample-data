The notion of \Gamma-semirings was introduced by Murali Krishna Rao \cite{Rao} as a generalization of the notion of \Gamma-rings as well as of semirings. We have known that the notion of \Gamma-semirings is a generalization of the notion of semirings. In this paper, extending Kaushik, Moin and Khan's work, we generalize the notion of generalized bi-\Gamma-ideals of \Gamma-semirings and investigate some related properties of generalized bi-\Gamma-ideals.
