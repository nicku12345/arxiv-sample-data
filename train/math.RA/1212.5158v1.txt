A significant class of Poisson brackets on the polynomial algebra \C[x_1,x_2,..., x_n] is studied and, for this class of Poisson brackets, the Poisson prime ideals and Poisson primitive ideals are determined. Moreover it is established that these Poisson algebras satisfy the Poisson Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence.
