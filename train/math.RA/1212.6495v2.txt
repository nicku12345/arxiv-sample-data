In the latest developments in the theory of skew lattices, distributivity has been one of the main topics of study. The largest classes of examples of such algebras are distributive. Unlike what happens in lattices, the properties of cancellation and distributivity are independent for skew lattices. In this paper we will discuss several aspects of distributivity in the absence of commutativity, review the recent results by Kinyon and Leech on these matters and have an insight on the coset structure of those algebras that satisfy this property. We will also discuss combinatorial implications of these results.
