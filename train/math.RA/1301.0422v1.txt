For bounded lattices, we introduce certain Galois connections, called (cyclically) essential, retractable and UC Galois connections, which behave well with respect to concepts of module-theoretic nature involving essentiality. We show that essential retractable Galois connections preserve uniform dimension, whereas essential retractable UC Galois connections induce a bijective correspondence between sets of closed elements. Our results are applied to suitable Galois connections between submodule lattices. Cyclically essential Galois connections unify semi-projective and semi-injective modules, while retractable Galois connections unify retractable and coretractable modules.
