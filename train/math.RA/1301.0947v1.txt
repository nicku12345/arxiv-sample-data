This paper gives an explicit structure theorem for the symmetric group acting on the symmetric algebra of its natural module. Let G be the symmetric group on x_1,..., x_n and let d_i be the i^{\text{th}} elementary symmetric polynomial in the x_i's. We show that if we take monomial representations discussed in \cite[Section 3]{Kemper} to be the modules V_I, then we have an isomorphism of kG-modules k[x_1,..., x_n] \cong \Oplus_{\{n\} \subseteq I \subseteq [n]} k[d_I] \otimes_k V_I.
