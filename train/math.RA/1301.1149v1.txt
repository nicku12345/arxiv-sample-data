We report on some computations with nilpotent orbits in simple Lie algebras of exceptional type within the SLA package of GAP4. Concerning reachable nilpotent orbits our computations firstly confirm the classification of such orbits in Lie algebras of exceptional type by Elashvili and Grelaud, secondly they answer a question by Panyushev, and thirdly they show in what way a recent result of Yakimova for the Lie algebras of classical type extends to the exceptional types. The second topic of this note concerns abelianizations of centralizers of nilpotent elements. We give tables with their dimensions.
