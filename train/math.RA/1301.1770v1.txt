We describe an algorithm for obtaining generators of the unit group of the integral group ring ZG of a finite abelian group G. We used our implementation in Magma of this algorithm to compute the unit groups of ZG for G of order up to 110. In particular for those cases we obtained the index of the group of Hoechsmann units in the full unit group. At the end of the paper we describe an algorithm for the more general problem of finding generators of an arithmetic group corresponding to a diagonalizable algebraic group.
