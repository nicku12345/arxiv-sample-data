We investigate endomorphism semirings of a finite semilattice with one least element and one greatest element such that all the other elements form an antichain. We construct some new finite simple semirings. Keywords: endomorphism semiring, additively idempotent semiring, simple semiring, idempotent endomorphism, finite semilattice.
