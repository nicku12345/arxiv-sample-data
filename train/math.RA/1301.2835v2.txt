It was shown by Bergman that the Jacobson radical of a Z-graded ring is homogeneous. This paper shows that the analogous result holds for nil rings, namely, that the nil radical of a Z-graded ring is homogeneous.   It is obvious that a subring of a nil ring is nil, but generally a subring of a Jacobson radical ring need not be a Jacobson radical ring. In this paper it is shown that every subring which is generated by homogeneous elements in a graded Jacobson radical ring is always a Jacobson radical ring. It is also observed that a ring whose all subrings are Jacobson radical rings is nil. Some new results on graded-nil rings are also obtained.
