Suppose that a Lie algebra L admits a finite Frobenius group of automorphisms FH with cyclic kernel F and complement H such that the characteristic of the ground field does not divide |H|. It is proved that if the subalgebra C_L(F) of fixed points of the kernel has finite dimension m and the subalgebra C_L(H) of fixed points of the complement is nilpotent of class c, then L has a nilpotent subalgebra of finite codimension bounded in terms of m, c, |H|, and |F| whose nilpotency class is bounded in terms of only |H| and c. Examples show that the condition of the kernel F being cyclic is essential.
