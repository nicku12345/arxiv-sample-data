Suppose f:S \rightarrow R is a ring homomorphism such that f[S]  is contained in the center of R. We study the connections between chains in \text{Spec} (S) and chains in \text{Spec} (R). We focus on the properties LO (lying over), INC (incomparability), GD (going down), GU (going up) and SGB (strong going between). %we define the notion \mathcal D-chain which is a chain \mathcal C \subseteq \text{Spec} (S) such that for all Q \in \mathcal C, f^{-1}[Q] \in \mathcal D. We provide a sufficient condition for every maximal chain in \text{Spec} (R) to cover a maximal chain in \text{Spec} (S). We prove some necessary and sufficient conditions for f to satisfy each of the properties GD, GU and SGB, in terms of maximal \mathcal D-chains, where \mathcal D \subseteq \text{Spec} (S) is a nonempty chain. We show that if f satisfies all of the properties above, then every maximal \mathcal D-chain is a perfect maximal cover of \mathcal D. Our main result is Corollary \ref{equivalent conditions}, in which we give equivalent conditions for the following property: for every chain \mathcal D \subseteq {\text Spec} (S) and for every maximal \mathcal D-chain \mathcal C \subseteq {\text Spec} (R), \mathcal C and \mathcal D are of the same cardinality.
