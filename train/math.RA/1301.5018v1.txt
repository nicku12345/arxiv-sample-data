In this paper, the Composition-Diamond lemma for commutative algebras with multiple operators is established. As applications, the Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases and linear bases of free commutative Rota-Baxter algebra, free commutative \lambda-differential algebra and free commutative \lambda-differential Rota-Baxter algebra are given, respectively. Consequently, these three free algebras are constructed directly by commutative \Omega-words.
