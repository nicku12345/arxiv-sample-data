Quaternionic polynomials are generated by quaternionic variables and the quaternionic product. This paper proposes the generating ideal of quaternionic polynomials in tensor algebra, finds the Groebner base of the ideal in the case of pure imaginary quaternionic variables, and describes the normal forms of such quaternionic polynomials explicitly.
