A new model, in terms of finite bipartite graphs, of the free pseudosemilattice is presented. This will then be used to obtain several results about the variety SPS of all strict pseudosemilattices: (i) an identity basis for SPS is found, (ii) SPS is shown to be inherently non-finitely based, (iii) SPS is shown to have no irredundant identity basis, and (iv) SPS is shown to have no covers and to be meet-prime in the lattice of all varieties of pseudosemilattices. Some applications to e-varieties of locally inverse semigroups are also derived.
