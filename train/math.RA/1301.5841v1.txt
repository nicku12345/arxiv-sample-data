It is proved, among other results, that a prime right nonsingular ring (in particular, a simple ring) R is right self-injective if R_R is invariant under automorphisms of its injective hull. This answers two questions raised by Singh and Srivastava, and Clark and Huynh. An example is given to show that this conclusion no longer holds when prime ring is replaced by semiprime ring in the above assumption. Also shown is that automorphism-invariant modules are precisely pseudo-injective modules, answering a recent question of Lee and Zhou. Furthermore, rings whose cyclic modules are automorphism-invariant are investigated.
