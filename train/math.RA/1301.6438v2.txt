In order to study the structure of A^+(B_n) -- the affine near-semiring over a Brandt semigroup -- this work completely characterizes the Green's classes of its semigroup reducts. In this connection, this work characterizes the elements of A^+(B_n) and reports the size of A^+(B_n). Further, idempotents and regular elements of the semigroup reducts of A^+(B_n) have also been characterized and studied some relevant semigroups in A^+(B_n).
