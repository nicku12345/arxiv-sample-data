The Drazin inverse solutions of the matrix equations {\rm {\bf A}}{\rm {\bf X}} = {\rm {\bf B}}, {\rm {\bf X}}{\rm {\bf A}} = {\rm {\bf B}} and {\rm {\bf A}}{\rm {\bf X}}{\rm {\bf B}} ={\rm {\bf D}}  are considered in this paper. We use both the determinantal representations of the Drazin inverse obtained earlier by the author and in the paper. We get analogs of the Cramer rule for the Drazin inverse solutions of these matrix equations and using their for determinantal representations of solutions of some differential matrix equations, {\bf X}'+ {\bf A}{\bf X}={\bf B} and {\bf X}'+{\bf X}{\bf A}={\bf B}, where the matrix {\bf A} is singular.
