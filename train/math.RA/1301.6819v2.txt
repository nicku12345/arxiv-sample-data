For a regular multiplier Hopf algebra A, the Yetter-Drinfel'd module category {}_{A}\mathcal{YD}^{A} is equivalent to the centre Z({}_{A}\mathcal{M}) of the unital left A-module category {}_{A}\mathcal{M}. Then we introduce the generalized (\alpha, \beta)-Yetter-Drinfel'd module categories {}_{A}\mathcal{GYD}^{A}(\alpha, \beta), which are treated as components of a braided T-category. Especially when A is a coFrobenius Hopf algebra, {}_{A}\mathcal{YD}^{A}(\alpha, \beta) is isomorphic to the unital \hat{A} \bowtie A(\alpha, \beta)-module category {}_{\hat{A} \bowtie A(\alpha, \beta)}\mathcal{M}. Finally for a Yetter-Drinfel'd A-module algebra H, we introduce Yetter-Drinfel'd (H, A)-module category, which is a monoidal.
