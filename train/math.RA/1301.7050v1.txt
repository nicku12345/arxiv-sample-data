Let M be a left R-module and \pazocal{A}=\{A\}_{A\in\pazocal{A}} be a family of some submodules of M. It is introduced the classes of (strongly) M-\pazocal{A}-\mathrm{injective} and (strongly) M-\pazocal{A}-\mathrm{flat} modules which are denoted by (S) M-\pazocal{A}I and (S) M-\pazocal{A}F, respectively. It is obtained some characterizations of these classes and the relationships between these classes. Moreover it is investigated (S) M-\pazocal{A}I and (S) M-\pazocal{A}F precovers and preenvelopes of modules. It is also studied \pazocal{A}-coherent, F\pazocal{A} and P\pazocal{A} modules. Finally more generally we give the characterization of S-\pazocal{A}I(F) modules where \pazocal{A}=\{A\}_{A\in\pazocal{A}} is a family of some left R-modules.
