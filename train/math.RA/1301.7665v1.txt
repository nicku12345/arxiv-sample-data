This paper is a contribution to the development of the non associative algebras theory. More precisely, this work deals with the classification of the complex 4-dimensional Leibniz algebras. Note that the classification of 4-dimensional nilpotent complex Leibniz algebras was obtained in [1]. Therefore we will only consider non nilpotent case in this work.
