The existence of a well-behaved dimension of a finite von Neumann algebra (see [19]) has lead to the study of such a dimension of finite Baer *-rings (see [26]) that satisfy certain *-ring axioms (used in [9]). This dimension is closely related to the equivalence relation \sim^{*} on projections defined by p\sim^{*} q iff p=xx^* and q=x^*x for some x. However, the equivalence \sim^{a} on projections (or, in general, idempotents) defined by p\sim^{a} q iff p=xy and q=yx for some x and y, can also be relevant. There were attempts to unify the two approaches (see [10]).   In this work, our agenda is three-fold: (1) We study assumptions on a ring with involution that guarantee the existence of a well-behaved dimension defined for any general equivalence relation on projections \sim. (2) By interpreting \sim as \sim^{a}, we prove the existence of a well-behaved dimension of strongly semihereditary rings with a positive definite involution. This class is wider than the class of finite Baer *-rings with dimension considered in the past: it includes some non Rickart *-rings. Moreover, none of the *-ring axioms from [9] and [26] are assumed. (3) As the first corollary of (2), we obtain dimension of noetherian Leavitt path algebras over positive definite fields. Secondly, we obtain dimension of a Baer *-ring R satisfying the first seven axioms from [26] (in particular, dimension of finite AW^*-algebras). Assuming the eight axiom as well, R has dimension for \sim^{*} also and the two dimensions coincide.
