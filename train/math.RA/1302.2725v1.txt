Let R be an arbitrary ring with identity and M a right R-module with S= End_R(M). Let Z_2(M) be the second singular submodule of M. In this paper, we define Goldie Rickart modules by utilizing the endomorphisms of a module. The module M is called Goldie Rickart if for any f\in S, f^{-1}(Z_2(M)) is a direct summand of M. We provide several characterizations of Goldie Rickart modules and study their properties. Also we present that semisimple rings and right \Sigma-t-extending rings admit some characterizations in terms of Goldie Rickart modules.
