For an efficient implementation of Buchberger's Algorithm, it is essential to avoid the treatment of as many unnecessary critical pairs or obstructions as possible. In the case of the commutative polynomial ring, this is achieved by the Gebauer-Moeller criteria. Here we present an adaptation of the Gebauer-Moeller criteria for non-commutative polynomial rings, i.e. for free associative algebras over fields. The essential idea is to detect unnecessary obstructions using other obstructions with or without overlap. Experiments show that the new criteria are able to detect almost all unnecessary obstructions during the execution of Buchberger's procedure.
