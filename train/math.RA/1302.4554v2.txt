In this paper, we give an expansion of two notions of double extension and T^*-extension for quadratic and odd quadratic Lie superalgebras. Also, we provide a classification of quadratic and odd quadratic Lie superalgebras up to dimension 6. This classification is considered up to isometric isomorphism, mainly in the solvable case and the obtained Lie superalgebras are indecomposable.
