We explicitly compute the automorphism group of the large N = 4 conformal superalgebra and classify the twisted loop conformal superalgebras based on the large N = 4 conformal superalgebra. By considering the corresponding superconformal Lie algebras, we validate the existence of only two (up to isomorphism) such algebras as described in the Physics literature.
