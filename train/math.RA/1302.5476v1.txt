Malcev dialgebras have been introduced recently by Bremner, Peresi and S\'anchez-Ortega. In the present paper, we continue their study by introducing the notion of the generalized alternative di-nucleus of a 0-dialgebra. A general conjecture about the speciality of Malcev dialgebras in terms of this di-nucleus is formulated. In the last section, we introduce the appropriate generalization of the associative nucleus for dialgebras, and prove an analogue of Kleinfeld's theorem for the setting of dialgebras.
