Let L be a restricted Lie superalgebra with its restricted enveloping algebra u(L) over a field F of characteristic p>2. A polynomial identity is called non-matrix if it is not satisfied by the algebra of 2\times 2 matrices over F. We characterize L when u(L) satisfies a non-matrix polynomial identity.
