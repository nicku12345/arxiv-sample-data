In this paper, we describe the structure of the localization of Ext^{i}_{R}(R/P,M), where P is a prime ideal and M is a module, at certain Ore sets X. We first study the situation for FBN rings, and then consider matters for a large class of Auslander-Gorenstein rings. We need to impose suitable homological regularity conditions to get results in the more general situation. The results obtained are then used to study the shape of minimal injective resolutions of modules over noetherian rings.
