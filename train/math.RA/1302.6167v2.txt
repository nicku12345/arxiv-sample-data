We prove an equivalent condition for the existence of a link between prime ideals in terms of the structure of a certain cohomology module. We use this formulation to answer an open question regarding the nature of module extensions over one sided noetherian rings. We apply the techniques developed in this paper to the local link structure of prime ideals of small homological height and examine when certain noetherian rings satisfy the density condition.
