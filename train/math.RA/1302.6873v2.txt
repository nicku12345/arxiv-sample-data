An element a of a ring R is called \emph{quasipolar} provided that there exists an idempotent p\in R such that p\in comm^2(a), a+p\in U(R) and ap\in R^{qnil}. A ring R is \emph{quasipolar} in case every element in R is quasipolar. In this paper, we determine conditions under which subrings of 3\times 3 matrix rings over local rings are quasipolar. Namely, if R is a bleached local ring, then we prove that \mathcal{T}_3(R) is quasipolar if and only if R is uniquely bleached. Furthermore, it is shown that T_n(R) is quasipolar if and only if T_n\big(R[[x]]\big) is quasipolar for any positive integer n.
