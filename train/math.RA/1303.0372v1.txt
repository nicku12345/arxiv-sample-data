In this paper, we mainly study Jordan derivations of dual extension algebras and those of generalized one-point extension algebras. It is shown that every Jordan derivation of dual extension algebras is a derivation. As applications, we obtain that every Jordan generalized derivation and every generalized Jordan derivation on dual extension algebras are both generalized derivations. For generalized one-point extension algebras, it is proved that under certain conditions, each Jordan derivation of them is the sum of a derivation and an anti-derivation.
