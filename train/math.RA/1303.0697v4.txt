We introduce the new notion of general bilinear forms (generalizing sesquilinear forms) and prove that for every ring R (not necessarily commutative, possibly without involution) and every right R-module M which is a generator (i.e. R_R is a summand of M^n for some n\in\N), there is a one-to-one correspondence between the anti-automorphisms of \End(M) and the general regular bilinear forms on M, considered up to similarity. This generalizes a well-known similar correspondence in the case R is a field. We also demonstrate that there is no such correspondence for arbitrary R-modules.   We use the generalized correspondence to show that there is a canonical set isomorphism between the orbits of the left action of \Inn(R) on the anti-automorphisms of R and the orbits of the left action of \Inn(M_n(R)) on the anti-automorphisms of M_n(R), provided R_R is the only right R-module N satisfying N^n\cong R^n. We also prove a variant of a theorem of Osborn. Namely, we classify all semisimple rings with involution admitting no non-trivial idempotents that are invariant under the involution.
