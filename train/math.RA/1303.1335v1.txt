We study and classify Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension five with two generators under an additional \mathbb Z^2-grading by Hilbert driven Gr\"{o}bner basis computations. All the algebras we obtained are strongly noetherian, Auslander regular, and Cohen-Macaulay. One of the results provides an answer to Fl{\o}ystad-Vatne's question in the context of \mathbb Z^2-grading. Our results also achieve a connection between Lyndon words and Artin-Schelter regular algebras.
