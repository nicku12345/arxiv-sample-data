An element a of a ring R is called \emph{quasipolar} provided that there exists an idempotent p\in R such that p\in comm^2(a), a+p\in U(R) and ap\in R^{qnil}. A ring R is \emph{quasipolar} in case every element in R is quasipolar. In this paper, we investigate quasipolarity of generalized matrix rings K_s (R) for a commutative local ring R and s\in R. We show that if s is nilpotent, then K_s(R) is quasipolar. We determine the conditions under which elements of K_s (R) are quasipolar. It is shown that K_s(R) is quasipolar if and only if tr(A)\in J(R) or the equation x^2-tr(A)x+det_s(A)=0 is solvable in R for every A\in K_s(R) with det_s(A)\in J(R). Furthermore, we prove that M_2(R) is quasipolar if and only if M_2(R) is strongly clean for a commutative local ring R.
