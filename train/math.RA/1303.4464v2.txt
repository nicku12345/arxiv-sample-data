In a 1998 paper with H. Lakser, the authors proved that every finite distributive lattice D can be represented as the congruence lattice of a finite \emph{semimodular lattice}.   Some ten years later, the first author and E. Knapp proved a much stronger result, proving the representation theorem for \emph{rectangular lattices}.   In this note we present a short proof of these results.
