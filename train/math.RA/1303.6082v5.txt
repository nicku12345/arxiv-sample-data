In the current article we study structure of a Chevalley group G(R) over a commutative ring R. We generalize and improve the following results: (1) standard, relative, and multi-relative commutator formulas; (2) nilpotent structure of [relative] K_1; (3) bounded word length of commutators. To this end we enlarge the elementary group, construct a generic element for the extended elementary group, and use localization in the universal ring. The key step is a construction of a generic element for a principle congruence subgroup, corresponding to a principle ideal.
