Warfield proved that every injective module has the exchange property. This was generalized by Fuchs who showed that quasi-injective modules satisfy the exchange property. We extend this further and prove that a module invariant under automorphisms of its injective hull satisfies the exchange property. We also show that automorphism-invariant modules are clean and that directly-finite automorphism-invariant modules satisfy the internal cancellation and hence the cancellation property.
