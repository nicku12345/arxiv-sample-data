We study \mathbb H-perfect pseudo MV-algebras, that is, algebras which can be split into a system of ordered slices indexed by the elements of an subgroup \mathbb H of the group of the real numbers. We show when they can be represented as a lexicographic product of \mathbb H with some \ell-group. In addition, we show also a categorical equivalence of this category with the category of \ell-groups.
