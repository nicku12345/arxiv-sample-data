Hom-alternative, Hom-Malcev and Hom-Jordan superalgebras are \mathbb{Z}_{2}-graded generalizations of Hom-alternative, Hom-Malcev and Hom-Jordan algebras, which are Hom-type generalizations of alternative, Malcev and Jordan algebras. In this paper we prove that Hom-alternative superalgebras are Hom-Malcev-admissible and are also Hom-Jordan-admissible. Home-type generalizations of some well known identities in alternative superalgebras, including the \mathbb{Z}_{2}-graded Bruck-Kleinfled function are obtained.
