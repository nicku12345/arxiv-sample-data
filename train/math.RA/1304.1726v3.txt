We study the Hopf algebra H of Fliess operators coming from Control Theory in the one-dimensional case. We prove that it admits a graded, finte-dimensional, connected gradation. Dually, the vector space IR is both a pre-Lie algebra for the pre-Lie product dual of the coproduct of H, and an associative, commutative algebra for the shuffle product. These two structures admit a compatibility which makes IR a Com-pre-Lie algebra. We give a presentation of this object as a Com-pre-Lie algebra and as a pre-Lie algebra.
