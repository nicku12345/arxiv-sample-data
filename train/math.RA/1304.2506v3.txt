Let (A_i)_{0\leq i\leq k} be generic matrices over \mathbb{Q}, the field of rational numbers. Let K=\mathbb{Q}(E), where E denotes the entries of the (A_i)_i, and let \overline{K} be the algebraic closure of K. We show that the generic unilateral equation A_kX^k+\cdots+A_1X+A_0=0_n has \binom{nk}{n} solutions X\in\mathcal{M}_n(\overline{K}). Solving the previous equation is equivalent to solving a polynomial of degree kn, with Galois group S_{kn} over K. Let (B_i)_{i\leq k} be fixed n\times n matrices with entries in a field L. We show that, for a generic C\in\mathcal{M}_n(L), a polynomial equation g(B_1,\cdots,B_k,X)=C admits a finite fixed number of solutions and these solutions are simple. We study, when n=2, the generic non-unilateral equations X^2+BXC+D=0_2 and X^2+BXB+C=0_2. We consider the unilateral equation X^k+C_{k-1}X^{k-1}+\cdots+C_1X+C_0=0_n when the (C_i)_i are n\times n generic commuting matrices ; we show that every solution X\in\mathcal{M}_n(\overline{K}) commutes with the (C_i)_i. When n=2, we prove that the generic equation A_1XA_2X+XA_3X+X^2A_4+A_5X+A_6=0_2 admits 16 isolated solutions in \mathcal{M}_2(\overline{K}), that is, according to the B\'ezout's theorem, the maximum for a quadratic 2\times 2 matrix equation.
