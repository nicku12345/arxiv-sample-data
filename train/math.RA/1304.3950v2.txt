Let E be a field, p a prime number and F/E a finitely-generated extension of transcendency degree t. This paper shows that if the absolute Galois group \mathcal{G}_{E} is of nonzero cohomological p-dimension cd_{p}(E), then the field F has Brauer p-dimension Brd_{p}(F) \ge t except, possibly, in case p = 2, the Sylow pro-2-subgroups of \mathcal{G}_{E} are of order 2, and F is a nonreal field. It announces that Brd_{p}(F) is infinite whenever t \ge 1 and the absolute Brauer p-dimension abrd_{p}(E) is infinite; moreover, for each pair (m, n) of integers with 1 \le m \le n, there exists a central division F-algebra of exponent p ^{m} and Schur index p ^{n}.
