The maximal graded subalgebras for four families of Lie superalgebras of Cartan type over a field of prime characteristic are studied. All maximal reducible graded subalgebras are described completely and their isomorphism classes, dimension formulas are found. The classification of maximal irreducible graded subalgebras is reduced to the classification of the maximal irreducible subalgebras for the classical Lie superalgebras \frak{gl}(m,n), \frak{sl}(m,n) and \frak{osp}(m,n).
