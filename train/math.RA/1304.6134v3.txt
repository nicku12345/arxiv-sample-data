Quantum Drinfeld orbifold algebras are the generalizations of Drinfeld orbifold algebras, which are obtained by replacing polynomial rings by quantum polynomial rings. Shepler and Witherspoon in their paper, give necessary and sufficient conditions on a defining parameters to obtain Drinfeld orbifold algebras. In this article we generalize their result. It also simultaneously generalizes the result of Levandovskyy and Shepler about quantum Drinfeld Hecke algebras.
