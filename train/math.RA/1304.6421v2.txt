The Kumjian-Pask algebra of a higher-rank graph generalises the Leavitt path algebra of a directed graph. We extend the definition of Kumjian-Pask algebra to row-finite higher-rank graphs \Lambda with sources which satisfy a local-convexity condition. After proving versions of the graded-uniqueness theorem and the Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem, we study the Kumjian-Pask algebra of rank-2 Bratteli diagrams by studying certain finite subgraphs which are locally convex. We show that the desourcification procedure of Farthing and Webster yields a row-finite higher-rank graph \tilde{\Lambda} without sources such that the Kumjian-Pask algebras of \tilde{\Lambda} and \Lambda are Morita equivalent. We then use the Morita equivalence to study the ideal structure of the Kumjian-Pask algebra of \Lambda by pulling the appropriate results across the equivalence.
