In this paper we introduce the notion of cyclic (f(t),\sigma,\delta)-codes for f(t)\in \Ore. These codes generalize the \theta-codes as introduced by D. Boucher, F. Ulmer, W. Geiselmann \cite{BGU}. We construct generic and control matrices for these codes. As a particular case the (\si,\de)-W-code associated to a Wedderburn polynomial are defined and we show that their control matrices are given by generalized Vandermonde matrices. All the Wedderburn polynomials of \mathbb F_q[t;\theta] are described and their control matrices are presented. A key role will be played by the pseudo-linear transformations.
