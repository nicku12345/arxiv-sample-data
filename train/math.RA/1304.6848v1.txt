G\'amez-Merino, Munoz-Fern\'andez and Seoane-Sep\'ulveda proved that if additivity \mathcal A(\mathcal F)>\mathfrak c, then \mathcal F is \mathcal A(\mathcal F)-lineable where \mathcal F\subseteq\mathbb R^\mathbb R. They asked if \mathcal A(\mathcal F)>\mathfrak c can be weakened. We answer this question in negative. Moreover, we introduce and study the notions of homogeneous lineability number and lineability number of subsets of linear spaces.
