Let 3\leq m\leq n. We study typical ranks of m\times n\times ((m-1)n-1) tensors over the real number field. The number (m-1)n-1 is a minimal typical rank of m\times n\times ((m-1)n-1) tensors over the real number field. We show that a typical rank of m\times n\times ((m-1)n-1) tensors over the real number field is less than or equal to (m-1)n and in particular, m\times n\times ((m-1)n-1) tensors over the real number field has two typical ranks (m-1)n-1, (m-1)n if m\leq \rho(n), where \rho is the Hurwitz-Radon function defined as \rho(n)=2^b+8c for nonnegative integers a,b,c such that n=(2a+1)2^{b+4c} and 0\leq b<4.
