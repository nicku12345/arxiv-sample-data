In this paper, we introduce the notion of system of quotients of Lie triple systems and investigate some properties which can be lifted from a Lie triple system to its systems of quotients. We relate the notion of Lie triple system of Martindale-like quotients with respect to a filter of ideals and the notion of system of quotients, and prove that the system of quotients of a Lie triple system is equivalent to the algebra of quotients of a Lie algebra in some sense, and these allow us to construct the maximal system of quotients for nondegenerate Lie triple systems.
