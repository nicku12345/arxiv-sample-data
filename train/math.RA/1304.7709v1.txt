The purpose of this note is to present a proof of the existence of Gabor frames in general linear position in all finite dimensions. The tools developed in this note are also helpful towards an explicit construction of such a frame, which is carried out in the last section. This result has applications in signal recovery through erasure channels, operator identification, and time-frequency analysis.
