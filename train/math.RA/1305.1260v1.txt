In this paper, we present the structure of the group of *-unitary units in the group algebra FD_{2p}, where F is a finite field of characteristic p > 2, D_{2p} is the dihedral group of order 2p, and * is the canonical involution of the group algebra FD_{2p}. We also provide the structure of the maximal p-subgroup of the unit group \mathscr{U}(FD_{2p}) and compute a basis of its center.
