In this paper, we study the Poisson (co)homology of a Frobenius Poisson algebra. More precisely, we show that there exists a duality between the Poisson homology and the Poisson cohomology, similar to the duality between the Hochschild homology and the Hochschild cohomology of a Frobenius algebra. Using the non-degenerated bilinear form on a Frobenius algebra we construct a Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Poisson cohomology ring of a class of Frobenius Poisson algebras.
