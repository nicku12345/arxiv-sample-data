In this paper, we give the definition of {\em weakly locally finite} division rings and we show that the class of these rings strictly contains the class of locally finite division rings. Further, we study multiplicative subgroups in these rings. Some skew linear groups are also considered. Our new obtained results generalize previous results for centrally finite case.
