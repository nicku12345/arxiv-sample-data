We give Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases for Drinfeld-Kohno Lie algebra \textbf{L}_{n} in \cite{[Et]} and Kukin Lie algebra A_P in \cite{Kukin}, where P is a semigroup. As applications, we show that as \mathbb{Z}-module \textbf{L}_{n} is free and a \mathbb{Z}-basis of \textbf{L}_{n} is given. We give another proof of Kukin Theorem: if semigroup P has the undecidable word problem then the Lie algebra A_P has the same property.
