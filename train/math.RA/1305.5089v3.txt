A complex \omega-Lie algebra is a vector space L over the complex field, equipped with a skew symmetric bracket [-,-] and a bilinear form \omega such that [[x,y],z]+[[y,z],x]+ [[z,x],y]=\omega(x,y)z+\omega(y,z)x+\omega(z,x)y for all x,y,z\in L. The notion of \omega-Lie algebras, as a generalization of Lie algebras, was introduced in Nurowski \cite{Nur2007}. Fundamental results about finite-dimensional \omega-Lie algebras were developed by Zusmanovich \cite{Zus2010}. In \cite{Nur2007}, all three dimensional non-Lie real \omega-Lie algebras were classified. The purpose of this note is to provide an approach to classify all three dimensional non-Lie complex \omega-Lie algebras. Our method also gives a new proof of the classification in Nurowski \cite{Nur2007}.
