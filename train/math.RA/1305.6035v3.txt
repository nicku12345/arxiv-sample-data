The first part of the paper will describe a recent result of K. Retert in (\cite{Ret}) for k[x_1,\ldots,x_n] and k[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]. This result states that if \mathfrak{D} is a set of commute k-derivations of k[x,y] such that both \partial_x \in \mathfrak{D} and the ring is \mathfrak{D}-simple, then there is d \in \mathfrak{D} such that k[x,y] is \{\partial_x,d\}-simple. As applications, we obtain relationships with known results of A. Nowicki on commutative bases of derivations.
