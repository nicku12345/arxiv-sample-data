Let \alpha be an endomorphism of a ring R. We introduce the notion of weak \alpha-skew McCoy rings which are a generalization of the \alpha-skew McCoy rings and the weak McCo rings. Some properties of this generalization are established, and connections of properties of a weak \alpha-skew McCoy ring R with n\times n upper triangular T_n(R) are investigated. We study relationship between the weak skew McCoy property of a ring R and it's polynomial ring, R[x]. Among applications, we show that a number of interesting properties of a weak \alpha-skew McCoy ring R such as weak skew McCoy property in a ring R.
