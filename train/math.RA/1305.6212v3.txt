In this paper, we prove that for a given biquaternion algebra over a field of characteristic two, one can move from one symbol presentation to another by at most three steps, such that in each step at least one entry remains unchanged. If one requires that in each step two entries remain the same then their number increases to fifteen. We provide even more basic steps that in order to move from one symbol presentation to another one needs to use up to forty-five of them.
