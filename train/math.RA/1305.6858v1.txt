By a completely inverse AG^{**}-groupoid we mean an inverse AG^{**}-groupoid A satisfying the identity xx^{-1}=x^{-1}x, where x^{-1} denotes a unique element of A such that x=(xx^{-1})x and x^{-1}=(x^{-1}x)x^{-1}. We show that the set of all idempotents of such groupoid forms a semilattice and the Green's relations \mathcal{H,L, R,D} and \mathcal{J} coincide on A. The main result of this note says that any completely inverse AG^{**}-groupoid meets the famous Lallement's Lemma for regular semigroups. Finally, we show that the Green's relation \mathcal{H} is both the least semilattice congruence and the maximum idempotent-separating congruence on any completely inverse AG^{**}-groupoid.
