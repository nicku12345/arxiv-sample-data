We study an upper bound of ranks of n-tensors with size 2\times\cdots\times2 over the complex and real number field. We characterize a 2\times 2\times 2 tensor with rank 3 by using the Cayley's hyperdeterminant and some function. Then we see another proof of Brylinski's result that the maximal rank of 2\times2\times2\times2 complex tensors is 4. We state supporting evidence of the claim that 5 is a typical rank of 2\times2\times2\times2 real tensors. Recall that Kong and Jiang show that the maximal rank of 2\times2\times2\times2 real tensors is less than or equal to 5. The maximal rank of 2\times2\times2\times2 complex (resp. real) tensors gives an upper bound of the maximal rank of 2\times\cdots\times 2 complex (resp. real) tensors.
