A ring R is strongly clean provided that every element in R is the sum of an idempotent and a unit that commutate. Let T_n(R,\sigma) be the skew triangular matrix ring over a local ring R where \sigma is an endomorphism of R. We show that T_2(R,\sigma) is strongly clean if and only if for any a\in 1+J(R), b\in J(R), l_a-r_{\sigma(b)}: R\to R is surjective. Further, T_3(R,\sigma) is strongly clean if l_{a}-r_{\sigma(b)}, l_{a}-r_{\sigma^2(b)} and l_{b}-r_{\sigma(a)} are surjective for any a\in U(R),b\in J(R). The necessary condition for T_3(R,\sigma) to be strongly clean is also obtained.
