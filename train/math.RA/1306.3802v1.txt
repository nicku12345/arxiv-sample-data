In this paper we characterize the modules and the complexes involved in the dualities induced by a 1-cotilting bimodule in terms of a linear compactness condition. Our result generalizes the classical characterization of reflexive modules with respect to Morita dualities. The linear compactness notion considered, permits us to obtain finiteness properties of the rings and modules involved.
