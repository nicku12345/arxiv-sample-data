Let K be a unital associative and commutative ring and let K \langle X \rangle be the free unital associative K-algebra on a non-empty set X of free generators. Define a left-normed commutator [a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n] inductively by [a_1, a_2] = a_1 a_2 - a_2 a_1, [a_1, \dots , a_{n-1}, a_n] = [[a_1, \dots , a_{n-1}], a_n] (n \ge 3). For n \ge 2, let T^{(n)} be the two-sided ideal in K \langle X \rangle generated by all commutators [a_1,a_2, \dots , a_n] ( a_i \in K \langle X \rangle ).   It can be easily seen that the ideal T^{(2)} is generated (as a two-sided ideal in K \langle X \rangle) by the commutators [x_1, x_2] (x_i \in X). It is well-known that T^{(3)} is generated by the polynomials [x_1,x_2,x_3] and [x_1,x_2][x_3,x_4] + [x_1,x_3][x_2,x_4] (x_i \in X). A similar generating set for T^{(4)} contains 3 types of polynomials in x_i \in X if \frac{1}{3} \in K and 5 types if \frac{1}{3} \notin K. In the present article we exhibit a generating set for T^{(5)} that contains 8 types of polynomials in x_i \in X.
