In this article, we show that for a partial skew group ring R*G, where R is a commutative ring, each non-zero ideal of R*G intersects R non-trivially if and only if R is a maximal commutative subring of R*G. As a consequence, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for simplicity; the partial skew group ring R*G is simple if and only if R is a G-simple and maximal commutative subring of R*G. We thereby generalize our previous results for skew group rings, to partial skew group rings which are not necessarily unital.
