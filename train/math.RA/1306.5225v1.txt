The algebra of n\times n matrices over a field F has a natural \mathbb{Z}_n-grading. Its graded identities have been described by Vasilovsky who extended a previous work of Di Vincenzo for the algebra of 2\times 2 matrices. In this paper we study the graded identities of block-triangular matrices with the grading inherited by the grading of M_n(F). We show that its graded identities follow from the graded identities of M_n(F) and from its monomial identities of degree up to 2n-2. In the case of blocks of sizes n-1 and 1, we give a complete description of its monomial identities, and exhibit a minimal basis for its T_{\mathbb{Z}_n}-ideal.
