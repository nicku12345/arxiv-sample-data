We investigate projective covers of cyclically presented modules, characterizing the rings over which every cyclically presented module has a projective cover as the rings R that are Von Neumann regular modulo their Jacobson radical J(R) and in which idempotents can be lifted modulo J(R). Cyclically presented modules naturally appear in the study of factorizations of elements in non-necessarily commutative integral domains. One of the possible applications is to the modules M_R whose endomorphism ring E:=(M_R) is Von Neumann regular modulo J(E) and in which idempotents lift modulo J(E).
