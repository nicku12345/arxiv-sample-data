In this note, we compute the order and provide the structure of the unit group \mathcal{U}(FD_{2p^m}) of the group algebra FD_{2p^m}, where F is a finite field of characteristic 2 and D_{2p^m} is the dihedral group of order 2p^m such that p is an odd prime. Further, we obtain the structure of the unitary subgroup \mathcal{U}_*(FD_{2p^m}) with respect to canonical involution * and prove that it is a normal subgroup of the unit group \mathcal{U}(FD_{2p^m}).
