In this paper, the notion of strongly G_C-projective and injective modules is introduced, where C is a semidualizing module. Using these modules we can obtain a new characterization of G_C-projective and injective modules, similar to the one of projective modules by the free modules. We then define and study the global dimensions of rings relative to a semidualizing module C, and prove that the global G_C-projective dimension of a ring R is equal to the global G_C-injective dimension of R.
