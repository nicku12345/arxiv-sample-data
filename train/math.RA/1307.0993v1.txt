In the present paper we study some algebraic properties of evolution algebras. Moreover, we reduce the study of evolution algebras of permutations to two special types of evolution algebras, idempotents and absolute nilpotent elements of the algebra. We study three-dimensional evolution algebras whose each element of evolution basis has infinite period. In addition, for an evolution algebra with some properties we describe its associative enveloping algebra.
