Let A be a centrally closed prime algebra over a characteristic 0 field k, and let q:A\to A be the trace of a d-linear map (i.e., q(x)=M(x,...,x) where M:A^d\to A is a d-linear map). If [q(x),x]=0 for every x\in A, then q is of the form q(x) =\sum_{i=0}^{d} \mu_i(x)x^i where each \mu_i is the trace of a (d-i)-linear map from A into k. For infinite dimensional algebras and algebras of dimension >d^2 this was proved by Lee, Lin, Wang, and Wong in 1997. In this paper we cover the remaining case where the dimension is  \le d^2. Using this result we are able to handle general functional identities of one variable on A; more specifically, we describe the traces of d-linear maps q_i:A\to A that satisfy \sum_{i=0}^m x^i q_i(x)x^{m-i}\in k for every x\in A.
