Denote by M_n(K) the algebra of n by n matrices with entries in the field K. A theorem of Albert and Muckenhoupt states that every trace zero matrix of M_n(K) can be expressed as AB-BA for some pair (A,B) of matrices of M_n(K). Assuming that n>2 and that K has more than 3 elements, we prove that the matrices A and B can be required to belong to an arbitrary given hyperplane of M_n(K).
