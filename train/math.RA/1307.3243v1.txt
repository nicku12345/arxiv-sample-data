In this paper some results on the Lie structure of prime superalgebras are discussed. We prove that, with the exception of some special cases, for a prime superalgebra, A, over a ring of scalars \Phi with 1/2\in \Phi, if L is a Lie ideal of A and W is a subalgebra of A such that [W, L]\subseteq W, then either L\subseteq Z or W\subseteq Z. Likewise, if V is a submodule of A and [V, L]\subseteq V, then either V\subseteq Z or L\subseteq Z or there exists an ideal of A, M, such that 0\not= [M,A]\subseteq V. This work extends to prime superalgebras some results of I. N. Herstein, C. Lanski and S. Montgomery on prime algebras.
