Maps that preserve adjacency on the set of all invertible hermitian matrices over a finite field are characterized. It is shown that such maps form a group that is generated by the maps A\mapsto PAP^{\ast}, A\mapsto A^{\sigma}, and A\mapsto A^{-1}, where P is an invertible matrix, P^{\ast} is its conjugate transpose, and \sigma is an automorphism of the underlying field. Bijectivity of maps is not an assumption but a conclusion. Moreover, adjacency is assumed to be preserved in one directions only.   The main result and author's previous result [16] are applied to characterize maps that preserve the `speed of light' on (a) finite Minkowski space-time and (b) the complement of the light cone in finite Minkowski space-time.
