In this article, we investigate additive properties of the Drazin inverse of elements in rings and algebras over an arbitrary field. Under the weakly commutative condition of ab = \lambda ba, we show that a-b is Drazin invertible if and only if aa^{D}(a-b)bb^{D} is Drazin invertible. Next, we give explicit representations of (a+b)^{D}, as a function of a, b, a^{D} and b^{D}, under the conditions a^{3}b = ba and b^{3}a = ab.
