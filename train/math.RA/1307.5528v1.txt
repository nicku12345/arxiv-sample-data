In [Comput. Math. Appl. 59 (2010) 764-778], Baksalary and Trenkler characterized some complex idempotent matrices of the form (I-PQ)^{\dag}P(I-Q), (I-QP)^{\dag}(I-Q) and P(P+Q-QP)^{\dag} in terms of the column spaces and null spaces of P and Q, where P, Q\in \mathbb{C}^{\textsf{OP}}_n = \{L\in \mathbb{C}_{n,n}\ |\ L^2 = L = L^*\}. We generalize these results from \mathbb{C}_{n,n} to any *-reducing rings.
