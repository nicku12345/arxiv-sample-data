We study the Drazin inverses of the sum and product of two elements in a ring. For Drazin invertible elements a and b such that a^2b=aba and b^2a=bab, it is shown that ab is Drazin invertible and that a+b is Drazin invertible if and only if 1+a^Db is Drazin invertible. Moreover, the formulae of (ab)^D and (a+b)^D are presented. Thus, a generalization of the main result of Zhuang, Chen et al. (Linear Multilinear Algebra 60 (2012) 903-910) is given.
