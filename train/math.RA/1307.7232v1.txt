We study properties of pseudo Drazin inverse in a Banach algebra with unity 1. If ab=ba and a,b are pseudo Drazin invertible, we prove that a+b is pseudo Drazin invertible if and only if 1+a^\ddag b is pseudo Drazin invertible. Moreover, the formula of (a+b)^\ddag is presented . When the commutative condition is weaken to ab=\lambda ba ~(\lambda \neq 0), we also show that a-b is pseudo Drazin invertible if and only if aa^\ddag(a-b)bb^\ddag is pseudo Drazin invertible.
