A ring R is uniquely (strongly) clean provided that for any a\in R there exists a unique idempotent e\in R \big(\in comm(a)\big) such that a-e\in U(R). Let R be a uniquely bleached ring. We prove, in this note, that R is uniquely clean if and only if R is abelian, and T_n(R) is uniquely strongly clean for all n\geq 1, if and only if R is abelian, T_n(R) is uniquely strongly clean for some n\geq 1. In the commutative case, the more explicit results are obtained. These also generalize the main theorems in [6] and [7], and provide many new class of such rings.
