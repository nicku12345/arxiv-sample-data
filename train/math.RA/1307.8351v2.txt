A commutative ring R is projective free provided that every finitely generated R-module is free. An element in a ring is strongly clean provided that it is the sum of an idempotent and a unit that commutates. Let R be a projective-free ring, and let h\in R[t] be a monic polynomial of degree n. We prove, in this article, that every \varphi\in M_n(R) with characteristic polynomial h is strongly clean, if and only if the companion matrix C_h of h is strongly clean, if and only if there exists a factorization h=h_0h_1 such that h_0\in {\Bbb S}_0, h_1\in {\Bbb S}_1 and (h_0,h_1)=1. Matrices over power series over projective rings are also discussed. These extend the known results [1, Theorem 12] and [5, Theorem 25].
