For a slim, planar, semimodular lattice L and covering square~S, G.~Cz\'edli and E.\,T.~Schmidt introduced the fork extension, L[S], which is also a slim, planar, semimodular lattice. We investigate when a congruence of L extends to L[S].   We introduce a join-irreducible congruence \boldsymbol{\gamma}(S) of L[S]. We determine when it is new, in the sense that it is not generated by a join-irreducible congruence of L. When it is new, we describe the congruence \boldsymbol{\gamma}(S) in great detail. The main result follows: \emph{In the order of join-irreducible congruences of a slim, planar, semimodular lattice L, the congruence \boldsymbol{\gamma}(S) has \emph{at most two covers.}}
