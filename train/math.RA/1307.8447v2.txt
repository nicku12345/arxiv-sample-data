All solvable Lie algebras with Heisenberg nilradical have already been classified. We extend this result to a classification of solvable Leibniz algebras with Heisenberg nilradical. As an example, we show the complete classification of all real or complex Leibniz algebras whose nilradical is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg algebra.
