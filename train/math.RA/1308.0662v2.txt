It was recently proved that a compact set X\subseteq \mathbb R^2 has an outgoing Severi-Bouligand tangent vector u\not=0 at x\in X iff some principal ideal of the Riesz space \mathcal R(X) of piecewise linear functions on X is not an intersection of maximal ideals. "Outgoing" means X\cap [x,x+u]=\{x\}.   Suppose now X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n and some principal ideal of \mathcal R(X) is not an intersection of maximal ideals. We prove that this is equivalent to saying that X contains a sequence \{x_i\} whose Frenet k-frame (u_1,\ldots,u_k) is an outgoing Severi-Bouligand tangent of X. When the \{x_i\} are taken as sample points of a smooth curve \gamma, the Frenet k-frames of \{x_i\} and of \gamma coincide. The computation of Frenet frames via sample sequences does not require the knowledge of any higher-order derivative of \gamma.
