A ring R is called right (small) dual if every (small) right ideal of R is a right annihilator. Left (small) dual rings can be defined similarly. And a ring R is called (small) dual if R is left and right (small) dual. It is proved that R is a dual ring if and only if R is a semilocal and small dual ring. Several known results are generalized and properties of small dual rings are explored. As applications, some characterizations of QF rings are obtained through small dualities of rings.
