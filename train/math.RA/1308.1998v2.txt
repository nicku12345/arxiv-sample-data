We investigate when a skew polynomial extension T = R[x; {\sigma}, {\delta}] of a Hopf algebra R admits a Hopf algebra structure, substantially generalising a theorem of Panov. When this construction is applied iteratively in characteristic 0 one obtains a large family of connected noetherian Hopf algebras of finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, including for example all enveloping algebras of finite dimensional solvable Lie algebras and all coordinate rings of unipotent groups. The properties of these Hopf algebras are investigated.
