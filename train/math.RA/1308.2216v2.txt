We develop a ring-theoretic approach for blowing up many noncommutative projective surfaces. Let T be an elliptic algebra (meaning that, for some central element g of degree 1, T/gT is a twisted homogeneous coordinate ring of an elliptic curve E at an infinite order automorphism). Given an effective divisor d on E whose degree is not too big, we construct a blowup T(d) of T at d and show that it is also an elliptic algebra. Consequently it has many good properties: for example, it is strongly noetherian, Auslander-Gorenstein, and has a balanced dualizing complex. We also show that the ideal structure of T(d) is quite rigid. Our results generalise those of the first author. In the companion paper "Classifying Orders in the Sklyanin Algebra", we apply our results to classify orders in (a Veronese subalgebra of) a generic cubic or quadratic Sklyanin algebra.
