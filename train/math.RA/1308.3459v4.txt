We show that if R is a, not necessarily unital, ring graded by a semigroup G equipped with an idempotent e such that G is cancellative at e, the non-zero elements of eGe form a hypercentral group and R_e has a non-zero idempotent f, then R is simple if and only if it is graded simple and the center of the corner subring f R_{eGe} f is a field. This is a generalization of a result of E. Jespers' on the simplicity of a unital ring graded by a hypercentral group. We apply our result to partial skew group rings and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the simplicity of a, not necessarily unital, partial skew group ring by a hypercentral group. Thereby, we generalize a very recent result of D. Gon\c{c}alves'. We also point out how E. Jespers' result immediately implies a generalization of a simplicity result, recently obtained by A. Baraviera, W. Cortes and M. Soares, for crossed products by twisted partial actions.
