We show that Artin-Schelter regularity of a \mathbb{Z}-graded algebra can be examined by its associated \mathbb{Z}^r-graded algebra. We prove that there is exactly one class of four-dimensional Artin-Schelter regular algebras with two generators of degree one in the Jordan case. This class is strongly noetherian, Auslander regular, and Cohen-Macaulay. Their automorphisms and point modules are described.
