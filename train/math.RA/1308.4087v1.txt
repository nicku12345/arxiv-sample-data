This work investigates the rank properties of A^+(B_n), the additive semigroup reduct of affine near-semiring over Brandt semigroup B_n. In this connection, this work reports the ranks r_1, r_2, r_3 and r_5 of A^+(B_n) and identifies a lower bound for the upper rank r_4(A^+(B_n)). While this lower bound is found to be the r_4(A^+(B_n)) for n \ge 6, in other cases where 2 \le n \le 5, the upper rank of A^+(B_n) is still open for investigation.
