An element a of a ring R is called \emph{strongly J-clean} provided that there exists an idempotent e\in R such that a-e\in J(R) and ae=ea. A ring R is \emph{strongly J-clean} in case every element in R is strongly J-clean. In this paper, we investigate strong J-cleanness of M_2(R;s) for a local ring R and s\in R. We determine the conditions under which elements of M_2(R;s) are strongly J-clean.
