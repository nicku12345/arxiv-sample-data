Let \mathbb Z \langle X \rangle be the free unital associative ring freely generated by an infinite countable set X = \{ x_1,x_2, \dots \}. Define a left-normed commutator [x_1,x_2, \dots, x_n] by [a,b] = ab - ba, [a,b,c] = [[a,b],c]. For n \ge 2, let T^{(n)} be the two-sided ideal in \mathbb Z \langle X \rangle generated by all commutators [a_1,a_2, \dots, a_n] ( a_i \in \mathbb Z \langle X \rangle ). Let T^{(3,2)} be the two-sided ideal of the ring \mathbb Z \langle X \rangle generated by all elements [a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4] and [a_1, a_2] [a_3, a_4, a_5] (a_i \in \mathbb Z \langle X \rangle).   It has been recently proved in arXiv:1204.2674 that the additive group of \mathbb Z \langle X \rangle / T^{(4)} is a direct sum  A \oplus B where A is a free abelian group isomorphic to the additive group of \mathbb Z \langle X \rangle / T^{(3,2)} and B = T^{(3,2)} /T^{(4)} is an elementary abelian 3-group. A basis of the free abelian summand A was described explicitly in arXiv:1204.2674. The aim of the present article is to find a basis of the elementary abelian 3-group B.
