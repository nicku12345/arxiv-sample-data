One-parameter analogs of the Heisenberg enveloping algebra were studied previously by Kirkman and Small. In particular, they demonstrated how one may obtain Hayashi's analog of the Weyl algebra as a primitive factor of this algebra. We consider various two-parameter versions of this problem. Of particular interest is the case when the parameters are dependent. Our study allows us to consider the representation theory of a two-parameter version of the Virasoro enveloping algebra.
