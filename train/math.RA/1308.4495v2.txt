This paper provides a fresh perspective on the representation of distributive bilattices and of related varieties. The techniques of naturalduality are employed to give, economically and in a uniform way, categories ofstructures dually equivalent to these varieties.We relate our dualities to the product representations for bilattices and to pre-existing dual representations by a simple translation process which is an instance of a more general mechanism for connecting dualities based on Priestley duality to natural dualities. Our approach gives us access to descriptions of algebraic/categorical properties of bilattices and also reveals how `truth' and `knowledge' may be seen as dual notions.
