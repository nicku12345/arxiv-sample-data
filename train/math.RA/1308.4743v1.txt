Suppose F is a field with valuation v and valuation domain O_{v}, and R is an O_{v}-algebra. We prove that R satisfies SGB (strong going between) over O_{v}. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for R to satisfy LO (lying over) over O_{v}. Using the filter \qv constructed in [Sa1], we show that if R is torsion-free over O_{v} then R satisfies GD (going down) over O_{v}. In particular, if R is torsion-free and (R^{\times} \cap O_{v}) \subseteq O_{v}^{\times}, then for any chain in \text{Spec}(O_v) there exists a chain in \text{Spec}(R) covering it.   Assuming R is torsion-free over O_{v} and [R \otimes_{O_{v}}F:F]< \infty, we prove that R satisfies INC (incomparabilty) over O_{v}. Assuming in addition that (R^{\times} \cap O_{v}) \subseteq O_{v}^{\times}, we deduce that R and O_{v} have the same Krull dimension and a bound on the size of the prime spectrum of R is given.   Under certain assumptions on R and a \qv defined on it, we prove that the \qv ring satisfies GU (going up) over O_{v}. Combining these five properties together, we deduce that any maximal chain of prime ideals of the \qv ring is lying over \text{Spec}(O_{v}), in a one-to-one correspondence.
