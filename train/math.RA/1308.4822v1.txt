This paper presents a novel treatment of the canonical extension of a bounded lattice, in the spirit of thetheory of natural dualities. At the level of objects, this can be achieved by exploiting the topological representation due to M. Ploscica, and the canonical extension can be obtained in the same manner as can be done in the distributive case by exploiting Priestley duality. To encompass both objects and morphismsthe Ploscica representation is replaced by a duality due to Allwein and Hartonas, recast in the style of Ploscica's paper. This leads to a construction of canonical extension valid for all bounded lattices,which is shown to be functorial, with the property that the canonical extension functor decomposes asthe composite of two functors, each of which acts on morphisms by composition, in the manner of hom-functors.
