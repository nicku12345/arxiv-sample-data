Let D be a division ring with the center F=Z(D). Suppose that N is a normal subgroup of D^* which is radical over F, that is, for any element x\in N, there exists a positive integer n_x, such that x^{n_x}\in F. In \cite{Her1}, Herstein conjectured that N is contained in F. In this paper, we show that the conjecture is true if there exists a positive integer d such that n_x\le d for any x\in N
