The \emph{large rank} of a finite semigroup \Gamma, denoted by r_5(\Gamma), is the least number n such that every subset of \Gamma with n elements generates \Gamma. Howie and Ribeiro showed that r_5(\Gamma) = |V| + 1, where V is a largest proper subsemigroup of \Gamma. This work considers the complementary concept of subsemigroups, called \emph{prime subsets}, and gives an alternative approach to find the large rank of a finite semigroup. In this connection, the paper provides a shorter proof of Howie and Ribeiro's result about the large rank of Brandt semigroups. Further, this work obtains the large rank of the semigroup of order-preserving singular selfmaps.
