We study the problem of existence of essential indecomposable submodules of direct sums of copies of the ring of quotients of Ore domains. We provide, for each Ore domain D, with at least three non-associate irreducibles, a lower bound for the supremum of all cardinals \kappa such that the direct sum of \kappa copies of the ring of quotients of D contains indecomposable essential D-submodules, and a lower bound for the number of times this bound is attained up to isomorphisms. We provide examples illustrating these results.
