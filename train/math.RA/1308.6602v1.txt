Makar-Limanov's conjecture states that if a division ring D is finitely generated and infinite dimensional over its center k then D contains a free k-subalgebra of rank 2. In this work, we will investigate the existence of such structures in D, the division ring of fractions of the skew polynomial ring L[t;\sigma], where t is a variable and \sigma is a k-automorphism of L. For instance, we prove Makar-Limanov's conjecture when either L is the function field of an abelian variety or the function field of the n-dimensional projective space.
