Suppose the ground field to be algebraically closed and of characteristic different from 2 and 3. All Heisenberg Lie superalgebras consist of two super versions of the Heisenberg Lie algebras, \frak{h}_{2m,n} and \frak{ba}_n with m a nonnegative integer and n a positive integer. The space of a "classical" Heisenberg Lie superalgebra \frak{h}_{2m,n} is the direct sum of a superspace with a non-degenerate anti-supersymmetric even bilinear form and a one-dimensional space of values of this form constituting the even center. The other super analog of the Heisenberg Lie algebra, \frak{ba}_n, is constructed by means of a non-degenerate anti-supersymmetric odd bilinear form with values in the one-dimensional odd center. In this paper, we study the cohomology of \frak{h}_{2m,n} and \frak{ba}_n with coefficients in the trivial module by using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequences relative to a suitable ideal. In characteristic zero case, for any Heisenberg Lie superalgebra, we determine completely the Betti numbers and associative superalgebra structure for their cohomology. In characteristic p>3 case, we determine the associative superalgebra structures for the divided power cohomology of \frak{ba}_n and we also make an attempt to determine the cohomology of \frak{h}_{2m,n} by computing it in a low-dimensional case.
