The purpose of this paper is to determine all maximal graded subalgebras of the four infinite series of finite-dimensional graded Lie superalgebras of odd Cartan type over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>3. All maximal graded subalgebras consist of three types (\MyRoman{1}), (\MyRoman{2}) and (\MyRoman{3}). Maximal graded subalgebras of type (\MyRoman{3}) fall into reducible maximal graded subalgebras and irreducible maximal graded subalgebras. In this paper we classify maximal graded subalgebras of types (\MyRoman{1}), (\MyRoman{2}) and reducible maximal g raded subalgebras.The classification of irreducible maximal graded subalgebras is reduced to that of the irreducible maximal subalgebras of the classical Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{p}(n).
