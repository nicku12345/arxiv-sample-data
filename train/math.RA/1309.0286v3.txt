Let p be a prime, k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. In this paper, we provide the classification of connected Hopf algebras of dimension p^3, except the case when the primitive space of the Hopf algebra is two dimensional and abelian. Each isomorphism class is presented by generators x, y, z with relations and Hopf algebra structures. Let \mu be the multiplicative group of (p^2+p-1)-th roots of unity. When the primitive space is one-dimensional and p is odd, there is an infinite family of isomorphism classes, which is naturally parameterized by A_{k}^1/\mu.
