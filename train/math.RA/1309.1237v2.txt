Let A be an associative unital algebra, B_k its successive quotients of lower central series and N_k the successive quotients of ideals generated by lower central series. The geometric and algebraic aspects of B_k and N_k have been of great interest since the pioneering work of \cite{feigin2007}. In this paper, we will concentrate on the case where A is a noncommutative polynomial algebra over \mathbb{Z} modulo a single homogeneous relation. Both the torsion part and the free part of B_k and N_k are explored. Many examples are demonstrated in detail, and several general theorems are proved. Finally we end up with an appendix about the torsion subgroups of N_k(A_n(\mathbb{Z})) and some open problems.
