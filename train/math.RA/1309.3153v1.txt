The poles and zeros of a transfer function can be studied by various means. The main motivation of the present paper is to give a state-space description of the module theoretic definition of zeros introduced and analyzed by Wyman et al. (1989, 1991). This analysis is carried out for proper transfer functions.   The obtained explicit equations determined by the system matrices are used for defining two inner functions to transform the original transfer function into a square, invertible one via multiplication eliminating the "generic" zeros corresponding to the kernel and the image of the transfer function.   As it is well-known the zeros are connected to various invariant subspaces arising in geometric control, see e.g. Aling and Schumacher (1984) for a complete description. The connections to these subspaces are also mentioned in the paper.
