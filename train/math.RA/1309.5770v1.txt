In this paper, we study 4-dimensional nilpotent complex associative algebras. This is a continuation of the study of the moduli space of 4-dimensional algebras. The non-nilpotent algeras were analyzed in an earlier paper. Even though there are only 15 families of nilpotent 4-dimensional algebras, the complexity of their behaviour warrented a separate study, which we give here.
