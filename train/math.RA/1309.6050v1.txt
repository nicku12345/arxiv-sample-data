In this paper we study the moduli space of 4-dimensional complex associative algebras. We use extensions to compute the moduli space, and then give a decomposition of this moduli space into strata consisting of complex projective orbifolds, glued together through jump deformations. Because the space of 4-dimensional algebras is large, we only classify the non-nilpotent algebras in this paper.
