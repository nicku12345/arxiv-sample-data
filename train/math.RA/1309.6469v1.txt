In this paper, we introduce some particular families of graphicable algebras obtained by following a relatively new line of research, initiated previously by some of the authors. It consists of the use of certain objects of Discrete Mathematics, mainly graphs and digraphs, to facilitate the study of graphicable algebras, which are a subset of evolution algebras.
