We consider a differential algebra F of formal power series in infinitely many variables. We define the important notions of a normalized set of generators for an ideal of F and a regular quotient algebra. The concept of the passive collection being analog of involutive system of the nonlinear partial differential equations and Gr\"obner basis is introduced. Using special partitions of the algebra F and action of a semigroup on F, the sufficient conditions of passivity are obtained. The proof of the main theorem essentially differs from similar one for the differential equations and we obtain more general statement.
