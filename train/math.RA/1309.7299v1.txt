We describe the ternary and the generalized superderivations of finite-dimensional semisimple Jordan superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and of finite-dimensional simple Jordan superalgebras with semisimple even part over an algebraically closed field of any characteristic not equal 2.
