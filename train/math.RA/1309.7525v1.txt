Let L be a lattice. We call a congruence relation \gQ of L isoform, if any two congruence classes of \gQ are isomorphic (as lattices). Let us call the lattice L isoform, if all congruences of L are isoform.   G. Gr\"atzer and E.\,T. Schmidt proved that every finite distributive lattice D can be represented as the congruence lattice of a finite isoform lattice L.   We now prove that every finite lattice K has a congruence-preserving extension to a finite isoform lattice L.
