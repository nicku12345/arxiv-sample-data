Differential difference algebras were introduced by Mansfield and Szanto, which arose naturally from differential difference equations. In this paper, we investigate the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of differential difference algebras. We give a lower bound of the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of a differential difference algebra and a sufficient condition under which the lower bound is reached; we also find an upper bound of this Gelfand-Kirillov dimension under some specific conditions and construct an example to show that this upper bound can not be sharpened any more.
