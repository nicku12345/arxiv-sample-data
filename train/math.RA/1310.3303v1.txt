In \cite{C, LCC}, it is proven that if an element ab in a ring is (generalized) Drazin invertible, then so is ba. In this paper, we give a new and short proof of it in an effective manner. In particular, we show that if ab is strongly clean, then so is ba. Consequently, we see that if 1-ab is strongly clean, then so is 1-ba. Also, some characterizations are obtained for some certain elements in a corner ring. It is shown that for an idempotent e and any arbitrary element a in a ring, ea+1-e is Drazin invertible if and only if eae is Drazin invertible.
