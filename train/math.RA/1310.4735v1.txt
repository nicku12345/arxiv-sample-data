Let n be a positive integer. For each 0\leq j \leq n-1 we let C_n^{j} denote Cayley graph for the cyclic group {\mathbb Z}_n  with respect to the subset \{1, j\}. For any such pair (n,j) we compute the size of the Grothendieck group of the Leavitt path algebra L_K(C_n^j); the analysis is related to a collection of integer sequences described by Haselgrove in the 1940's. When j=0,1, or 2, we are able to extract enough additional information about the structure of these Grothendieck groups so that we may apply a Kirchberg-Phillips-type result to explicitly realize the algebras L_K(C_n^j) as the Leavitt path algebras of graphs having at most three vertices. The analysis in the j=2 case leads us to some perhaps surprising and apparently nontrivial connections to the classical Fibonacci sequence.
