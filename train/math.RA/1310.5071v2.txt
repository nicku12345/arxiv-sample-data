We prove that the fixed ring of the q-division ring k_q(x,y) under any finite group of monomial automorphisms is isomorphic to k_q(x,y) for the same q. In a similar manner, we also show that this phenomenon extends to an automorphism that is defined only on k_q(x,y) and does not restrict to k_q[x^{\pm1},y^{\pm1}]. We then use these results to answer several questions posed by Artamonov and Cohn about the endomorphisms and automorphisms of k_q(x,y).
