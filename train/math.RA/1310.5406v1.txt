The Weyl algebra over a field k of characteristic 0 is a simple ring of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 2, which has a grading by the group of integers. We classify all \mathbb{Z}-graded simple rings of GK-dimension 2 and show that they are graded Morita equivalent to generalized Weyl algebras as defined by Bavula. More generally, we study \mathbb{Z}-graded simple rings A of any dimension which have a graded quotient ring of the form K[t, t^{-1}; \sigma] for a field K. Under some further hypotheses, we classify all such A in terms of a new construction of simple rings which we introduce in this paper. In the important special case that \operatorname{GKdim} A = \operatorname{tr.deg}(K/k) + 1, we show that K and \sigma must be of a very special form. The new simple rings we define should warrant further study from the perspective of noncommutative geometry.
