A survey of some properties of Okubo algebras is presented. Emphasis is put on automorphisms and derivations of these algebras, especially in characteristic three, where the situation is more involved and interesting. In this case, the Okubo algebra is closely related to a nodal noncommutative Jordan algebra.   Dedicated to Helmut Strade on the occasion of his 70th birthday.
