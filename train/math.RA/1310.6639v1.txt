We prove that if R is a left Noetherian and left regular ring then the same is true for any bijective skew PBW extension A of R. From this we get Serre's Theorem for such extensions. We show that skew PBW extensions and its localizations include a wide variety of rings and algebras of interest for modern mathematical physics such as PBW extensions, well known classes of Ore algebras, operator algebras, diffusion algebras, quantum algebras, quadratic algebras in 3-variables, skew quantum polynomials, among many others. We estimate the global, Krull and Goldie dimensions, and also Quillen's K-groups.
