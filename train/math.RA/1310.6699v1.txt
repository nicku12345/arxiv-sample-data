Eventually positive matrices are real matrices whose powers become and remain strictly positive. As such, eventually positive matrices are a fortiori matrix roots of positive matrices, which motivates us to study the matrix roots of primitive matrices. Using classical matrix function theory and Perron-Frobenius theory, we characterize, classify, and describe in terms of the real Jordan canonical form the pth-roots of eventually positive matrices.
