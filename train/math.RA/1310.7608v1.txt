Let K be a field and let \mathbb N = \{1,2, \dots \}. Let R_n=K[x_{ij} \mid 1\le i\le n, j\in \mathbb N] be the ring of polynomials in x_{ij} (1 \le i \le n, j \in \mathbb N) over K. Let S_n = Sym (\{1,2, \ldots, n \}) and Sym (\mathbb N) be the groups of the permutations of the sets \{1,2,\dots, n \} and \mathbb N, respectively. Then S_n and Sym (\mathbb N) act on R_n in a natural way: \tau (x_{ij})=x_{\tau(i)j} and \sigma (x_{ij})=x_{i\sigma (j)} for all \tau \in S_n and \sigma \in Sym(\mathbb N). Let \overline{R}_n be the subalgebra of the symmetric polynomials in R_n, \[ \overline{R}_n = \{f \in R_n \mid \tau (f) = f \mbox{for each} \tau \in S_n \} . \] In 1992 the second author proved that if char (K)= 0 or char(K)=p > n then every Sym (\mathbb N)-invariant ideal in \overline{R}_n is finitely generated (as such). In this note we prove that this is not the case if char (K)=p\le n.   We also survey some results about Sym (\mathbb N)-invariant ideals in polynomial algebras and some related results.
