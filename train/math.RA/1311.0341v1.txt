We explicitly construct a particular real form of the Lie algebra \mathfrak{e}_7 in terms of symplectic matrices over the octonions, thus justifying the identifications \mathfrak{e}_7\cong\mathfrak{sp}(6,\mathbb{O}) and, at the group level, \mathrm{E}_7\cong\mathrm{Sp}(6,\mathbb{O}). Along the way, we provide a geometric description of the minimal representation of \mathfrak{e}_7 in terms of rank 3 objects called cubies.
