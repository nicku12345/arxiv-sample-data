We present an alternative account of the problem of classifying and finding normal forms for arbitrary bilinear forms. Beginning from basic results developed by Riehm, our solution to this problem hinges on the classification of indecomposable forms and in how uniquely they fit together to produce all other forms. We emphasize the use of split forms, i.e., those bilinear forms such that the minimal polynomial of the asymmetry of their non-degenerate part splits over ground field, rather than restricting the field to be algebraically closed. In order to obtain the most explicit results, without resorting to the classification of hermitian, symmetric and quadratic forms, we merely require that the underlying field be quadratically closed.
