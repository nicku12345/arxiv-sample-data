Let A and B two F_q-subspaces of a finite field, of the same size, and let A^{-1} denote the set of inverses of the nonzero elements of A. Mattarei proved that A^{-1} can only be contained in A if either A is a subfield, or A is the set of trace zero elements in a quadratic extension of a field. Csajb\'{o}k refined this to the following quantitative statement: if A^{-1}\not\subseteq B, then the bound |A^{-1}\cap B|\le 2|B|/q-2 holds. He also gave examples showing that his bound is sharp for |B|\le q^3. Our main result is a proof of the stronger bound |A^{-1}\cap B|\le |B|/q\cdot\bigl(1+O_d(q^{-1/2})\bigr), for |B|=q^d with d>3. We also classify all examples with |B|\le q^3 which attain equality in Csajb\'{o}k's bound.
