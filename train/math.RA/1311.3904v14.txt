Let F be a finite field of char F > 3 and sl_{2}(F) be the Lie algebra of traceless 2\times 2 matrices over F. This paper aims for the following goals:   Find a basis for the \mathbb{Z}_{2}-graded identities of sl_{2}(F);   Find a basis for the \mathbb{Z}_{3}-graded identities of sl_{2}(F) when F contains a primitive 3rd root of one;   Find a basis for the \mathbb{Z}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}-graded identities of sl_{2}(F).
