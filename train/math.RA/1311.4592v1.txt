In this work we study the automorphisms of skew PBW extensions and skew quantum polynomials. We use Artamonov's works as reference for getting the principal results about automorphisms for generic skew PBW extensions and generic skew quantum polynomials. In general, if we have an endomorphism on a generic skew PBW extension and there are some x_i,x_j,x_u such that the endomorphism is not zero on this elements and the principal coefficients are invertible, then endomorphism act over x_i as a_ix_i for some a_i in the ring of coefficients. Of course, this is valid for quantum polynomial rings, with r=0, as such Artamonov shows in his work. We use this result for giving some more general results for skew PBW extensions, using filtred-graded techniques. Finally, we use localization for characterize some class the endomorphisms and automorphisms for skew PBW extensions and skew quantum polynomials over Ore domains.
