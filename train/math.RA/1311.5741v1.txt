Let B be a finitely generated algebra over a field k. Then B is called a Jacobson algebra if every semiprime ideal of B is semiprimitive. We will discuss several conditions, all involving the commutant of simple B-modules, which imply that B is Jacobson. In particular, we will recover the well-known result that every finitely generated almost commutative algebra is Jacobson. The same holds true for \mathbb{N}-filtered k-algebras B with a locally finite filtration such that the associated graded k-algebra is left-noetherian.
