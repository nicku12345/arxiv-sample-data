We investigate the function d_\mathbf{A}(n), which gives the size of a least size generating set for \mathbf{A}^n, in the case where \mathbf{A} has a cube term. We show that if \mathbf{A} has a k-cube term and \mathbf{A}^k is finitely generated, then d_\mathbf{A}(n) \in O(\log(n)) if \mathbf{A} is perfect and d_\mathbf{A}(n) \in O(n) if \mathbf{A} is imperfect. When \mathbf{A} is finite, then one may replace "Big Oh" with "Big Theta" in these estimates.
