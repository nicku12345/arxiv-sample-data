We study central extensions of the Lie superalgebra sl_{m|n}(A), where A is a Z/2Z-graded superalgebra over a commutative ring K. The Steinberg Lie superalgebra st_{m|n}(A) plays a crucial role. We show that st_{m|n}(A) is a central extension of sl_{m|n}(A) for m+n\geq 3. We use a Z/2Z-graded version of cyclic homology to show that the center of the extension is isomorphic to HC_1(A) as K-modules. For m+n\geq 5, we prove that st_{m|n}(A) is the universal central extension of sl_{m|n}(A). For m+n=3,4, we prove that st_{2|1}(A) and st_{3|1}(A) are both centrally closed. The universal central extension of st_{2|2}(A) is constructed explicitly.
