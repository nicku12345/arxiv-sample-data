We define and classify the analogues of the affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras for the ring corresponding to the complex projective line minus three points. The classification is given in terms of Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants. We also study the question of conjugacy of Cartan subalgebras for these algebras.
