Let L be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of non-zero characteristic and let S be a subalgebra. Suppose that X is a finite set of finite-dimensional L-modules. Let D be the category of all finite-dimensional S-modules. Then there exists a category C of finite-dimensional L-modules containing the modules in X such that the restriction functor Res:C \to D has a left adjoint Ind:D \to C.
