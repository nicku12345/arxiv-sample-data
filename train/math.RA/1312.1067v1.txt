We describe two constructions of a certain \mathbb{Z}_4^3-grading on the so-called Brown algebra (a simple structurable algebra of dimension 56 and skew-dimension 1) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from 2 and 3. We also show how this grading gives rise to several interesting fine gradings on exceptional simple Lie algebras of types E6, E7 and E8.
