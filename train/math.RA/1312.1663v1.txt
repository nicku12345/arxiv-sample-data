In this paper we establish a very close link (in terms of von Neumann's coordinatization) between regular modules introduced by Zelmanowitz, on one hand, and von Neumann regular rings, on the other hand: we prove that the lattice \mathcal{L}^{fg}(M) of all finitely generated submodules of a finitely generated regular module M, over an arbitrary ring, can be coordinatized as the lattice of all principal right ideals of some von Neumann regular ring S.
