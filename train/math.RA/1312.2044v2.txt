Differential difference algebras are generalizations of polynomial algebras, quantum planes, and Ore extensions of automorphism type and of derivation type. In this paper, we investigate the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of a finitely generated module over a differential difference algebra through a computational method: Gr\"obner-Shirshov basis method. We develop the Gr\"obner-Shirshov basis theory of differential difference algebras, and of finitely generated modules over differential difference algebras, respectively. Then, via Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases, we give algorithms for computing the Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions of cyclic modules and finitely generated modules over differential difference algebras.
