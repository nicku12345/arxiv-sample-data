Let \A be an algebra and \sigma an automorphism of \A. A linear map d of \A is called a \sigma-derivation of \A if d(xy) = d(x)y + \sigma(x)d(y), for all x, y \in \A. A bilinear map D: \A \times \A \to \A is said to be a \sigma-biderivation of \A if it is a \sigma-derivation in each component. An additive map \Theta of \A is \sigma-commuting if it satisfies \Theta(x)x - \sigma(x)\Theta(x) = 0, for all x \in \A. In this paper, we introduce the notions of inner and extremal \sigma-biderivations and of proper \sigma-commuting maps. One of our main results states that, under certain assumptions, every \sigma-biderivation of a triangular algebras is the sum of an extremal \sigma-biderivation and an inner \sigma-biderivation. Sufficient conditions are provided on a triangular algebra for all of its \sigma-biderivations (respectively, \sigma-commuting maps) to be inner (respectively, proper). A precise description of \sigma-commuting maps of triangular algebras is also given. A new class of automorphisms of triangular algebras is introduced and precisely described. We provide many classes of triangular algebras whose automorphisms can be precisely described.
