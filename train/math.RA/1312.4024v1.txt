In this paper, we introduce a class of rings in which every nilpotent element is central. This class of rings generalizes so-called reduced rings. A ring R is called {\it central reduced} if every nilpotent element of R is central.   For a ring R, we prove that R is central reduced if and only if   R[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n] is central reduced if and only if R[[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]] is central reduced if and only if R[x_1,x_1^{-1},x_2,x_2^{-1},\ldots,x_n,x_n^{-1}] is central reduced. Moreover, if R is a central reduced ring, then the trivial extension T(R,R) is central Armendariz.
