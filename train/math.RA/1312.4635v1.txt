Let A be an algebra and \sigma an automorphism of A. A linear map d of A is called a \sigma-derivation of A if d(xy) = d(x)y + \sigma(x)d(y), for all x, y \in A. A linear map D is said to be a generalized \sigma-derivation of A if there exists a \sigma-derivation d of A such that D(xy) = D(x)y + \sigma(x)d(y), for all x, y \in A. An additive map \Theta of A is \sigma-centralizing if \Theta(x)x - \sigma(x)\Theta(x) \in Z(A), for all x \in A. In this paper, precise descriptions of generalized \sigma-derivations and \sigma-centralizing maps of triangular algebras are given. Analogues of the so-called commutative theorems, due to Posner and Mayne, are also proved for the triangular algebra setting.
