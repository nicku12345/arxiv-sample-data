Let \T be a 2-torsion free triangular ring and let \varphi:\T\rightarrow \T be an additive map. We prove that if \A \varphi(\B)+\varphi(\B)\A=0 whenever \A,\B\in \T are such that \A\B=\B\A=0, then \varphi is a centralizer. It is also shown that if \tau:\T\rightarrow \T is an additive map satisfying \label{t2} X,Y\in \T, \quad XY=YX=0\Rightarrow X \tau(Y)+\delta(X)Y+Y\delta(X)+\tau(Y)X=0, where \delta:\T\rightarrow \T  is an additive map satisfies X,Y\in \T, \quad XY=YX=0\Rightarrow X \delta(Y)+\delta(X)Y+Y\delta(X)+\delta(Y)X=0, then \tau(\A)=d(\A)+\A \tau(\textbf{1}), where d:\T\rightarrow \T is a derivation and \tau(\textbf{1}) lies in the centre of the \T. By applying this results we obtain some corollaries concerning (Jordan) centralizers and (Jordan) derivations on triangular rings.
