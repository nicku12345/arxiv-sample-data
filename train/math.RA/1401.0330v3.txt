Let A be a Koszul Artin-Schelter regular algebra and \sigma an algebra homomorphism from A to M_{2\times 2}(A). We compute the Nakayama automorphisms of a trimmed double Ore extension A_P[y_1, y_2; \sigma] (introduced in \cite{ZZ08}). Using a similar method, we also obtain the Nakayama automorphism of a skew polynomial extension A[t; \theta], where \theta is a graded algebra automorphism of A. These lead to a characterization of the Calabi-Yau property of A_P[y_1, y_2; \sigma], the skew Laurent extension A[t^{\pm 1}; \theta] and A[y_1^{\pm 1}, y_2^{\pm 1}; \sigma] with \sigma a diagonal type.
