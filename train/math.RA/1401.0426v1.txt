In this paper we study Cartan subalgebras in general and special linear algebras over a field of positive characteristic. We determined the conjugacy classes of Cartan subalgebras under the general linear groups, and count the explicit number of all Cartan subalgebras from its conjugacy when the base field is an arbitrary finite field.
