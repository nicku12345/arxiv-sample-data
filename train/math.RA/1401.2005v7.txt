Let p be a prime number and (K, v) a Henselian valued field with a residue field \widehat K. This paper determines the Brauer p-dimension of K, in case p \neq {\rm char}(\widehat K) and \widehat K is a p-quasilocal field properly included in its maximal p-extension. When \widehat K is a local field, it describes index-exponent pairs of central division K-algebras of p-primary degrees. The same goal is achieved, if (K, v) is maximally complete, char(K) = p and \widehat K is local.
