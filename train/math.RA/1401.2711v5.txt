The Berger-Wang formula establishes equality between the joint and generalized spectral radii of a set of matrices. For matrix products whose multipliers are applied not arbitrarily but in accordance with some Markovian law, there are also known analogs of the joint and generalized spectral radii. However, the known proofs of the Berger-Wang formula hardly can be directly applied in the case of Markovian products of matrices since they essentially rely on the arbitrariness of appearance of different matrices in the related matrix products. Nevertheless, as has been shown by X. Dai the Berger-Wang formula is valid for the case of Markovian analogs of the joint and the generalized spectral radii too, although the proof in this case heavily exploits the more involved techniques of multiplicative ergodic theory. In the paper we propose a matrix theory construction allowing to deduce the Markovian analog of the Berger-Wang formula from the classical Berger-Wang formula.
