Let R be a ring. It is proved that (\mathcal{GP}(R), \mathcal{GP}(R)^\bot) is a complete hereditary cotorsion pair, where \mathcal{GP}(R) denotes the class of the Gorenstein projective left R-modules. Then we get that each left R-module has a special Gorenstein projective precover. As an application, we prove that all Gorenstein projective left R-modules are Gorenstein flat over left noetherian rings.
