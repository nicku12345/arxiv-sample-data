We give a characterization of the cohomology and deformation theory of 3-Lie algebras. The notion of Nijenhuis operators for 3-Lie algebras is introduced to describe trivial deformations. The theory of extending structures and unified product for 3-Lie algebras are developed. It is proved that extending structures can be classified by using some non-abelian cohomology and deformation map theory.
