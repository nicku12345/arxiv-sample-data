Let \KX =K\langle X_1,\ldots ,X_n\rangle be the free algebra generated by X=\{ X_1,\ldots ,X_n\} over a field K. It is shown that with respect to any weighted \mathbb{N}-gradation attached to \KX, minimal homogeneous generating sets for finitely generated graded (two-sided) ideals of \KX can be algorithmically computed, and that if an ungraded (two-sided) ideal I of \KX has a finite Gr\"obner basis \G with respect to a graded monomial ordering on \KX, then a minimal standard basis for I can be computed via computing a minimal homogeneous generating set of the associated graded ideal \langle\LH (I)\rangle.
