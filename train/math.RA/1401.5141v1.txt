Let A_1(K)=K \langle x,y | yx-xy= 1 \rangle be the first Weyl algebra over a characteristic zero field K and let \alpha be the exchange involution on A_1(K) given by \alpha(x)= y and \alpha(y)= x. The Dixmier conjecture of Dixmier (1968) asks: Is every algebra endomorphism of the Weyl algebra A_1(K) an automorphism? The aim of this paper is to prove that each \alpha-endomorphism of A_1(K) is an automorphism. Here an \alpha-endomorphism of A_1(K) is an endomorphism which preserves the involution \alpha. We also prove an analogue result for the Jacobian conjecture in dimension 2, called \alpha-JC_2.
