In this paper we prove that a multiplicative quadratic map between a unital ring K and a field L is induced by a homomorphism from K into L or a composition algebra over L. Especially we show that if K is a field, then every multiplicative quadratic map is the product of two field homomorphisms. Moreover, we prove a multiplicative version of Artin's Theorem showing that a product of field homomorphisms is unique up to multiplicity.
