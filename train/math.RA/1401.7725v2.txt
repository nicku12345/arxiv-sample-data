The cohomology theory of Lie triple systems in the sense of Yamaguti is studied by means of cohomology of Leibniz algebras in the sense of Loday. The notion of Nijenhuis operators for Lie triple system is introduced to describe trivial deformations. We also study the abelian extensions of Lie triple systems in details.
