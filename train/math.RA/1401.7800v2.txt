In this article we study graded Clifford algebras with a gradation preserving action of automorphisms given by H_p, the Heisenberg group of order p^3 with p prime. After reviewing results in dimensions 3 and 4, we will determine the graded Clifford algebras that are AS-regular algebras of global dimension 5 and generalize certain results to arbitrary dimension p. More specifically, we prove that there is a nice correspondence between \mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{F}_p} and the algebras isomorphic to the quantum space \mathbb{C}_{-1}[x_0,\ldots,x_{p-1}].
