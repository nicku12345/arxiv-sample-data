We bound the symbol length of elements in the Brauer group of a field K containing a C_m field (for example any field containing an algebraically closed field or a finite field), and solve the local exponent-index problem for a C_m field F. In particular, for a C_m field F, we show that every F central simple algebra of exponent p^t is similar to the tensor product of at most len(p^t,F)\leq t(p^{m-1}-1) symbol algebras of degree p^t. We then use this bound on the symbol length to show that the index of such algebras is bounded by (p^t)^{(p^{m-1}-1)}, which in turn gives a bound for any algebra of exponent n via the primary decomposition. Finally for a field K containing a C_m field F, we show that every F central simple algebra of exponent p^t and degree p^s is similar to the tensor product of at most len(p^t,p^s,K)\leq len(p^t,L) symbol algebras of degree p^t, where L is a C_{m+ed_L(A)+p^{s-t}-1} field.
