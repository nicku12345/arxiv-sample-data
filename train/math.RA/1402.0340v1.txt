Rowen and Saltman proved that every division algebra which is split by a dihedral extension of degree 2n of the center, n odd, is in fact cyclic. The proof requires roots of unity of order n in the center. We show that for n=5, this assumption can be removed. It then follows that {}_{5\!\!\!\:}Br(F), the 5-torsion part of the Brauer group, is generated by cyclic algebras, generalizing a result of Merkurjev on the 2 and 3 torsion parts.
