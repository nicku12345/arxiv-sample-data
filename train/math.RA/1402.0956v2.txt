In this paper we investigate the structure of \left(\frac{a,b}{\Z{n}}\right), the quaternion rings over \Z{n}. It is proved that these rings are isomorphic to \left(\frac{-1,-1}{\Z{n}}\right) if  a \equiv b\equiv -1 \pmod{4} or to \left(\frac{1,1}{\Z{n}}\right) otherwise. We also prove that the ring \left(\frac{a,b}{\Z{n}}\right) is isomorphic to \mathbb{M}_2(\Z{n}) if and only if n is odd and that all quaternion algebras defined over \Z{n} are isomorphic if and only if n \not \equiv 0 \pmod{4}.
