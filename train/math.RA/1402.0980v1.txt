For any factorization domain \cal A and an algebra endomorphism \sigma of \cal A, there exists a non-associative algebra ({\cal A},\sigma,[\cdot,\cdot]) with multiplication satisfying skew-symmetry and generalized (twisted) Jacobi identities, called a \sigma-deformed Witt algebra. In this paper, we obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the algebra ({\cal A},\sigma,[\cdot,\cdot]) to be simple.
