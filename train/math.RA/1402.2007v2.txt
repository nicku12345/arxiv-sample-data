For a Poisson algebra A, by exploring its relation with Lie-Rinehart algebras, we prove a Poincar\'e-Birkoff-Witt theorem for its universal enveloping algebra A^e. Some general properties of the universal enveloping algebras of Poisson Hopf algebras are studied. Given a Poisson Hopf algebra B, we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for a Poisson polynomial algebra B[x; \alpha, \delta]_p to be a Poisson Hopf algebra. We also prove a structure theorem for B^e when B is a pointed Poisson Hopf algebra. Namely, B^e is isomorphic to B#_\sigma \mathcal{H}(B), the crossed product of B and \mathcal{H}(B), where \mathcal{H}(B) is the quotient Hopf algebra B^e/B^eB^+.
