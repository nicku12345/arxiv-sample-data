It is well-known that every derivation of a semisimple Lie algebra L over an algebraically closed field F with characteristic zero is inner. The aim of this paper is to show what happens if the characteristic of F is prime with L an exceptional Lie algebra. We prove that if L is a Chevalley Lie algebra of type \{G_2,F_4,E_6,E_7,E_8\} over a field of characteristic p then the derivations of L are inner except in the cases G_2 with p=2, E_6 with p=3 and E_7 with p=2.
