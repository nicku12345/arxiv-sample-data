A topological space A is said to be compatible with a set \Sigma of equations (involving operation symbols F_t) iff there are continuous operations \overline F_t identically satisfying \Sigma on A. The paper's main focus is on the compatibility relation for A a finite simplicial complex. We review and extend the known compatibilities and incompatibilities in this context. Many such spaces are compatible with no non-trivial \Sigma.   The paper concludes with open questions. For example, if A is compatible with \Sigma, can this fact be deduced from the compatibility of A with some \Gamma that involves only ternary operations? If A is compatible with \Sigma, can the operations \overline F_t be chosen as piecewise multilinear? Is the compatibility relation (between finite \Sigma and finite complexes A) algorithmic? For A a one-simplex (i.e., a closed real interval), is there some simple characterization of the set of all \Sigma compatible with A?
