In this survey we determine an explicit set of generators of the maximal ideals in the ring \mathbb R[x_1,\dots,x_n] of polynomials in n variables with real coefficients and give an easy analytic proof of the Bass-Vasershtein theorem on the Bass stable rank of \mathbb R[x_1,\dots,x_n]. The ingredients of the proof stem from different publications by Coquand, Lombardi, Estes and Ohm. We conclude with a calculation of the topological stable rank of \mathbb R[x_1,\dots,x_n], which seems to be unknown so far.
