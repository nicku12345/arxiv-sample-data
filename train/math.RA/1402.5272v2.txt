Algebras simple with respect to an action of a Taft algebra H_{m^2}(\zeta) deliver an interesting example of H-module algebras that are H-simple but not necessarily semisimple. We describe finite dimensional H_{m^2}(\zeta)-simple algebras and prove the analog of Amitsur's conjecture for codimensions of their polynomial H_{m^2}(\zeta)-identities. In particular, we show that the Hopf PI-exponent of an H_{m^2}(\zeta)-simple algebra A over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 equals \dim A. The groups of automorphisms preserving the structure of an H_{m^2}(\zeta)-module algebra are studied as well.
