Given a function from \mathbb{Z}_n to itself one can determine its polynomial representability by using Kempner function. In this paper we present an alternative characterization of polynomial functions over \mathbb{Z}_n by constructing a generating set for the \mathbb{Z}_{n}-module of polynomial functions. This characterization results in an algorithm that is faster on average in deciding polynomial representability. We also extend the characterization to functions in several variables.
