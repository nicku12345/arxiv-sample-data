Let V be a finite-dimensional positively-graded vector space. Let b \in V \otimes V be a homogeneous element whose rank is \text{dim}(V). Let A=TV/(b), the quotient of the tensor algebra TV modulo the 2-sided ideal generated by b. Let {\sf gr}(A) be the category of finitely presented graded left A-modules and {\sf fdim}(A) its full subcategory of finite dimensional modules. Let {\sf qgr}(A) be the quotient category {\sf gr}(A)/{\sf fdim}(A). We compute the Grothendieck group K_0({\sf qgr}(A)). In particular, if the reciprocal of the Hilbert series of A, which is a polynomial, is irreducible, then K_0({\sf qgr}(A)) \cong \mathbb{Z}[\theta] \subset \mathbb{R} as ordered abelian groups where \theta is the smallest positive real root of that polynomial. When \text{dim}_k(V)=2, {\sf qgr}(A) is equivalent to the category of coherent sheaves on the projective line, \mathbb{P}^1, or a stacky \mathbb{P}^1 if V is not concentrated in degree 1. If \text{dim}_k(V) \ge 3, results of Piontkovskii and Minamoto suggest that {\sf qgr}(A) behaves as if it is the category of "coherent sheaves" on a non-commutative, non-noetherian, analogue of \mathbb{P}^1.
