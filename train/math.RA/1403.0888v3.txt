Let F be a finite field with characteristic p > 2 and let G be the unitary Grassmann algebra generated by an infinite dimensional vector space V over F. In this paper, we determine a basis of the \mathbb{Z}_{2}-graded polynomial identities for any non-trivial \mathbb{Z}_{2}-grading such that a basis of V is homogeneous in this grading.
