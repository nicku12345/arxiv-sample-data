Let R be a ring satisfying a polynomial identity and let \delta be a derivation of R. We show that if N is the nil radical of R then \delta(N)\subseteq N and the Jacobson radical of R[x;\delta] is equal to N[x;\delta]. As a consequence, we have that if R is locally nilpotent then R[x;\delta] is locally nilpotent. This affirmatively answers a question of Smoktunowicz and Ziembowski.
