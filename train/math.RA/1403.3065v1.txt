These notes are an expanded version of the author's lectures at the graduate workshop "Noncommutative Algebraic Geometry" at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in June 2012. The main topics discussed are Artin-Schelter regular algebras, point modules, and the noncommutative projective scheme associated to a graded algebra.
