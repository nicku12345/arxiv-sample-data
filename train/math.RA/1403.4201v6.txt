Let K be an infinite integral domain and M_{n}(K) be the algebra of all n\times n matrices over K. This paper aims for the following goals:   Find a basis for the graded identities for elementary grading in M_{n}(K) when the neutral component and diagonal coincide; Describe the \mathbb{Z}_{p}-graded central polynomials of M_{p}(K) when p is a prime number; Describe the \mathbb{Z}-graded central polynomials of M_{n}(K).
