We prove Cuntz-Krieger and graded uniqueness theorems for Steinberg algebras. We also show that a Steinberg algebra is basically simple if and only if its associated groupoid is both effective and minimal. Finally we use results of Steinberg to characterise the center of Steinberg algebras associated to minimal groupoids
