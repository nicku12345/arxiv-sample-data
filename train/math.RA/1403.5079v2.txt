In this paper, the notion of a uniformly distributed systems of elements on the variety of metabelian Lie algebras is introduced. This notion is analogous to one of a measure preserving systems of elements on group varieties. As the main result of the paper it was shown that on the variety of metabelian Lie algebras a system of elements is primitive iff it is uniformly distributed.
