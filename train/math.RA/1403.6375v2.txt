In this paper, we construct an explicit minimal projective bimodule resolution of a self-injective special biserial algebra A_{T} (T\geq0) whose Grothendieck group is of rank 4. As a main result, we determine the dimension of the Hochschild cohomology group {\rm HH}^{i}(A_{T}) of A_{T} for i\geq0, completely. Moreover we give a presentation of the Hochschild cohomology ring modulo nilpotence {\rm HH}^{*}(A_{T})/\mathcal{N}_{A_{T}} of A_{T} by generators and relations in the case where T=0.
