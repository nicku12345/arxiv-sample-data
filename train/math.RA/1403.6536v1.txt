We study algebra endomorphisms and derivations of some localized down-up algebras \A. First, we determine all the algebra endomorphisms of \A under some conditions on r and s. We show that each algebra endomorphism of \A is an algebra automorphism if r^{m}s^{n}=1 implies m=n=0. When r=s^{-1}=q is not a root of unity, we give a criterion for an algebra endomorphism of \A to be an algebra automorphism. In either case, we are able to determine the algebra automorphism group for \A. We also show that each surjective algebra endomorphism of the down-up algebra A(r+s, -rs) is an algebra automorphism in either case. Second, we determine all the derivations of \A and calculate its first degree Hochschild cohomology group.
