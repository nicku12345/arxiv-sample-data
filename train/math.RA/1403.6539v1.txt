In this paper, we study a class of down-up algebras \A defined over a polynomial base ring \K[t_{1}, \cdots, t_{n}] and establish several analogous results. We first construct a \K-basis for the algebra \A. As a result, we prove that the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of \A is n+3 and completely determine the center of \A when char\K=0. Then, we prove that the algebra \A is a noetherian domain if and only if \beta\neq 0; and \A is Auslander-regular when \beta \neq 0. We also prove that the global dimension of \A is n+3; and the algebra \A is a prime ring except \alpha=\beta=\phi=0. Moreover, we obtain some results on the Krull dimension, isomorphisms, and automorphisms of the algebra \A.
