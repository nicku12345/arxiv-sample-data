Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and let H be a noetherian cocommutative Hopf algebra over k. We show that if H has polynomially bounded growth then H satisfies the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence. That is, for every prime ideal P in {\rm Spec}(H) we have the equivalences P~{\rm primitive}\iff P~{\rm rational}\iff P ~{\rm locally~closed~in}~{\rm Spec}(H). We observe that examples due to Lorenz show that this does not hold without the hypothesis that H have polynomially bounded growth. We conjecture, more generally, that the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence holds for all finitely generated complex noetherian Hopf algebras of polynomially bounded growth.
