We study the class of finite lattices that are isomorphic to the congruence lattices of algebras from a given finitely generated congruence-distributive variety. If this class is as large as allowed by an obvious necessary condition, the variety is called congruence FD-maximal. The main results of this paper characterize some special congruence FD-maximal varieties.
