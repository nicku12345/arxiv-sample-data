This paper is primarily concerned with the first cohomology of \frak{gl}_{0|2} with coefficients in the generalized Witt Lie superalgebra, where \frak{gl}_{0|2} is a subalgebra of the general linear Lie superalgebra. The derivations and inner derivations from \frak{gl}_{0|2} into submodules of the generalized Witt Lie superalgebra are represented by matrices, respectively. Then the first cohomology of \frak{gl}_{0|2} with coefficients in the generalized Witt Lie superalgebra is completely determined by matrices.
