The paper studies the structure of restricted Leibniz algebras. More specifically speaking, we first give the equivalent definition of restricted Leibniz algebras, which is by far more tractable than that of a restricted Leibniz algebras in [6]. Second, we obtain some properties of p-mappings and restrictable Leibniz algebras, and discuss restricted Leibniz algebras with semisimple elements. Finally, Cartan decomposition and the uniqueness of decomposition for restricted Leibniz algebras are determined.
