We introduce ring theoretic constructions that are similar to the construction of wreath product of groups. In particular, for a given graph \Gamma=(V,E) and an associate algebra A, we construct an algebra B=A\, wr\, L(\Gamma) with the following property: B has an ideal I,which consists of (possibly infinite) matrices over A, B/I\cong L(\Gamma), the Leavitt path algebra of the graph \Gamma. \medskip \par Let W\subset V be a hereditary saturated subset of the set of vertices [1], \Gamma(W)=(W,E(W,W)) is the restriction of the graph \Gamma to W, \Gamma/W is the quotient graph [1]. Then L(\Gamma)\cong L(W) wr L(\Gamma/W).
