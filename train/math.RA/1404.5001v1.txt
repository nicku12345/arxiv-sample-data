In this paper, we study the variety Jor_{3} of three-dimensional Jordan algebras over the field of real numbers. We establish the list of 26 non-isomorphic Jordan algebras and describe the irreducible components of Jor_{3} proving that it is the union of Zariski closure of the orbits of 8 rigid algebras.
