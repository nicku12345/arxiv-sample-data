Let R be a valuation ring with fraction field K and 2\in R^\times. We give an elementary proof of the following known result: Two unimodular quadratic forms over R are isometric over K if and only if they are isometric over R. Our proof does not use Witt's Cancelation Theorem and yields an explicit algorithm to construct an isometry over R from a given isometry over K. The statement actually holds for hermitian forms over valuated involutary division rings, provided mild assumptions.   A python implementation of the algorithm derived from the proof can be found on the author's home page.
