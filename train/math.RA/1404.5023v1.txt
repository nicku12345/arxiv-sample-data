We give a characterization of symplectic quadratic Lie algebras that their Lie algebra of inner derivations has an invertible derivation. A family of symplectic quadratic Lie algebras is introduced to illustrate this situation. Finally, we calculate explicitly the Betti numbers of a family of solvable Lie algebras in two ways: using the cohomology of quadratic Lie algebras and applying a Pouseele's result on extensions of the one-dimensional Lie algebra by Heisenberg Lie algebras
