A version of the twisted Poincar\'{e} duality is proved between the Poisson homology and cohomology of a polynomial Poisson algebra with values in an arbitrary Poisson module. The duality is achieved by twisting the Poisson module structure in a canonical way, which is constructed from the modular derivation. In the case that the Poisson structure is unimodular, the twisted Poincar\'{e} duality reduces to the Poincar\'{e} duality in the usual sense. The main result generalizes the work of Launois-Richard \cite{LR} for the quadratic Poisson structures and Zhu \cite{Zhu} for the linear Poisson structures.
