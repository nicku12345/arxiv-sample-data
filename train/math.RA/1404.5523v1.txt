To use evolution algebras to model population dynamics that both allow extinction and introduction of certain gametes in finite generations, nilpotency must be built into the algebraic structures of these algebras with the entire algebras not to be nilpotent if the populations are assumed to evolve for a long period of time. To adequately address this need, evolution algebras over rings with nilpotent elements must be considered instead of evolution algebras over fields. This paper develops some criteria, which are computational in nature, about the nilpotency of these algebras, and shows how to construct finitely generated evolution algebras which are nil but not nilpotent.
