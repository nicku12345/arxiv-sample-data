Fix an algebraically closed field \mathbb{F} and an integer d \geq 3. Let \text{Mat}_{d+1}(\mathbb{F}) denote the \mathbb{F}-algebra consisting of the (d+1) \times (d+1) matrices that have all entries in \mathbb{F}. We consider a pair of diagonalizable matrices A,A^* in \text{Mat}_{d+1}(\mathbb{F}), each acts in an irreducible tridiagonal fashion on an eigenbasis for the other one. Such a pair is called a Leonard pair in \text{Mat}_{d+1}(\mathbb{F}). For a Leonard pair A,A^* there is a nonzero scalar q that is used to describe the eigenvalues of A and A^*. In the present paper we find all Leonard pairs A,A^* in \text{Mat}_{d+1}(\mathbb{F}) such that A is lower bidiagonal with subdiagonal entries all 1 and A^* is irreducible tridiagonal, under the assumption that q is not a root of unity. This gives a partial solution of a problem given by Paul Terwilliger.
