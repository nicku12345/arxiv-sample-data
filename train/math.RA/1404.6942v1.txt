Let F be a field of characteristic not 2 . An associative F-algebra R gives rise to the commutator Lie algebra R^{(-)}=(R,[a,b]=ab-ba). If the algebra R is equipped with an involution *:R\rightarrow R then the space of the skew-symmetric elements K=\{a \in R \mid a^{*}=-a \} is a Lie subalgebra of R^{(-)}. In this paper we find sufficient conditions for the Lie algebras [R,R] and [K,K] to be finitely generated.
