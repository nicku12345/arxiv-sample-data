In this paper, we introduce the notions of Gorenstein weak injective and weak flat modules respectively in terms of weak injective and weak flat modules, which is larger than classical classes of Gorenstein injective and flat modules. In this new setting, we characterize rings over which all modules are Gorenstein weak injective. Moreover, we also discuss a relation between weak cosyzygy and Gorenstein weak cosyzygy of a module, and the stability of Gorenstein weak injective modules.
