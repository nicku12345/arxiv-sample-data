For fields with more than 2 elements, the classification of the vector spaces of matrices with rank at most 2 is already known. In this work, we complete that classification for the field \mathbb{F}_2. We apply the results to obtain the classification of triples of locally linearly dependent operators over \mathbb{F}_2, the classification of the 3-dimensional subspaces of \text{M}_3(\mathbb{F}_2) in which no matrix has a non-zero eigenvalue, and the classification of the 3-dimensional affine spaces that are included in the general linear group \text{GL}_3(\mathbb{F}_2).
