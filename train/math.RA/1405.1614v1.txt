The theory of the column-row determinants has been considered for matrices over a non-split quaternion algebra. In this paper the concepts of column-row determinants are extending to a split quaternion algebra. New definitions of the column and row immanants (permanents) for matrices over a non-split quaternion algebra are introduced, and their basic properties are investigated. The key theorem about the column and row immanants of a Hermitian matrix over a split quaternion algebra is proved. Based on this theorem an immanant of a Hermitian matrix over a split quaternion algebra is introduced.
