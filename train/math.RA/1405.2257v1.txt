We consider a complete filtered Rota-Baxter algebra of weight \lambda over a commutative ring. Finding the unique solution of a non-homogeneous linear algebraic equation in this algebra, we generalize Spitzer's identity in both commutative and non-commutative cases. As an application, considering the Rota-Baxter algebra of power series in one variable with q-integral as the Rota-Baxter operator, we show certain Eulerian identities.
