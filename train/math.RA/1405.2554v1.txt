The paper presents two new results concerning the varieties of Leibnitz algebras. In the case of prime characteristic p of the base field constructed example not nilpotent variety of Leibnitz algebras satisfying an Engel condition order p. In the case of zero characteristic obtained new results concerning the space of multilinear elements variety of left nilpotent of the class not more than 3 Leibnitz algebras.
