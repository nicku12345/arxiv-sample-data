The purpose of this paper is to study representations and T*-extensions of hom-Jordan-Lie algebras. In particular, adjoint representations, trivial representations, deformations and many properties of T*-extensions of hom-Jordan-Lie algebras are studied in detail. Derivations and central extensions of hom-Jordan-Lie algebras are also discussed as an application.
