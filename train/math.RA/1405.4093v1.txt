We describe the fine (group) gradings on the Heisenberg algebras, on the Heisenberg superalgebras and on the twisted Heisenberg algebras. We compute the Weyl groups of these gradings. Also the results obtained respect to Heisenberg superalgebras are applied to the study of Heisenberg Lie color algebras.
