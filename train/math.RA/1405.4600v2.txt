In the theory of finite groups, the irreducible representations of G over a field F are classified into blocks based on a direct decompositions of the group algebra FG. This gives a natural decomposition of FG-modules into direct summands, each summand having all its composition factors belonging to a single block. This block decomposition is the finest natural decomposition of the FG-modules. In this paper, a classification of the irreducible representations of a finite dimensional Lie algebra L into blocks is defined, giving the finest natural direct decomposition of L-modules. This classification is investigated for supersoluble algebras.
