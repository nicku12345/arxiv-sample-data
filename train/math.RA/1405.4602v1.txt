The paper presents two new results concerning the varieties of Leibnitz algebras. We find values of multiplicities and colength variety of Leibniz algebras of almost polynomial growth, which is generated by the algebra constructed with the help of the Heisenberg algebra and its infinite-dimensional irreducible representations.
