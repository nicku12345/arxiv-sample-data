The paper is devoted to two new results concerning varieties of Leibnitz algebras over a field of the zero characteristic. Here is proved the sufficient condition for finiteness colength of variety of Leibnitz algebras. Here is also defined the basis of identities of variety V3 of Leibnitz algebras and the basis of its multilinear part.
