This monograph is devoted to a comprehensive study of graded rings and graded K-theory. A bird's eye view of the graded module theory over a graded ring gives an impression of the module theory with the added adjective "graded" to all its statements. Once the grading is considered to be trivial, the graded theory reduces to the usual module theory. So from this perspective, the graded module theory can be considered as an extension of the module theory. However, one aspect that could be easily missed from such a panoramic view is that, the graded module theory comes equipped with a shifting, thanks to being able to partition the structures and rearranging these partitions. This adds an extra layer of structure (and complexity) to the theory. An sparkling example of this is the theory of graded Grothendieck groups, K^{gr}_0, which is the main focus of this monograph. Whereas the usual K_0 is an abelian group, thanks to the shiftings, K^{gr}_0 has a natural Z[\Gamma]-module structure, where \Gamma is the graded group. As we will see throughout this note, this extra structure carries a substantial information about the graded ring.
