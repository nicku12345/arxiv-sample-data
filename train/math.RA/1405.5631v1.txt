An element X in the algebra {\rm M}(n,\mathbb{F}) of all n\times n matrices over a field \mathbb{F} is said to be f-cyclic if the underlying vector space considered as an \mathbb{F}[X]-module has at least one cyclic primary component. These are the matrices considered to be `good' in the Holt-Rees version of Norton's irreducibility test in the MeatAxe algorithm. We prove that, for any finite field \mathbb{F}_q, the proportion of matrices in {\rm M}(n,\mathbb{F}_q) that are `not good' decays exponentially to zero as the dimension n approaches infinity. Turning this around, we prove that the density of `good' matrices in {\rm M}(n,\mathbb{F}_q) for the MeatAxe depends on the degree, showing that it is at least 1-\frac2q(\frac{1}{q}+\frac{1}{q^2}+\frac{2}{q^3})^n for q\geq4. We conjecture that the density is at least 1-\frac1q(\frac{1}{q}+\frac{1}{2q^2})^n for all q and n, and confirm this conjecture for dimensions n\leq 37. Finally we give a one-sided Monte Carlo algorithm called IsfCyclic to test whether a matrix is `good', at a cost of {\rm O}({\rm Mat}(n)\log n) field operations, where {\rm Mat}(n) is an upper bound for the number of field operations required to multiply two matrices in {\rm M}(n,\mathbb{F}_q).
