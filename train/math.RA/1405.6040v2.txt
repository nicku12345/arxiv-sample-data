Let H be a twisted Calabi-Yau (CY) algebra and \sigma a 2-cocycle on H. Let A be an N-Koszul twisted CY algebra such that A is a graded H^\sigma-module algebra. We show that the cleft extension A#_\sigma H is also a twisted CY algebra. This result has two consequences. Firstly, the smash product of an N-Koszul twisted CY algebra with a twisted CY Hopf algebra is still a twisted CY algebra. Secondly, the cleft objects of a twisted CY Hopf algebra are all twisted CY algebras. As an application of this property, we determine which cleft objects of U(\mathcal{D},\lambda), a class of pointed Hopf algebras introduced by Andruskiewitsch and Schneider, are Calabi-Yau algebras.
