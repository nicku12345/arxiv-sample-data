Let  Aut_{mHH}(H) denote a set of all automorphisms of a monoidal Hopf algebra H with bijective antipode in the sense of Caenepeel S. and Goyvaerts I. (Commun. Algebra 39, 2216-2240, 2011) and let G be a crossed product group  Aut_{mHH}(H)\times Aut_{mHH}(H). The main aim of this paper is to provide further examples of braided T-category in the sense of Turaev (1994, 2008). For this purpose, we first introduce a class of new categories _{H}\mathcal {MHYD}^{H}(A, B) of monoidal Hom (A, B)-Yetter-Drinfeld modules with A, B \in Aut_{mHH}(H). Then we show that the category {\cal MHYD}(H)=\{{}_{H}\mathcal {MHYD}^{H}(A, B)\}_{(A, B)\in G} forms a braided T-category, generalizing the main constructions construction by Panaite and Staic (Isr J Math 158:349-365, 2007).
