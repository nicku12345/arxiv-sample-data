In this paper we study subalgebras of complex finite dimensional evolution algebras. We obtain the classification of nilpotent evolution algebras whose any subalgebra is an evolution subalgebra with a basis which can be extended to a natural basis of algebra. Moreover, we formulate three conjectures related to description of such non-nilpotent algebras.
