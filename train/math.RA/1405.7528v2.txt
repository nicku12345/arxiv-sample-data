Let (H,\alpha) be a monoidal Hom-Hopf algebra, and (A,\beta) a Hom-algebra. In this paper we will introduce the crossed product (A\#_{\sigma}H,\beta\otimes\alpha), which is a Hom-algebra. Then we will introduce the notions of cleft extensions and Galois extensions respectively, and prove that a crossed product is equivalent to a cleft extension and a cleft extension is equivalent to a Galois extension with normal bases property.
