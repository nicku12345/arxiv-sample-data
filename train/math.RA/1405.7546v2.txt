Let K be a field of characteristic zero and let \mathfrak{M}_5 be the variety of associative algebras over K, defined by the identity [x_1,x_2][x_3,x_4,x_5]. It is well-known that such variety is a minimal variety and that is generated by the algebra A=\begin{pmatrix} E_0 & E\\ 0 & E\\ \end{pmatrix}, where E=E_0\oplus E_1 is the Grassmann algebra. In this paper, for any positive integer k, we describe the polynomial identities of the relatively free algebras of rank k of \mathfrak{M}_5, \[F_k(\mathfrak{M}_5)=\dfrac{K\langle x_1,\dots, x_k \rangle}{K\langle x_1,\dots, x_k \rangle\cap T(\mathfrak{M}_5)}.\] It turns out that such algebras satisfy the same polynomial identities of some algebras used in the description of the subvarieties of \mathfrak{M}_5, given by Di Vincenzo, Drensky and Nardozza.
