Let n,\alpha\geq 2. Let K be an algebraically closed field with characteristic 0 or greater than n. We show that the dimension of the variety of pairs (A,B)\in {M_n(K)}^2, with B nilpotent, that satisfy AB-BA=A^{\alpha} or A^2-2AB+B^2=0 is n^2-1 ; moreover such matrices (A,B) are simultaneously triangularizable. Let R be a reduced ring such that n! is not a zero-divisor and A be a generic matrix over R ; we show that X=0 is the sole solution of AX-XA=X^{\alpha}. Let R be a commutative ring with unity ; let A be similar to \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_1I_{n_1},\cdots,\lambda_rI_{n_r}) such that, for every i\not= j, \lambda_i-\lambda_j is not a zero-divisor. If X is a nilpotent solution of XA-AX=X^{\alpha}g(X) where g is a polynomial, then AX=XA.
