A 1955 result of J.~Jakub\'i k states that for the prime intervals \fp and \fq of a finite lattice, \con{\fp} \geq \con{\fq} if{}f \fp is congruence-projective to~\fq (\emph{via} intervals of arbitrary size). The problem is how to determine whether \con{\fp} \geq \con{\fq} involving only prime intervals.   Two recent papers approached this problem in different ways. G. Cz\'edli's used trajectories for slim rectangular lattices---a special subclass of slim, planar, semimodular lattices. I used the concept of prime-projectivity for arbitrary finite lattices. In this note I show how my approach can be used to generalize Cz\'edli's result to arbitrary slim, planar, semimodular lattices.
