In this paper, we introduce and study V- and CI-semirings---semirings all of whose simple and cyclic, respectively, semimodules are injective. We describe V-semirings for some classes of semirings and establish some fundamental properties of V-semirings. We show that all Jacobson-semisimple V-semirings are V-rings. We also completely describe the bounded distributive lattices, Gelfand, subtractive, semisimple, and anti-bounded, semirings that are CI-semirings. Applying these results, we give complete characterizations of congruence-simple subtractive and congruence-simple anti-bounded CI-semirings which solve two earlier open problems for these classes of CI-semirings.
