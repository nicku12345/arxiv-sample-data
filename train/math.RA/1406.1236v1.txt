A ring R is feckly clean provided that for any a\in R there exists an element e\in R and a full element u\in R such that a=e+u, eR(1-e)\subseteq J(R). We prove that a ring R is feckly clean if and only if for any a\in R, there exists an element e\in R such that V(a)\subseteq V(e), V(1-a)\subseteq V(1-e) and eR(1-e)\subseteq J(R), if and only if for any distinct maximal ideals M and N, there exists an element e\in R such that e\in M, 1-e\in N and eR(1-e)\subseteq J(R), if and only if J-spec(R) is strongly zero dimensional, if and only if Max(R) is strongly zero dimensional and every prime ideal containing J(R) is contained in a unique maximal ideal. More explicit characterizations are also discussed for commutative feckly clean rings.
