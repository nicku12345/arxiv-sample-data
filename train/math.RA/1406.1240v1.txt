An element a\in R is very clean provided that there exists an idempotent e\in R such that ae=ea and either a-e or a+e is invertible. A ring R is very clean in case every element in R is very clean. We explore the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a triangular 2\times 2 matrix ring over local rings is very clean. The very clean 2\times 2 matrices over commutative local rings are completely determined. Applications to matrices over power series are also obtained.
