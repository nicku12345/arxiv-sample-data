In this paper, we study triple derivations and triple homomorphisms of perfect Lie superalgebras over a commutative ring R. It is proved that, if the base ring contains \frac{1}{2}, L is a perfect Lie superalgebra with zero center, then every triple derivation of L is a derivation, and every triple derivation of the derivation algebra  Der (L) is an inner derivation. Let L,~L^{'} be Lie superalgebras over a commutative ring R, the notion of triple homomorphism from L to L^{'} is introduced. We proved that, under certain assumptions, homomorphisms, anti-homomorphisms, and sums of homomorphisms and anti-homomorphisms are all triple homomorphisms.
