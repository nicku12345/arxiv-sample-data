We study algebraic conditions when a pseudo MV-algebra is an interval in the lexicographic product of an Abelian unital \ell-group and an \ell-group that is not necessary Abelian. We introduce (H,u)-perfect pseudo MV-algebras and strong (H,u)-perfect pseudo MV-algebras, the latter ones will have a representation by a lexicographic product. Fixing a unital \ell-group (H,u), the category of strong (H,u)-perfect pseudo MV-algebras is categorically equivalent to the category of \ell-groups.
