Skew lattices are non-commutative generalizations of lattices, and the cosets represent the building blocks that skew lattices are built of. As by Leech's Second Decomposition Theorem any skew lattice embeds into a direct product of a left-handed skew lattice by a right-handed one, it is natural to consider the so called flat coset decompositions, i.e. decompositions of a skew lattice into right and left cosets, thus finding the smallest atoms that compose the structure.
