In calculus, an indefinite integral of a function f is a differentiable function F whose derivative is equal to f. In present paper, we generalize this notion of the indefinite integral from the ring of real functions to any ring. The main goal of the paper is to focus on the properties of such generalized integrals that are inherited from the well-known basic properties of indefinite integrals of real functions.
