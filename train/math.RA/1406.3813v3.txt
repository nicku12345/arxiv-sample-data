In this paper, we introduce and study the concept of CS-Rickart modules, that is a module analogue of the concept of ACS rings. A ring R is called a right weakly semihereditary ring if every its finitly generated right ideal is of the form P\oplus S, where P_R is a projective module and S_R is a singular module. We describe the ring R over which \mathrm{Mat}_n (R) is a right ACS ring for any n \in \mathbb {N}. We show that every finitely generated projective right R-module will to be a CS-Rickart module, is precisely when R is a right weakly semihereditary ring. Also, we prove that if R is a right weakly semihereditary ring, then every finitely generated submodule of a projective right R-module has the form P_{1}\oplus \ldots\oplus P_{n}\oplus S, where every P_{1}, \ldots, P_{n} is a projective module which is isomorphic to a submodule of R_{R}, and S_R is a singular module. As corollaries we obtain some well-known properties of Rickart modules and semihereditary rings.
