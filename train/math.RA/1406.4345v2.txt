We investigate the barycentric associativity property for functions with indefinite arities and discuss the more general property of barycentric preassociativity, a generalization of barycentric associativity which does not involve any composition of functions. We also provide a generalization of Kolmogoroff-Nagumo's characterization of the quasi-arithmetic mean functions to barycentrically preassociative functions.
