The well-known Dixmier conjecture asks if every algebra endomorphism of the first Weyl algebra over a characteristic zero field is an automorphism. We bring a hopefully easier to solve conjecture, called the \gamma,\delta conjecture, and show that it is equivalent to the Dixmier conjecture. Up to checking that in the group generated by automorphisms and anti-automorphisms of A_1 all the involutions belong to one conjugacy class, we show that every involutive endomorphism from (A_1,\gamma) to (A_1,\delta) is an automorphism (\gamma and \delta are two involutions on A_1), and given an endomorphism f of A_1 (not necessarily an involutive endomorphism), if one of f(X),f(Y) is symmetric or skew-symmetric (with respect to any involution on A_1), then f is an automorphism.
