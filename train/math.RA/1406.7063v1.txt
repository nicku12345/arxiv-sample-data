Let F be a field, let V be a valuation ring of F of arbitrary Krull dimension (rank), let K be a finite Galois extension of F with group G, and let S be the integral closure of V in K. Let f:G\times G\mapsto K\setminus \{0\} be a normalized two-cocycle such that f(G\times G)\subseteq S\setminus \{0\}, but we do not require that f should take values in the group of multiplicative units of S. One can construct a crossed-product V-algebra A_f=\sum_{\sigma\in G}Sx_{\sigma} in a natural way, which is a V-order in the crossed-product F-algebra (K/F,G,f). If V is unramified and defectless in K, we show that A_f is semihereditary if and only if for all \sigma,\tau\in G and every maximal ideal M of S, f(\sigma,\tau)\not\in M^2. If in addition J(V) is not a principal ideal of V, then A_f is semihereditary if and only if it is an Azumaya algebra over V.
