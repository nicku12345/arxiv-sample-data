Let F be a field, let V be a valuation ring of F of arbitrary Krull dimension (rank), let K be a finite Galois extension of F with group G, and let S be the integral closure of V in K. Let f:G\times G\mapsto K\setminus \{0\} be a normalized two-cocycle such that f(G\times G)\subseteq S\setminus \{0\}, but we do not require that f should take values in the group of multiplicative units of S. One can construct a crossed-product V-order A_f=\sum_{\sigma\in G}Sx_{\sigma} with multiplication given by x_{\sigma}sx_{\tau}=\sigma(s)f(\sigma,\tau)x_{\sigma\tau} for s\in S, \sigma,\tau\in G. We characterize semihereditary and Dubrovin crossed-product orders, under mild valuation-theoretic assumptions placed on the nature of the extension K/F.
