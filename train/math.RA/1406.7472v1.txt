An element of a ring is unique clean if it can be uniquely written as the sum of an idempotent and a unit. A ring R is uniquely \pi-clean if some power of every element in R is uniquely clean. In this article, we prove that a ring R is uniquely \pi-clean if and only if for any a\in R, there exists an m\in {\Bbb N} and a central idempotent e\in R such that a^m-e\in J(R), if and only if R is abelian; every idempotent lifts modulo J(R); and R/P is torsion for all prime ideals P containing the Jacobson radical J(R). Further, we prove that a ring R is uniquely \pi-clean and J(R) is nil if and only if R is an abelian periodic ring, if and only if for any a\in R, there exists some m\in {\Bbb N} and a unique idempotent e\in R such that a^m-e\in P(R), where P(R) is the prime radical of R.
