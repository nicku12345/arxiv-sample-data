Swan (Pacific J. Math. 12(3) (1962), 1099-1106) characterized the parity of the number of irreducible factors of trinomials over F_2. Many researchers have recently obtained Swan-like results on determining the reducibility of polynomials over finite fields. In this paper, we determine the parity of the number of irreducible factors for so-called Type I pentanomial f(x)=x^m+x^{n+1}+x^n+x+1 over F_2 with even n. Our result is based on the Stickelberger-Swan theorem and Newton's formula which is very useful for the computation of the discriminant of a polynomial.
