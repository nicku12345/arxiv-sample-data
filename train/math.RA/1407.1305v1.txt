We consider the algebra E\otimes E over an infinite field equipped with a \mathbb{Z}_2-grading where the canonical basis is homogeneous and prove that in various cases the graded identites are just the ordinary ones. If the grading is a non-canonical grading obtained as a quotient grading of the natural \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2-grading we exhibit a basis for the graded identities.
