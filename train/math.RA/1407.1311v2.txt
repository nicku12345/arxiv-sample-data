Let f and g be two noncommutative polynomials in disjoint sets of variables. An algebra A is verbally prime if whenever f\cdot g is an identity for A then either f or g is also an identity. As an analogue of this property Regev proved that the verbally prime algebra M_k(F) of k\times k matrices over an infinite field F has the following primeness property for central polynomials: whenever the product f\cdot g is a central polynomial for M_k(F) then both f and g are central polynomials. In this paper we prove that over a field of characteristic zero Regev' s result holds for the verbally prime algebras M_k(E) and M_{k,k}(E), where E is the infinite dimensional Grassmann algebra.
