In this paper, we investigate the Leibniz triple system T and its universal Leibniz envelope U(T). The involutive automorphism of U(T) determining T is introduced, which gives a characterization of the \Z_2-grading of U(T). We give the relationship between the solvable radical R(T) of T and Rad(U(T)), the solvable radical of U(T). Further, Levi's theorem for Leibniz triple systems is obtained. Moreover, the relationship between the nilpotent radical of T and that of U(T) is studied. Finally, we introduce the notion   of representations of a Leibniz triple system.
