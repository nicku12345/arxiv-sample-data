Let U and V be finite-dimensional vector spaces over a (commutative) field \mathbb{K}, and \mathcal{S} be a linear subspace of the space \mathcal{L}(U,V) of all linear operators from U to V. A map F : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow V is called range-compatible when F(s) \in \text{Im}(s) for all s \in \mathcal{S}.   In a previous work, we have classified all the range-compatible group homomorphisms provided that \text{codim}(\mathcal{S}) \leq 2\,\text{dim}(V)-3, except in the special case when \mathbb{K} has only two elements and \text{codim}(\mathcal{S}) = 2\,\text{dim}(V)-3. In this article, we give a thorough treatment of that special case. Our results are partly based upon the recent classification of vector spaces of matrices with rank at most 2 over \mathbb{F}_2.   As an application, we classify the 2-dimensional non-reflexive operator spaces over any field, and the affine subspaces of \text{M}_{n,p}(\mathbb{K}) with lower-rank 2 and codimension 3.
