Arising from the classification of the matrix-roots of a nonnegative imprimitive irreducible matrix, we present results concerning the Jordan chains of an h-cyclic matrix. We also present ancillary results applicable to nonnegative imprimitive irreducible matrices and demonstrate these results via examples.
