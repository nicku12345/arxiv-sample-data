Using matrix function theory, Perron-Frobenius theory, combinatorial matrix theory, and elementary number theory, we characterize, classify, and describe in terms of the Jordan canonical form the matrix pth-roots of imprimitive irreducible nonnegative matrices. Preliminary results concerning the matrix roots of reducible matrices are provided as well.
