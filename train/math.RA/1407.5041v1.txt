The genus gen(D) of a finite-dimensional central division algebra D over a field F is defined as the collection of classes [D'] in the Brauer group Br(F), where D' is a central division F-algebra having the same maximal subfields as D. For any prime p, we construct a division algebra of degree p with infinite genus. Moreover, we show that there exists a field K such that there are infinitely many nonisomorphic central division K-algebras of degree p, and any two such algebras have the same genus.
