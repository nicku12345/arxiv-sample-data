It is known that the critical exponent (CE) for conventional, continuous powers of n-by-n doubly nonnegative (DN) matrices is n-2. Here, we consider the larger class of diagonalizable, entry-wise nonnegative n-by-n matrices with nonnegative eigenvalues (GDN). We show that, again, a CE exists and are able to bound it with a low-coefficient quadratic. However, the CE is larger than in the DN case; in particular, 2 for n=3. There seems to be a connection with the index of primitivity, and a number of other observations are made and questions raised. It is shown that there is no CE for continuous Hadamard powers of GDN matrices, despite it also being n-2 for DN matrices.
