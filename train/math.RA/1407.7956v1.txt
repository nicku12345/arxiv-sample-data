In this paper the description of solvable Lie algebras with triangular nilradicals is extended to Leibniz algebras. It is proven that the matrices of the left and right operators on elements of Leibniz algebra have upper triangular forms. We establish that solvable Leibniz algebra of a maximal possible dimension with a given triangular nilradical is a Lie algebra. Furthermore, solvable Leibniz algebras with triangular nilradicals of low dimensions are classified.
