An exchange ring R is separative provided that for all finitely generated projective right R-modules A and B, A\oplus A\cong A\oplus B\cong B\oplus B\Longrightarrow A\cong B. Let R be a separative exchange ring in which 2 is invertible, and let a-a^3\in R be regular. We prove, in this note, that a\in R is unit-regular if R(1-a^2)R=Rr(a)={\ell}(a). An element a in a ring R is special clean if there exists an idempotent e\in R such that a-e\in R is a unit and aR\bigcap eR=0. Furthermore, we prove that a\in R is special clean if aR/ar(a^2), R/\big(aR+r(a)\big) are projective, and R(a-a^3)R=Rar(a^2)=\ell (a^2)aR. These also extend the corresponding results in separative regular rings.
