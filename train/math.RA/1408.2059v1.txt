A vector-circulant matrix is a natural generalization of the classical circulant matrix and has applications in constructing additive codes. This article formulates the concept of a vector-circulant matrix over finite fields and gives an algebraic characterization for this kind of matrix. Finally, a construction of additive codes with vector-circulant based over \mathbb{F}_4 is given together with some examples of good half-rate additive codes.
