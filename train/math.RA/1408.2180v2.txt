Fix an algebraically closed field \F and an integer d \geq 3. Let V be a vector space over \F with dimension d+1. A Leonard pair on V is a pair of diagonalizable linear transformations A: V \to V and A^* : V \to V, each acting in an irreducible tridiagonal fashion on an eigenbasis for the other one. There is an object related to a Leonard pair called a Leonard system. It is known that a Leonard system is determined up to isomorphism by a sequence of scalars (\{\th_i\}_{i=0}^d, \{\th^*_i\}_{i=0}^d, \{\vphi_i\}_{i=1}^d, \{\phi_i\}_{i=1}^d), called its parameter array. The scalars \{\th_i\}_{i=0}^d (resp.\ \{\th^*_i\}_{i=0}^d) are mutually distinct, and the expressions (\th_{i-2} - \th_{i+1})/(\th_{i-1}-\th_{i}), (\th^*_{i-2} - \th^*_{i+1})/(\th^*_{i-1}-\th^*_{i}) are equal and independent of i for 2 \leq i \leq d-1. Write this common value as \beta+1. In the present paper, we consider the "end-parameters" \th_0, \th_d, \th^*_0, \th^*_d, \vphi_1, \vphi_d, \phi_1, \phi_d of the parameter array. We show that a Leonard system is determined up to isomorphism by the end-parameters and \beta. We display a relation between the end-parameters and \beta. Using this relation, we show that there are up to inverse at most \lfloor (d-1)/2 \rfloor Leonard systems that have specified end-parameters. The upper bound \lfloor (d-1)/2 \rfloor is best possible.
