Many rings and algebras arising in quantum mechanics can be interpreted as skew PBW (Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt) extensions. Indeed, Weyl algebras, enveloping algebras of finite-dimensional Lie algebras (and its quantization), Artamonov quantum polynomials, diffusion algebras, Manin algebra of quantum matrices, among many others, are examples of skew PBW extensions. In this short paper we study the d-Hermite condition about stably free modules for skew PBW extensions. For this purpose, we estimate the stable rank of these non-commutative rings. In addition, and close related with these questions, we will prove the Kronecker's theorem about the radical of finitely generated ideals for some particular types of skew PBW extensions.
