Let \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z}[G])) denote the group of central units in the integral group ring \mathbb{Z}[G] of a finite group G. A bound on the index of the subgroup generated by a virtual basis in \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z}[G])) is computed for a class of strongly monomial groups. The result is illustrated with application to the groups of order p^{n}, p prime, n \leq 4. The rank of \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z}[G])) and the Wedderburn decomposition of the rational group algebra of these p-groups have also been obtained.
