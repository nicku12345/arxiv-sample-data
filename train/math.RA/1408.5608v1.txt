A new class of rings, {\em the class of weakly left localizable rings}, is introduced. A ring R is called {\em weakly left localizable} if each non-nilpotent element of R is invertible in some left localization S^{-1}R of the ring R. Explicit criteria are given for a ring to be a weakly left localizable ring provided the ring has only finitely many maximal left denominator sets (eg, this is the case if a ring has a left Artinian left quotient ring). It is proved that a ring with finitely many maximal left denominator sets that satisfies some natural conditions is a weakly left localizable ring iff its left quotient ring is a direct product of finitely many local rings such that their radicals are nil ideals.
