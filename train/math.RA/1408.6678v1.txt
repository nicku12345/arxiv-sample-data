Let HV be the loop Heisenberg-Virasoro Lie algebra over \C with basis \{L_{\a,i},H_{\b,j}\,|\,\a,\,\b,i,j\in\Z\} and brackets [L_{\a,i},L_{\b,j}]=(\a-\b)L_{\a+\b,i+j}, [L_{\a,i},H_{\b,j}]=-\b H_{\a+\b,i+j},[H_{\a,i},H_{\b,j}]=0. In this paper, a formal distribution Lie algebra of HV is constructed. Then the associated conformal algebra CHV is studied, where CHV has a \C[\partial]-basis \{L_i,H_i\,|\,i\in\Z\} with \lambda-brackets [L_i\, {}_\lambda \, L_j]=(\partial+2\lambda) L_{i+j}, [L_i\, {}_\lambda \, H_j]=(\partial+\lambda) H_{i+j}, [H_i\, {}_\lambda \, L_j]=\lambda L_{i+j} and [H_i\, {}_\lambda \, H_j]=0. In particular, the conformal derivations of CHV are determined. Finally, rank one conformal modules and \Z-graded free intermediate series modules over CHV are classified.
