Let \mathbb{H} be the real quaternion algebra and \mathbb{H}^{n\times m} denote the set of all n\times m matrices over \mathbb{H}. In this paper, we construct a simultaneous decomposition of seven general real quaternion matrices with compatible sizes: A\in \mathbb{H}^{m\times n}, B\in \mathbb{H}^{m\times p_{1}},C\in \mathbb{H}^{m\times p_{2}},D\in \mathbb{H}^{m\times p_{3}},E\in \mathbb{H}^{q_{1}\times n},F\in \mathbb{H}^{q_{2}\times n},G\in \mathbb{H}^{q_{3}\times n}. As applications of the simultaneous matrix decomposition, we give solvability conditions, general solutions, as well as the range of ranks of the general solutions to the following two real quaternion matrix equations BXE+CYF+DZG=A and BX+WE+CYF+DZG=A, where A,B,C,D,E,F, and G are given real quaternion matrices.
