Non-abelian tensor product of Hom-Lie algebras is constructed and studied. This tensor product is used to describe universal (\alpha-)central extensions of Hom-Lie algebras and to establish a relation between cyclic and Milnor cyclic homologies of Hom-associative algebras satisfying certain additional condition.
