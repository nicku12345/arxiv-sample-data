In this paper we strengthen Kolchin's theorem ([1]) in the ordinary case.   It states that if a differential field E is finitely generated over a differential subfield F \subset E, trdeg_F E < \infty, and F contains a nonconstant, i.e. an element f such that f^{\prime} \neq 0, then there exists a \in E such that E is generated by a and F.   We replace the last condition with the existence of a nonconstant element in E.
