It is shown that for the restricted Zassenhaus algebra \mathfrak{W}=\mathfrak{W}(1,n), n>1, defined over an algebraically closed field \mathbb{F} of characteristic 2 any projective indecomposable restricted \mathfrak{W}-module has maximal possible dimension 2^{2^n-1}, and thus is isomorphic to some induced module \mathrm{ind}^{\mathfrak{W}}_{\mathfrak{t}}(\mathbb{F}(\mu)) for some torus of maximal dimension \mathfrak{t}. This phenomenon is in contrast to the behavior of finite-dimensional simple restricted Lie algebras in characteristic p>3.
