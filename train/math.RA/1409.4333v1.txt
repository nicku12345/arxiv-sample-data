Fix an algebraically closed field \mathbb{F} and an integer d \geq 3. Let V be a vector space over \mathbb{F} with dimension d+1. A Leonard pair on V is an ordered pair of diagonalizable linear transformations A: V \to V and A^* : V \to V, each acting in an irreducible tridiagonal fashion on an eigenbasis for the other one. Let \{v_i\}_{i=0}^d (resp.\ \{v^*_i\}_{i=0}^d) be such an eigenbasis for A (resp.\ A^*). For 0 \leq i \leq d define a linear transformation E_i : V \to V such that E_i v_i=v_i and E_i v_j =0 if j \neq i (0 \leq j \leq d). Define E^*_i : V \to V in a similar way. The sequence \Phi =(A, \{E_i\}_{i=0}^d, A^*, \{E^*_i\}_{i=0}^d) is called a Leonard system on V with diameter d. With respect to the basis \{v_i\}_{i=0}^d, let \{\th_i\}_{i=0}^d (resp.\ \{a^*_i\}_{i=0}^d) be the diagonal entries of the matrix representing A (resp.\ A^*). With respect to the basis \{v^*_i\}_{i=0}^d, let \{\theta^*_i\}_{i=0}^d (resp.\ \{a_i\}_{i=0}^d) be the diagonal entries of the matrix representing A^* (resp.\ A). It is known that \{\theta_i\}_{i=0}^d (resp. \{\th^*_i\}_{i=0}^d) are mutually distinct, and the expressions (\theta_{i-1}-\theta_{i+2})/(\theta_i-\theta_{i+1}), (\theta^*_{i-1}-\theta^*_{i+2})/(\theta^*_i - \theta^*_{i+1}) are equal and independent of i for 1 \leq i \leq d-2. Write this common value as \beta + 1. In the present paper we consider the "end-entries" \theta_0, \theta_d, \theta^*_0, \theta^*_d, a_0, a_d, a^*_0, a^*_d. We prove that a Leonard system with diameter d is determined up to isomorphism by its end-entries and \beta if and only if either (i) \beta \neq \pm 2 and q^{d-1} \neq -1, where \beta=q+q^{-1}, or (ii) \beta = \pm 2 and \text{Char}(\mathbb{F}) \neq 2.
