We investigate the theory of Hopf-Galois extensions for monoidal Hom-Hopf algebras. As the main result of this paper, we prove the Schneider's affineness theorems in the case of monoidal Hom-Hopf algebras in terms of the theory of the total integral and Hom-Hopf Galois extensions. In addition, we obtain the affineness criterion for relative Hom-Hopf module associated with faithfully flat Hom-Hopf Galois extensions.
