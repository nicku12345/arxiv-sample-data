Let R be a 2 torsion free semiprime ring and d a nonzero derivation. Further let A = O(R) be the orthogonal completion of R and B = B(C) the Boolean ring of C where C be the extended centroid of R. We show that if a[[d(x),x]^n- [y, d(y)]^m]^t = 0 such that a in R for all x, y in R, where m, n, t > 0 are fixed integers, then there exists an idempotent e in B such that eA is a commutative ring and d induce a zero derivation on (1-e)A.
