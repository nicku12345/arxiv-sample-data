The n-dimensional quantum torus is defined as the F-algebra generated by variables x_1, \cdots, x_n together with their inverses satisfying the relations x_ix_j = q_{ij}x_jx_i, where q_{ij} \in F. The Krull and global dimensions of this algebra are known to coincide and the common value is equal to the supremum of the rank of certain subgroups of \langle x_1, \cdots, x_n \rangle that can be associated with this algebra.   In this paper we study how these dimensions behave with respect to taking tensor products of quantum tori %over the base field. We derive a best possible upper bound for the dimension of such a tensor product and %deduce from this special cases in which the dimension is additive with respect to tensoring.
