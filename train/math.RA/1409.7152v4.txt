Let (A,\alpha) be a finite-dimensional Hom-Hopf algebra. In this paper we mainly construct the Drinfel'd double D(A)=(A^{op}\bowtie A^{\ast},\alpha\otimes(\alpha^{-1})^{\ast}) in the setting of Hom-Hopf algebras by two ways, one of which generalizes Majid's bicrossproduct for Hopf algebras (see \cite{M2}) and another one is to introduce the notion of dual pairs of of Hom-Hopf algebras. Then we study the relation between the Drinfel'd double D(A) and Heisenberg double H(A)=A\# A^{*}, generalizing the main result in \cite{Lu}. Especially, the examples given in the paper are not obtained from the usual Hopf algebras.
