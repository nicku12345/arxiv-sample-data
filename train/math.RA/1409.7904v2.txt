A ring R is periodic provided that for any a\ in R there exist distinct elements m,n \in {\Bbb N} such that a^m=a^n. We shall prove that periodicity is inherited by a type of generalized matrix rings.We define strongly periodic rings and determine completely the connections between these ones and periodic rings. Moreover, we characterize J-clean like rings and obtain the relations among these rings.
