Let F be a field and let F \langle X \rangle be the free unital associative F-algebra on the free generating set X = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots \}. A subalgebra (a vector subspace) V in F \langle X \rangle is called a T-subalgebra (a T-subspace) if \phi (V) \subseteq V for all endomorphisms \phi of F \langle X \rangle. For an algebra G, its central polynomials form a T-subalgebra C(G) in F \langle X \rangle. Over a field of characteristic p > 2 there are algebras G whose algebras of all central polynomials C (G) are not finitely generated as T-subspaces in F \langle X \rangle. However, no example of an algebra G such that C(G) is not finitely generated as a T-subalgebra is known yet.   In the present paper we construct the first example of a 2-graded unital associative algebra B over a field of characteristic p>2 whose algebra C_2 (B) of all 2-graded central polynomials is not finitely generated as a T_2-subalgebra in the free 2-graded unital associative F-algebra F \langle Y,Z \rangle. Here Y = \{ y_1, y_2, \dots \} and Z = \{ z_1, z_2, \dots \} are sets of even and odd free generators of F \langle Y,Z \rangle, respectively. We hope that our example will help to construct an algebra G whose algebra C(G) of (ordinary) central polynomials is not finitely generated as a T-subalgebra in F \langle X \rangle.
