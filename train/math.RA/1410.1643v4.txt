The category of quasi frames (or qframes) is introduced and studied. In the context of qframes we can jointly study problems related to the L-Surjunctivity and Stable Finiteness Conjectures. As a consequences of our main results, we can generalize some of the known results on these conjectures. In particular, let R be a ring, let G be a sofic group, fix a crossed product R*G and let N be a right R-module. It is proved that: (1) the endomorphism ring End_{R* G}(N\otimes_R R*G) is stably finite, provided N is finitely generated and has Krull dimension; (2) any linear cellular automaton \phi:N^G\to N^G is surjunctive, provided N is Artinian.
