The algebraic structures known as {\it Leavitt path algebras} were initially developed in 2004 by Ara, Moreno and Pardo, and almost simultaneously (using a different approach) by the author and Aranda Pino.   During the intervening decade, these algebras have attracted significant interest and attention, not only from ring theorists, but from analysts working in C^*-algebras, group theorists, and symbolic dynamicists as well. The goal of this article is threefold: to introduce the notion of Leavitt path algebras to the general mathematical community; to present some of the important results in the subject; and to describe some of the field's currently unresolved questions.
