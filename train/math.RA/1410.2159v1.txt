Let \mathbb{K} denote a field and let \mathfrak{X} denote a finite non-empty set. Let \text{Mat}_\mathfrak{X}(\mathbb{K}) denote the \mathbb{K}-algebra consisting of the matrices with entries in \mathbb{K} and rows and columns indexed by \mathfrak{X}. A matrix C \in \text{Mat}_\mathfrak{X}(\mathbb{K}) is called Cauchy whenever there exist mutually distinct scalars \{x_i\}_{i \in \mathfrak{X}}, \{\tilde{x}_i\}_{i \in \mathfrak{X}} from \mathbb{K} such that C_{ij} = (x_i - \tilde{x}_j)^{-1} for i, j \in \mathfrak{X}. In this paper, we give a linear algebraic characterization of a Cauchy matrix. To do so, we introduce the notion of a Cauchy pair. A Cauchy pair is an ordered pair of diagonalizable linear transformations (X, \tilde{X}) on a finite-dimensional vector space V such that X-\tilde{X} has rank 1 and such that there does not exist a proper subspace W of V such that X W \subseteq W and \tilde{X} W \subseteq W. Let V denote a vector space over \mathbb{K} with dimension |\mathfrak{X}|. We show that for every Cauchy pair (X, \tilde{X}) on V, there exists an X-eigenbasis \{v_i\}_{i \in \mathfrak{X}} for V and an \tilde{X}-eigenbasis \{w_i\}_{i \in \mathfrak{X}} for V such that the transition matrix from \{v_i\}_{i \in \mathfrak{X}} to \{w_i\}_{i \in \mathfrak{X}} is Cauchy. We show that every Cauchy matrix arises as a transition matrix for a Cauchy pair in this way. We give a bijection between the set of equivalence classes of Cauchy pairs on V and the set of permutation equivalence classes of Cauchy matrices in \text{Mat}_\mathfrak{X}(\mathbb{K}).
