We consider associative algebras with involution graded by a finite abelian group G over a field of characteristic zero. Suppose that the involution is compatible with the grading. We represent conditions permitting PI-representability of such algebras. Particularly, it is proved that a finitely generated (Z/qZ)-graded associative PI-algebra with involution satisfies exactly the same graded identities with involution as some finite dimensional (Z/qZ)-graded algebra with involution for any prime q or q = 4. This is an analogue of the theorem of A.Kemer for ordinary identities, and an extension of the result of the author for identities with involution. The similar results were proved also recentely for graded identities.
