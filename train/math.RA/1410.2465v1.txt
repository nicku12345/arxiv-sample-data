We classify the polynomials with integral coefficients that, when evaluated on a group element of finite order n, define a unit in the integral group ring for infinitely many positive integers n. We show that this happens if and only if the polynomial defines generic units in the sense of Marciniak and Sehgal. We also classify the polynomials with integral coefficients which provides units when evaluated on n-roots of a fixed integer a for infinitely many positive integers n.
