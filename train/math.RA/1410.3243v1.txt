We introduce Central McCoy rings, which are a generalization of McCoy rings and investigate their properties. For a ring R, we prove that R is right Central McCoy if and only if the polynomial ring R[x] is right Central McCoy. Also, we give some examples to show that if R is right Central McCoy, then Mn(R) and Tn(R) are not necessary right Central McCoy, but Dn(R) and Vn(R) are right Central McCoy, where Dn(R) and Vn(R) are the subrings of the triangular matrices with constant main diagonal and constant main diagonals, respectively.
