Given a groupoid < G, \star >, and k \geq 3, we say that G is antiassociative iff for all x_1, x_2, x_3 \in G, (x_1 \star x_2) \star x_3 and x_1 \star (x_2 \star x_3) are never equal. Generalizing this, < G, \star > is k-antiassociative iff for all x_1, x_2, ... x_k \in G, any two distinct expressions made by putting parentheses in x_1 \star x_2 \star x_3 \star ...x_k are never equal.   We prove that for every k \geq 3, there exist finite groupoids that are k-antiassociative. We then generalize this, investigating when other pairs of groupoid terms can be made never equal.
