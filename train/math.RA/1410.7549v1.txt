This work is a continuation of the description of some classes of nilpotent Zinbiel algebras. We focus on the study of Zinbiel algebras with restrictions to gradation and characteristic sequence. Namely, the classification of naturally graded Zinbiel algebras with characteristic sequence equal to  (n-p, p) is obtained.
