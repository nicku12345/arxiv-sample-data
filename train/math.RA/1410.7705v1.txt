The famous Jacobian conjecture asks if an endomorphism f of K[x,y] (K is a characteristic zero field) having a non-zero scalar Jacobian is invertible. Let \alpha be the exchange involution on K[x,y]: \alpha(x)= y and \alpha(y)= x. An \alpha-endomorphism f of K[x,y] is an endomorphism of K[x,y] that preserves the involution \alpha: f \alpha= \alpha f. It was shown that if f is an \alpha-endomorphism of K[x,y] having a non-zero scalar Jacobian, then f is invertible. Based on this, we bring more results that imply that a given endomorphism f having a non-zero scalar Jacobian and additional conditions involving involutions, is invertible.
