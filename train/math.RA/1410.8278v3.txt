Let  Aut_{mHH}(H) denote the set of all automorphisms of a monoidal Hopf algebra H with bijective antipode in the sense of Caenepeel and Goyvaerts \cite{CG2011}. The main aim of this paper is to provide new examples of braided T-category in the sense of Turaev \cite{T2008}. For this, first we construct a monoidal Hom-Hopf T-coalgebra \mathcal{MHD}(H) and prove that the T-category Rep(\mathcal{MHD}(H)) of representation of \mathcal{MHD}(H) is isomorphic to \mathcal {MHYD}(H) as braided T-categories, if H is finite-dimensional. Then we construct a new braided T-category \mathcal{ZMHYD}(H) over \mathbb{Z}, generalizing the main construction by Staic \cite{S2007}.
