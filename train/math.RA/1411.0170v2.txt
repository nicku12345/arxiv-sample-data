Since Leibniz algebras were introduced by Loday as a generalization of Lie algebras, there has been a lot of interest in which results of the latter extend to the former. Cyclic algebras, those generated by one element, are a useful tool for studying these concepts. In fact, they have no Lie algebra counterpart. Their simple structure lends itself to elegant counterexamples to the extension of several important results from Lie algebras to Leibniz algebras. In this paper, we give a classification of cyclic Leibniz algebras.
