An algebra L over a field \Bbb F, in which product is denoted by [\,,\,], is said to be \textit{ Lie type algebra} if for all elements a,b,c\in L there exist \alpha, \beta\in \Bbb F such that \alpha\neq 0 and [[a,b],c]=\alpha [a,[b,c]]+\beta[[a,c],b]. Examples of Lie type algebras are associative algebras, Lie algebras, Leibniz algebras, etc. It is proved that if a Lie type algebra L admits an automorphism of finite order n with finite-dimensional fixed-point subalgebra of dimension m, then L has a soluble ideal of finite codimension bounded in terms of n and m and of derived length bounded in terms of n.
