Let A be a commutative algebra over \mathbb C. Given a pointed simplicial finite set Y and q\in \mathbb C a primitive N-th root of unity, we define the q-Hochschild homology groups of A of order Y. When D is a derivation on A, we construct the corresponding Lie derivative on these groups. We also define the Lie derivative for a higher derivation \{D_n\}_{n\geq 0} on A. Finally, we describe the morphisms induced on the bivariant q-Hochschild cohomology groups of order Y by a derivation D on A.
