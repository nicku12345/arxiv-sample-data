Let D be an integral domain with quotient field K and \Omega a finite subset of D. McQuillan proved that the ring {\rm Int}(\Omega,D) of polynomials in K[X] which are integer-valued over \Omega, that is, f\in K[X] such that f(\Omega)\subset D, is a Pr\"ufer domain if and only if D is Pr\"ufer. Under the further assumption that D is integrally closed, we generalize his result by considering a finite set S of a D-algebra A which is finitely generated and torsion-free as a D-module, and the ring {\rm Int}_K(S,A) of integer-valued polynomials over S, that is, polynomials over K whose image over S is contained in A. We show that the integral closure of {\rm Int}_K(S,A) is equal to the contraction to K[X] of {\rm Int}(\Omega_S,D_F), for some finite subset \Omega_S of integral elements over D contained in an algebraic closure \bar K of K, where D_F is the integral closure of D in F=K(\Omega_S). Moreover, the integral closure of {\rm Int}_K(S,A) is Pr\"ufer if and only if D is Pr\"ufer. The result is obtained by means of the study of pullbacks of the form D[X]+p(X)K[X], where p(X) is a monic non-constant polynomial over D: we prove that the integral closure of such a pullback is equal to the ring of polynomials over K which are integral-valued over the set of roots \Omega_p of p(X) in \bar K.
