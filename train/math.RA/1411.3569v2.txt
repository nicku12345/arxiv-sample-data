We study the cluster monomials and cluster complex in \mathbb C[GL_n/N]. For we consider the {\em tableau basis} in \mathbb C[GL_n/N]. Namely, an element \Delta_T of the tableau basis labeled by a semistandard Young tableau T is the product of the flag minors corresponding to columns of T. Our main results state: (i) cluster monomials in \mathbb C[GL_n/N] can be labeled by semistandard Young tableaux such that any cluster monomial has the form \Delta_T+ lexicographically smaller terms; (ii) such labeling distinguish the cluster monomial; (iii) for any seed of the cluster algebra on \mathbb C[GL_n/N], we define a cone in \mathbf D(n) generated by tableaux which label the cluster variables of the seed, then these cones form a simlicial fan in \mathbf D(n) (\mathbf D(n) is linear isomorphic to the Gelfand Tseitlin cone).
