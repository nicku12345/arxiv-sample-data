Fix an arbitrary prime p. Let F be a field, containing a primitive p-th root of unity, with absolute Galois group G_F. The triple Massey product (in the mod-p Galois cohomology) is a partially defined, multi-valued function \langle \cdot,\cdot,\cdot \rangle: H^1(G_F)^3\rightarrow H^2(G_F). In this work we prove a conjecture made in [11] stating that any defined triple Massey product contains zero. As a result the pro-p groups appearing in [11] are excluded from being absolute Galois groups of fields F as above.
