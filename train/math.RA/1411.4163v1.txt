Let R be a commutative ring with 1\neq 0 and \Bbb{A}(R) be the set of ideals with nonzero annihilators. The annihilating-ideal graph of R is defined as the graph \Bbb{AG}(R) with the vertex set \Bbb{A}(R)^{*} = \Bbb{A}(R)\setminus \{(0)\} and two distinct vertices I and J are adjacent if and only if IJ = (0). In this paper, we first study the interplay between the diameter of annihilating-ideal graphs and zero-divisor graphs. Also, we characterize rings R when {\rm gr}(\Bbb{AG}(R))\geq 4, and so we characterize rings whose annihilating-ideal graphs are bipartite. Finally, in the last section we discuss on a relation between the Smarandache vertices and diameter of \Bbb {AG}(R).
