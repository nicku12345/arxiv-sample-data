We determine the skew fields of fractions of the enveloping algebra of the Lie superalgebra osp(1, 2) and of some significant subsu-peralgebras of the Lie superalgebra osp(1, 4). We compare the kinds of skew fields arising from this "super" context with the Weyl skew fields in the classical Gelfand-Kirillov property.
