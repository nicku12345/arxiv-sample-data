In this paper we investigate Leibniz algebras whose quotient Lie algebra is a naturally graded filiform Lie algebra n_{n,1}. We introduce a Fock module for the algebra n_{n,1} and provide classification of Leibniz algebras L whose corresponding Lie algebra L/I is the algebra n_{n,1} with condition that the ideal I is a Fock n_{n,1}-module, where I is the ideal generated by squares of elements from L.
