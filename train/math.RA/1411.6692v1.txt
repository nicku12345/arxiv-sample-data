We study the structures of arbitrary split \delta Jordan-Lie algebras with symmetric root systems. We show that any of such algebras L is of the form L = U + \sum\limits_{[j] \in \Lambda/\sim}I_{[j]} with U a subspace of H and any I_{[j]}, a well described ideal of L, satisfying [I_{[j]}, I_{[k]}] = 0 if [j]\neq [k]. Under certain conditions, the simplicity of L is characterized and it is shown that L is the direct sum of the family of its minimal ideals, each one being a simple split \delta Jordan-Lie algebra with a symmetric root system and having all its nonzero roots connected.
