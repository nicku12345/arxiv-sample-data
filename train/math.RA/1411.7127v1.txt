We first introduce the notion of Doi Hom-Hopf modules and find the sufficient condition for the category of Doi Hom-Hopf modules to be monoidal. Also we obtain the condition for the monoidal Hom-algebra and monoidal Hom-coalgebra to be monoidal Hom-bialgebras. Second, we give the maps between the underlying monoidal Hom-Hopf algebras, Hom-comodule algebras and Hom-module coalgebras give rise to functors between the category of Doi Hom-Hopf modules and study tensor identities for monodial categories of Doi Hom-Hopf modules. Furthermore, we construct a braiding on the category of Doi Hom-Hopf modules.   Finally, as an application of our theory, we consider the braiding on the category of Hom-modules, the category of Hom-comodules and the category of Hom-Yetter-Drinfeld modules respectively.
