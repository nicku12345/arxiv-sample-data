Let (H, \a) be a monoidal Hom-Hopf algebra and (A, \b) a right (H, \a)-Hom-comodule algebra. We first investigate the criterion for the existence of a total integral of (A, \b) in the setting of monoidal Hom-Hopf algebras. Also we prove that there exists a total integral \phi: (H, \a)\rightarrow (A, \b) if and only if any representation of the pair (H,A) is injective in a functorial way, as a corepresentation of (H, \a), which generalizes Doi's result. Finally, we define a total quantum integral \g: H\rightarrow Hom(H, A) and prove the following affineness criterion: if there exists a total quantum integral \g and the canonical map \psi: A\o_{B}A\rightarrow A\o H,\ \ a\o_{B}b\mapsto \b^{-1}(a)b_{[0]}\o \a(b_{[1]}) is surjective, then the induction functor A\o_B-: \widetilde{\mathscr{H}}(\mathscr{M}_k)_{B}\rightarrow \widetilde{\mathscr{H}}(\mathscr{M}_k)^{H}_{A} is an equivalence of categories.
