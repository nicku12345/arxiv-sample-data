We consider the following question posted by K.I. Beidar and A.V. Mikhalev in 1995 for an associative ring R=R_1+R_2: is it true that if the subrings R_1 and R_2 satisfy polynomial identities, then R also satisfies a polynomial identity? Over a field of positive characteristic we establish new conditions on R_1 and R_2 that guarantee a positive answer to the question. We find upper and low bounds on the degrees of identities of R.
