In this paper we introduce modules over both left and right Hom-alternative algebras. We give some constructions of left and right Hom-alternative modules and give various properties of both, as well as examples. Then, we prove that morphisms of left alternative algebras extend to morphisms of left Hom-alternative algebras. Next, we introduce comodules over Hom-Poisson coalgebras and show that we may obtain a structure map of a comodule over a Hom-Poisson coalgebra from a given one.
