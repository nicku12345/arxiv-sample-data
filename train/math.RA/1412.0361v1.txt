We study the algebraic constraints on the structure of nilpotent Lie algebra \mathbb{g}, which arise because of the presence of an integrable complex structure J. Particular attention is paid to non-abelian complex structures. Constructed various examples of positive graded Lie algebras with complex structures, in particular, we construct an infinite family \mathfrak{D}(n) of such algebras that we have for their nil-index s(\mathfrak{D}(n)):  s(\mathfrak{D}(n))=[ \frac{2}{3}\dim{\mathfrak{D}(n)} ].
