A structure of a left-symmetric algebra on the set of all derivations of a free algebra is introduced such that its commutator algebra becomes the usual Lie algebra of derivations. Left and right nilpotent elements of left-symmetric algebras of derivations are studied. Simple left-symmetric algebras of derivations and Novikov algebras of derivations are described. It is also proved that the positive part of the left-symmetric algebra of derivations of a free nonassociative symmetric m-ary algebra in one free variable is generated by one derivation and some right nilpotent derivations are described.
