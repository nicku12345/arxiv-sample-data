In [7, Papadima and Suciu, When does the associated graded Lie algebra of an arrangement group decompose? Comment. Math. Helv. {\bf 81:4} (2006), 859--875] it is proved that the holonomy Lie algebra of an arrangement of hyperplanes through origo decomposes as a direct product of Lie algebras in degree at least two if and only if a certain (computable) condition is fulfilled. We prove similar results for a class of Lie algebras which is a generalization of the holonomy Lie algebras. The proof methods are the same as in [7].
