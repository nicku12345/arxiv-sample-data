For a regular representation H \subseteq \text{Sym}_n of the generalized quaternion group of order n=4k, with k\geq 2, the monoid S_n(H) presented with generators a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_n and with relations a_1a_2\cdots a_n=a_{\sigma(1)}a_{\sigma(2)}\cdots a_{\sigma(n)}, for all \sigma\in H, is investigated. It is shown that S_n(H) has the two unique product property. As a consequence, for any field K, the monoid algebra K[S_n(H)] is a domain with trivial units which is semiprimitive.
