The class of finitely presented algebras over a field K with a set of generators a_{1},\ldots , a_{n} and defined by homogeneous relations of the form a_{1}a_{2}\cdots a_{n} =a_{\sigma (1)} a_{\sigma (2)} \cdots a_{\sigma (n)}, where \sigma runs through a subset H of the symmetric group \text{Sym}_{n} of degree n, is investigated. Groups H in which the cyclic group \langle (1,2, \ldots ,n) \rangle is a normal subgroup of index 2 are considered. Certain representations by permutations of the dihedral and semidihedral groups belong to this class of groups. A normal form for the elements of the underlying monoid S_n(H) with the same presentation as the algebra is obtained. Properties of the algebra are derived, it follows that it is an automaton algebra in the sense of Ufnarovski\u{\i}. The universal group G_n of S_n(H) is a unique product group, and it is the central localization of a cancellative subsemigroup of S_n(H). This, together with previously obtained results on such semigroups and algebras, is used to show that the algebra K[S_n(H)] is semiprimitive.
