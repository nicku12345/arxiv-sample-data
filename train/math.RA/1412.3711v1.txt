Let H be a subgroup of \text{Sym}_n, the symmetric group of degree n. For a fixed integer l \geq 2, the group G presented with generators x_1, x_2, \ldots ,x_n and with relations x_{i_1}x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_l} =x_{\sigma (i_1)} x_{\sigma (i_2)} \cdots x_{\sigma (i_l)}, where \sigma runs through H, is considered. It is shown that G has a free subgroup of finite index. For a field K, properties of the algebra K[G] are derived. In particular, the Jacobson radical \mathcal{J}(K[G]) is always nilpotent, and in many cases the algebra K[G] is semiprimitive. Results on the growth and the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of K[G] are given. Further properties of the semigroup S and the semigroup algebra K[S] with the same presentation are obtained, in case S is cancellative. The Jacobson radical is nilpotent in this case as well, and sufficient conditions for the algebra to be semiprimitive are given.
