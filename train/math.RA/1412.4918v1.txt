This article sets out to understand the categories \QGr A where A is either a monomial algebra or a path algebra of finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension. The principle questions are: 1) What is the structure of the point modules up to isomorphism in \QGr A? 2) When is \QGr A \equiv \QGr A'? These two questions turn out to be intimately related.   It is shown that up to isomorphism in \QGr A, there are only finitely many point modules and these give all the simple objects in the category. Then, a finite quiver E_A, which can be constructed from the algebra A rather simply, is associated to the category \QGr A. It is shown that the vertices of E_A are in bijection with the point modules and the arrows are determined by the extensions between point modules. Lastly, it is shown that \QGr A\equiv \QGr A' if and only if E_A=E_{A'}.
