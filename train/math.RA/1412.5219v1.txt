Let k be a field, Q a finite directed graph, and kQ its path algebra. Make kQ an \NN-graded algebra by assigning each arrow a positive degree. Let I be a homogeneous ideal in kQ and write A=kQ/I. Let \QGr A denote the quotient of the category of graded right A-modules modulo the Serre subcategory consisting of those graded modules that are the sum of their finite dimensional submodules. This paper shows there is a finite directed graph Q' with all its arrows placed in degree 1 and a homogeneous ideal I'\subset kQ' such that \QGr A \equiv \QGr kQ'/I'. This is an extension of a result obtained by the author and Gautam Sisodia.
