Kite pseudo effect algebras were recently introduced as a class of interesting examples of pseudo effect algebras using a po-group, an index set and two bijections on the index set. We represent kite pseudo effect algebras with a special kind of the Riesz decomposition property as an interval in a lexicographic extension of the po-group which solves an open problem on representation of kites. In addition, we introduce kite n-perfect pseudo effect algebras and we characterize subdirectly irreducible algebras which are building stones of the theory.
