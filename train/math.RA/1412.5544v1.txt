{Generalizing the notion of nil cleanness from \cite{D13}, in parallel to \cite{DM14}, we define the concept of {\it weak nil cleanness} for an arbitrary ring. Its comprehensive study in different ways is provided as well. A decomposition theorem of a weakly nil-clean ring is obtained. It is completely characterized when an abelian ring is {\it weakly nil-clean}.} It is also completely determined when a matrix ring over a division ring is weakly nil-clean.
