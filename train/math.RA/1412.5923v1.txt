Let L/K be a finite Galois extension of fields with group \Gamma. Associated to each Hopf-Galois structure on L/K is a group G of the same order as the Galois group \Gamma. The type of the Hopf-Galois structure is by definition the isomorphism type of G. We investigate the extent to which general properties of either of the groups \Gamma and G constrain those of the other. Specifically, we show that if G is nilpotent then \Gamma is soluble, and that if \Gamma is abelian then G is soluble. The proof of the latter result depends on the classification of finite simple groups. In contrast to these results, we give some examples where the groups \Gamma and G have different composition factors. In particular, we show that a soluble extension may admit a Hopf-Galois structure of insoluble type.
