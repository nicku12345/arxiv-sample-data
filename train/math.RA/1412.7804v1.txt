In this paper, we present some basic properties concerning the derivation algebra {\rm Der}(T), the quasiderivation algebra {\rm QDer}(T) and the generalized derivation algebra {\rm GDer}(T) of a Lie triple system T, with the relationship {\rm Der}(T)\subseteq {\rm QDer}(T)\subseteq {\rm GDer}(T)\subseteq {\rm End}(T). Furthermore, we completely determine those Lie triple systems T with condition {\rm QDer}(T)={\rm End}(T). We also show that the quasiderivations of T can be embedded as derivations in a larger Lie triple system.
