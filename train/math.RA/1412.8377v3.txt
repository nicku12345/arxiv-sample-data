The purpose of this paper is to classify all p-nilpotent restricted Lie algebras of dimension 5 over perfect fields of characteristic p\geq 5. Our work builds upon the recent work of Schneider and Usefi on the classification of p-nilpotent restricted Lie algebras of dimension up to 4 over perfect fields of characteristic p. The method we use here to classify p-nilpotent restricted Lie algebras is the analogue of Skjelbred-Sund method for classifying nilpotent Lie algebras.
