The n-dimensional quantum torus \Lambda is defined to be the F-algebra generated by variables y_1, \cdots, y_n with the relations y_iy_j = q_{ij}y_jy_i where q_{ij} are suitable scalars from the base field. This algebra is also the twisted group algebra of the free abelian group A on n generators. Each subgroup of corresponds to a sub-algebra of the quanutm torus. A may contain non-trivial subgroups B so that the corresponding sub-algebra is commutative.   In this paper we show that whenever the quantum torus \Lambda has center F, a \Lambda module M that is finitely generated over such a commutative sub-algebra U is necessarily torsion-free over U and has finite length. We also show that M has finite length.   We also apply tbis result to modules over infinite nilpotent groups of class 2.
