In this paper, we first generalize the theorem about the existence of an enveloping action to a partial twisted smash product. Second, we construct a Morita context between the partial twisted smash product and the twisted smash product related to the enveloping action. Furthermore, we show some results relating partial actions and partial representations over the partial twisted smash products, which generalize the results of Alves and Batista (Comm. Algebra, 38(8): 2872-2902, 2010). Finally, we present versions of the duality theorems of Blattner-Montgomery for partial twisted smash products.
