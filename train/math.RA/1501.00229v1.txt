We study a twisted generalization of Novikov superalgebras, called Hom-Novikov superalgebras. It is shown that two classes of Hom-Novikov superalgebras can be constructed from Hom-supercommutative algebras together with derivations and Hom-Novikov superalgebras with Rota-Baxter operators, respectively. We show that quadratic Hom-Novikov superalgebras are Hom-associative superalgebras and the sub-adjacent Hom-Lie superalgebras of   Hom-Novikov superalgebras are 2-step nilpotent. Moreover, we develop the 1-parameter formal deformation theory of Hom-Novikov superalgebras.
