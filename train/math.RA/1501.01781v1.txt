Let E be an arbitrary graph, K be any field and let L be the corresponding Leavitt path algebra. Necessary and sufficient conditions (which are both algebraic and graphical) are given under which all the irreducible representations of L are finitely presented. In this case, the graph E turns out to be row finite and the cycles in E form an artinian partial ordered set under a defined preorder. When the graph E is finite, the above graphical conditions were shown to be equivalent to the algebra L having finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension in a paper by Alahmadi, Alsulami, Jain and Zelmanov. Examples are constructed showing that this equivalence no longer holds if the graph is infinite and a complete description is obtained of Leavitt path algebras over arbitrary graphs having finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension
