We define a generalization \mathfrak{G} of the Grassmann algebra G which is well-behaved over arbitrary commutative rings C, even when 2 is not invertible. In particular, this enables us to define a notion of superalgebras that does not become degenerate in such a setting. Using this construction we are able to provide a basis of the non-graded multilinear identities of the free superalgebra with supertrace, valid over any ring.   We also show that all identities of \mathfrak{G} follow from the Grassmann identity, and explicitly give its co-modules, which turn out to be generalizations of the sign representation. In particular, we show that the co-module is a free C-module of rank 2^{n-1}.
