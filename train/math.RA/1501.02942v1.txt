The polynomials with quaternion coefficients have two kind of roots: isolated and spherical. A spherical root generates a class of roots which contains only one complex number z and its conjugate \bar{z}, and this class can be determined by z. In this paper, we deal with the complex roots of quaternion polynomials. More precisely, using B\'{e}zout matrices, we give necessary and sufficient conditions, for a quaternion polynomial to have a complex root, a spherical root, and a complex isolated root. Moreover, we compute a bound for the size of the roots of a quaternion polynomial.
