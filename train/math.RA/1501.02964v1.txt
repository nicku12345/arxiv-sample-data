A *-ring R is called (strongly) *-clean if every element of R is the sum of a projection and a unit (which commute with each other). In this note, some properties of *-clean rings are considered. In particular, a new class of *-clean rings which called strongly \pi-*-regular are introduced. It is shown that R is strongly \pi-*-regular if and only if R is \pi-regular and every idempotent of R is a projection if and only if R/J(R) is strongly regular with J(R) nil, and every idempotent of R/J(R) is lifted to a central projection of R. In addition, the stable range conditions of *-clean rings are discussed, and equivalent conditions among *-rings related to *-cleanness are obtained.
