We present some new conditions for a B\acute{e}zout ring to be an elementary divisor ring. We prove, in this note, that a B\acute{e}zout ring R is feckly zero-adequate if and only if R/J(R) is regular if and only if R/J(R) is \pi-regular, and that every feckly zero-adequate ring is an elementary divisor ring. If R has feckly adequate range 1, we prove that R is an elementary divisor ring if and only if R is a B\acute{e}zout ring. Many known results are thereby generalized to much wider class of rings, e.g. [4, Theorem 14], [5, Theorem 4], [8, Theorem 1.2.14], [10, Theorem 4] and [11, Theorem 7]. \vskip3mm {\bf Keywords:} Elementary divisor ring, B\acute{e}zout ring, Feckly zero-adequate ring, Feckly adequate range 1.
