We consider the partition lattice \Pi_\kappa on any set of transfinite cardinality \kappa and properties of \Pi_\kappa whose analogues do not hold for finite cardinalities. Assuming the Axiom of Choice we prove: (I) the cardinality of any maximal well-ordered chain is always exactly \kappa; (II) there are maximal chains in \Pi_\kappa of cardinality > \kappa; (III) if, for every cardinal \lambda < \kappa, we have 2^{\lambda} < 2^\kappa, there exists a maximal chain of cardinality < 2^{\kappa} (but \ge \kappa) in \Pi_{2^\kappa}; (IV) every non-trivial maximal antichain in \Pi_\kappa has cardinality between \kappa and 2^{\kappa}, and these bounds are realized. Moreover we can construct maximal antichains of cardinality \max(\kappa, 2^{\lambda}) for any \lambda \le \kappa; (V) all cardinals of the form \kappa^\lambda with 0 \le \lambda \le \kappa occur as the number of complements to some partition \mathcal{P} \in \Pi_\kappa, and only these cardinalities appear. Moreover, we give a direct formula for the number of complements to a given partition; (VI) Under the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis, the cardinalities of maximal chains, maximal antichains, and numbers of complements are fully determined, and we provide a complete characterization.
