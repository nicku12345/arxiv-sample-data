Let E be a field of absolute Brauer dimension abrd(E), and F/E a transcendental finitely-generated extension. This paper shows that the Brauer dimension Brd(F) is infinite, if abrd(E) = \infty . When the absolute Brauer p-dimension abrd_{p}(E) is infinite, for some prime number p, it proves that for each pair (n, m) of integers with n \ge m > 0, there is a central division F-algebra of Schur index p ^{n} and exponent p ^{m}. Lower bounds on the Brauer p-dimension Brd_{p}(F) are obtained in some important special cases where abrd_{p}(E) < \infty . These results solve negatively a problem posed by Auel et al. (Transf. Groups {\bf 16}: 219-264, 2011).
