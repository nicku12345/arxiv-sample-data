This article introduces patterns of ideals of numerical semigroups, thereby unifying previous definitions of patterns of numerical semigroups. Several results of general interest are proved. More precisely, this article presents results on the structure of the image of patterns of ideals, and also on the structure of the sets of patterns admitted by a given ideal.
