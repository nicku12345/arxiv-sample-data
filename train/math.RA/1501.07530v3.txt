The impetus for this study is the work of Dumas and Rigal on the Jordanian deformation of the ring of coordinate functions on 2\times 2 matrices. We are also motivated by current interest in birational equivalence of noncommutative rings. Recognizing the construction of the Jordanian matrix algebra as a skew polynomial ring, we construct a family of algebras relative to differential operator rings over a polynomial ring in one variable which are birationally equivalent to the Weyl algebra over a polynomial ring in two variables.
