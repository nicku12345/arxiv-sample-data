Let R be a commutative ring with nonzero identity and I a proper ideal of R. The {\it ideal-based zero-divisor graph} of R with respect to the ideal I, denoted by \Gamma_I(R), is the graph on vertices \{x \in R\setminus I \mid xy\in I for some y\in R\setminus I \}, where distinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if xy\in I. In this paper, we classify when an ideal-based zero-divisor graph of a commutative ring is complemented or uniquely complemented.
