Since 1976, it is known from the paper by V. P. Belkin that the variety \mathrm{RA_2} of right alternative metabelian (solvable of index 2) algebras over an arbitrary field is not Spechtian (contains non-finitely based subvarieties). In 2005, S. V. Pchelintsev proved that the variety generated by the Grassmann \mathrm{RA_2}-algebra of finite rank r over a field \mathcal{F}, for \mathrm{char}(\mathcal{F})\neq2, is Spechtian iff r=1. We construct a non-finitely based variety \mathfrak{M} generated by the Grassmann \mathcal{V}-algebra of rank 2 of certain finitely based subvariety \mathcal V\subset\mathrm{RA}_2 over a field \mathcal{F}, for \mathrm{char(\mathcal{F})}\neq2,3, such that \mathfrak{M} can also be generated by the Grassmann envelope of a five-dimensional superalgebra with one-dimensional even part.
