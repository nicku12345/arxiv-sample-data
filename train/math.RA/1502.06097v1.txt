In this note we consider the monoid \mathcal{PODI}_n of all monotone partial permutations on \{1,\ldots,n\} and its submonoids \mathcal{DP}_n, \mathcal{POI}_n and \mathcal{ODP}_n of all partial isometries, of all order-preserving partial permutations and of all order-preserving partial isometries, respectively. We prove that both the monoids \mathcal{POI}_n and \mathcal{ODP}_n are quotients of bilateral semidirect products of two of their remarkable submonoids, namely of extensive and of co-extensive transformations. Moreover, we show that \mathcal{PODI}_n is a quotient of a semidirect product of \mathcal{POI}_n and the group \mathcal{C}_2 of order two and, analogously, \mathcal{DP}_n is a quotient of a semidirect product of \mathcal{ODP}_n and \mathcal{C}_2.
