Using the well-known equivalence between meet-completions of posets and standard closure operators we show a general method for constructing meet-completions for isotone poset expansions. With this method we find a meet-completion for ordered domain algebras which simultaneously serves as the base of a representation for such algebras, thereby proving that ordered domain algebras have the finite representation property. We show that many of the equations defining ordered domain algebras are preserved in this completion but associativity, (D2) and (D6) can fail.
