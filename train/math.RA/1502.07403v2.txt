Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic not 2 or 3, V a 3-dimensional vector space over k, R a 3-dimensional subspace of V \otimes V, and TV/(R) the quotient of the tensor algebra on V by the ideal generated by R. Raf Bocklandt proved that if TV/(R) is 3-Calabi-Yau, then it is isomorphic to J({\sf{w}}), the "Jacobian algebra" of some {\sf{w}} \in V^{\otimes 3}. This paper classifies the {\sf{w}}\in V^{\otimes 3} such that J({\sf{w}}) is 3-Calabi-Yau. The classification depends on how {\sf{w}} transforms under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on V^{\otimes 3} and on the nature of the subscheme \{\overline{{\sf{w}}}=0\} \subseteq \mathbb{P}^2 where \overline{{\sf{w}}} denotes the image of {\sf{w}} in the symmetric algebra SV. Surprisingly, as {\sf{w}} ranges over V^{\otimes 3}-\{0\}, only nine isomorphism classes of algebras appear as non-3-Calabi-Yau J({\sf{w}})'s.
