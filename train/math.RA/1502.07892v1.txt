We obtain classification of the irreducible bimodules over the Jordan superalgebra Kan(n), the Kantor double of the Grassmann Poisson superalgebra G_n on n odd generators, for all n \geq 2 and an algebraically closed field of characteristic \ne 2. This generalizes the corresponding result of C.Mart\'inez and E.Zelmanov announced in \cite{MZ2} for n>4 and a field of characteristic zero.}
