Recently J.A.Anquela, T.Cort\'es, and H.Petersson proved that for elements x, y in a non-degenerate Jordan algebra J, the relation x \circ y = 0 implies that the U-operators of x and y commute: U_xU_y = U_yU_x. We show that the result may be not true without the assumption on non-degeneracity of J. We give also a more simple proof of the mentioned result in the case of linear Jordan algebras, that is, when char\, F\neq 2.
