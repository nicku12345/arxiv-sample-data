A quantum {\mathbb P}^3 is a noncommutative analogue of a polynomial ring on four variables, and, herein, it is taken to be a regular algebra of global dimension four. It is well known that if a generic quadratic quantum {\mathbb P}^3 exists, then it has a point scheme consisting of exactly twenty distinct points and a one-dimensional line scheme. In this article, we compute the line scheme of a family of algebras whose generic member is a candidate for a generic quadratic quantum {\mathbb P}^3. We find that, as a closed subscheme of {\mathbb P}^5, the line scheme of the generic member is the union of seven curves; namely, a nonplanar elliptic curve in a {\mathbb P}^3, four planar elliptic curves and two nonsingular conics.
