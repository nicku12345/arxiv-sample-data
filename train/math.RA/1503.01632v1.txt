Given a finitely generated free monoid X and a morphism \phi : X\to X, we show that one can construct an algebra, which we call an iterative algebra, in a natural way. We show that many ring theoretic properties of iterative algebras can be easily characterized in terms of linear algebra and combinatorial data from the morphism and that, moreover, it is decidable whether or not an iterative algebra has these properties. Finally, we use our construction to answer several questions of Greenfeld, Leroy, Smoktunowicz, and Ziembowski by constructing a primitive graded nilpotent algebra with Gelfand-Kirillov dimension two that is finitely generated as a Lie algebra.
