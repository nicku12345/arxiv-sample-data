In this paper we investigate extended modules for a special class of Ore extensions. We will assume that R is a ring and A will denote the Ore extension A:=R[x_1,\dots,x_n;\sigma] for which \sigma is an automorphism of R, x_ix_j=x_jx_i and x_ir=\sigma(r)x_i, for every 1\leq i,j\leq n. With some extra conditions over the ring R, we will prove Vaserstein's, Quillen's patching, Horrocks' and Quillen-Suslin's theorems for this type of non-commutative rings.
