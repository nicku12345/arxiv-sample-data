Recently G. Bhattacharyya, S.Y. Song and R. Tanaka began to study Terwilliger algebras of wreath products of one-class association schemes. K. Kim determined the structure of Terwilliger algebras of wreath products by one-class association schemes or quasi-thin schemes. In this paper, we study Terwilliger algebras of wreath products by 3-equivalenced schemes.
