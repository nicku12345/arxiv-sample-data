Faithful representations of regular \ast-rings and modular complemented lattices with involution within orthosymmetric sesquilinear spaces are studied within the framework of Universal Algebra. In particular, the correspondence between classes of spaces and classes of representables is analyzed; for a class of spaces which is closed under ultraproducts and non-degenerate finite dimensional subspaces, the latter are shown to be closed under complemented [regular] subalgebras, homomorphic images, and ultraproducts and being generated by those members which are associated with finite dimensional spaces. Under natural restrictions, this is refined to a 1-1-correspondence between the two types of classes.
