A finite algebra \bA=\alg{A;\cF} is \emph{dualizable} if there exists a discrete topological relational structure \BA=\alg{A;\cG;\cT}, compatible with \cF, such that the canonical evaluation map e\_{\bB}\colon \bB\to \Hom( \Hom(\bB,\bA),\BA) is an isomorphism for every \bB in the quasivariety generated by \bA. Here, e\_{\bB} is defined by e\_{\bB}(x)(f)=f(x) for all x\in B and all f\in \Hom(\bB,\bA).   We prove that, given a finite congruence-modular Abelian algebra \bA, the set of all relations compatible with \bA, up to a certain arity, \emph{entails} the whole set of all relations compatible with \bA. By using a classical compactness result, we infer that \bA is dualizable. Moreover we can choose a dualizing alter-ego with only relations of arity \le 1+\alpha^3, where \alpha is the largest exponent of a prime in the prime decomposition of \card{A}.   This improves Kearnes and Szendrei result that modules are dualizable, and Bentz and Mayr's result that finite modules with constants are dualizable. This also solves a problem stated by Bentz and Mayr in 2013.
