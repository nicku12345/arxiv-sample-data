Let R be a ring and \sigma an endomorphism of R. In this note, we study skew polynomial rings and skew power series rings over idempotent reflexive rings and abelian rings. Also, we introduce the concept of right (resp., left) \sigma-idempotent reflexive rings which generalizes right (resp., left) idempotent reflexive rings and \sigma-abelian rings. Certain results are obtained as corollaries from our results.
