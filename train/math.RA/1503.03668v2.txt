Within the framework of the theory of the column and row determinants, we obtain new determinantal representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse over the quaternion skew field. We give determinantal representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse by using previously introduced determinantal representations of the Drazin inverse, the Moore-Penrose inverse, and the limit representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse in some special case.
