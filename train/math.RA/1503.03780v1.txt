Our aim in this thesis is to use the language of deformation-quantization to understand certain quantized algebras by looking at properties of the corresponding commutative ones, and conversely to obtain results about the commutative algebras (upon which a Poisson structure is induced) using existing results for the non-commutative ones. We consider two main cases: firstly, the division ring of fractions of the quantum plane, which we view as a deformation of the commutative field of rational functions in two variables with respect to the bracket \{x,y\} = xy, and secondly, quantum matrices and their semi-classical limits. In particular, we use the theory of H-stratification to study the Poisson-prime and Poisson-primitive ideals of \mathcal{O}(GL_3) and \mathcal{O}(SL_3), and compare this to the corresponding results for quantum matrices.
