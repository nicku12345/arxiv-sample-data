We consider an evolution algebra which corresponds to a bisexual population with a set of females partitioned into finitely many different types and the males having only one type. For such algebras in terms of its structure constants we calculate right and plenary periods of generator elements. Some results on subalgebras of EACP and ideals on low-dimensional EACP are obtained.
