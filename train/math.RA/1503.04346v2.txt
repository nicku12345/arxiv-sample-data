Let (F,\le) be an ordered field and let A,B be square matrices over F of the same size. We say that A and B belong to the same archimedean class if there exists an integer r such that the matrices r A^T A-B^T B and r B^T B-A^T A are positive semidefinite with respect to \le. We show that this is true if and only if A=CB for some invertible matrix C such that all entries of C and C^{-1} are bounded by some integer. We also show that every archimedean class contains a row echelon form and that its shape and archimedean classes (in F) of its pivots are uniquely determined. For matrices over fields of formal Laurent series we construct a canonical representative in each archimedean class. The set of all archimedean classes is shown to have a natural lattice structure while the semigroup structure does not come from matrix multiplication. Our motivation comes from noncommutative real algebraic geometry and noncommutative valuation theory.
