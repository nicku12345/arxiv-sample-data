A necessary and sufficient condition for a central simple algebra with involution over a field of characteristic two to be decomposable as a tensor product of quaternion algebras with involution, in terms of its Frobenius subalgebras, is given. It is also proved that a bilinear Pfister form, recently introduced by A. Dolphin, can classify totally decomposable central simple algebras of orthogonal type.
