The mod-p cohomology ring of a non-trivial finite p-group is an infinite dimensional, finitely presented graded unital algebra over the field with p elements, with generators in positive degrees. We describe an effective algorithm to test if two such algebras are graded isomorphic. As application, we determine all graded isomorphisms between the mod-p cohomology rings of all p-groups of order at most 100.
