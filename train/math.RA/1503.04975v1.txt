We discuss the free cyclic submodules over an associative ring R with unity. Special attention is paid to those, which are generated by outliers. This paper describes all orbits of such submodules in the ring of lower triangular 3x3 matrices over a field F under the action of the general linear group. Besides rings with outliers generating free cyclic submodules, there are also rings with outliers generating only torsion cyclic submodules and without any outliers. We give examples of all cases.
