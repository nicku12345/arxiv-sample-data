Fix an algebraically closed field \mathbb{F} and an integer n \geq 1. Let \text{Mat}_n(\mathbb{F}) denote the \mathbb{F}-algebra consisting of the n \times n matrices that have all entries in \mathbb{F}. We consider a pair of diagonalizable matrices in \text{Mat}_{n}(\mathbb{F}), each acting in an irreducible tridiagonal fashion on an eigenbasis for the other one. Such a pair is called a Leonard pair in \text{Mat}_{n}(\mathbb{F}). In the present paper, we find all Leonard pairs A,A^* in \text{Mat}_{n}(\mathbb{F}) such that each of A and A^* is irreducible tridiagonal with all diagonal entries 0. This solves a problem given by Paul Terwilliger.
