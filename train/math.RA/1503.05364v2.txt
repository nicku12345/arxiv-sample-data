Let A be a unital associative algebra over a field k, E a vector space and \pi : E \to A a surjective linear map with V = {\rm Ker} (\pi). All algebra structures on E such that \pi : E \to A becomes an algebra map are described and classified by an explicitly constructed global cohomological type object {\mathbb G} {\mathbb H}^{2} \, (A, \, V). Any such algebra is isomorphic to a Hochschild product A \star V, an algebra introduced as a generalization of a classical construction. We prove that {\mathbb G} {\mathbb H}^{2} \, (A, \, V) is the coproduct of all non-abelian cohomologies {\mathbb H}^{2} \, \, (A, \, (V, \cdot)). The key object {\mathbb G} {\mathbb H}^{2} \, (A, \, k) responsible for the classification of all co-flag algebras is computed. All Hochschild products A \star k are also classified and the automorphism groups {\rm Aut}_{\rm Alg} (A \star k) are fully determined as subgroups of a semidirect product A^* \, \ltimes \bigl(k^* \times {\rm Aut}_{\rm Alg} (A) \bigl) of groups. Several examples are given as well as applications to the theory of supersolvable coalgebras or Poisson algebras. In particular, for a given Poisson algebra P, all Poisson algebras having a Poisson algebra surjection on P with a 1-dimensional kernel are described and classified.
