In this paper, we prove some relations between Fibonacci elements in an arbitrary algebra. Moreover, we define imaginary Fibonacci quaternions and imaginary Fibonacci octonions and we prove that always three arbitrary imaginary Fibonacci quaternions are linear independents and the mixed product of three arbitrary imaginary Fibonacci octonions is zero.
