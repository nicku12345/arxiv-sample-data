We develop a mechanism for classication of isomorphism types of non-trivial semisimple Hopf algebras whose group of grouplikes G(H) is abelian of prime index p which is the smallest prime divisor of |G(H)|. We describe structure of the second cohomology group of extensions of \k C_p by \k^G where C_p is a cyclic group of order p and G a finite abelian group. We carry out an explicit classification for Hopf algebras of this kind of dimension p^4 for any odd prime p. The ground field is algebraically closed of characteristic 0.
