The representation and cohomology theory of Hom-Lie-Yamaguti algebras is introduced. As an application, we study deformation and extension of Hom-Lie-Yamaguti algebras. It proved that a 1-parameter infinitesimal deformation of a Hom-Lie-Yamaguti algebra T corresponds to a Hom-Lie-Yamaguti algebra of deformation type and a (2,3)-cocycle of T with coefficients in the adjoint representation. We also prove that abelian extensions of Hom-Lie-Yamaguti algebras are classified by the (2,3)-cohomology group.
