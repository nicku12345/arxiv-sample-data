We provide new characterizations of pseudo-Frobenius and quasi-Frobenius rings in terms of tight modules. In the process, we also provide fresh perspectives on FGF and CF conjectures. In particular, we propose new natural extensions of these conjectures which connect them with the classical theory of PF rings. Our techniques are mainly based on set-theoretic counting arguments initiated by Osofsky. Several corollaries and examples to illustrate their applications are given.
