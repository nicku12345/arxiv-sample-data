Albert's classical construction of twisted fields generates unital division algebras out of cyclic field extensions. We apply a generalized version to unital division algebras with a multiplicative norm and give conditions for the resulting twisted algebras to be division. Four- and eight-dimensional real unital division algebras with large derivation algebras are constructed out of Hamilton's quaternion and Cayley's octonion algebra.
