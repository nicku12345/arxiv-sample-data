We study the tensor product of an associative and a nonassociative cyclic algebra. The condition for the tensor product to be a division algebra equals the classical one for the tensor product of two associative cyclic algebras by Albert or Jacobson, if the base field contains a suitable root of unity. Stronger conditions are obtained in special cases. Applications to space-time block coding are discussed.
