Effect algebras, introduced by Foulis and Bennett in 1994, are partial algebras which generalize some well known classes of algebraic structures (for example orthomodular lattices, MV algebras, orthoalgebras etc.). In the present paper, we introduce a new class of effect algebras, called {\em homogeneous effect algebras}. This class includes orthoalgebras, lattice ordered effect algebras and effect algebras satisfying Riesz decomposition property. We prove that every homogeneous effect algebra is a union of its blocks, which we define as maximal sub-effect algebras satisfying Riesz decomposition property. This generalizes a recent result by Rie\v{c}anov\'a, in which lattice ordered effect algebras were considered. Moreover, the notion of a block of a homogeneous effect algebra is a generalization of the notion of a block of an orthoalgebra. We prove that the set of all sharp elements in a homogeneous effect algebra E forms an orthoalgebra E_S. Every block of E_S is the center of a block of E. The set of all sharp elements in the compatibility center of E coincides with the center of E. Finally, we present some examples of homogeneous effect algebras and we prove that for a Hilbert space \mathbb H with dim(\mathbb H)>1, the standard effect algebra \mathcal E(\mathbb H) of all effects in \mathbb H is not homogeneous.
