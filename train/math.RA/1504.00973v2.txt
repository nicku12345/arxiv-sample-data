Let f(Z)=Z^n-a_{1}Z^{n-1}+\cdots+(-1)^{n-1}a_{n-1}Z+(-1)^na_n be a monic polynomial with coefficients in a ring~R with identity, not necessarily commutative. We study the ideal I_f of R[X_1,\dots,X_n] generated by \sigma_i(X_1,\dots,X_n)-a_{i}, where \sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n are the elementary symmetric polynomials, as well as the quotient ring R[X_1,\dots,X_n]/I_f.
