Classification and invariants, with respect to basis changes, of finite dimensional algebras are considered. An invariant open, dense (in the Zariscki topology) subset of the space of structural constants is defined. The algebras with structural constants from this set are classified and a basis to the field of invariant rational functions of structural constants is provided.
