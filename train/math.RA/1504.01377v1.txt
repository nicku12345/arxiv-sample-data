In this paper, we introduce symmetric diagram matrices A_{s+r,s} of size {_{(s+r)}}C_s whose entries are \{x_i\}_{min\{s,r\}}. We compute the eigenvalues of symmetric diagram matrices using elementary row and column operations inductively. As a byproduct, we obtain the eigenvalues of Gram matrices of a larger class of diagram algebras like the signed partition algebras, algebra of \mathbb{Z}_2 relations and partition algebras.
