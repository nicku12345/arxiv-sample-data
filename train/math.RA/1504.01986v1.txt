Let \mathbb{D} be a division ring and \mathbb{F} be a subfield of the center of \mathbb{D} over which \mathbb{D} has finite dimension d. Let n,p,r be positive integers and \mathcal{V} be an affine subspace of the \mathbb{F}-vector space M_{n,p}(\mathbb{D}) in which every matrix has rank less than or equal to r. Using a new method, we prove that \dim_{\mathbb{F}} \mathcal{V} \leq \max(n,p)\,rd and we characterize the spaces for which equality holds. This extends a famous theorem of Flanders which was known only for fields.
