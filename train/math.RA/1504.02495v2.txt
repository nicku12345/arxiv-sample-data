We describe the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on the Hochschild cohomology HH*(A) when A is a quadratic string algebra. First we compute the Hochschild cohomology groups using Barzdell's resolution and we describe generators of these groups. Then we construct comparison morphisms between the bar resolution and Bardzell's resolution in order to get formulae for the cup product and the Lie bracket. We find conditions on the bound quiver associated to string algebras in order to get non-trivial structures.
