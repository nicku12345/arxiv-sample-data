In this paper we will give a similar factorization as in \cite{4}, \cite{5}, where the autors Svrtan and Meljanac examined certain matrix factorizations on Fock-like representation of a multiparametric quon algebra on the free associative algebra of noncommuting polynomials equiped with multiparametric partial derivatives. In order to replace these matrix factorizations (given from the right) by twisted algebra computation, we first consider the natural action of the symmetric group S_{n} on the polynomial ring R_{n} in n^2 commuting variables X_{a\,b} and also introduce a twisted group algebra (defined by the action of S_{n} on R_{n}) which we denote by {\mathcal{A}(S_{n})}. Here we consider some factorizations given from the left because they will be more suitable in calculating the constants (= the elements which are annihilated by all multiparametric partial derivatives) in the free algebra of noncommuting polynomials.
