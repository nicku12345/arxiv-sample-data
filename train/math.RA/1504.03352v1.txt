An R-module M is called absolutely self pure if for any finitely generated left ideal of R whose kernel is in the filter generated by the set of all left ideals L of R with L \supseteq ann (m) for some m \in M, any map from L to M is a restriction of a map R \rightarrow M. Certain properties of quasi injective and absolutely pure modules are extended to absolute self purity. Regular and left noetherian rings are characterized using this new concept.
