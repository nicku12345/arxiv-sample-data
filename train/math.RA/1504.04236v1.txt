We introduce the class of split regular Hom-Leibniz algebras as the natural generalization of split Leibniz algebras and split regular Hom-Lie algebras. By developing techniques of connections of roots for this kind of algebras, we show that such a split regular Hom-Leibniz algebra L is of the form L = U + \sum\limits_{[j] \in \Lambda/\sim}I_{[j]} with U a subspace of the abelian subalgebra H and any I_{[j]}, a well described ideal of L, satisfying [I_{[j]}, I_{[k]}] = 0 if [j]\neq [k]. Under certain conditions, in the case of L being of maximal length, the simplicity of the algebra is characterized.
