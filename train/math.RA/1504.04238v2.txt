Let F be an infinite field and UT(d_1,\dots, d_n) be the algebra of upper block-triangular matrices over F. In this paper we describe a basis for the G-graded polynomial identities of UT(d_1,\dots, d_n), with an elementary grading induced by an n-tuple of elements of a group G such that the neutral component corresponds to the diagonal of UT(d_1,\dots,d_n). In particular, we prove that the monomial identities of such algebra follow from the ones of degree up to 2n-1. Our results generalize for infinite fields of arbitrary characteristic, previous results in the literature which were obtained for fields of characteristic zero and for particular G-gradings. In the characteristic zero case we also generalize results for the algebra UT(d_1,\dots, d_n)\otimes C with a tensor product grading, where C is a color commutative algebra generating the variety of all color commutative algebras.
