We study graded symmetric algebras, which are the symmetric monoids in the monoidal category of vector spaces graded by a group. We show that a finite dimensional graded semisimple algebra is graded symmetric. The center of a symmetric algebra is not necessarily symmetric, but we prove that the center of a finite dimensional graded division algebra is symmetric, provided that the order of the grading group is not divisible by the characteristic of the base field.
