We explore elementary matrix reduction over certain rings characterized by their localizations. Let R be a locally stable ring, we prove that R is an elementary divisor ring if and only if R is a Bezout ring. Elementary matrix reduction over some related localizations are also studied. Many known results on domains are thereby extended to general commutative rings which may contain many zero divisors.
