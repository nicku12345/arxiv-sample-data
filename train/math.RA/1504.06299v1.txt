Let A = \bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty}A_n be a connected graded k-algebra over an algebraically closed field k (thus A_0=k). Assume that a finite abelian group G, of order coprime to the characteristic of k, acts on A by graded automorphisms. In conjunction with a suitable cocycle this action can be used to twist the multiplication in A. We study this new structure and, in particular, we describe when properties like Artin-Schelter regularity are preserved by such a twist. We then apply these results to examples of Rogalski and Zhang.
