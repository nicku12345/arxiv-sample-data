Let R be a ring, \CC_R and \pCCR be the set of regular and left regular elements of R (\CC_R\subseteq \pCCR). Goldie's Theorem is a semisimplicity criterion for the classical left quotient ring Q_{l,cl}(R):=\CC_R^{-1}R. Semisimplicity criteria are given for the classical left regular left quotient ring 'Q_{l,cl}(R):=\pCCR^{-1}R. As a corollary, two new semisimplicity criteria for Q_{l,cl}(R) are obtained (in the spirit of Goldie).
