Hilbert's Nullstellensatz characterizes polynomials that vanish on the vanishing set of an ideal in C[x]. In the free algebra C<X> the vanishing set of a two-sided ideal I is defined in a dimension-free way using images in finite-dimensional representations of C<x>/I. In this article Nullstellens\"atze for a simple but important class of ideals in the free algebra - called tentatively rationally resolvable here - are presented. An ideal is rationally resolvable if its defining relations can be eliminated by expressing some of the X variables using noncommutative rational functions in the remaining variables. Whether such an ideal I satisfies the Nullstellensatz is intimately related to embeddability of C<x>/I into (free) skew fields. These notions are also extended to free algebras with involution. For instance, it is proved that a polynomial vanishes on all tuples of spherical isometries iff it is a member of the two-sided ideal I generated by 1-\sum_j X_j^* X_j. This is then applied to free real algebraic geometry: polynomials positive semidefinite on spherical isometries are sums of Hermitian squares modulo I. Similar results are obtained for nc unitary groups.
