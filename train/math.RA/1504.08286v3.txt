Let \mathfrak{g} be a reductive Lie algebra over an algebraically closed, characteristic zero field or over \mathbb{R}. Let \mathfrak{q} be a parabolic subalgebra of \mathfrak{g}. We characterize the derivations of \mathfrak{q} by decomposing the derivation algebra as the direct sum of two ideals: one of which being the image of the adjoint representation and the other consisting of all linear transformations on \mathfrak{q} that map into the center of \mathfrak{q} and map the derived algebra of \mathfrak{q} to 0.
