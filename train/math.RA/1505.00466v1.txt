In 2009, J. Wood [15] proved that Frobenius bimodules have the extension property for symmetrized weight compositions. Later, in [9], it was proved that having a cyclic socle is sufficient for satisfying the property, while the necessity remained an open question. Here, landing in Midway, the necessity is proved, a module alphabet RA has the extension property for symmetrized weight compositions built on AutR(A) is necessarily having a cyclic socle.
