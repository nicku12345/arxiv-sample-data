A classical result of Claborn states that every abelian group is the class group of a commutative Dedekind domain. Among noncommutative Dedekind prime rings, apart from PI rings, the simple Dedekind domains form a second important class. We show that every abelian group is the class group of a noncommutative simple Dedekind domain. This solves an open problem stated by Levy and Robson in their recent monograph on hereditary Noetherian prime rings.
