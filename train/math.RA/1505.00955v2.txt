We study post-Lie algebra structures on pairs of Lie algebras (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n}), motivated by nil-affine actions of Lie groups. We prove existence results for such structures depending on the interplay of the algebraic structures of \mathfrak{g} and \mathfrak{n}. We consider the classes of simple, semisimple, reductive, perfect, solvable, nilpotent, abelian and unimodular Lie algebras. Furthermore we consider commutative post-Lie algebra structures on perfect Lie algebras. Using Lie algebra cohomology we prove that such structures are trivial in several cases. We classify commutative structures on low-dimensional Lie algebras, and study the case of nilpotent Lie algebras.
