We obtain a faithful representation of the twisted tensor product B\otimes_{\chi} A of unital associative algebras, when B is finite dimensional. This generalizes the representations of [C] where B=K[X]/<X^2-X>, [GGV] where B=K[X]/<X^n> and [JLNS] where B=K^n. Furthermore, we establish conditions to extend twisted tensor products B\otimes_{\chi} A and C\otimes_{\psi} A to a twisted tensor product (B\times C) \otimes_{\varphi} A.
