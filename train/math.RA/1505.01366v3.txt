Let G:=SO(2n) be the even special orthogonal group over \mathbb{C} and let M_{2n}^+ (resp. M_{2n}^-) be the space of symmetric (resp. skew-symmetric) complex matrices with respect to the usual transposition. We study the structure of the space B^+:=\left(\bigwedge (M_{2n}^{+})^*\otimes M_{2n}^-\right)^G, the space of G-equivariant skew-symmetric matrix valued alternating multilinear maps on the space of symmetric n-tuples of matrices, with G acting by conjugation. We prove that B^+ is a free module over a certain subalgebra of invariants A:=\left(\bigwedge (M_{2n}^{+})^*\right)^G of rank 2n. We give an explicit description for the basis of this module. Furthermore we prove new trace polynomial identities for symmetric matrices. Finally we show, using a computation made with the LiE software, that the analogous module B^-:=\left(\bigwedge (M_{2n}^{+})^*\otimes M_{2n}^+\right)^G doesn't satisfy a similar property.
