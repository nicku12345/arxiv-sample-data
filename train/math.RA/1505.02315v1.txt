Let U and V be finite-dimensional vector spaces over an arbitrary field, and \mathcal{S} be a subset of the space \mathcal{L}(U,V) of all linear maps from U to V. A map F : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow V is called range-compatible when it satisfies F(s) \in \mathrm{im}(s) for all s \in \mathcal{S}; it is called quasi-range-compatible when the condition is only assumed to apply to the operators whose range does not include a fixed 1-dimensional linear subspace of V. Among the range-compatible maps are the so-called local maps s \mapsto s(x) for fixed x \in U.   Recently, the range-compatible group homomorphisms on \mathcal{S} were classified when \mathcal{S} is a linear subspace of small codimension in \mathcal{L}(U,V). In this work, we consider several variations of that problem: we investigate range-compatible affine maps on affine subspaces of linear operators; when \mathcal{S} is a linear subspace, we give the optimal bound on its codimension for all quasi-range-compatible homomorphisms on \mathcal{S} to be local. Finally, we give the optimal upper bound on the codimension of an affine subspace \mathcal{S} of \mathcal{L}(U,V) for all quasi-range-compatible affine maps on it to be local.
