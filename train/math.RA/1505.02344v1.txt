Motivated by the Cheung's elaborate work [Linear Multilinear Algebra, 51 (2003), 299-310], we investigate the construction of a Lie derivation on a generalized matrix algebra and apply it to give a characterization for such a Lie derivation to be proper. Our approach not only provides a direct proof for some known results in the theory, but also it presents several sufficient conditions assuring the properness of Lie derivations on certain generalized matrix algebras.
