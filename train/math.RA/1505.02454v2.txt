For finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, their classification in characteristic 0 (e.g. over \mathbb{C}) has been investigated for decades with many fruitful results, but their structures in positive characteristic have remained elusive. In this paper, working over an algebraically closed field \mathbf{k} of prime characteristic p, we introduce the concept, called Primitive Deformation, to provide a structured technique to classify certain finite-dimensional connected Hopf algebras which are almost primitively generated; that is, these connected Hopf algebras are p^{n+1}-dimensional, whose primitive spaces are abelian restricted Lie algebras of dimension n. We illustrate this technique for the case n=2. Together with our preceding results in arXiv:1309.0286, we provide a complete classification of p^3-dimensional connected Hopf algebras over \mathbf{k} of characteristic p>2.
