The Sylvester equation AX-XB=C is considered in the setting of quaternion matrices. Conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a unique solution are well-known. We study the complementary case where the equation either has infinitely many solutions or does not have solutions at all. Special attention is given to the case where A and B are respectively, lower and upper triangular two-diagonal matrices (in particular, if A and B are Jordan blocks)
