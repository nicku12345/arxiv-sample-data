Let G be a group and let W be an algebra over a field K. We will say that W is a G-graded twisted algebra if W can be written as a direct sum over the elements of G of one dimensional K-vector spaces. It is also assumed that W has no monomial which is a zero divisor. We also demand that W has a multiplicative identity element. We focus in the case where G is a finite abelian group and the field K is either the real numbers or the complex numbers. In this article, using methods of group cohomology, we classify all associative G-graded twisted algebras in the case G is a finite abelian group. On the other hand, by generalizing some of the arguments developed in (Velez et. al., 2014) we present a classification of all G-graded twisted algebras that satisfy certain symmetry condition.
