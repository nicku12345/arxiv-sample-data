Pseudo MV-algebras are a non-commutative generalization of MV-algebras. The main purpose of the paper is to introduce and investigate orthocomplete pseudo MV-algebras. We use the concepts of projectable pseudo MV-algebras and large pseudo MV-subalgebras to introduce orthocomplete pseudo MV-algebras. Then we apply a generalization of the Mundici's functor to an orthocompletion of an representable \ell-group to prove that each representable pseudo MV-algebra has an orthocompletion. In particular, our results are valid also for MV-algebras.
