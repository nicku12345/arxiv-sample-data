In this paper we introduce the notions of partial bimodule algebra and partial bico- module algebra. We also deal with the existence of globalizations for these structures, generalizing related results appeared in [2, 4]. As an application we construct the partial (L;R)-smash product, extending the corresponding global notion appeared in [14] to the context of partial Hopf actions.
