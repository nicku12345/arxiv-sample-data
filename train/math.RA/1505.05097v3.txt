In the present paper we extend the construction of the formal (affine) Demazure algebra due to Hoffnung, Malag\'on-L\'opez, Savage and Zainoulline in two directions. First, we introduce and study the notion of an extendable weight lattice in the Kac-Moody setting and show that all the definitions and properties of the formal (affine) Demazure operators and algebras hold for such lattices. Second, we show that for the hyperbolic formal group law the formal Demazure algebra is isomorphic (after extending the coefficients) to the Hecke algebra.
