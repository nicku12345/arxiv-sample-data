We solve the noncommutative Noether's problem for the reflection groups by showing that the skew field of the invariants of the Weyl algebra under the action of any reection group is a Weyl field, that is isomorphic to a skew field of some Weyl algebra over a transcendental extension of the ground field. We also extend this result to the invariants of the ring of differential operators on any dimensional torus.The results are applied to obtain analogs of the Gelfand-Kirillov Conjecture for Cherednik algebras and Galois algebras.
