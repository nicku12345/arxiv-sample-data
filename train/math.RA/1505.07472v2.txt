Noncommutative rational functions, i.e., elements of the universal skew field of fractions of a free algebra, can be defined through evaluations of noncommutative rational expressions on tuples of matrices. This interpretation extends their traditional important role in the theory of division rings and gives rise to their applications in other areas, from free real algebraic geometry to systems and control theory. If a noncommutative rational function is analytic at the origin, it can be described by a linear object, called a {\em realization}. In this article we present a realization theory that is applicable to {\em arbitrary} noncommutative rationals function and is well-adapted for studying matrix evaluations. Of special interest are the minimal realizations, which compensate the absence of a canonical form for noncommutative rational functions. The non-minimality of a realization is assessed by obstruction modules associated with it, they enable us to devise an efficient method for obtaining minimal realizations. With them we describe the extended domain of a noncommutative rational function and define a numerical invariant that measures its complexity. Using these results we determine concrete size bounds for rational identity testing, construct minimal symmetric realizations and prove an effective local-global principle of linear dependence for noncommutative rational functions.
