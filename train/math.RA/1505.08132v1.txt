In this paper we deal with the problem of computing the sum of the k-th powers of all the elements of the matrix ring \mathbb{M}_d(R) with d>1 and R a finite commutative ring. We completely solve the problem in the case R=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} and give some results that compute the value of this sum if R is an arbitrary finite commutative ring R for many values of k and d. Finally, based on computational evidence and using some technical results proved in the paper we conjecture that the sum of the k-th powers of all the elements of the matrix ring \mathbb{M}_d(R) is always 0 unless d=2, \textrm{card}(R) \equiv 2 \pmod 4, 1<k\equiv -1,0,1 \pmod 6 and the only element e\in R \setminus \{0\} such that 2e =0 is idempotent, in which case the sum is \textrm{diag}(e,e).
