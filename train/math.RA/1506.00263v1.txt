The main aim of this paper is to discuss the structure of coretractble and mono-coretractble modules. We have provided the characterizations of coretractable modules in terms of Kasch ring, CS modules, mono-coretractble modules, projective modules, epi retractable modules, and retractable modules. We have also discussed some equivalent condition related with coretractbele and mono-coretractble modules.
