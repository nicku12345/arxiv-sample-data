Moens proved that a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over field of characteristic zero is nilpotent if and only if it has an invertible Leibniz-derivation. In this article we prove the analogous results for finite-dimensional Malcev, Jordan, (-1,1)-, quasiassociative, quasialternative, right alternative and Malcev-admissible noncommutative Jordan algebras over the field of characteristic zero. Also, we describe all Leibniz-derivations of semisimple Jordan, right alternative and Malcev algebras.
