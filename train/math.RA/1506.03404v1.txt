This article is a sequel of [4], where we introduced quadratic forms on a module~ V over a supertropical semiring R and analysed the set of bilinear companions of a quadratic form q: V \to R in case that the module V is free, with fairly complete results if R is a supersemifield. Given such a companion b we now classify the pairs of vectors in V in terms of (q,b). This amounts to a kind of tropical trigonometry with a sharp distinction between the cases that a sort of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds or fails. We apply this to study the supertropicalizations (cf. [4]) of a quadratic form on a free module X over a field in the simplest cases of interest where rk(X) = 2.   In the last part of the paper we start exploiting the fact that the free module V as above has a unique base up to permutations and multiplication by units of R, and moreover~V carries a so called minimal (partial) ordering. Under mild restriction on~R we determine all q-minimal vectors in V, i.e., the vectors x \in V for which q(x') < q(x) whenever x' < x.
