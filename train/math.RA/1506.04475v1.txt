In this manuscript, we introduce a new concept, which is called fuzzy left (right) derivations KU- ideals in KU-algebras. We state and prove some theorems about fundamental properties of it. Moreover, we give the concepts of the image and the pre-image of fuzzy left (right) derivations KU-ideals under homomorphism of KU- algebras and investigated some its properties. Further, we have proved that every the image and the pre-image of fuzzy left (right) derivations KU-ideals under homomorphism of KU- algebras are fuzzy left (right) derivations KU-ideals
