Given a left noetherian k-algebra A graded by a group G, an injective object I in the category of G-graded A-modules and a morphism from G to another group G', we provide bounds for the injective dimension of I as a G'-graded A-module. For this, we use three change of grading functors. Most of the constructions concerning these functors work in the context of H-comodule algebras, where H is a Hopf algebra, so we develop them in this general context.
