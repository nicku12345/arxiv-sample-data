Given a finite-dimensional noncommutative semisimple algebra A with involution, we show that A always has an RBA-basis. We look for an RBA-basis that has integral or rational structure constants, and ask if the RBA admits a positive degree map. For RBAs that have a positive degree map, we try to find an RBA-basis with nonnegative structure constants to determine if there is a generalized table algebra structure. We settle these questions for the algebras \mathbb{C} \oplus M_n(\mathbb{C}), n \ge 2.
