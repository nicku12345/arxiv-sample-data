In this paper, we introduce a class of quasipolar rings which is a generalization of J-quasipolar rings. Let R be a ring with identity. An element a \in R is called {\it \delta-quasipolar} if there exists p^2 = p\in comm^2(a) such that a + p is contained in \delta(R), and the ring R is called {\it \delta-quasipolar} if every element of R is \delta-quasipolar. We use \delta-quasipolar rings to extend some results of J-quasipolar rings. Then some of the main results of J-quasipolar rings are special cases of our results for this general setting. We give many characterizations and investigate general properties of \delta-quasipolar rings.
