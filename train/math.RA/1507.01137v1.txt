We determine the algebraic structure of the multiplicative loops for locally compact 2-dimensional topological connected quasifields. In particular, our attention turns to multiplicative loops which have either a normal subloop of positive dimension or which contain a 1-dimensional compact subgroup. In the last section we determine explicitly the quasifields which coordinatize locally compact translation planes of dimension 4 admitting an at least 7-dimensional Lie group as collineation group.
