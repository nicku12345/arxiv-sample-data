Let R be a ring and b, c\in R. In this paper, we give some characterizations of the (b,c)-inverse, in terms of the direct sum decomposition, the annihilator and the invertible elements. Moreover, elements with equal (b,c)-idempotents related to their (b, c)-inverses are characterized, and the reverse order rule for the (b,c)-inverse is considered.
