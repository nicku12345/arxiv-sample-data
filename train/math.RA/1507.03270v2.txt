Two years ago, I characterized the order \Princl L of principal congruences of a bounded lattice L as a bounded order.   If K and L are bounded lattices and \gf is a \zo homomorphism of K into~L, then there is a natural isotone \zo-map \gf_{\Hom} from \Princl K into \Princl L.   We prove the converse: For bounded orders P and Q and an isotone \zo map \gy of P into Q, we represent P and Q as \Princl K and \Princl L for bounded lattices K and L with a \zo homomorphism \gf of K into L, so that \gy is represented as \gf_{\Hom}.
