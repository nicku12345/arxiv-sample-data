Let n and p be non-negative integers with n \geq p, and S be a linear subspace of the space of all n by p matrices with entries in a field \mathbb{K}. A classical theorem of Flanders states that S contains a matrix with rank p whenever \mathrm{codim} S <n.   In this article, we prove the following related result: if \mathrm{codim} S<n-1, then, for any non-zero n by p matrix N with rank less than p, there exists a line that is directed by N, has a common point with S and contains only rank p matrices.
