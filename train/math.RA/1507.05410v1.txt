In this article several properties of the inverse along an element will be studied in the context of unitary rings. New characterizations of the existence of this inverse will be proved. Moreover, the set of all invertible elements along a fixed element will be fully described. Futhermore, commuting inverse along an element will be characterized. The special cases of the group inverse, the (generalized) Drazin inverse and the Moore-Penrose inverse (in rings with involutions) will be also considered.
