Let K be a field of characteristic zero, let \sigma be an automorphism of K and let \delta be a \sigma-derivation of K. We show that the division ring D=K(x;\sigma,\delta) either has the property that every finitely generated subring satisfies a polynomial identity or D contains a free algebra on two generators over its center. In the case when K is finitely generated over k we then see that for \sigma a k-algebra automorphism of K and \delta a k-linear derivation of K, K(x;\sigma) having a free subalgebra on two generators is equivalent to \sigma having infinite order, and K(x;\delta) having a free subalgebra is equivalent to \delta being nonzero. As an application, we show that if D is a division ring with center k of characteristic zero and D^* contains a solvable subgroup that is not locally abelian-by-finite, then D contains a free k-algebra on two generators. Moreover, if we assume that k is uncountable, without any restrictions on the characteristic of k, then D contains the k-group algebra of the free group of rank two.
