Let  m , n \in \mathbb{N}, D be a division ring, and M_{m \times n}(D) denote the bimodule of all m \times n matrices with entries from D. First, we characterize one-sided submodules of M_{m \times n}(D) in terms of left row reduced echelon or right column reduced echelon matrices with entries from D. Next, we introduce the notion of a nest module of matrices with entries from D. We then characterize submodules of nest modules of matrices over D in terms of certain finite sequences of left row reduced echelon or right column reduced echelon matrices with entries from D. We use this result to characterize principal submodules of nest modules. We also describe subbimodules of nest modules of matrices. As a consequence, we characterize (one-sided) ideals of nest algebras of matrices over division rings.
