Let D be a division ring, \mathcal V and  \mathcal W vector spaces over D, and {\mathcal L(\mathcal V,\mathcal W)} the {\mathcal L(\mathcal W)}-{\mathcal L(\mathcal V)} bimodule of all linear transformations from \mathcal V into \mathcal W. We prove some basic results about certain submodules of \mathcal L(\mathcal V, \mathcal W). For instance, we show, among other results, that a right submodule (resp. left submodule) of {\mathcal L(\mathcal V,\mathcal W)} is finitely generated whenever its image (resp. coimage) is finite-dimensional.
