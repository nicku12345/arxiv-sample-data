Given a central division algebra D of degree d over a field F, we associate to any standard polynomial \phi(z)=z^n+c_{n-1} z^{n-1}+\dots+c_0 over D a "companion polynomial" \Phi(z) of degree n d with coefficients in F whose roots are exactly the conjugacy classes of the roots of \phi(z). We explain how in case D is a quaternion algebra, all the roots of \phi(z) can be recovered from the roots of \Phi(z). On the way, we also generalize certain theorems that were known for \mathbb{H} to any division algebra, such as the connection between the right eigenvalues of a matrix and the roots of its characteristic polynomial, and the connection between the roots of a standard polynomial and left eigenvalues of the companion matrix.
