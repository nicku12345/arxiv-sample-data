We present a new and simple proof of a theorem due to Kaplansky which unifies theorems of Kolchin and Levitzki on triangularizability of semigroups of matrices. We also give two different extensions of the theorem. As a consequence, we prove the counterpart of Kolchin's Theorem for finite groups of unipotent matrices over division rings. We also show that the counterpart of Kolchin's Theorem over division rings of characteristic zero implies that of Kaplansky's Theorem over such division rings.
