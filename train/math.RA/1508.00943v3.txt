We give an accessible introduction into the theory of lower central series of associative algebras, exhibiting the interplay between algebra, geometry and representation theory that is characteristic for this subject, and to discuss some open questions. In particular, we provide shorter and clearer proofs of the main results of this theory. We also discuss some new theoretical and computational results and conjectures on the lower central series of the free algebra in two generators modulo a generic homogeneous relation.
