Let 0 \to A \to L \to B \to 0 be a short exact sequence of Lie algebras over a field F, where A is abelian. We show that the obstruction for a pair of automorphisms in \Aut(A) \times \Aut(B) to be induced by an automorphism in \Aut(L) lies in the Lie algebra cohomology \Ha^2(B;A). As a consequence, we obtain a four term exact sequence relating automorphisms, derivations and cohomology of Lie algebras. We also obtain a more explicit necessary and sufficient condition for a pair of automorphisms in \Aut\big(L_{n,2}^{(1)}\big) \times \Aut\big(L_{n,2}^{ab}\big) to be induced by an automorphism in \Aut\big(L_{n,2}\big), where L_{n,2} is a free nilpotent Lie algebra of rank n and step 2.
