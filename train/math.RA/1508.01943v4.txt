In this paper, we prove the following differential analog of the Noether normalization lemma: for every d-dimensional differential algebraic variety over differentially closed field of zero characteristic there exists a surjective map onto the d-dimensional affine space.   Equivalently, for every integral differential algebra A over differential field of zero characteristic there exist differentially independent b_1, \ldots, b_d such that A is differentially algebraic over subalgebra B differentially generated by b_1, \ldots, b_d, and whenever \mathfrak{p} \subset B is a prime differential ideal, there exists a prime differential ideal \mathfrak{q} \subset A such that \mathfrak{p} = B \cap \mathfrak{q}.   We also prove the analogous theorem for differential algebraic varieties over the ring of formal power series over an algebraically closed differential field and present some applications to differential equations.
