We investigate the pfaffians of decomposable biquaternion algebras with involution of orthogonal type. In characteristic two, a classification of these algebras in terms of their pfaffians and some other related invariants is studied. Also, in arbitrary characteristic, a criterion is obtained for an orthogonal involution on a biquaternion algebra to be metabolic.
