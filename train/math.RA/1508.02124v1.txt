We introduce the class of split regular Hom-Lie color algebras as the natural generalization of split Lie color algebras. By developing techniques of connections of roots for this kind of algebras, we show that such a split regular Hom-Lie color algebra L is of the form L = U + \sum\limits_{[j] \in \Lambda/\sim}I_{[j]} with U a subspace of the abelian graded subalgebra H and any I_{[j]}, a well described ideal of L, satisfying [I_{[j]}, I_{[k]}] = 0 if [j]\neq [k]. Under certain conditions, in the case of L being of maximal length, the simplicity of the algebra is characterized.
