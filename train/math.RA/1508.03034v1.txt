In this paper we consider the very wide class of varieties of representations of Lie algebras over the field k, which has characteristic 0. We study the relation between the geometric equivalence and automorphic equivalence of the representations of these varieties. We calculate the group, which measures the difference between the geometric equivalence and automorphic equivalence of representations of theses varieties. In Section 5, we present one example of the subvariety of the variety of all the representations of the Lie algebras over the field k, and two representations from these variety which are automorphically equivalent but not geometrically equivalent.
