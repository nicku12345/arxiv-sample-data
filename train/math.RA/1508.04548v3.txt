H. J. Zassenhaus conjectured that any unit of finite order and augmentation one in the integral group ring of a finite group G is conjugate in the rational group algebra to an element of G. One way to verify this is showing that such unit has the same distribution of partial augmentations as an element of G and the HeLP Method provides a tool to do that in some cases. In this paper we use the HeLP Method to describe the partial augmentations of a hypothetical counterexample to the conjecture for the projective special linear groups.
