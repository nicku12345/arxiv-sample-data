Fix an integer d \geq 0, a field \mathbb{F}, and a vector space V over \mathbb{F} with dimension d+1. By a decomposition of V we mean a sequence \{V_i\}_{i=0}^d of 1-dimensional subspaces of V whose sum is V. For a linear transformation A from V to V, we say A lowers \{V_i\}_{i=0}^d whenever A V_i = V_{i-1} for 0 \leq i \leq d, where V_{-1}=0. We say A raises \{V_i\}_{i=0}^d whenever A V_i = V_{i+1} for 0 \leq i \leq d, where V_{d+1}=0. An ordered pair of linear transformations A,B from V to V is called LR whenever there exists a decomposition \{V_i\}_{i=0}^d of V that is lowered by A and raised by B. In this case the decomposition \{V_i\}_{i=0}^d is uniquely determined by A,B; we call it the (A,B)-decomposition of V. Consider a 3-tuple of linear transformations A, B, C from V to V such that any two of A, B, C form an LR pair on V. Such a 3-tuple is called an LR triple on V. Let \alpha, \beta, \gamma be nonzero scalars in \mathbb{F}. The triple \alpha A, \beta B, \gamma C is an LR triple on V, said to be associated to A,B,C. Let \{V_i\}_{i=0}^d be a decomposition of V and let X be a linear transformation from V to V. We say X is tridiagonal with respect to \{V_i\}_{i=0}^d whenever X V_i \subseteq V_{i-1} + V_i + V_{i+1} for 0 \leq i \leq d. Let \cal X be the vector space over \mathbb{F} consisting of the linear transformations from V to V that are tridiagonal with respect to the (A,B) and (B,C) and (C,A) decompositions of V. There is a special class of LR triples, called q-Weyl type. In the present paper, we find a basis of \cal X for each LR triple that is not associated to an LR triple of q-Weyl type.
