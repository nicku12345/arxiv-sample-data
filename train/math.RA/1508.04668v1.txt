Let P_n=k[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n] be the polynomial algebra over a field k of characteristic zero in the variables x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n and \mathscr{L}_n be the left-symmetric Witt algebra of all derivations of P_n. We describe all right operator identities of \mathscr{L}_n and prove that the set of all algebras \mathscr{L}_n, where n\geq 1, generates the variety of all left-symmetric algebras. We also describe a class of general (not only right operator) identities for \mathscr{L}_n.
