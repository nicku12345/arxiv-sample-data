Let A be any associative algebra graded by a finite abelian group G, then if we denote by GKdim_k(A) and GKdim^G_k (A) the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of its relatively free algebra and its relatively free G-graded algebra in k variables respectively, then GKdim_k(A)\leq GKdim^G_k (A). We show a counterexample of the previous result for Jordan algebras (hence non-associative). In particular, there exists a Z_2-grading on UJ_n, the Jordan algebra of n\times n upper triangular matrices, n equal to 2 or 3, such that the previous inequality does not hold.
