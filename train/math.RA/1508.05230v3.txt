We give a classification up to equivalence of the fine group gradings by abelian groups on the Jordan pairs and triple systems of types bi-Cayley and Albert, under the assumption that the base field is algebraically closed of characteristic different from 2. The associated Weyl groups are computed. We also determine, for each fine grading on the bi-Cayley and Albert pairs, the induced grading on the exceptional simple Lie algebra given by the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction.
