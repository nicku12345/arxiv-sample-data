We construct homomorphisms from the universal enveloping algebra of the positive (part of the) Witt algebra to several different Artin-Schelter regular algebras, and determine their kernels and images. As a result, we produce elementary proofs that the universal enveloping algebras of the Virasoro algebra, the Witt algebra, and the positive Witt algebra are neither left nor right noetherian.
