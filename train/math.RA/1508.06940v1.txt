The aim of this paper is to investigate in which sense, for n\geq 3, n-Lie algebras admit universal enveloping algebras. There have been some attempts at a construction (see [10] and [5]) but after analysing those we come to the conclusion that they cannot be valid in general. We give counterexamples and sufficient conditions.   We then study the problem in its full generality, showing that universality is incompatible with the wish that the category of modules over a given n-Lie algebra L is equivalent to the category of modules over the associated algebra U(L). Indeed, an associated algebra functor U \colon \text{n-}\mathsf{Lie}_{\mathbb{K}} \to \mathsf{Alg}_{\mathbb{K}} inducing such an equivalence does exist, but this kind of functor never admits a right adjoint.   We end the paper by introducing a (co)homology theory based on the associated algebra functor U.
