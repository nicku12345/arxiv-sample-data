The zeta function of an integral lattice \Lambda is the generating function \zeta_{\Lambda}(s) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n n^{-s}, whose coefficients count the number of left ideals of \Lambda of index n. We derive a formula for the zeta function of \Lambda_1 \otimes \Lambda_2, where \Lambda_1 and \Lambda_2 are \mathbb{Z}-orders contained in finite-dimensional semisimple \mathbb{Q}-algebras that satisfy a "locally coprime" condition. We apply the formula obtained above to \mathbb{Z}S \otimes \mathbb{Z}T and obtain the zeta function of the adjacency algebra of the direct product of two finite association schemes (X,S) and (Y,T) in several cases where the \mathbb{Z}-orders \mathbb{Z}S and \mathbb{Z}T are locally coprime and their zeta functions are known.
