Let (R,{}^-) be an arbitrary unital associative superalgebra with superinvolution over a commutative ring \Bbbk with 2 invertible. The second homology of the generalized periplectic Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{p}_m(R,{}^-) for m\geqslant3 has been completely determined via an explicit construction of its universal central extension. In particular, this second homology could be identified with the first \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}-graded dihedral homology of R with certain superinvolution whenever m\geqslant 5.
