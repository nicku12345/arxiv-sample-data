It is shown that over an arbitrary field there exists a nil algebra R whose adjoint group R^{o} is not an Engel group. This answers a question by Amberg and Sysak from 1997 [5] and answers related questions from [3, 44]. The case of an uncountable field also answers a recent question by Zelmanov.   In [38], Rump introduced braces and radical chains A^{n+1}=A\cdot A^{n} and A^{(n+1)}=A^{(n)}\cdot A of a brace A. We show that the adjoint group A^{o} of a finite right brace is a nilpotent group if and only if A^{(n)}=0 for some n.   We also show that the adjoint group of A^{o} of a finite left brace A is a nilpotent group if and only if   A^{n}=0 for some n. Moreover, if A^{o} is a nilpotent group then   A is the direct sum of braces whose cardinatities are powers of prime numbers. Notice that A^{o} is sometimes called the multiplicative group of a brace A (for example in [13]).   We also introduce a chain of ideals A^{[n]} of a left brace A and then use it to investigate braces which satisfy A^{n}=0 and A^{(m)}=0 for some m, n (Theorems 2, 3).   In Section 2 we describe connections between our results and braided groups and the Yang-Baxter equation.   It is worth noticing that by a result by Gateva-Ivanova [17] braces are in one-to-one correspondence with braided groups with involutive braided operators.
