The key ingredient of this paper is the universal central extension of the generalized orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{osp}_{m|2n}(R,{}^-) coordinatized by a unital associative superalgebra (R,{}^-) with superinvolution. Such a universal central extension will be constructed via a Steinberg orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra coordinated by (R,{}^-). The research on the universal central extension of \mathfrak{osp}_{m|2n}(R,{}^-) will yield an identification between the second homology group of the generalized orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{osp}_{m|2n}(R,{}^-) and the first \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}-graded skew-dihedral homology group of (R,{}^-) for (m,n)\neq(2,1),(1,1). The universal central extensions of \mathfrak{osp}_{2|2}(R,{}^-) and \mathfrak{osp}_{1|2}(R,{}^-) will also be treated separately.
