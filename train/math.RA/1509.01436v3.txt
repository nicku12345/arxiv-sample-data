We introduce non-associative Ore extensions, S = R[X ; \sigma , \delta], for any non-associative unital ring R and any additive maps \sigma,\delta : R \rightarrow R satisfying \sigma(1)=1 and \delta(1)=0. In the special case when \delta is either left or right R_{\delta}-linear, where R_{\delta} = \ker(\delta), and R is \delta-simple, i.e. \{ 0 \} and R are the only \delta-invariant ideals of R, we determine the ideal structure of the non-associative differential polynomial ring D = R[X ; \mathrm{id}_R , \delta]. Namely, in that case, we show that all ideals of D are generated by monic polynomials in the center Z(D) of D. We also show that Z(D) = R_{\delta}[p] for a monic p \in R_{\delta}[X], unique up to addition of elements from Z(R)_{\delta}. Thereby, we generalize classical results by Amitsur on differential polynomial rings defined by derivations on associative and simple rings. Furthermore, we use the ideal structure of D to show that D is simple if and only if R is \delta-simple and Z(D) equals the field R_{\delta} \cap Z(R). This provides us with a non-associative generalization of a result by \"{O}inert, Richter, and Silvestrov. This result is in turn used to show a non-associative version of a classical result by Jordan concerning simplicity of D in the cases when the characteristic of the field R_{\delta} \cap Z(R) is either zero or a prime. We use our findings to show simplicity results for both non-associative versions of Weyl algebras and non-associative differential polynomial rings defined by monoid/group actions on compact Hausdorff spaces.
