Let (H,\a) be a Hom-Hopf algebra and (A,\b) be a Hom-algebra. In this paper we will construct the Hom-crossed product (A\#_\sigma H,\b\o\a), and prove that the extension A\subseteq A\#_\sigma H is actually a Hom-type cleft extension and vice versa. Then we will give the necessary and sufficient conditions to make (A\#_\sigma H,\b\o\a) a Hom-Hopf algebra. Finally we will study the lazy 2-cocycle on (H,\a).
