Just as knowing some roots of a polynomial allows one to factor it, a well-known result provides a factorization of any scalar differential operator given a set of linearly independent functions in its kernel. This note provides a straight-forward generalization to the case of matrix coefficient differential operators that applies even in the case that the leading coefficient is singular.
