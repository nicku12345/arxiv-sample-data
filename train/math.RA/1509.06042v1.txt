A number of papers deal with the problem of counting the number of retractions of a structure S onto a substructure T. In the particular case when S is a free algebra, this number is \geq 1 iff T is projective. In this paper we consider the case when T is a projective lattice-ordered abelian group with a distinguished strong order unit, or equivalently, a projective MV-algebra.   Let A be a retract of the free n-generator MV-algebra \mathcal{M}([0,1]^n) of McNaughton functions on [0,1]^n. We prove that the number \mathsf{r}(A) of retractions of \mathcal{M}([0,1]^n) onto A is finite if, and only if, the maximal spectral space \mu_A is homeomorphic to a (Kuratowski) closed domain M of [0,1]^n, in the sense that M=\mathsf{cl}(\mathsf{int}(M)). Further, the closed domain condition is decidable and \mathsf{r}(A) is computable, once a retraction onto A is explicitly given. Thus every finitely generated projective MV-algebra B comes equipped with a new invariant \iota(B)=\sup\{\mathsf{r}(A) \mid \mbox{A\cong B for A a retract of \mathcal{M}([0,1]^{k})} \}, where k is the smallest number of generators of B. We compute \iota(B) for many projective MV-algebras B considered in the literature. Various problems concerning retractions of free MV-algebras are shown to be decidable. Via the \Gamma functor, our results and computations automatically transfer to finitely generated projective abelian \ell-groups with a distinguished strong unit.
