By using determinantal representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse previously obtained by the author within the framework of the theory of the column-row determinants, we get explicit formulas for determinantal representations of the W-weighted Drazin inverse solutions   (analogs of Cramer's rule) of the quaternion matrix equations  {\bf W}{\bf A}{\bf W}{\bf X}={\bf D},  {\bf X}{\bf W}{\bf A}{\bf W}={\bf D} , and {\bf W}_{1}{\bf A}{\bf W}_{1}{\bf X}{\bf W}_{2}{\bf B}{\bf W}_{2}={\bf D} .
