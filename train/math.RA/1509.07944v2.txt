Let a be a regular element of a ring R. If either K:=\rm{r}_R(a) has the exchange property or every power of a is regular, then we prove that for every positive integer n there exist decompositions  R_R = K \oplus X_n \oplus Y_n = E_n \oplus X_n \oplus aY_n, where Y_n \subseteq a^nR and E_n \cong R/aR. As applications we get easier proofs of the results that a strongly \pi-regular ring has stable range one and also that a strongly \pi-regular element whose every power is regular is unit-regular.
