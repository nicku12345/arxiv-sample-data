In this note, we consider the semigroup O(X) of all order endomorphisms of an infinite chain X and the subset J of O(X) of all transformations \alpha such that |Im(\alpha)|=|X|. For an infinite countable chain X, we give a necessary and sufficient condition on X for O(X) = \langle J \rangle to hold. We also present a sufficient condition on X for O(X) = \langle J \rangle to hold, for an arbitrary infinite chain X.
