Let F be a field and let F \langle X \rangle be the free unital associative algebra over F freely generated by an infinite countable set X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots \}. Define a left-normed commutator [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] recursively by [a_1, a_2] = a_1 a_2 - a_2 a_1, [a_1, \dots, a_{n-1}, a_n] = [[a_1, \dots, a_{n-1}], a_n] (n \ge 3). For n \ge 2, let T^{(n)} be the two-sided ideal in F \langle X \rangle generated by all commutators [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] (a_i \in F \langle X \rangle).   Let F be a field of characteristic 0. In 2008 Etingof, Kim and Ma conjectured that T^{(m)} T^{(n)} \subset T^{(m+n -1)} if and only if m or n is odd. In 2010 Bapat and Jordan confirmed the "if" direction of the conjecture: if at least one of the numbers m, n is odd then T^{(m)} T^{(n)} \subset T^{(m + n -1)}. The aim of the present note is to confirm the "only if" direction of the conjecture. We prove that if m = 2 m' and n = 2 n' are even then T^{(m)} T^{(n)} \nsubseteq T^{(m +n -1)}. Our result is valid over any field F.
