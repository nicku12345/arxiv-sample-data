In this paper, we study the moduli space of all complex 5-dimensional Lie algebras, realizing it as a stratification by orbifolds, which are connected by jump deformations. The orbifolds are given by the action of finite groups on very simple complex manifolds. Our method of determining the stratification is based on the construction of versal deformations of the Lie algebras, which allow us to identify natural neighborhoods of the elements in the moduli space.
