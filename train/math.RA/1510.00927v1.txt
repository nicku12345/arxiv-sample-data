We prove that if S is a le-semigroup in which left ideal elements commute (condition which is called \mathbf{\Lambda}), then any \mathcal{J}-class satisfying the Green condition is a subsemigroup of S. As a corollary of this we show that semisimple le-semigroups satisfying \mathbf{\Lambda} are precisely those that decompose as a semilattice of left simple \vee e-semigroups which are in addition semisimple, intra-regular and satisfy \mathbf{\Lambda}.
