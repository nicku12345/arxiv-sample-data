In this paper, we introduce the notion of globalization for partial module coalgebra and for partial comodule coalgebra. We show that every partial module coalgebra is globalizable exhibiting a standard globalization. We also show the existence of globalization for a partial comodule coalgebra, provided a certain rationality condition. Moreover, we show a relationship between the globalization for the (co)module coalgebra and the usual globalization for the (co)module algebra.
