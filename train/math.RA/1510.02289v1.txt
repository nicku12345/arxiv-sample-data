We investigate the graded Lie algebras of Cartan type W, S and H in characteristic 2 and determine their simple constituents and some exceptional isomorphisms between them. We also consider the graded Lie algebras of Cartan type K in characteristic 2 and conjecture that their simple constituents are isomorphic to Lie algebras of type H.
