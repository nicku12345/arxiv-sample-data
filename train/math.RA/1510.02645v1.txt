In this paper we classify, up to equivalence, all semisimple nontrivial Hopf algebras of dimension 2^{2n+1} for n\geq 2 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 with the group of group-like elements isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}_{2^{n}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2^{n}}. Moreover we classify all such nonisomorphic Hopf algebras of dimension 32 and show that they are not twist-equivalent to each other. More generally, given an abelian group of order 2^{m-1} we give an upper bound for the number of nonisomorphic nontrivial Hopf algebras of dimension 2^{m} which have this group as their group of group-like elements.
