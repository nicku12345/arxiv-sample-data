We construct an example of a unit-regular ring which is not strongly clean, answering an open question of Nicholson. We also characterize clean matrices with a zero column, and this allows us to describe an interesting connection between unit-regular elements and clean elements. It is also proven that given an element a in a ring R, if a,a^2,\ldots, a^k are all regular elements in R (for some k\geq 1), then there exists w\in R such that a^{i}w^{i}a^{i}=a^{i} for 1\leq i\leq k, and a similar statement holds for unit-regular elements. The paper ends with a large number of examples elucidating further connections (and disconnections) between cleanliness, regularity, and unit-regularity.
