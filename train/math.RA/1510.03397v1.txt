Many rings and algebras arising in quantum mechanics, algebraic analysis, and non-commutative algebraic geometry can be interpreted as skew PBW (Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt) extensions. In the present paper we study two aspects of these non-commutative rings: its finitely generated projective modules from a matrix-constructive approach, and the construction of the Gr\"obner theory for its left ideals and modules. These two topics could be interesting in future eventual applications of skew PBW extensions in functional linear systems and in non-commutative algebraic geometry.
