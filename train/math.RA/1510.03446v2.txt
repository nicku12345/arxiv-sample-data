In this paper we compute the Tor and Ext modules over skew PBW extensions. If A is a bijective skew PBW extension of a ring R, we give presentations of Tor_r^{A}(M,N), where M is a finitely generated centralizing subbimodule of A^m, m\geq 1, and N is a left A-submodule of A^l, l\geq 1. In the case of Ext_A^{r}(M,N), M is a left A-submodule of A^m and N is a finitely generated centralizing subbimodule of A^l. As application of these computations, we test stably-freeness, reflexiveness, and we will compute also the torsion, the dual and the grade of a given submodule of A^m. Skew PBW extensions include many important classes of non-commutative rings and algebras arising in quantum mechanics, for example, Weyl algebras, enveloping algebras of finite-dimensional Lie algebras (and its quantization), Artamonov quantum polynomials, diffusion algebras, Manin algebra of quantum matrices, among many others.
