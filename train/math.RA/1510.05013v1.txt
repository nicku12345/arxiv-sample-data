In this paper we discuss about the semiprimitivity and the semiprimality of partial smash products. Let H be a semisimple Hopf algebra over a field \mathbb{k} and let A be a left partial H-module algebra. We study the H-prime and the H-Jacobson radicals of A and its relations with the prime and the Jacobson radicals of \underline{A\#H}, respectively. In particular, we prove that if A is H-semiprimitive, then \underline{A\#H} is semiprimitive provided that all irreducible representations of A are finite-dimensional, or A is an affine PI-algebra over \mathbb{k} and \mathbb{k} is a perfect field, or A is locally finite. Moreover, we prove that \underline{A\#H} is semiprime provided that A is an H-semiprime PI-algebra, generalizing for the setting of partial actions, the main results of [20] and [19].
