Constructive proofs of fact that a stably free left S-module M with rank(M)\geqsr(S) is free, where sr(S) denotes the stable rank of an arbitrary ring S, were developed in some articles. Additionally, in such papers, are presented algorithmic proofs for calculating projective dimension, and to check whether a left S-module M is stably free. Given a left A-module M, with A a bijective skew PBW extension, we will use these results and Gr\"obner bases theory, to establish algorithms that allow us to calculate effectively the projective dimension for this module, to check whether is stably free, to construct minimal presentations, and to obtain bases for free modules.
