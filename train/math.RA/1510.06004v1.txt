Let R be a ring with char(R)\neq2 whose unit group are denoted by \mathcal{U}(R), G a group with involution *, and \sigma:G\rightarrow\mathcal{U}(R) a nontrivial group homomorphism, with ker\ \sigma=N, satisfying xx^*\in N for all x\in G. Let RG be the group ring of G over R and define the involution \sigma* in RG by \left( \sum_{x\in G}\alpha_xx\right)^{\sigma*}=\sum_{x\in G}\sigma(x)\alpha_xx^*. In this paper, we will classify the group rings RG such that \mathcal{S} is anticommutative, where \mathcal{S} is the largest subset of (RG)^+=\left\{ \alpha\in RG: \alpha^{\sigma *}=\alpha\right\} that can satisfy anticommutativity under char(R)\neq2.
