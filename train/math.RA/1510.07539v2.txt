We study the structure and properties of free skew Boolean algebras. For finite generating sets, these free algebras are finite and we give their representation as a product of primitive algebras and provide formulas for calculating their cardinality. We also characterize atomic elements and central elements and calculate the number of such elements. These results are used to study minimal generating sets of finite skew Boolean algebras. We also prove that the center of the free infinitely generated algebra is trivial and show that all free algebras have intersections.
