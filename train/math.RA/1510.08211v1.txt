The commuting probability of a finite ring R, denoted by \Pr(R), is the probability that any two randomly chosen elements of R commute. In this paper, we obtain several bounds for \Pr(R) through a generalization of \Pr(R). Further, we define {\Z}-isoclinism between two pairs of rings and show that the generalized commuting probability, defined in this paper, is invariant under {\Z}-isoclinism between two pairs of finite rings.
