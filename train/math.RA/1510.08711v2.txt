Weakly locally finite division rings were considered in \cite{dbh}, where it was mentioned that the class of weakly locally finite division rings properly contains the class of locally finite division rings. In this paper, for any integer n\geq 0 or n=\infty, we construct a weakly locally finite division ring whose Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is n. This fact shows in particular that there exist infinitely many weakly locally finite division rings that are not locally finite. Further, for the class of weakly locally finite division rings, we investigate some questions related with the well-known Kurosh Problem and with one of Herstein's conjectures.
