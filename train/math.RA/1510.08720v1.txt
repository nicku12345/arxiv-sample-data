In this note, we introduce a new concept of a {\it generalized algebraic rational identity} to investigate the structure of division rings. The main theorem asserts that if a non-central subnormal subgroup N of the multiplicative group D^* of a division ring D with center F satisfies a non-trivial generalized algebraic rational identity of bounded degree, then D is a finite dimensional vector space over F. This generalizes some previous results.
