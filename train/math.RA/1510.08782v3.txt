Let F be a field of characteristic zero and W be an associative affine F-algebra satisfying a polynomial identity (PI). The codimension sequence associated to W, c_n(W), is known to be of the form \Theta (c n^t d^n), where d is the well known (PI) exponent of W. In this paper we establish an algebraic interpretation of the polynomial part (the constant t) by means of Kemer's theory. In particular, we show that in case W is a basic algebra, then t = \frac{d-q}{2} + s, where q is the number of simple component in W/J(W) and s+1 is the nilpotency degree of J(W). Thus proving a conjecture of Giambruno.
