The notion of derivation with invertible values as a derivation of ring with unity that only takes multiplicatively invertible or zero values appeared in a paper of Bergen, Herstein and Lanski, in which they determined the structure of associative rings that admit derivations with invertible values. Later, the results of this paper were generalized in many cases, for example, for generalized derivations, associative super-algebras, alternative algebras and many others. The present work is dedicated to description of all Jordan algebras admitting derivations with invertible values.
