A Poisson algebra \Bbb C[G] considered as a Poisson version of the twisted quantized coordinate ring \Bbb C_{q,p}[G], constructed by Hodges, Levasseur and Toro in \cite{HoLeT}, is obtained and its Poisson structure is investigated. This establishes that all Poisson prime and primitive ideals of \Bbb C[G] are characterized. Further it is shown that \Bbb C[G] satisfies the Poisson Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence and that Zariski topology on the space of Poisson primitive ideals of \Bbb C[G] agrees with the quotient topology induced by the natural surjection from the maximal ideal space of \Bbb C[G] onto the Poisson primitive ideal space.
