We investigate max-algebraic (tropical) one-sided systems A\otimes x=b where b is an eigenvector and x lies in an interval X. A matrix A is said to have X-simple image eigencone associated with an eigenvalue \lambda, if any eigenvector x associated with \lambda and belonging to the interval X is the unique solution of the system A\otimes y=\lambda x in X. We characterize matrices with X-simple image eigencone geometrically and combinatorially, and for some special cases, derive criteria that can be efficiently checked in practice.
