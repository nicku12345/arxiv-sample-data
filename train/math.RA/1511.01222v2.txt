In this work is presented a weakened version of the left exact preradicals: the prehereditary preradicals. Also is presented a weakened version of the idempotent preradicals: the essentially idempotent preradicals. These new classes of prerradicals are studied under the lattice theory. Each class serves to generalize the theorems of the injectivity respect to a torsion theory.
