We present a unified ring theoretic approach, based on properties of the Casimir element of a symmetric algebra, to a variety of known divisibility results for the degrees of irreducible representations of semisimple Hopf algebras in characteristic 0. All these results are motivated by a classical theorem of Frobenius on the degrees of irreducible complex representations of finite groups.
