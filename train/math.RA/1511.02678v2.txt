In this paper for a noetherian ring R with nilradical N we define semiprime ideals P and Q called as the left and right krull homogenous parts of N . We also recall the known definitions of localisability and the weak ideal invariance (w.i.i for short ) of an ideal of a noetherian ring R . We then state and prove results that culminate in our main theorem whose statement is given below ; Theorem :- Let R be a noetherian ring with nilradical N . Let P and Q be semiprime ideals of R that are the right and left krull homogenous parts of N respectively . Then the following conditions are equivalent ; (i) N is a right w.i.i ideal of R ( respectively N is a left w.i.i ideal of R ) . (ii)P is a right localizable ideal of R ( respectively Q is a left localizable ideal of R ) .
