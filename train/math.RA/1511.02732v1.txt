The main purpose of this note is to illustrate how the radius in a finite-dimensional power-associative algebra over a field \mathbb{F}, either \mathbb{R} or \mathbb{C}, may change when the multiplication in this algebra is modified. Our point of departure will be \mathbb{F}^{n \times n}, the familiar algebra of n \times n matrices over \mathbb{F} with the usual matrix operations, where it is known that the radius is the classical spectral radius. We shall alter the multiplication in \mathbb{F}^{n \times n} in three different ways and compute, in each case, the radius in the resulting algebra.
