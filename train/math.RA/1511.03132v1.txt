An n-dimensional Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} over a field \mathbb{F} of characteristic two is said to be of Vergne type if there is a basis e_1,\dots,e_n such that [e_1,e_i]=e_{i+1} for all 2\leq i \leq n-1 and [e_i,e_j] = c_{i,j}e_{i+j} for some c_{i,j} \in \mathbb{F} for all i,j \ge 2 with i+j \le n. We define the algebra \mathfrak{m}_0 by its nontrivial bracket relations: [e_1,e_i]=e_{i+1}, 2\leq i \leq n-1, and the algebra \mathfrak{m}_2: [e_1, e_i ]=e_{i+1}, 2 \le i \le n-1, [e_2, e_j ]=e_{j+2}, 3 \le j \le n-2.   We show that, in contrast to the corresponding real and complex cases, \mathfrak{m}_0(n) and \mathfrak{m}_2(n) have the same Betti numbers. We also prove that for any Lie algebra of Vergne type of dimension at least 5, there exists a non-isomorphic algebra of Vergne type with the same Betti numbers.
