We study the necessary conditions for sets of quadratic n-fold Pfister forms to have a common (n-1)-fold Pfister factor. For any set S of n-fold Pfister forms generating a subgroup of I_q^n F/I_q^{n+1} F of order 2^s in which every element has an n-fold Pfister representative, we associate an invariant in I_q^{n+1} F which lives inside I_q^{n+s-1} F when the forms in S have a common (n-1)-fold Pfister factor. We study the properties of this invariant and compute it explicitly in a few interesting cases.
