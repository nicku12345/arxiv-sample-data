We describe all subdirectly irreducible medial quandles. We show that they fall within one of four disjoint classes. In particular, in the finite case they are either connected (and therefore Alexander quandles) or reductive. Moreover, we provide a representation of all non-connected subdirectly irreducible medial quandles.
