We study systems of combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations with an arbitrary number N of coupling constants. The considered Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs is \mathbb{N}^N-graded, and we wonder if the graded subalgebra generated by the solution is Hopf or not. We first introduce a family of pre-Lie algebras which we classify, dually providing systems generating a Hopf subalgebra, we also describe the associated groups, as extensions of groups of formal diffeomorphisms on several variables. We then consider systems coming from Feynman graphs of a Quantum Field Theory. We show that if the number N of independent coupling constants is the number of interactions of the considered QFT, then the generated subalgebra is Hopf. For QED, \varphi^3 and QCD, we also prove that this is the minimal value of N. All these examples are generalizations of the first family of Dyson-Schwinger systems in the one coupling constant case, called fundamental.We also give a generalization of the second family, called cyclic.
