Let R be a ring with char(R)\neq2 whose unit group are denoted by \mathcal{U}(R), G a group, and RG its group ring. Let * be an involution in G, \sigma:G\rightarrow\mathcal{U}(R) be a nontrivial group homomorphism, with ker\ \sigma=N, satisfying xx^*\in N for all x\in G, and define the generalized oriented involution \sigma* in RG by \left( \sum_{x\in G}\alpha_xx\right)^{\sigma*}=\sum_{x\in G}\sigma(x)\alpha_xx^*. An element \alpha\in RG is called skew-symmetric if \alpha^{\sigma *}=-\alpha, and the set of all skew-symmetric elements are denoted by (RG)^-. In this paper, we will classify the group rings RG such that (RG)^- is anticommutative, generalizing, and obtaining as consequence, the main result of \cite{GP13a}.
