Let S be a semigroup and \mathbb F be a field. For an ideal J of the semigroup algebra {\mathbb F}[S] of S over \mathbb F, let \varrho _J denote the restriction (to S) of the congruence on {\mathbb F}[S] defined by the ideal J. A semigroup S is called a permutable semigroup if \alpha \circ \beta =\beta \circ \alpha is satisfied for all congruences \alpha and \beta of S. In this paper we show that if S is a semilattice or a rectangular band then \varphi _{\{S;{\mathbb F}\}}:\ J\mapsto \varrho _J is a homomorphism of the semigroup (Con ({\mathbb F}[S]);\circ ) into the relations semigroup ({\cal B}_S; \circ ) if and only if S is a permutable semigroup.
