In this paper we prove that one-sided Duo rings are (two-sided) McCoy. By doing so, we are then able to explicitly describe some of these ring element annihilators of polynomials in McCoy rings. We conclude the paper by showing the place of these results in the literature by way of an extension of a convenient diagram from a paper by Camillo and Nielsen.
