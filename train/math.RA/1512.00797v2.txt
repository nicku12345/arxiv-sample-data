In this paper, prime as well as primitive Kumjian-Pask algebras \mathrm{KP}_R(\Lambda) of a row-finite k-graph \Lambda over a unital commutative ring R are completely characterized in graph-theoretic and algebraic terms. By applying quotient k-graphs, these results describe prime and primitive graded basic ideals of Kumjian-Pask algebras. In particular, when \Lambda is strongly aperiodic and R is a field, all prime and primitive ideals of a Kumjian-Pask algebra \mathrm{KP}_R(\Lambda) are determined.
