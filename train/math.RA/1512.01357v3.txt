Let H be a dual quasi-Hopf algebra. In this paper we will firstly introduce all possible categories of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H, and give explicitly the monoidal and braided structure of them. Then we prove that the category ^H_H\mathcal{YD}^{fd} of finite-dimensional left-left Yetter-Drinfeld modules is rigid. Finally we will study the braided cocommunitivity of H_0 in ^H_H\mathcal{YD}.
