Let \mathbb{F}G denote the group algebra of the locally finite group G over the infinite field \mathbb{F} with \car(\mathbb{F})\neq 2, and let \circledast:\mathbb{F}G\rightarrow \mathbb{F}G denote the involution defined by \alpha=\Sigma\alpha_{g}g \mapsto \alpha^\circledast=\Sigma\alpha_{g}\sigma(g)g^{\ast}, where \sigma:G\rightarrow \{\pm1\} is a group homomorphism (called an orientation) and \ast is an involution of the group G. In this paper we prove, under some assumptions, that if the \circledast-symmetric units of \mathbb{F}G satisfies a group identity then \mathbb{F}G satisfies a polynomial identity, i.e., we give an affirmative answer to a Conjecture of B. Hartley in this setting. Moreover, in the case when the prime radical \eta(\mathbb{F}G) of \mathbb{F}G is nilpotent we characterize the groups for which the symmetric units \mathcal{U}^+(\mathbb{F}G) do satisfy a group identity.
