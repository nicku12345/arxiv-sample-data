We prove that if an involution in a ring is the sum of an idempotent and a nilpotent then the idempotent in this decomposition must be 1. As a consequence, we completely characterize weakly nil-clean rings introduced recently in [Breaz, Danchev and Zhou, Rings in which every element is either a sum or a difference of a nilpotent and an idempotent, J. Algebra Appl., DOI: 10.1142/S0219498816501486].
