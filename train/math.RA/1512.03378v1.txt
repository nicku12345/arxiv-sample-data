In order to study AS-regular algebras of dimension 5, we consider dimension 5 graded iterated Ore extensions generated in degree one. We classify the possible degrees of relations and structure of the free resolution for extensions with 3 and 4 generators. We show that every known type of algebra of dimension 5 can be realized by an Ore extension and we consider which of these types cannot be realized by an enveloping algebra.
