Fix an integer d \geq 0, a field \mathbb{F}, and a vector space V over \mathbb{F} with dimension d+1. By a decomposition of V we mean a sequence \{V_i\}_{i=0}^d of 1-dimensional \mathbb{F}-subspaces of V such that V = \sum_{i=0}^d V_i (direct sum). Consider \mathbb{F}-linear transformations A, B from V to V. Then A,B is called an LR pair whenever there exists a decomposition \{V_i\}_{i=0}^d of V such that A V_i = V_{i-1} and B V_i = V_{i+1} for 0 \leq i \leq d, where V_{-1}=0 and V_{d+1}=0. By an LR triple we mean a 3-tuple A,B,C of \mathbb{F}-linear transformations from V to V such that any two of them form an LR pair. In the present paper, we consider how an LR pair A,B can be extended to an LR triple A,B,C.
