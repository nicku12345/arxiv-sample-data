We prove that every finite lattice L can be embedded in a three-generated finite lattice K. We also prove that every algebraic lattice with accessible cardinality is a complete sublattice of an appropriate algebraic lattice K such that K is completely generated by three elements. Note that ZFC has a model in which all cardinal numbers are accessible. Our results strengthen P. Crawley and R. A. Dean's 1959 results by adding finiteness, algebraicity, and completeness.
