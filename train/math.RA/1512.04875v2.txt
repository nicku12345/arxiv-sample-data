In this paper, we introduce a new concept called left (right) g-MP inverse in a *-monoid. The relations of this type of generalized inverse with left inverse along an element are investigated. Also, the reverse order law for the inverse along an element is studied. Then, the existence criteria and formulae of the inverse of the product of triple elements along an element are investigated in a monoid. Finally, we further study left and right g-MP inverses, the inverse along an element in the context of rings.
