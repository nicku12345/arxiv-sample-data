We study cocycle twists of a 4-dimensional Sklyanin algebra A and a factor ring B which is a twisted homogeneous coordinate ring. Twisting such algebras by the Klein four-group G, we show that the twists A^{G,\mu} and B^{G,\mu} have very different geometric properties to their untwisted counterparts. For example, A^{G,\mu} has only 20 point modules and infinitely many fat point modules of multiplicity 2. The ring B^{G,\mu} falls under the purview of Artin and Stafford's classification of noncommutative curves, and we describe it using a sheaf of orders over an elliptic curve.
