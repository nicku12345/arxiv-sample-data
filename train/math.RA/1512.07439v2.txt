Let H be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra, and let A be a left H-module algebra. Motivated by the study of the isolated singularities of A^H and the endomorphism ring \mathrm{End}_{A^H}(A), we introduce the concept of Hopf dense Galois extensions in this paper. Hopf dense Galois extensions yield certain equivalences between the quotient categories over A and A^H. A special class of Hopf dense Galois extensions consits of the so-called densely group graded algebras, which are weaker versions of strongly graded algebras. A weaker version of Dade's Theorem holds for densely group graded algebras. As applications, we recover the classical equivalence of the noncommutative projective schemes over a noetherian \mathbb{N}-graded algebra A and its d-th Veroness subalgebra A^{(d)} respectively. Hopf dense Galois extensions are also applied to the study of noncommuative graded isolated singularities.
