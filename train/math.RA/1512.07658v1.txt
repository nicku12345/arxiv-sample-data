Let G be a finite group. There is a standard theorem on the classification of G-equivariant finite dimensional simple commutative, associative, and Lie algebras (i.e., simple algebras of these types in the category of representations of G). Namely, such an algebra is of the form A={\rm Fun}_H(G,B), where H is a subgroup of G, and B is a simple algebra of the corresponding type with an H-action. We explain that such a result holds in the generality of algebras over a linear operad. This allows one to extend Theorem 5.5 of arXiv:1506.07565 on the classification of simple commutative algebras in the Deligne category {\rm Rep}(S_t) to algebras over any finitely generated linear operad.
