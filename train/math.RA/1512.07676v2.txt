We compute the cohomology with trivial coefficients of Lie algebras \mathfrak{m}_0 and \mathfrak{m}_2 of maximal class over the field \mathbb{Z}_2. In the infinite-dimensional case, we show that the cohomology rings H^*(\mathfrak{m}_0) and H^*(\mathfrak{m}_2) are isomorphic, in contrast with the case of the ground field of characteristic zero, and we obtain a complete description of them. In the finite-dimensional case, we find the first three Betti numbers of \mathfrak{m}_0(n) and \mathfrak{m}_2(n) over \mathbb{Z}_2.
