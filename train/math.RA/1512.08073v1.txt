The core inverse for a complex matrix was introduced by Baksalary and Trenkler. Raki\'c, Din\v{c}i\'c and Djordjevi\'c generalized the core inverse of a complex matrix to the case of an element in a ring. They also proved that the core inverse of an element in a ring can be characterized by five equations and every core invertible element is group invertible. It is natural to ask when a group invertible element is core invertible, in this paper, we will answer this question. We will use three equations to characterize the core inverse of an element. That is, let a, b\in R, then a\in R^{\tiny\textcircled{\tiny\#}} with a^{\tiny\textcircled{\tiny\#}}=b if and only if (ab)^{\ast}=ab, ba^{2}=a and ab^{2}=b. Finally, we investigate the additive property of two core invertible elements. Moreover, the formulae of the sum of two core invertible elements are presented.
