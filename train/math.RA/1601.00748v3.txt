We study the flatness and the projectivity of Hopf algebras, defined over a Dedekind ring, over their Hopf subalgebras. We give a criterion for the faithful flatness and use it to show the faithful flatness of an arbitrary flat Hopf algebra upon its finite normal Hopf subalgebra. For the projectivity of a projective Hopf algebras we need some finiteness condition in terms of the module of integral. In particular we show the the module of integral has rank one.
