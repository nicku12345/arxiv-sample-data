Poisson algebras are, just like Lie algebras, particular cases of Lie-Rinehart algebras. The latter were introduced by Rinehart in his seminal 1963 paper, where he also introduces the notion of an enveloping algebra and proves --- under some mild conditions --- that the enveloping algebra of a Lie-Rinehart algebra satisfies a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem (PBW theorem). In the case of a Poisson algebra ({\mathcal A},\cdot,\{\cdot,\cdot\}) over a commutative ring R (with unit), Rinehart's result boils down to the statement that if \mathcal A is \emph{smooth} (as an algebra), then gr(U({\mathcal A})) and \mathrm{Sym}_{\mathcal A}(\Omega({\mathcal A})) are isomorphic as graded algebras; in this formula, U({\mathcal A}) stands for the Poisson enveloping algebra of {\mathcal A} and \Omega({\mathcal A}) is the {\mathcal A}-module of K\"ahler differentials of {\mathcal A} (viewing {\mathcal A} as an R-algebra). In this paper, we give several new constructions of the Poisson enveloping algebra in some general and in some particular contexts. Moreover, we show that for an important class of \emph{singular} Poisson algebras, the PBW theorem still holds. In geometrical terms, these Poisson algebras correspond to (singular) Poisson hypersurfaces of arbitrary smooth affine Poisson varieties.
