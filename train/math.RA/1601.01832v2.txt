We study evolution algebras of arbitrary dimension. We analyze in deep the notions of evolution subalgebras, ideals and non-degeneracy and describe the ideals generated by one element and characterize the simple evolution algebras. We also prove the existence and unicity of a direct sum decomposition into irreducible components for every non-degenerate evolution algebra. When the algebra is degenerate, the uniqueness cannot be assured.   The graph associated to an evolution algebra (relative to a natural basis) will play a fundamental role to describe the structure of the algebra. Concretely, a non-degenerate evolution algebra is irreducible if and only if the graph is connected. Moreover, when the evolution algebra is finite-dimensional, we give a process (called the fragmentation process) to decompose the algebra into irreducible components.
