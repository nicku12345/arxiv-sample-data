Let R be a unital ring with involution. We give several characterizations and properties of core partial order in R. In particular, we investigate the reverse order law (ab)^{\tiny\textcircled{\tiny\#}} = b^{\tiny\textcircled{\tiny\#}} a^{\tiny\textcircled{\tiny\#}} for two core invertible elements a,b\in R. Some relationships between core partial order and other partial orders are obtained.
