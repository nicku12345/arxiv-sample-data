For some monoids, we give a method of composing invertibility preserving maps associated to "partial involutions." Also, we define the notion of "determinants for finite dimensional algebras over a field." As examples, we give invertibility preserving maps for Clifford algebras into a field and determinants for Clifford algebras into a field, where we assume that the algebras are generated by less than or equal to 5 generators over the field. On the other hand, "determinant formulas for Clifford algebras" are known. We understand these formulas as an expression that connects invertibility preserving maps for Clifford algebras and determinants for Clifford algebras. As a result, we have a better sense of determinant formulas. In addition, we show that there is not such a determinant formula for Clifford algebras generated by greater than 5 generators.
