Let K be a field of characteristic zero and V a vector space of dimension m>1 with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form f:V\times V \rightarrow K. The Jordan algebra B_m=K\oplus V of the form f is a superalgebra with this decomposition. We prove that the ideal of all the 2-graded identities of B_m satisfies the Specht property and we compute the 2-graded cocharacter sequence of B_m.
