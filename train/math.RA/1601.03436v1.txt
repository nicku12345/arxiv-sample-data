For an R-module M, projective in \sigma[M] and satisfying ascending chain condition (ACC) on left annihilators, we introduce the concept of Goldie module. We also use the concept of semiprime module defined by Raggi et. al. in \cite{S} to give necessary and sufficient conditions for an R-module M, to be a semiprime Goldie module. This theorem is a generalization of Goldie's theorem for semiprime left Goldie rings. Moreover, we prove that M is a semiprime (prime) Goldie module if and only if the ring S=End_R(M) is a semiprime (prime) right Goldie ring. Also, we study the case when M is a duo module.
