Using the concepts of prime module, semiprime module and the concept of ascending chain condition (ACC) on annihilators for an R-module M . We prove that if \ M is semiprime \ and projective in \sigma \left[ M\right] , such that M satisfies ACC on annihilators, then M has finitely many minimal prime submodules. Moreover if each submodule N\subseteq M contains a uniform submodule, we prove that there is a bijective correspondence between a complete set of representatives of isomorphism classes of indecomposable non M-singular injective modules in \sigma \left[ M\right]  and the set of minimal primes in M. If M is Goldie module then % \hat{M}\cong E_{1}^{k_{1}}\oplus E_{2}^{k_{2}}\oplus ...\oplus E_{n}^{k_{n}} where each E_{i} is a uniform M-injective module. As an application, new characterizations of left Goldie rings are obtained.
