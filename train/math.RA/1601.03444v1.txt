Given a semiprime Goldie module M projective in \sigma[M] we study decompositions on its M-injective hull \hat{M} in terms of the minimal prime in M submodules. With this, we characterize the semiprime Goldie modules in \mathbb{Z}-Mod and make a decomposition of the endomorphism ring of \hat{M}. Also, we investigate the relations among semiprime Goldie modules, QI-modules and co-semisimple modules extending results on left QI-rings and V-rings.
