The Hopf dual H^\circ of any Poisson Hopf algebra H is proved to be a co-Poisson Hopf algebra provided H is noetherian. Without noetherian assumption, it is not true in general. There is no nontrivial Poisson Hopf structure on the universal enveloping algebra of a non-abelian Lie algebra. The Poisson Hopf structures on A=k[x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_d], viewed as the universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional abelian Lie algebra, are exactly linear Poisson structures on A. The co-Poisson structures on polynomial Hopf algebra A are characterized. Some correspondences between co-Poisson and Poisson structures are also established.
