Let K be an arbitrary field of characteristic zero and A a commutative associative  K-algebra which is an integral domain. Denote by R the fraction field of A and by W(A)=RDer_{\mathbb K}A, the Lie algebra of \mathbb K-derivations of R obtained from Der_{\mathbb K}A via multiplication by elements of R. If L\subseteq W(A) is a subalgebra of W(A) denote by rk_{R}L the dimension of the vector space RL over the field R and by F=R^{L} the field of constants of L in R. Let L be a nilpotent subalgebra L\subseteq W(A) with rk_{R}L\leq 3. It is proven that the Lie algebra FL (as a Lie algebra over the field F) is isomorphic to a finite dimensional subalgebra of the triangular Lie subalgebra u_{3}(F) of the Lie algebra Der F[x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}],  where u_{3}(F)=\{f(x_{2}, x_{3})\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}}+g(x_{3})\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2}}+c\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{3}}\} with f\in F[x_{2}, x_{3}], g\in F[x_3], c\in F. In particular, a characterization of nilpotent Lie algebras of vector fields with polynomial coefficients in three variables is obtained.
