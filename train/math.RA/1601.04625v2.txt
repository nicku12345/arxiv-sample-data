A noncommutative analogue of the Zariski cancellation problem asks whether A[x]\cong B[x] implies A\cong B when A and B are noncommutative algebras. We resolve this affirmatively in the case when A is a noncommutative finitely generated domain over the complex field of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension two. In addition, we resolve the Zariski cancellation problem for several classes of Artin-Schelter regular algebras of higher Gelfand-Kirillov dimension.
