We explore some properties of wide subcategories of the category mod\,(\Lambda) of finitely generated left \Lambda-modules, for some artin algebra \Lambda. In particular we look at wide finitely generated subcategories and give a connection with the class of standard modules and standardly stratified algebras. Furthermore, for a wide class \mathcal{X} in mod\,(\Lambda), we give necessary and sufficient conditions to see that \mathcal{X}=\mathrm{pres}\,(P), for some projective \Lambda-module P; and finally, a connection with ring epimorphisms is given.
