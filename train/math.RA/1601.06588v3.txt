The purpose of this paper is to study W(2,2) Lie conformal algebra, which has a free \mathbb{C}[\partial]-basis \{L, M\} such that [L_\lambda L]=(\partial+2\lambda)L, [L_\lambda M]=(\partial+2\lambda)M, [M_\lambda M]=0. In this paper, we study conformal derivations, central extensions and conformal modules for this Lie conformal algebra. Also, we compute the cohomology of this Lie conformal algebra with coefficients in its modules. In particular, we determine its cohomology with trivial coefficients both for the basic and reduced complexes.
