A generalization of G-sets, called partial G-sets, are the sets that admit an action of partial maps on their subsets. Partial actions are a powerful tool to generalize many results of group actions. These generalizations are obtained by using global actions when they exist. The main objective of this paper is to construct the global action of a given finite partial group action on a set. For this, first we generalize orbit-stabilizer theorem for partial group actions and use it to know the exact size of the orbits in the global set.
