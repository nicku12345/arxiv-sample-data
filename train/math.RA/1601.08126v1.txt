This preprint deals with the symmetry of parametrized families of systems and the changes therein as the parameter changes. There are (at least ?) two kinds of symmetry: generic and specific which behave in almost totally opposite ways as the parameter changes: generic symmetry has links with entropy while specific symmetry has to do with symmetry breaking as it is usually understood in physics.
