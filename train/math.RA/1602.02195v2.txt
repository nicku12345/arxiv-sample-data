We observe \cite[Proposition 4.1]{LaLe} that Poisson polynomial extensions appear as semiclassical limits of a class of Ore extensions. As an application, a Poisson generalized Weyl algebra A_1 considered as a Poisson version of the quantum generalized Weyl algebra is constructed and its Poisson structures are studied. In particular, it is obtained a necessary and sufficient condition such that A_1 is Poisson simple and established that the Poisson endomorphisms of A_1 are Poisson analogues of the endomorphisms of the quantum generalized Weyl algebra.
