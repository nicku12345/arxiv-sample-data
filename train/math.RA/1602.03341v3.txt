We prove that the group algebra KG of a group G over a field K is primitive, provided that G has a free subgroup with the same cardinality as G, and that G satisfies the following condition (\ast): for each subset M of G consisting of a finite number of elements not equal to 1, and for any positive integer m, there exist distinct a, b, and c in G so that if (x_{1}^{-1}g_1x_{1}) \cdots (x_{m}^{-1}g_mx_{m})=1, where g_i is in M and x_i is equal to a, b, or c for all i between 1 and m, then x_{i}=x_{i+1} for some i. This generalizes results of \cite{Bal}, \cite{For}, \cite{Ni07}, and \cite{Ni11}, and proves that, for every countably infinite group G satisfying (\ast), KG is primitive for any field K. We use this result to determine the primitivity of group algebras of one relator groups with torsion.
