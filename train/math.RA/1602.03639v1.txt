Let D be a weakly locally finite division ring and n a positive integer. In this paper, we investigate the problem on the existence of non-cyclic free subgroups in non-central almost subnormal subgroups of the general linear group {\rm GL}_n(D). Further, some applications of this fact are also investigated. In particular, all infinite finitely generated almost subnormal subgroups of {\rm GL}_n(D) are described.
