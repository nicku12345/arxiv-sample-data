The asymptotic behaviour is studied of exponentially bounded sequences of codimensions of identities of algebras with unity. A series of algebras is constructed for which the base of the exponential increases by exactly one when an outer unity is adjoined to the original algebra. We show that the PI-exponents of unital algebras can take any value greater than two, and the exponents of finite-dimensional unital algebras form a dense subset of the domain [2,\infty).
