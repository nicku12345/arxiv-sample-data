For a Lie ring L over the ring of integers, we compare its lower central series \{\gamma_n(L)\}_{n\geq 1} and its dimension series \{\delta_n(L)\}_{n\geq 1} defined by setting \delta_n(L)= L\cap \varpi^n(L), where \varpi(L) is the augmentation ideal of the universal enveloping algebra of L. While \gamma_n(L)\subseteq\delta_n(L) for all n\geq 1, the two series can differ. In this paper it is proved that if L is a metabelian Lie ring, then 2\delta_n(L)\subseteq\gamma_n(L), and [\delta_n(L),\,L]=\gamma_{n+1}(L), for all n\geq 1.
