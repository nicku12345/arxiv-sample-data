For Leavitt path algebras, we show that whereas removing sources from a graph produces a Morita equivalence, removing sinks gives rise to a recollement situation. In general, we show that for a graph E and a finite hereditary subset H of E^0 there is a recollement \xymatrix{ L_K(E/\overline H) \rModd \ar[r] & \ar@<3pt>[l] \ar@<-3pt>[l] L_K(E) \rModd \ar[r] & \ar@<3pt>[l] \ar@<-3pt>[l] L_K(E_H) \rModd .} We record several corollaries.
