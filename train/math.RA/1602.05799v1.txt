We study gradings by noncommutative groups on finite dimensional Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. It is shown that if L is gradeg by a non-abelian finite group G then the solvable radical R of L is G-graded and there exists a Levi subalgebra B=H_1\oplus\cdots\oplus H_m homogeneous in G-grading with graded simple summands H_1, \ldots, H_m. All supports Supp~H_i, i=1\ldots, m, are commutative subsets of G.
