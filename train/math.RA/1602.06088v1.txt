We study polynomial identities of finite dimensional simple color Lie superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero graded by the product of two cyclic groups of order 2. We prove that the codimensions of identities grow exponentially and the rate of exponent equals the dimension of the algebra. A similar result is also obtained for graded identities and graded codimensions.
