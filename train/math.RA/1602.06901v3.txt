We prove that if the maximal dimension of an anisotropic homogeneous polynomial form of prime degree p over a field F with \operatorname{char}(F)=p is a finite integer d greater than 1 then the symbol length of p-algebras of exponent p over F is bounded from above by \left \lceil \frac{d-1}{p} \right \rceil-1, and show that every two tensor products of symbol algebras of lengths k and \ell with (k+\ell) p \geq d-1 can be modified so that they share a common slot. For p=2, we obtain an upper bound of \frac{u(F)}{2}-1 for the symbol length, which is sharp when I_q^3 F=0.
