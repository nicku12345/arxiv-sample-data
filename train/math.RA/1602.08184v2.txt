Let R be a unital ring with involution. We first show that the EP elements in R can be characterized by three equations. Namely, let a\in R, then a is EP if and only if there exists x\in R such that (xa)^{\ast}=xa, xa^{2}=a and ax^{2}=x. It is well known that all EP elements in R are core invertible and Moore-Penrose invertible. We give more equivalent conditions for a core (Moore-Penrose) invertible element to be an EP element. Finally, the EP elements are characterized in terms of n-EP property, which is a generalization of bi-EP property.
