Given an arbitrary graph E we investigate the relationship between E and the groupoid G_E.   We show that there is a lattice isomorphism between the lattice of pairs (H, S), where H is a hereditary and saturated set of vertices and S is a set of breaking vertices {associated to H }, onto the lattice of open invariant subsets of G_E^{(0)}. We use this lattice isomorphism to characterize the decomposability of the Leavitt path algebra L_K(E), where K is a field.   First we find a graph condition to characterise when an open invariant subset of G_E^{(0)} is closed.   Then we give both a graph condition and a groupoid condition each of which is equivalent to L_K(E) being decomposable {in the sense that it can be written as a direct sum of two nonzero ideals}.
