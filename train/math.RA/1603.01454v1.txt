Let \mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{b},\mathfrak{e} be algebras over a field k. Then \mathfrak{e} is an extension of \mathfrak{a} by \mathfrak{b} if \mathfrak{a} is an ideal of \mathfrak{e} and \mathfrak{b} is isomorphic to the quotient algebra \mathfrak{e}/\mathfrak{a}. In this paper, by using Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases theory for associative (resp. Lie) algebras, we give complete characterizations of associative (resp. Lie) algebra extensions of \mathfrak{a} by \mathfrak{b}, where \mathfrak{b} is presented by generators and relations.
