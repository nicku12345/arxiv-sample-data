The Ado-Iwasawa Theorem asserts that a finite-dimensional Lie algebra L over a field F has a finite-dimensional faithful module V. There are several extensions asserting the existence of such a module with various additional properties. In particular, Jacobson has proved that if the field has characteristic p>0, then there exists a completely reducible such module V. I strengthen Jacobson's Theorem, proving that if L has dimension n over the field F of characteristic p>0, then L has a faithful completely reducible module V with \dim(V) \le p^{n^2-1}.
