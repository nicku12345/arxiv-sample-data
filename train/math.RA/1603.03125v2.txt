Let \mathcal{C} be a self-dual spherical fusion categories of rank 4 with non-trivial grading. We complete the classification of Grothendieck ring K(\mathcal{C}) of \mathcal{C}; that is, we prove that K(\mathcal{C})\cong Fib\otimes\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Z}_2], where Fib is the Fibonacci fusion ring and \mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Z}_2] is the group ring on \mathbb{Z}_2. In particular, if \mathcal{C} is braided then it is equivalent to \textbf{Fib}\boxtimes\textbf{Vec}_{\mathbb{Z}_2}^{\omega} as fusion categories, where \textbf{Fib} is a Fibonacci category and \textbf{Vec}_{\mathbb{Z}_2}^{\omega} is a rank 2 pointed fusion category.
