Let \mathbb{F} denote an algebraically closed field. Denote the three-element set by \mathcal{X}=\{A,B,C\}, and let \mathbb{F}\left<\mathcal{X}\right> denote the free unital associative \mathbb{F}-algebra on \mathcal{X}. Fix a nonzero q\in\mathbb{F} such that q^4\neq 1. The universal Askey-Wilson algebra \Delta is the quotient space \mathbb{F}\left<\mathcal{X}\right>/\mathbb{I}, where \mathbb{I} is the two-sided ideal of \mathbb{F}\left<\mathcal{X}\right> generated by the nine elements UV-VU, where U is one of A,B,C, and V is one of \begin{equation} (q+q^{-1}) A+\frac{qBC-q^{-1}CB}{q-q^{-1}},\nonumber \end{equation} \begin{equation} (q+q^{-1}) B+\frac{qCA-q^{-1}AC}{q-q^{-1}},\nonumber \end{equation} \begin{equation} (q+q^{-1}) C+\frac{qAB-q^{-1}BA}{q-q^{-1}}.\nonumber \end{equation} Turn \mathbb{F}\left<\mathcal{X}\right> into a Lie algebra with Lie bracket \left[ X,Y\right] = XY-YX for all X,Y\in\mathbb{F}\left<\mathcal{X}\right>. Let \mathcal{L} denote the Lie subalgebra of \mathbb{F}\left<\mathcal{X}\right> generated by \mathcal{X}, which is also the free Lie algebra on \mathcal{X}. Let L denote the Lie subalgebra of \Delta generated by A,B,C. Since the given set of defining relations of \Delta are not in \mathcal{L}, it is natural to conjecture that L is freely generated by A,B,C. We give an answer in the negative by showing that the kernel of the canonical map \mathbb{F}\left<\mathcal{X}\right>\rightarrow\Delta has a nonzero intersection with \mathcal{L}. Denote the span of all Hall basis elements of \mathcal{L} of length n by \mathcal{L}_n, and denote the image of \sum_{i=1}^n\mathcal{L}_i under the canonical map \mathcal{L}\rightarrow L by L_n. We study some properties of L_4 and L_5.
