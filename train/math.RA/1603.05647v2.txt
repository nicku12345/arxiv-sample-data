By any measure, semisimple modules form one of the most important classes of modules and play a distinguished role in the module theory and its applications. One of the most fundamental results in this area is the Wedderburn-Artin theorem. In this paper, we establish natural generalizations of semisimple modules and give a generalization of the Wedderburn-Artin theorem. We study modules in which every submodule is isomorphic to a direct summand and name them {\it virtually semisimple modules}. A module _RM is called {\it completely virtually semisimple} if each submodules of M is a virtually semisimple module. A ring R is then called {\it left} ({\it completely}) {\it virtually semisimple} if _RR is a left (compleatly) virtually semisimple R-module. Among other things, we give several characterizations of left (completely) virtually semisimple rings. For instance, it is shown that a ring R is left completely virtually semisimple if and only if R \cong \prod _{i=1}^ k M_{n_i}(D_i) where k, n_1, ...,n_k\in \Bbb{N} and each D_i is a principal left ideal domain. Moreover, the integers k,~ n_1, ...,n_k and the principal left ideal domains D_1, ...,D_k are uniquely determined (up to isomorphism) by R.
