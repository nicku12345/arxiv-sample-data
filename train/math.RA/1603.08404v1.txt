In this paper we work with unital twisted partial actions. We investigate ring theoretic properties of partial crossed products as artinianity, noetherianity, perfect property, semilocalproperty, semiprimary property and we also study the Krull dimension. Moreover, we consider triangular matrix representation of partial skew group rings, weak and global dimensions of partial crossed products Also we study when the partial crossed products are Frobenius and symmetric algebras.
