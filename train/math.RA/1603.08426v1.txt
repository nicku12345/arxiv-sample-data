We study the structure of a Leibniz triple system \mathcal{E} graded by an arbitrary abelian group G which is considered of arbitrary dimension and over an arbitrary base field \mathbb{K}. We show that \mathcal{E} is of the form \mathcal{E}=U+\sum_{[j]\in \sum^{1}/\sim} I_{[j]} with U a linear subspace of the 1-homogeneous component \mathcal{E}_{1} and any ideal I_{[j]} of \mathcal{E}, satisfying \{I_{[j]},\mathcal{E},I_{[k]}\} =\{I_{[j]},I_{[k]},\mathcal{E}\}=\{\mathcal{E},I_{[j]},I_{[k]}\}=0 if [j]\neq [k], where the relation \sim in \sum^{1}=\{g \in G \setminus \{1\} : L_{g}\neq 0\}, defined by g \sim h if and only if g is connected to h.
