In this paper we study the notion of isoclinism on Lie-central extensions of Leibniz algebras, this yields to introduce the concept of Lie-isoclinic Leibniz algebras. We provide several equivalent conditions under which Leibniz algebras are Lie-isoclinic. We also define the concept of Schur Lie-multiplier and analyze its connection with Lie-isoclinism.
