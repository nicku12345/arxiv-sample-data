Let r and n be positive integers such that r<n, and \mathbb{K} be an arbitrary field. In a recent work, we have determined the maximal dimension for a linear subspace of n by n symmetric matrices with rank less than or equal to r, and we have classified the spaces having that maximal dimension. In this article, provided that \mathbb{K} has more than two elements, we extend this classification to spaces whose dimension is close to the maximal one: this generalizes a result of Loewy. We also prove a similar result on spaces of alternating matrices with bounded rank, with no restriction on the cardinality of the underlying field.
