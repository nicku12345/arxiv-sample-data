To a finite ranked poset \Gamma we associate a finite-dimensional graded quadratic algebra R_\Gamma. Assuming \Gamma satisfies a combinatorial condition known as uniform, R_{\Gamma} is related to a well-known algebra, the splitting algebra A_{\Gamma}. First introduced by Gelfand, Retakh, Serconek, and Wilson, splitting algebras originated from the problem of factoring non-commuting polynomials. Given a finite ranked poset \Gamma, we ask: Is R_{\Gamma} Koszul? The Koszulity of R_{\Gamma} is related to a combinatorial topology property of \Gamma called Cohen-Macaulay. Kloefkorn and Shelton proved that if \Gamma is a finite ranked cyclic poset, then \Gamma is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if \Gamma is uniform and R_{\Gamma} is Koszul. We define a new generalization of Cohen-Macaulay, weakly Cohen-Macaulay, and we note that this new class includes posets with disconnected open subintervals. We prove: if \Gamma is a finite ranked cyclic poset, then \Gamma is weakly Cohen-Macaulay if and only if R_{\Gamma} is Koszul.
