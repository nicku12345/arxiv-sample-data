This paper presents a survey of the results and ideas behind the classification of the fine gradings, up to equivalence, on the simple finite dimensional Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. It provides an expanded version of the mini course delivered by the second author at the Conference "Advances in Group Theory and Applications AGTA-2015".
