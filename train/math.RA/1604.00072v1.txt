In this article, we introduce Cohn path algebras of higher-rank graphs. We prove that for a higher-rank graph \Lambda , there exists a higher-rank graph T\Lambda  such that the Cohn path algebra of \Lambda  is isomorphic to the Kumjian-Pask algebra of T\Lambda . We then use this isomorphism and properties of Kumjian-Pask algebras to study Cohn path algebras. This includes proving a uniqueness theorem for Cohn path algebras.
