In this study, we introduce the concept of quasi n-absorbing elements of multiplicative lattices. A proper element q is said to be a quasi n-absorbing element of L if whenever a^nb\le q implies that either a^n\le q or a^{n-1}b\le q. We investigate properties of this new type of elements and obtain some relations among prime, 2-absorbing, n-absorbing elements in multiplicative lattices.
