In this paper, we are concerned with Gorenstein projective objects in homotopy categories. Specifically, we present a characterization on Gorenstein projective objects in the category of complexes. Using this result, it is proved that the category of Gorenstein projective objects is a compactly generated triangulated category and an equivalence of triangulated categories is also given over some reasonably nice rings.
