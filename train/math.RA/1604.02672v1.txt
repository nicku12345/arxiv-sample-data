We first show a counter intuitive result that in the ring of real valued continuous functions on [0,1] non maximal prime ideals exist. This is a standard proof and a well known result. Interestingly, a non maximal prime ideal in this ring is actually contained inside a unique maximal ideal. We arrive at this result merely by looking at the zero set of ideals in this ring and by making simple geometrical observations. We end by leaving the reader with an interesting open problem that logically follows from this article.
