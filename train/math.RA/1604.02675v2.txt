The notion of the Moore-Penrose inverse of tensors with the Einstein product was introduced, very recently. In this paper, we further elaborate this theory by producing a few characterizations of different generalized inverses of tensors. A new method to compute the Moore-Penrose inverse of tensors is proposed. Reverse order laws for several generalized inverses of tensors are also presented. In addition to these, we discuss general solutions of multilinear systems of tensors using such theory.
