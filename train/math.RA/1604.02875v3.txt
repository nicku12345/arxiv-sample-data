We study ideal lattices constructed from totally definite quaternion algebras over totally real number fields, and generalize the definition of Arakelov-modular lattices over number fields. In particular, we prove for the case where the totally real number field is \mathbb{Q}, that for \ell a prime integer, there always exists a totally definite quaternion over \mathbb{Q} from which an Arakelov-modular lattice of level \ell can be constructed.
