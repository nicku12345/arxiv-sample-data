In this paper we introduce an equivalence between the category of the t-nilpotent quadratic Lie algebras with d generators and the category of some symmetric invariant bilinear forms on the t-nilpotent free Lie algebra with d generators. Taking into account this equivalence, t-nilpotent quadratic Lie algebras with d generators are classified (up to isometric isomorphism, and over any field of characteristic zero), in the following cases: d=2 and t<6, d=3 and t<4.
