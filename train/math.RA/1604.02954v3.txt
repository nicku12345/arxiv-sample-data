In continuation of our recent work about smash product Hom-Hopf algebras in \cite{MLY}, we introduce Hom-Yetter-Drinfeld category _H^H{\mathbb{YD}} via Radford biproduct Hom-Hopf algebra, and prove that the Hom-Yetter-Drinfeld modules can provide solutions of the Hom-Yang-Baxter equation and _H^H{\mathbb{YD}} is a pre-braided tensor category, where (H, \b, S) is a Hom-Hopf algebra. Furthermore, we obtain that (A^{\natural}_{\diamond} H,\a\o \b) is a Radford biproduct Hom-Hopf algebra if and only if (A,\a) is a Hopf algebra in the category _H^H{\mathbb{YD}}. At last, some examples and applications are given.
