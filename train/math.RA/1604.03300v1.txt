Rota-Baxter systems are modified by the inclusion of a curvature term. It is shown that, subject to specific properties of the curvature form, curved Rota-Baxter systems (A,R,S,\omega) induce associative and (left) pre-Lie products on the algebra A. It is also shown that if both Rota-Baxter operators coincide with each other and the curvature is A-bilinear, then the (modified by R) Hochschild cohomology ring over A is a curved differential graded algebra.
