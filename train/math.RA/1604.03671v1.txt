Let S, K be two subrings of a finite ring R. Then the generalized non-commuting graph of subrings S, K of R, denoted by \Gamma_{S, K}, is a simple graph whose vertex set is (S \cup K) \setminus (C_K(S) \cup C_S(K)) and two distinct vertices a, b are adjacent if and only if a \in S or b \in S and ab \neq ba. We determine the diameter, girth and some dominating sets for \Gamma_{S, K}. Some connections between the \Gamma_{S, K} and \Pr(S, K) are also obtained. Further, \Z-isoclinism between two pairs of finite rings is defined and showed that the generalized non-commuting graphs of two \Z-isoclinic pairs are isomorphic under some condition.
