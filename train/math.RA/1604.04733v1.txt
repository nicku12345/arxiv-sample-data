In this paper we study symplectic involutions and quadratic pairs that become hyperbolic over the function field of a conic. In particular, we classify them in degree 4 and deduce results on 5 dimensional minimal quadratic forms, thus extending to arbitrary fields some results of [24], which were only known in characteristic different from 2.
