In this paper, we generalize the Lyndon-Shirshov words to Lyndon-Shirshov \Omega-words on a set X and prove that the set of all non-associative Lyndon-Shirshov \Omega-words forms a linear basis of the free Lie \Omega-algebra on the set X. From this, we establish Gr\"{o}bner-Shirshov bases theory for Lie \Omega-algebras. As applications, we give Gr\"{o}bner-Shirshov bases for free \lambda-Rota-Baxter Lie algebras, free modified \lambda-Rota-Baxter Lie algebras and free Nijenhuis Lie algebras and then linear bases of such three free algebras are obtained.
