This paper is the result of a research project completed in the context of the first author's Undergraduate Student Research Award from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).   We prove a nesting phenomenon for twisted Frobenius extensions. Namely, suppose R \subseteq B \subseteq A are graded superrings such that A and B are both twisted Frobenius extensions of R, R is contained in the center of A, and A is projective over B. Our main result is that, under these assumptions, A is a twisted Frobenius extension of B. This generalizes a result of Pike and the second author, which considered the case where R is a field.
