We study conditions when a certain type of the Riesz Decomposition Property (RDP for short) holds in the lexicographic product of two po-groups. Defining two important properties of po-groups, we extend known situations showing that the lexicographic product satisfies RDP or even RDP_1, a stronger type of RDP. We recall that a very strong type of RDP, RDP_2, entails that the group is lattice ordered. RDP's of the lexicographic products are important for the study of lexicographic pseudo effect algebras, or perfect types of pseudo MV-algebras and pseudo effect algebras, where infinitesimal elements play an important role both for algebras as well as for the first order logic of valid but not provable formulas.
