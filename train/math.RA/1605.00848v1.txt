In this paper solvable Leibniz algebras with naturally graded non-Lie p-filiform (n-p\geq4) nilradical and with one-dimensional complemented space of nilradical are described. Moreover, solvable Leibniz algebras with abelian nilradical and extremal (minimal, maximal) dimensions of complemented space nilradical are studied. The rigidity of solvable Leibniz algebras with abelian nilradical and maximal dimension of its complemented space is proved.
