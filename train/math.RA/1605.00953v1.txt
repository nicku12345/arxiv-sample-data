We address the problem of constructing the non-associative version of the Dynkin form of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula; that is, expressing \log (\exp (x)\exp(y)), where x and y are non-associative variables, in terms of the Shestakov-Umirbaev primitive operations. In particular, we obtain a recursive expression for the Magnus expansion of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff series and an explicit formula in degrees smaller than 5. Our main tool is a non-associative version of the Dynkin-Specht-Wever Lemma. A construction of Bernouilli numbers in terms of binary trees is also recovered.
