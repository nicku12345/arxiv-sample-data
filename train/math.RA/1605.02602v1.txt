In this paper we attempt to investigate the super-biderivations of Lie superalgebras. Furthermore, we prove that all super-biderivations on the centerless super-Virasoro algebras are inner super-biderivations. Finally, we study the linear super commuting maps on the centerless super-Virasoro algebras.
