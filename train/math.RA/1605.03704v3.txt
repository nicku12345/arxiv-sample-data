Let \mathcal{W} be the class of all pure projective modules. In this article, \mathcal{W}-injective modules is defined via the vanishing of cohomology of pure projective modules. First we show that every module has a \mathcal{W}-injective coresolution over an arbitrary ring and the class of all \mathcal{W}-injective modules is coresolving over a pure-hereditary ring. Further, we analyze the dimension of \mathcal{W}-injective coresolution over a pure-hereditary ring. It is shown that \Fcor_{\mathcal{W}^{\bot}}(R) = \sup\{\pd(G) \colon G is a pure projective R-module\} = \sup\{\cores_{\mathcal{W}^{\bot}}(M) \colon M  is an R-module\}. Finally, we give some equivalent conditions of \mathcal{W}-injective envelope with the unique mapping property. The dimension has desirable properties when the ring is semisimple artinian.
