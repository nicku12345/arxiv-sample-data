In this paper, we construct some left-symmetric algebras arising from the operation of DNA insertion. We define a new operation of insertion by modifying the simplified insertion as follows: x\Rightarrow y:=f(\mid x\mid, \mid y \mid)\sum\limits_{i=o}^{q} y_{1}y_{2}\cdots y_{i} x y_{i+1}\cdots y_{q} where x = x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{p} and y = y_{1}y_{2}\cdots y_{q}. Then it is proved that (x, y, z)_2= (y, x, z)_2 if and only if f satisfies the following conditions: f(m, n) f(m+n, p)=f(n, p) f(m, n+p)= f(m, p) f(n, m+p) where m, n, p\in \mathbb{N}. The paper also give an important example: f(m, n)=\exp\{g(m, n)\}, where g(m, n)=k\cdot mn, k is a fixed positive number. We also give simple case to make clear that the intermediate version of the insertion operation which is the open problem numbered [5] and the operator of synchronized insertion given in the \cite{Bremner} by Bremner do not satisfy the left-symmetric identities.
