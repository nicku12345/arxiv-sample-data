It is well known that n-Hom Lie superalgebras are certain generalizations of n-Lie algebras. This paper is devoted to investigate the generalized derivations of multiplicative n-Hom Lie superalgebras. We generalize the main results of Leger and Luks to the case of multiplicative n-Hom Lie superalgebras. Firstly, we review some concepts associated with a multiplicative n-Hom Lie superalgebra N. Furthermore, we give the definitions of the generalized derivations, quasiderivations, center derivations, centroids and quasicentroids. Obviously, we have the following tower ZDer(N)\subseteq Der(N)\subseteq QDer(N)\subseteq GDer(N)\subseteq End(N). Later on, we give some useful properties and connections between these derivations. Moreover, we obtain that the quasiderivation of N can be embedded as a derivation in a larger multiplicative n-Hom Lie superalgebra. Finally, we conclude that the derivation of the larger multiplicative n-Hom Lie superalgebra has a direct sum decomposition when the center of N is equal to zero.
