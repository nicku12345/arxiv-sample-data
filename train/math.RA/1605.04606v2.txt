If R is a regular and semiartinian ring, it is proved that the following conditions are equivalent: (1) R is unit-regular, (2) every factor ring of R is directly finite, (3) the abelian group K_0(R) is free and admits a basis which is in a canonical one to one correspondence with a set of representatives of simple right R-modules. For the class of semiartinian and unit-regular rings the canonical partial order of K_0(R) is investigated and the directed abelian groups which are realizable as K_0(R) of these rings are classified.
