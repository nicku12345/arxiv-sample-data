This paper studies similarities and differences between the classes of rings over which each simple module is injective and rings over which each simple module is \Sigma-injective. The rings in the former class are called V-rings and the rings in the latter class are called \Sigma-V rings. We have obtained analogues of various well-known results about V-rings for \Sigma-V rings. Motivated by a conjecture of Kaplansky, Fisher asked if a prime right V-ring is right primitive. Although a counter-example to Kaplansky's conjecture was constructed long ago but Fisher's question is still open. In this paper we show that for a right \Sigma-V ring, the notions of prime and primitive are equivalent. Also, we show that an exchange \Sigma-V ring is left-right symmetric and moreover, it is von Neumann regular.
