It is known that every complex trace-zero matrix is the sum of four square-zero matrices, but not necessarily of three such matrices. In this note, we prove that for every trace-zero matrix A over an arbitrary field, there is a non-negative integer p such that the extended matrix A \oplus 0_p is the sum of three square-zero matrices (more precisely, one can simply take p as the number of rows of A). Moreover, we demonstrate that if the underlying field has characteristic 2 then every trace-zero matrix is the sum of three square-zero matrices. We also discuss a counterpart of the latter result for sums of idempotents.
