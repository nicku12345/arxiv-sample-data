We extend conjugacy results from Lie algebras to their Leibniz algebra generalizations. The proofs in the Lie case depend on anti-commutativity. Thus it is necessary to find other paths in the Leibniz case. Some of these results involve Cartan subalgebras. Our results can be used to extend other results on Cartan subalgebras. We show an example here and others will be shown in future work.
