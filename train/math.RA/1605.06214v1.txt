Let \frak g be the finite dimensional simple Lie algebra associated to an indecomposable and symmetrizable generalized Cartan matrix C=(a_{ij})_{n\times n} of finite type and let \frak d be a finite dimensional Lie algebra related to a quantum group D_{q,p^{-1}}(\frak g) obtained by Hodges, Levasseur and Toro \cite{HoLeT} by deforming the quantum group U_q(\frak g).   Here we see that \frak d is a generalization of \frak g and give a \frak d-invariant symmetric bilinear form on \frak d.
