In this paper we find minimal faithful representations of several classes filiform Lie algebras by means of strictly upper-triangular matrices. We investigate Leibniz algebras whose corresponding Lie algebras are filiform Lie algebras such that the action I \times L \to I gives rise to a minimal faithful representation of a filiform Lie algebra. The classification up to isomorphism of such Leibniz algebras is given for low-dimensional cases.
