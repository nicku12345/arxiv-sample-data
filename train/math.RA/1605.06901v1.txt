In 1983 Feingold-Frenkel studied the structure of a rank 3 hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra \mathcal{F} containing the affine KM algebra A^{(1)}_1. In 2004 Feingold-Nicolai showed that \mathcal{F} contains all rank 2 hyperbolic KM algebras with symmetric Cartan matrices, A=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 2 & -a \\ -a & 2 \\ \end{array}\right], a\geq 3. The case when a=3 is called \mathcal{F}ib because of its connection with the Fibonacci numbers (Feingold 1980). Some important structural results about \mathcal{F} come from the decomposition with respect to its affine subalgebra A^{(1)}_1. Here we study the decomposition of \mathcal{F} with respect to its subalgebra \mathcal{F}ib. We find that \mathcal{F} has a grading by \mathcal{F}ib-level, and prove that each graded piece, \mathcal{F}ib(m) for m\in\mathbb{Z}, is an integrable \mathcal{F}ib-module. We show that for |m|>2, \mathcal{F}ib(m) completely reduces as a direct sum of highest- and lowest-weight modules, and for |m|\leq 2, \mathcal{F}ib(m) contains one irreducible non-standard quotient module V^{\Lambda_m}=V(m)\Big/U(m). We then prove that the quotient \mathcal{F}ib(m)\Big/V(m) completely reduces as a direct sum of one trivial module (on level 0), and standard modules. We give an algorithm for determining the inner multiplicities of any irreducible \mathcal{F}ib-module, in particular the non-standard modules on levels |m|\leq 2. We show that multiplicities of non-standard modules on levels |m|=1,2 do not follow the Kac-Peterson recursion, but instead appear to follow a recursion similar to Racah-Speiser. We then use results of Borcherds and Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman and construct vertex algebras from the root lattices of \mathcal{F} and \mathcal{F}ib, and study the decomposition within this setting.
