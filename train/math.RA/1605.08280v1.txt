Let W_{\overline{1}} and H_{\overline{0}} denote the odd parts of the general Witt modular Lie superalgebra W and the even parts of the Hamiltonian Lie superalgebra H over a field of characteristic p>3, respectively. We give a torus of H_{\overline{0}} and the weight space decomposition of the special subalgebra of W_{\overline{1}} with respect to the torus. By means of the derivations of the weight 0 and three series of outer derivations from H_{\overline{0}} into W_{\overline{1}}, the derivations from the even parts of Hamiltonian superalgebra to the odd parts of Witt superalgebra are determined.
