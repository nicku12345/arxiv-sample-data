The purpose of this paper is to study the relationships between a Hom-Lie superalgebra and its induced 3-ary-Hom-Lie superalgebra. We provide an overview of the theory and explore the structure properties such as ideals, center, derived series, solvability, nilpotency, central extensions, and the cohomology.
