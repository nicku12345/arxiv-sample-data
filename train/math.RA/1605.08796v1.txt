In this paper we construct a minimal faithful representation of the (2m+2)-dimensional complex general Diamond Lie algebra, \mathfrak{D}_m(\mathbb{C}), which is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the special linear Lie algebra \mathfrak{sl}(m+2,\mathbb{C}). We also construct a faithful representation of the general Diamond Lie algebra \mathfrak{D}_m which is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the special symplectic Lie algebra \mathfrak{sp}(2m+2,\mathbb{R}). Furthermore, we describe Leibniz algebras with corresponding (2m+2)-dimensional general Diamond Lie algebra \mathfrak{D}_m and ideal generated by the squares of elements giving rise to a faithful representation of \mathfrak{D}_m.
