In this paper we introduce the semi-graded rings, which extend graded rings and skew PBW extensions. For this new type of non-commutative rings we will discuss some basic problems of non-commutative algebraic geometry. In particular, we will prove some elementary properties of the generalized Hilbert series, Hilbert polynomial and Gelfand-Kirillov dimension. We will extended the notion of non-commutative projective scheme to the case of semi-graded rings and we generalize the Serre-Artin-Zhang-Verevkin theorem. Some examples are included at the end of the paper.
