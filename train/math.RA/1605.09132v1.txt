Let R be a ring with identity, (M;\leq) a commutative positive strictly ordered monoid and w_m an automorphism for each m \in M . The skew generalized power series ring R[[M,w]] is a common generalization of (skew) polynomial rings, (skew) power series rings, (skew) Laurent polynomial rings, (skew) group rings, and Mal'cev Neumann Laurent series rings. If S\subset R is a multiplicative set, then R is called right S-Noetherian, if for each ideal I of R, Is \subseteq J\subseteq I for some s\in S and some finitely generated right ideal J . Unifying and generalizing a number of known results, we study transfers of S-Noetherian property to the ring R[[M,w]]. We also show that the ring R[[M,w]] is left Noetherian if and only if R is left Noetherian and M is finitely generated. Generalizing a result of Anderson and Dumitrescu, we show that,when S\subset R is a-anti-Archimedean multiplicative set with a an automorphism of R, then R is right S-Noetherian if and only if the skew polynomial ring R[x,a] is right S-Noetherian.
