In this article we define G-algebras, that is, graded algebras on which a reductive group G acts as gradation preserving automorphisms. Starting from a finite dimensional G-module V and the polynomial ring \mathbb{C}[V], it is shown how one constructs a sequence of projective varieties \mathbf{V}_k such that each point of \mathbf{V}_k corresponds to a graded algebra with the same decomposition up to degree k as a G-module. After some general theory, we apply this to the case that V is the n+1-dimensional permutation representation of S_{n+1}, the permutation group on n+1 letters.
