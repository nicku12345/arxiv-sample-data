We say that an R-module M is {\it virtually simple} if M\neq (0) and N\cong M for every non-zero submodule N of M, and {\it virtually semisimple} if each submodule of M is isomorphic to a direct summand of M. We carry out a study of virtually semisimple modules and modules which are direct sums of virtually simple modules. Our theory provides two natural generalizations of the Wedderburn-Artin Theorem and an analogous to the classical Krull-Schmidt Theorem. Some applications of these theorems are indicated. For instance, it is shown that the following statements are equivalent for a ring R: (i) Every finitely generated left (right) R-modules is virtually semisimple; (ii) Every finitely generated left (right) R-modules is a direct sum of virtually simple modules; (iii) R\cong\prod_{i=1}^{k} M_{n_i}(D_i) where k, n_1,\ldots,n_k\in \Bbb{N} and each D_i is a principal ideal V-domain; and {\rm (iv)} Every non-zero finitely generated left R-module can be written uniquely (up to isomorphism and order of the factors) in the form  Rm_1 \oplus\ldots\oplus Rm_k where each Rm_i is either a simple R-module or a left virtually simple direct summand of R.
