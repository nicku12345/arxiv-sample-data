The Jacobi identity is one of the properties that are used to define the concept of Lie algebra and in this context is closely related to associativity. In this paper we provide a complete description of all bivariate polynomials that satisfy the Jacobi identity over infinite integral domains. Although this description depends on the characteristic of the domain, it turns out that all these polynomials are of degree at most one in each indeterminate.
