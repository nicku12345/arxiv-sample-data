We classify modules and rings with some specific properties of their intersection graphs. In particular, we describe rings with infinite intersection graphs containing maximal left ideals of finite degree. This answers a question raised in [A2]. We also generalize this result to modules, i.e. we get the structure theorem of modules for which their intersection graphs are infinite and contain maximal submodules of finite degree. Furthermore we omit the assumption of maximality of submodules and still get a satisfactory characterization of such modules. In addition we show that, if the intersection graph of a module is infinite but its clique number is finite, then the clique and chromatic numbers of the graph coincide. This fact was known earlier only in some particular cases. It appears that such equality holds also in the complement graph.
