Let F be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and G be a finite abelian group. If A=\oplus_{g\in G} A_g is a G-graded algebra, we study degree-inverting involutions on A, i.e., involutions * on A satisfying (A_g)^*\subseteq A_{g^{-1}}, for all g\in G. We describe such involutions for the full n\times n matrix algebra over F and for the algebra of n\times n upper triangular matrices.
