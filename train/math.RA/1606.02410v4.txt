A double Ore extension was introduced by James Zhang and Jun Zhang [26] to study a class of Artin-Schelter regular algebras. Here we give a definition of Poisson double extension which may be considered as an analogue of double Ore extension and show that algebras in a class of double Ore extensions are deformation quantizations of Poisson double extensions. We also investigate the modular derivations of Poisson double extensions and the relationship between Poisson double extensions and iterated Poisson polynomial extensions. Results are illustrated by examples.
