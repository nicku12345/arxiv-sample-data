Let A=\bigoplus_{p\in G}A_{p} be a multiplier Hopf T-coalgebra over a group G, in this paper we give the definition of the crossed left A-G-modules and show that the category of crossed left A-G-modules is a monoidal category. Finally we show that a family of multipliers R = \{R_{p, q} \in M(A_{p}\otimes A_{q})\}_{p, q\in G} is a quasitriangular structure of a multiplier T-coalgebra A if and only if the crossed left A-G-module category over A is a braided monoidal category with the braiding c defined by R, generalizing the main results in \cite{ZCL11} to the more general framework of multiplier Hopf algebras.
