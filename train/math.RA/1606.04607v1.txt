In this paper, we give a matrix-theoretic criterion for the Leavitt path algebra of a finite graph has Invariant Basis Number. Consequently, we show that the Cohn path algebra of a finite graph has Invariant Basis Number, as well as provide some certain classes of finite graphs for which Leavitt path algebras having Invariant Basis Number.
