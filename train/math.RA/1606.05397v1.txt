If \mathfrak{g} is a Frobenius Lie algebra, then for certain F\in \mathfrak{g}^* the natural map \mathfrak{g}\longrightarrow \mathfrak{g}^*  given by x \longmapsto F[x,-] is an isomorphism. The inverse image of F under this isomorphism is called a principal element. We show that if \mathfrak{g} is a Frobenius seaweed subalgebra of A_{n-1}=\mathfrak{sl}(n) then the spectrum of the adjoint of a principal element consists of an unbroken set of integers whose multiplicities have a symmetric distribution. Our proof methods are constructive and combinatorial in nature.
