The first Weyl algebra, A_1 = k \langle x, y\rangle/(xy-yx - 1) is naturally \mathbb{Z}-graded by letting \operatorname{deg} x = 1 and \operatorname{deg} y = -1. Sue Sierra studied \operatorname{gr}- A_1, category of graded right A_1-modules, computing its Picard group and classifying all rings graded equivalent to A_1. In this paper, we generalize these results by studying the graded module category of certain generalized Weyl algebras. We show that for a generalized Weyl algebra A(f) with base ring k[z] defined by a quadratic polynomial f, the Picard group of \operatorname{gr}- A(f) is isomorphic to the Picard group of \operatorname{gr}- A_1. In a companion paper, we use these results to construct commutative rings which are graded equivalent to generalized Weyl algebras.
