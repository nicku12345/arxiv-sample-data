The first Weyl algebra over k, A_1 = k \langle x, y\rangle/(xy-yx - 1) admits a natural \mathbb{Z}-grading by letting \operatorname{deg} x = 1 and \operatorname{deg} y = -1. Paul Smith showed that \operatorname{gr}- A_1 is equivalent to the category of quasicoherent sheaves on a certain quotient stack. Using autoequivalences of \operatorname{gr}- A_1, Smith constructed a commutative ring C, graded by finite subsets of the integers. He then showed \operatorname{gr}- A_1 \equiv \operatorname{gr}- (C, \mathbb{Z}_{\mathrm{fin}}). In this paper, we generalize results of Smith by using autoequivalences of a graded module category to construct rings with equivalent graded module categories. For certain generalized Weyl algebras, we use autoequivalences defined in a companion paper so that these constructions yield commutative rings.
