The purpose of this paper is to extend the cohomology and conformal derivation theories of the classical Lie conformal algebras to Hom-Lie conformal algebras. In this paper, we develop cohomology theory of Hom-Lie conformal algebras and discuss some applications to the study of deformations of regular Hom-Lie conformal algebras. Also, we introduce \alpha^k-derivations of multiplicative Hom-Lie conformal algebras and study their properties.
