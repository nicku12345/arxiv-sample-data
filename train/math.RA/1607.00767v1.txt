We construct homology with trivial coefficients of Hom-Leibniz n-algebras. We introduce and characterize universal (\alpha)-central extensions of Hom-Leibniz n-algebras. In particular, we show their interplay with the zeroth and first homology with trivial coefficients. When n=2 we recover the corresponding results on universal central extensions of Hom-Leibniz algebras. The notion of non-abelian tensor product of Hom-Leibniz n-algebras is introduced and we establish its relationship with the universal central extensions. We develop a generalization of the concept and properties of unicentral Leibniz algebras to the setting of Hom-Leibniz n-algebras.
