We study cyclic codes with arbitrary length over Fp+vFp where theta(v)=av, a in Fp and v^2=0. We characterize all existing codes in case of O(theta)|n by using certain projections from (Fp+vFp)[x;theta] to Fp[x]. We provide an explicit expression for the ensemble of all possible codes. We also prove useful properties of these codes in the case where O(theta)|n does not hold. We provide results and examples to illustrate how the codes are constructed and how their encoding and decoding are realized.
