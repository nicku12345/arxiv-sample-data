Let F be an infinite field. The primeness property for central polynomials of M_n(F) was proved by A. Regev, i.e., if the product of two polynomials in distinct variables is central then each factor is also central. In this paper we consider the analogous property for M_n(F) and determine, within the elementary gradings with commutative neutral component, the ones that satisfy this property, namely the crossed product gradings. Next we consider M_n(R), where R admits a regular grading, with a grading such that M_n(F) is a homogeneous subalgebra and provide sufficient conditions - satisfied by M_n(E) with the trivial grading - to prove that M_n(R) has the primeness property if M_n(F) does. We also prove that the algebras M_{a,b}(E) satisfy this property for ordinary central polynomials. Hence over a field of characteristic zero every verbally prime algebra as the primeness property.
