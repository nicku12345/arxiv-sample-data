Let F be a field of characteristic p. We define and investigate nonassociative differential extensions of F and of a central simple division algebra over F and give a criterium for these algebras to be division. As special cases, we obtain classical results for associative algebras by Amitsur and Jacobson. We construct families of nonassociative division algebras which can be viewed as generalizations of associative cyclic extensions of a purely inseparable field extension of exponent one or a central division algebra. Division algebras which are nonassociative cyclic extensions of a purely inseparable field extension of exponent one are particularly easy to obtain.
