An algebra A satisfies the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence if we have the equivalences: P~{\rm primitive}\iff P~{\rm rational}\iff P ~{\rm locally~closed~}\qquad~{\rm for}~P\in {\rm Spec}(A). We study the robustness of the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence under extension of scalars and under the formation of Ore extensions. In particular, we show that the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence is preserved under base change for finitely generated complex noetherian algebras. We also study Ore extensions of finitely generated complex noetherian algebras A. If T:A\to A is either a \mathbb{C}-algebra automorphism or a \mathbb{C}-linear derivation of A, we say that T is \emph{frame-preserving} if there exists a finite-dimensional subspace V\subseteq A that generates A as an algebra such that T(V)\subseteq V. We show that if A is of finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension and has the property that all prime ideals of A are completely prime and A satisfies the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence then the Ore extension A[x;T] satisfies the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence whenever T is a frame-preserving derivation or automorphism.
