We prove that the maximal dimension of a p-central subspace of the generic symbol p-algebra of prime degree p is p+1. We do it by proving the following number theoretic fact: let \{s_1,\dots,s_{p+1}\} be p+1 distinct nonzero elements in the additive group G=(\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z}) \times (\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z}); then every nonzero element g \in G can be expressed as d_1 s_1+\dots+d_{p+1} s_{p+1} for some non-negative integers d_1,\dots,d_{p+1} with d_1+\dots+d_{p+1} \leq p-1.
