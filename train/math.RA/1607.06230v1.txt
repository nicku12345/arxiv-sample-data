In this paper we introduce a new generalized inverse in a ring -- one-sided (b, c)-inverse, derived as an extension of (b, c)-inverse. This inverse also generalizes one-sided inverse along an element, which was recently introduced by H. H. Zhu et al. [H. H. Zhu, J. L. Chen, P. Patr\'{i}cio, Further results on the inverse along an element in semigroups and rings, Linear Multilinear Algebra, 64 (3) (2016) 393-403]. Also, here we present one-sided annihilator (b, c)-inverse, which is an extension of the annihilator (b, c)-inverse. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these new generalized inverses are obtained. Furthermore, we investigate conditions for the existence of one-sided (b, c)-inverse of a product of three elements and we consider some properties of one-sided (b, c)-inverses.
