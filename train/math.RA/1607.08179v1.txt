We present equivalent conditions of reverse order law for the (b, c)-inverse (aw)^{(b,c)}=w^{(b,s)}a^{(t,c)} to hold in a ring. Also, we study various mixed-type reverse order laws for the (b,c)-inverse. As a consequence, we get results related to the reverse order law for the inverse along an element. More general case of reverse order law (a_1a_2)^{(b_3, c_3)}=a_2^{(b_2, c_2)}a_1^{(b_1, c_1)} is considered too.
