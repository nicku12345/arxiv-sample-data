We study an extension algebra A from two given 3-Lie algebras M and H, and discuss the extensibility of a pair of derivations, one from the derivation algebra of M and the other from that of H, to a derivation of A. In particular, we give conditions for such an extension to be a 3-Lie algebra, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions of the pair of derivations to be extendable.
