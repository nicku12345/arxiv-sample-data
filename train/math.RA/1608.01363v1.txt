Let \mathfrak F be a saturated formation of soluble Lie algebras over a field F of characteristic p > 0 and let {\mathbb F}_p denote the field of p elements. Let (L,[p]) be a restricted Lie algebra over F with z^{\scriptstyle [p]}=0 for all z in the centre of L. Let S \in \mathfrak F, S\ne 0 be a subnormal subalgebra of L. Let V, W be L-modules. Suppose that the character cluster of W is contained in the set of {\mathbb F}_p-linear combinations of the characters in the character cluster of V. Suppose that V, regarded as S-module, is \mathfrak F-hypercentral. Then W, regarded as S-module, is also \mathfrak F-hypercentral.
