An n\times n complex matrix A is called coninvolutory if \bar AA=I_n and skew-coninvolutory if \bar AA=-I_n (which implies that n is even). We prove that each matrix of size n\times n with n>1 is a sum of 5 coninvolutory matrices and each matrix of size 2m\times 2m is a sum of 5 skew-coninvolutory matrices.   We also prove that each square complex matrix is a sum of a coninvolutory matrix and a condiagonalizable matrix. A matrix M is called condiagonalizable if M=\bar S^{-1}DS in which S is nonsingular and D is diagonal.
