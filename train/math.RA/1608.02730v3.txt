In characteristic two, it is shown that a central simple algebra of degree equal to a power of two with anisotropic orthogonal involution is totally decomposable, if it becomes either anisotropic or metabolic over all extensions of the ground field. A similar result is obtained for the case where this algebra with involution is Brauer-equivalent to a quaternion algebra and it becomes adjoint to a bilinear Pfister form over all splitting fields of the algebra.
