The main result of this paper is the following: if F is any field and R is any F-subalgebra of the algebra of nxn matrices over F with Lie nilpotence index m, then the F-dimension of R is less or equal than M(m+1,n), where M(m+1,n) is the maximum of a certain expression of m+1 nonnegative integers and n. The case m=1 reduces to a classical theorem of Schur (1905), later generalized by Jacobson (1944) to all fields, which asserts that if F is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and R is any commutative F-subalgebra of the full nxn matrix algebra over F, then the F-dimension of R is less or equal than ((n^2)/4)+1. Examples constructed from block upper triangular matrices show that the upper bound of M(m+1,n) cannot be lowered for any choice of m and n. An explicit formula for M(m+1,n) is also derived.
