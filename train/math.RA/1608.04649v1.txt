We develope the theory of the \mathcal{E}-relative Igusa-Todorov functions in an exact  IT-context (\mathcal{C},\mathcal{E}). In the case when \mathcal{C}=mod\, (\Lambda) is the category of finitely generated left \Lambda-modules, for an artin algebra \Lambda, and \mathcal{E} is the class of all exact sequences in \mathcal{C}, we recover the usual Igusa-Todorov functions. We use the setting of the exact structures and the Auslander-Solberg relative homological theory to generalise the original Igusa-Todorov's results. Furthermore, we introduce the \mathcal{E}-relative Igusa-Todorov dimension and also we obtain relationships with the relative global and relative finitistic dimensions and the Gorenstein homological dimensions.
