In this paper, double commutativity and the reverse order law for the core inverse are considered. Then, new characterizations of the Moore-Penrose inverse of a regular element are given by one-sided invertibilities in a ring. Furthermore, the characterizations and representations of the core and dual core inverses of a regular element are considered.
