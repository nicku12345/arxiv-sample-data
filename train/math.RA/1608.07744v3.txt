Given any finitely aligned higher-rank graph \Lambda and any unital commutative ring R, the Kumjian-Pask algebra \mathrm{KP}_R(\Lambda) is known as the higher-rank generalization of Leavitt path algebras. After characterizing simple Kumjian-Pask algebras by L.O. Clark and Y.E.P. Pangalela (and others), we focus in this article on the purely infinite simple ones. Briefly, we show that if \mathrm{KP}_R(\Lambda) is simple and every vertex of \Lambda is reached from a generalized cycle with an entrance, then \mathrm{KP}_R(\Lambda) is purely infinite. We next prove a standard dichotomy for simple Kumjian-Pask algebras: in the case that each vertex of \Lambda is reached only from finitely many vertices and \mathrm{KP}_R(\Lambda) is simple, then \mathrm{KP}_R(\Lambda) is either purely infinite or locally matritial. This result covers all unital simple Kumjian-Pask algebras.
