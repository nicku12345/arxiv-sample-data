In this article we introduce the notion of a controlled group graded ring. Let G be a group, with identity element e, and let R=\oplus_{g\in G} R_g be a unital G-graded ring. We say that R is G-controlled if there is a one-to-one correspondence between subsets of the group G and (mutually non-isomorphic) R_e-bimodules in R, given by G \supseteq H \mapsto \oplus_{h\in H} R_h. For strongly G-graded rings, the property of being G-controlled is stronger than that of being simple. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a general G-graded ring to be G-controlled. We also give a characterization of strongly G-graded rings which are G-controlled. As an application of our main results we give a description of all intermediate subrings T with R_e \subseteq T \subseteq R of a G-controlled strongly G-graded ring R. Our results generalize results for artinian skew group rings which were shown by Azumaya 70 years ago. In the special case of skew group rings we obtain an algebraic analogue of a recent result by Cameron and Smith on bimodules in crossed products of von Neumann algebras.
