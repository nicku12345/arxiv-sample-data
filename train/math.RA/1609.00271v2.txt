We compare a number of different definitions of structure algebras and TKK constructions for Jordan (super)algebras appearing in the literature. We demonstrate that, for unital superalgebras, all the definitions of the structure algebra and the TKK constructions fall apart into two cases. Moreover, one can be obtained as the Lie superalgebra of superderivations of the other. We also show that, for non-unital superalgebras, more definitions become non-equivalent. As an application, we obtain the corresponding Lie superalgebras for all simple finite dimensional Jordan superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.
