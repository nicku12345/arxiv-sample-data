In this paper we define a pair of faithful functors that map isomorphic and isotopic finite-dimensional algebras over finite fields to isomorphic graphs. These functors reduce the cost of computation that is usually required to determine whether two algebras are isomorphic. In order to illustrate their efficiency, we determine explicitly the classification of two- and three-dimensional partial quasigroup rings.
