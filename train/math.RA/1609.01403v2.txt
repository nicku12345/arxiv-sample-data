Let F be a Henselian field of q-cohomological dimension 3, where q is a prime. Let \Gamma_F be the totally ordered abelian value group of F and let D be a central division algebra over F of index a power of q such that the characteristic of the residue field, \overline{F} is coprime to q. We show that when 1\leq\dim_{\mathbb{F}_q}(\Gamma_F/q\Gamma_F)\leq 3, the reduced Whitehead group of D is trivial.
