The main focus of this paper is the complete enumeration of self-dual abelian codes in non-principal ideal group algebras \mathbb{F}_{2^k}[A\times \mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_{2^s}] with respect to both the Euclidean and Hermitian inner products, where k and s are positive integers and A is an abelian group of odd order. Based on the well-know characterization of Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual abelian codes, we show that such enumeration can be obtained in terms of a suitable product of the number of cyclic codes, the number of Euclidean self-dual cyclic codes, and the number of Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes of length 2^s over some Galois extensions of the ring \mathbb{F}_{2^k}+u\mathbb{F}_{2^k}, where u^2=0. Subsequently, general results on the characterization and enumeration of cyclic codes and self-dual codes of length p^s over \mathbb{F}_{p^k}+u\mathbb{F}_{p^k} are given. Combining these results, the complete enumeration of self-dual abelian codes in \mathbb{F}_{2^k}[A\times \mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_{2^s}] is therefore obtained.
