We classify pointed p^3-dimensional Hopf algebras H over any algebraically closed field k of prime characteristic p>0. In particular, we focus on the cases when the group G(H) of group-like elements is of order p or p^2, that is, when H is pointed but is not connected nor a group algebra. This work provides many new examples of (parametrized) non-commutative and non-cocommutative finite-dimensional Hopf algebras in positive characteristic.
