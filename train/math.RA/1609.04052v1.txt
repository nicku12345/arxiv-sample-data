The aim of this paper is to study the notions of \mathcal{A}-C3 and \mathcal{A}-D3 modules for some class \mathcal{A} of right modules. Several characterizations of these modules are provided and used to describe some well-known classes of rings and modules. For example, a regular right R-module F is a V-module if and only if every F-cyclic module M is an \mathcal{A}-C3 module where \mathcal{A} is the class of all simple submodules of M. Moreover, let R be a right artinian ring and \mathcal{A}, a class of right R-modules with local endomorphisms, containing all simple right R-modules and closed under isomorphisms. If all right R-modules are \mathcal{A}-injective, then R is a serial artinian ring with J^{2}(R)=0 if and only if every \mathcal{A}-C3 right R-module is quasi-injective, if and only if every \mathcal{A}-C3 right R-module is C3.
