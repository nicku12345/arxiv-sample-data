We study the notion of Rickart property in a general module theoretic setting as a generalization to the concept of Baer modules and right Rickart rings. A module M_{R} is called Rickart if the right annihilator in M_{R} of each left principal ideal of End_{R}(M) is generated by an idempotent. Characterizations of Rickart modules are given. We give sufficient conditions for direct sums of Rickart modules to be Rickart. We extend some useful results of right Rickart rings to the theory of Rickart modules.
