We study Jordan-Lie inner ideals of finite dimensional associative algebras and the corresponding Lie algebras and prove that they admit Levi decompositions. Moreover, we classify Jordan-Lie inner ideals satisfying a certain minimality condition and show that they are generated by pairs of idempotents.
