Let R be a ring and denote by \mathcal{FM} the class of all flat and Mittag-Leffler left R-modules. In \cite{BazzoniStovicek2} it is proved that, if R is countable, the orthogonal class of \mathcal{FM} consists of all cotorsion modules. In this note we extend this result to the class of all rings R satisfying that each flat left R-module is filtered by totally ordered limits of projective modules. This class of rings contains all countable, left perfect and discrete valuation domains. Moreover, assuming that there do not exist inaccessible cardinals, we obtain that, over these rings, all flat left R-modules have finite projective dimension.
