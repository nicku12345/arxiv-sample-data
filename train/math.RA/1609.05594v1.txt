The variety JorN_{5} of five-dimensional nilpotent Jordan algebras structures over an algebraically closed field is investigated. We show that JorN_{5} is the union of five irreducible components, four of them correspond to the Zariski closure of the GL_5-orbits of four rigid algebras and the other one is the Zariski closure of an union of orbits of infinite family of algebras, none of them being rigid.
