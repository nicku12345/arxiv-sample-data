For each non-commutative ring R, the commuting graph of R is a graph with vertex set R\setminus Z(R) and two vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if x\neq y and xy=yx. In this paper, we consider the domination and signed domination numbers on commuting graph \Gamma(R) for non-commutative ring R with Z(R)=\{0\}. For a finite ring R, it is shown that \gamma(\Gamma(R)) + \gamma(\overline{\Gamma}(R))=|R| if and only if R is non-commutative ring on 4 elements. Also we determine the domination number of \Gamma(\prod_{i=1}^{t}R_i) and commuting graph of non-commutative ring R of order p^3, where p is prime. Moreover we present an upper bound for signed domination number of \Gamma(\prod_{i=1}^{t}R_i).
