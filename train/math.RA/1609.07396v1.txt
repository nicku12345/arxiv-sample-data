We generalize the results of Leger and Luks, Zhang R. and Zhang Y.; Chen, Ma, Ni, Niu, Zhou and Fan; Kaygorodov and Popov about generalized derivations of color n-ary algebras to the case of n-ary Hom-\Omega color algebras. Particularly, we prove some properties of generalized derivations of multiplicative n-ary Hom-\Omega color algebras. Moreover, we prove that the quasiderivation algebra of any multiplicative n-ary Hom-\Omega color algebra can be embedded into the derivation algebra of a larger multiplicative n-ary Hom-\Omega color algebra.
