Evolution algebras were introduced into Genetics to deal with the mechanism of inheritance of asexual organisms. Their distribution into isotopism classes is uniquely related with the mutation of alleles in non-Mendelian Genetics. This paper deals with such a distribution by means of Computational Algebraic Geometry. We focus in particular on the two-dimensional case, which is related to the asexual reproduction processes of diploid organisms. Specifically, we determine the existence of four isotopism classes, whatever the base field is, and we characterize the corresponding isomorphism classes.
