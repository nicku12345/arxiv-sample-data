The aim of this paper is to introduce Hom-Novikov color algebras and give some constructions of Hom-Novikov color algebras from a given one and a (weak) morphism. Other interesting constructions using averaging operators, centroids, derivations and tensor product are given. We also proved that any Hom-Novikov color algebra is Hom-Lie admissible. Moreover, we introduce Hom-quadratic Hom-Novikov color algebras and provide some properties by twisting. It is also shown that the Hom-Lie color algebra associated to a given quadratic Hom-Novikov color algebra is also quadratic.
