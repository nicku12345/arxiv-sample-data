Fix an arbitrary prime p. Let F be a field containing a primitive p-th root of unity, with absolute Galois group G_F, and let H^n denote its mod p cohomology group H^n(G_F,\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}). The triple Massey product of weight (n,k,m)\in \mathbb{N}^3 is a partially defined, multi-valued function \langle \cdot,\cdot,\cdot \rangle: H^n\times H^k\times H^m\rightarrow H^{n+k+m-1}. %(in the mod-p Galois cohomology) In this work we prove that for an arbitrary prime p, any defined 3MP of weight (n,1,m), where the first and third entries are assumed to be symbols, contains zero; and that for p=2 any defined 3MP of the weight (1,k,1), where the middle entry is a symbol, contains zero. Finally, we use the description of the kernel of multiplication by a symbol to study general 3MP where the middle slot is a symbol. The main tools we will be using is Lemma 4.1 concerning the the annihilator of cup product with an H^1 element, and Theorem 5.2, generalizing a Theorem of Tignol on quaternion algebras with trivial corestriction along a separable quadratic extension.
