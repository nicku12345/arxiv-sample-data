In this paper properties of the determinant of a Hermitian matrix are investigated, and determinantal representations of the inverse of a Hermitian coquaternionic matrix are given. By their using, Cramer's rules for left and right systems of linear equations with Hermitian coquaternionic matrices of coefficients are obtained. Cramer's rule for a two-sided coquaternionic matrix equation {\bf AXB}={\bf D} (with Hermitian {\bf A}, {\bf B}) is given as well.
