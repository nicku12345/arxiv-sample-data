Let B\rightarrow A be a homomorphism of Hopf algebras and let C be an algebra. We consider the induction from B to A of C in two cases: when C is a B-interior algebra and when C is a B-module algebra. Our main results establish the connection between the two inductions. The inspiration comes from finite group representation theory, and some constructions work in even more general contexts.
