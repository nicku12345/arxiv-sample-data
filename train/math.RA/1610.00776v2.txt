Let \Bbbk be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and let \Gamma be an additive subgroup of \Bbbk. Results of Kaplansky-Santharoubane and Su classify intermediate series representations of the generalised Witt algebra W_\Gamma in terms of three families, one parameterised by {\mathbb A}^2 and two by {\mathbb P}^1. In this note, we use the first family to construct a homomorphism \Phi from the enveloping algebra U(W_\Gamma) to a skew extension of {\Bbbk}[a,b]. We show that the image of \Phi is contained in a (double) idealizer subring of this skew extension and that the representation theory of idealizers explains the three families. We further show that the image of U(W_\Gamma) under \Phi is not left or right noetherian, giving a new proof that U(W_\Gamma) is not noetherian.   We construct \Phi as an application of a general technique to create ring homomorphisms from shift-invariant families of modules. Let G be an arbitrary group and let A be a G-graded ring. A graded A-module M is an intermediate series module if M_g is one-dimensional for all g \in G. Given a shift-invariant family of intermediate series A-modules parametrised by a scheme X, we construct a homomorphism \Phi from A to a skew-extension of {\Bbbk}[X]. The kernel of \Phi consists of those elements which annihilate all modules in X.
