Given a lattice \mathbb{L} and a class K of algebraic structures, we say that \mathbb{L} \emph{forces nilpotency} in K if every algebra \mathbf{A} \in K whose congruence lattice \mathrm{Con} (\mathbf{A}) is isomorphic to \mathbb{L} is nilpotent. We describe congruence lattices that force nilpotency, supernilpotency or solvability for some classes of algebras. For this purpose, we investigate which commutator operations can exist on a given congruence lattice.
