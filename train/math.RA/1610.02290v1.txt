The aim of this paper is to introduce the notion of BiHom-Lie superalgebras. This class of algebras is a generalization of both BiHom-Lie algebras and Hom-Lie superalgebras. In this article, we first present two ways to construct BiHom-Lie superalgebras from BiHom-associative superalgebras and Hom-Lie superalgebras by Yau's twist principle. Also, we explore some general classes of BiHom-Lie admissible superalgebras and describe all these classes via G-BiHom-associative superalgebras, where G is a subgroup of the symmetric group S_{3}. Finally, we discuss the concept of \beta^{k}-derivation of BiHom-Lie superalgebras and prove that the set of all \beta^{k}-derivation has a natural BiHom-Lie superalgebra structure.
