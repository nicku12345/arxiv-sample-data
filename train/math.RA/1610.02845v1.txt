The aim of this paper is to study modules over Hom-post-Lie algebras and give some contructions and various twisting i.e. we show that modules over post-Hom-Lie algebras are close by twisting either Hom-post-Lie algebras or module structure maps. Given a type of Hom-algebra A, an A-bimodule M and an O-operator T : A ---> M, we give constructions another of Hom-algebra structure on M.
