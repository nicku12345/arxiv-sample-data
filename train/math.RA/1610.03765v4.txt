In this paper, we prove that a biderivation of a finite dimensional complex simple Lie algebra without the restriction of skewsymmetric is inner. As an application, the biderivation of a general linear Lie algebra is presented. In particular, we find a class of a non-inner and non-skewsymmetric biderivations. Furthermore, we also get the forms of linear commuting maps on the finite dimensional complex simple Lie algebra or general linear Lie algebra.
