Let F be characteristic zero field, G a residually finite group and W a G-prime and PI F-algebra. By constructing G-graded central polynomials for W, we prove the G-graded version of Posner's theorem. More precisely, if S denotes all non-zero degree e central elements of W, the algebra S^{-1}W is G-graded simple and finite dimensional over its center.   Furthermore, we show how to use this theorem in order to recapture the result of Aljadeff and Haile stating that two G-simple algebras of finite dimension are isomorphix iff their ideals of graded identities coincide.
