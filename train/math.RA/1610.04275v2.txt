Pre-Koszul and Koszul algebras were defined by Priddy. There exist some relations between these algebras and the skew PBW extensions defined. We have established conditions to guarantee that skew PBW extensions over fields it turns out homogeneous pre-Koszul or Koszul algebra. In this paper we complement these results defining graded skew PBW extensions and showing that if R is a finite presented Koszul K-algebra then every graded skew PBW extension of R is Koszul.
