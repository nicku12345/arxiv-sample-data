For p a prime and a\in\mathbb{Q}, where a is not a p^n-th power of any rational number, the extension \mathbb{Q}(w_n)/\mathbb{Q} where w_n=\root p^n \of a is separable but non-normal. The Hopf-Galois theory for separable extensions was determined by Greither and Pareigis, and the specific classification for radical extensions such as these by the author. In this work we extend this theory to a certain class of profinite extensions, namely those formed from the union of these \mathbb{Q}(w_n). We construct a 'profinite' Hopf algebra which acts, and show that it satisfies a generalization of a result due to Haggenmuller and Pareigis on the structure of Hopf algebra forms of group algebras.
