If k is a field, A and B k-algebras, M a faithful left A-module, and N a faithful left B-module, we recall the proof that the left A\otimes_k B-module M\otimes_k N is again faithful. If k is a general commutative ring, we note some conditions on A, B, M and N that do, and others that do not, imply the same conclusion. Finally, we note a version of the main result that does not involve any algebra structures on A and B.
