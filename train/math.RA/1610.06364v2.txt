Let K be a field, and A=K[a_1,\ldots ,a_n] a finitely generated K-algebra with the PBW K-basis {\cal B}=\{a_{1}^{\alpha_1}\cdots a_{n}^{\alpha_n}~|~(\alpha_1,\ldots ,\alpha_n)\in\mathbb{N}^n\}. It is shown that if L is a nonzero left ideal of A with GK.dim(A/L)=d<n (= the number of generators of A), then L has the {\it elimination property} in the sense that {\bf V}(U)\cap L\ne \{0\} for every subset U=\{ a_{i_1},\ldots ,a_{i_{d+1}}\}\subset\{a_1,\ldots ,a_n\} with i_1<i_2<\cdots <i_{d+1}, where {\bf V}(U)=K-span\{a_{i_1}^{\alpha_1}\cdots a_{i_{d+1}}^{\alpha_{d+1}}~|~(\alpha_1,\ldots ,\alpha_{d+1})\in\mathbb{N}^{d+1}\}. In terms of the structural properties of A, it is also explored when the condition GK.dim(A/L)<n may hold for a left ideal L of A. Moreover, from the viewpoint of realizing the elimination property by means of Gr\"obner bases, it is demonstrated that if A is in the class of binomial skew polynomial rings [G-I2, Serdica Math. J., 30(2004)] or in the class of solvable polynomial algebras [K-RW, J. Symbolic Comput., 9(1990)], then every nonzero left ideal L of A satisfies GK.dim(A/L)< GK.dimA=n (= the number of generators of A), thereby L has the elimination property.
