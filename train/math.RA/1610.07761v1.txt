For any compact p-adic Lie group G, the Iwasawa algebra \Omega_G over finite field \mathbb{F}_p is a complete noetherian semilocal algebra. It is shown that \Omega_G is the dual algebra of an artinian coalgebra C. We induce a duality between the derived category \mathcal{D}^b_{fg}(_{\Omega_G}\mathcal{M}) of bounded complexes of left \Omega_G-modules with finitely generated cohomology modules and the derived category \mathcal{D}^b_{qf}(^C\mathcal{M}) of bounded complexes of left C-comodules with quasi-finite cohomology comodules.
