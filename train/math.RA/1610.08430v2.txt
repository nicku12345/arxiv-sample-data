Let G be a finite subgroup of \text{SL}(2,\Bbbk) and let R = \Bbbk[x,y]^G be the coordinate ring of the corresponding Kleinian singularity. In 1998, Crawley-Boevey and Holland defined deformations \mathcal{O}^\lambda of R parametrised by weights \lambda. In this paper, we determine the singularity categories \mathcal{D}_{\text{sg}}(\mathcal{O}^\lambda) of these deformations, and show that they correspond to subgraphs of the Dynkin graph associated to R. This generalises known results on the structure of \mathcal{D}_{\text{sg}}(R). We also provide a generalisation of the intersection theory appearing in the geometric McKay correspondence to a noncommutative setting.
