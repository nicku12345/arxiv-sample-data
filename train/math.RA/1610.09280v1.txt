The purpose of this paper is to introduce basic concepts that are fundamental in the examination of composite moduli, while avoiding the notoriously difficult problem of prime-factorization. We introduce a new class of numbers, called idempotent numbers, that is unavoidable when researching composite moduli. Among many interesting results, we give generalizations of well-known theorems and definitions, such as the Euler-Fermat Theorem and the concept of primitive roots. We consider the generalization of the equivalence condition for the solvability of a binomial congruence to be the main result of our paper.
