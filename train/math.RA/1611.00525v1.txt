A ring R is (strongly) 2-nil-clean if every element in R is the sum of two idempotents and a nilpotent (that commute). Fundamental properties of such rings are discussed. Let R be a 2-primal ring. If R is strongly 2-nil-clean, we show that M_n(R) is 2-nil-clean for all n\in {\Bbb N}. We also prove that the matrix ring is 2-nil-clean for a strongly 2-nil-clean ring of bounded index. These provide many classes of rings over which every matrix is the sum of two idempotents and a nilpotent.
