For V a vector space over a field, or more generally, over a division ring, it is well-known that every x\in\mathrm{End}(V) has an <i>inner inverse</i>, i.e., an element y\in\mathrm{End}(V) satisfying xyx=x. We show here that a large class of such x have inner inverses y that satisfy with x an infinite family of additional monoid relations, making the monoid generated by x and y what is known as an <i>inverse monoid</i> (definition recalled). We obtain consequences of these relations, and related results.   P. Nielsen and J. \v{S}ter, in a paper to appear, show that a much larger class of elements x of rings R, including all elements of von Neumann regular rings, have inner inverses satisfying arbitrarily large <i>finite</i> subsets of the abovementioned set of relations. But we show by example that the endomorphism ring of any infinite-dimensional vector space contains elements having no inner inverse that simultaneously satisfies all those relations.   A tangential result proved is a condition on an endomap x of a set S that is necessary and sufficient for x to belong to an inverse submonoid of the monoid of all endomaps of S.
