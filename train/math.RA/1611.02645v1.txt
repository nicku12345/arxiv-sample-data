We solve the isomorphism problem for non noetherian down-up algebras A(\alpha,0,\gamma) by lifting isomorphisms between some of their non commutative quotients. The quotients we consider are either quantum polynomial algebras in two variables for \gamma = 0 or quantum versions of the Weyl algebra A_1 for non zero \gamma. In particular we obtain that no other down-up algebra is isomorphic to the monomial algebra A(0,0,0). We prove in the second part of the article that this is the only monomial algebra within the family of down-up algebras. Our method uses homological invariants that determine the shape of the possible quivers and we apply the abelianization functor to complete the proof.
