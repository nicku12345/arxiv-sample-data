Let k be a field and let H denote a pointed Hopf k-algebra with antipode S. We are interested in determining the order of S. Building on the work done by Taft and Wilson [7], we define an invariant for H, denoted m_{H}, and prove that the value of this invariant is connected to the order of S. In the case where \operatorname{char}k=0, it is shown that if S has finite order then it is either the identity or has order 2m_{H}. If in addition H is assumed to be coradically graded, it is shown that the order of S is finite if and only if m_{H} is finite. We also consider the case where \operatorname{char}k=p>0, generalising the results of [7] to the infinite-dimensional setting.
