In this paper, we investigate the skew-symmertric biderivations of the deformative Schrodinger-Virasoro Lie algebras which contain the twisted and original deformative Schrodinger-Virasoro Lie algebras. As an application, we give the explicit form of each linear commuting map on the deformative Schrodinger-Virasoro Lie algebras. In particular, we obtain that there exist non-inner biderivations and non-standard linear commuting maps for the certain deformative Schrodinger-Virasoro Lie algebras.
