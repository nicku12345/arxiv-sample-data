The structure of the lattice of clones on a finite set has been proven to be very complex. To better understand the top of this lattice, it is important to provide a characterization of submaximal clones in the lattice of clones. It is known that the clones Pol(\theta) and Pol(\rho) (where \theta is a nontrivial equivalence relation on E_k = \{0,\dots, k-1\}, and \rho is among the six types of relations which characterize maximal clones) are maximal clones. In this paper, we provide a classification of relations (of Rosenberg's List) on E_k such that the clone Pol(\theta) \cap Pol(\rho) is maximal in Pol(\theta).
