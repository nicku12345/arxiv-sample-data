In this study, we introduce a new classes of quaternion numbers. We show that this new classes quaternion numbers include all of quaternion numbers such as Fibonacci, Lucas, Pell, Jacobsthal, Pell-Lucas, Jacobsthal-Lucas quaternions have been studied by many authors. Moreover, for this newly defined quaternion numbers we give the generating function, norm value, Cassini identity, summation formula and their some properties.
