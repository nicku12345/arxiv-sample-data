In this paper we completely describe graphically Leavitt path algebras with bounded index of nilpotence and show that each graded simple module S over a Leavitt path algebra with bounded index of nilpotence is graded \Sigma-injective, that is, S^{(\alpha)} is graded injective for any cardinal \alpha. Furthermore, we characterize Leavitt path algebras over which each simple module is \Sigma-injective. We have shown that each simple module over a Leavitt path algebra L_K(E) is \Sigma-injective if and only if the graph E contains no cycles, and there is a positive integer d such that the length of any path in E is less than or equal to d and the number of distinct paths ending at any vertex v (including v) is less than or equal to d.
