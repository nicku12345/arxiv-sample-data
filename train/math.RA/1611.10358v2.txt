In this paper, we extend the results obtained by Cortes-Ferrero-Juriaans (2009) for the quaternion over the ring Colombeau's simplified generalized numbers, denoted by \overline{\mathbb{H}}_s, to the quaternion over the ring of Colombeau's full generalized numbers, denoted by \overline{\mathbb{H}}. In this paper, we introduce and investigate the topological algebra of the quaternion over the ring of Colombeau's full generalized numbers. This is an important object to study if one wants to build the algebraic theory of Colombeau's full generalized numbers \overline{\mathbb{K}} studied by Aragona-Garcia-Juriaans (2013). We study some ring theoretical properties of \overline{\mathbb{H}}, we classify the dense ideals of \overline{\mathbb{K}} in the algebraic sense, and as a consequence, it has a maximal ring of quotients which is Von Neumann regular.
