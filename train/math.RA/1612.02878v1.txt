The purpose of this paper is to extend the cohomology and conformal derivation theories of the classical Lie conformal algebras to Lie conformal superalgebras. Firstly, we construct the semidirect product of a Lie conformal superalgebra and its conformal module, and study derivations of this semidirect product. Secondly, we develop cohomology theory of Lie conformal superalgebras and discuss some applications to the study of deformations of Lie conformal superalgebras. Finally, we introduce generalized derivations of Lie conformal superalgebras and study their properties.
