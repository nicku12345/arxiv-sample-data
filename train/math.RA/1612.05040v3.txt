A nonnegative matrix A is said to be strongly robust if its max-algebraic eigencone is universally reachable, i.e., if the orbit of any initial vector ends up with a max-algebraic eigenvector of A. Consider the case when the initial vector is restricted to an interval and A can be any matrix from a given interval of nonnegative circulant matrices. The main aim of this paper is to classify and characterize the six types of interval robustness in this situation. This naturally leads us also to study the max-algebraic spectral theory of circulant matrices and the relation of inclusion between attraction cones of circulant matrices in max-algebra.
