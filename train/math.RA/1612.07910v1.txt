We introduce a non-abelian exterior product of two crossed modules of Leibniz algebra and investigate its relation to the low dimensional Leibniz homology. Later this non-abelian exterior product is applied to the construction of eight term exact sequence in Leibniz homology. Also its relationship to the universal quadratic functor is established, which is applied to the comparison of the second Lie and Leibniz homologies of a Lie algebra.
