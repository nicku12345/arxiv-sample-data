Motivated by the concept of clean index of rings, we introduce the concept of weak clean index of rings. For any element a of a ring R with unity, we define  \chi(a)=\{e\in R\mid e^2=e\text{ and }a-e \mbox{ or } a+e \mbox{ is a unit}\}. The weak clean index of R is defined as \sup \{|\chi(a)|: a\in R\} and it is denoted by \win(R), where | \chi(a)|  denotes the cardinality of the set \chi(a). In this article, we characterize rings of weak clean indices 1, 2 and 3.
