In this paper, we investigate *-DMP elements in *-semigroups and *-rings. The notion of *-DMP element was introduced by Patr\'{i}cio in 2004. An element a is *-DMP if there exists a positive integer m such that a^{m} is EP. We first characterize *-DMP elements in terms of the \{1,3\}-inverse, Drazin inverse and pseudo core inverse, respectively.   Then, we give the pseudo core decomposition utilizing the pseudo core inverse, which extends the core-EP decomposition introduced by Wang for matrices to an arbitrary *-ring; and this decomposition turns to be a useful tool to characterize *-DMP elements. Further, we extend Wang's core-EP order from matrices to *-rings and use it to investigate *-DMP elements. Finally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for two elements a,~b in *-rings to have aa^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}=bb^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}, which contribute to investigate *-DMP elements.
