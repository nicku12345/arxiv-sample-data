We study identities of finite dimensional algebras over a field of characteristic zero, graded by an arbitrary groupoid \Gamma. First we prove that its graded colength has a polynomially bounded growth. For any graded simple algebra A we prove the existence of the graded PI-exponent, provided that \Gamma is a commutative semigroup. If A is simple in a non-graded sense the existence of the graded PI-exponent is proved without any restrictions on \Gamma.
