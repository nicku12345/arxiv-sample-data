For c\geq 2, the free centre-by-(nilpotent-of-class-c-1)-by abelian Lie ring on a set X is the quotient L/[(L')^c,L] where L is the free Lie ring on X, and (L')^c denotes the cth term of the lower central series of the derived ideal L'=L^2 of L. In this paper we give a complete description of the torsion subgroup of its additive group in the case where |X|=2 and c is a prime number.
