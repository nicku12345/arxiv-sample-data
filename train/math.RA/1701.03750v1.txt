Let \mathbb K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Let V be a module over the polynomial ring \mathbb K[x,y]. The actions of x and y determine linear operators P and Q on V as a vector space over \mathbb K. Define the Lie algebra L_V=\mathbb K\langle P,Q\rangle \rightthreetimes V as the semidirect product of two abelian Lie algebras with the natural action of \mathbb K\langle P,Q\rangle on V. We show that if \mathbb K[x,y]-modules V and W are isomorphic or weakly isomorphic, then the corresponding associated Lie algebras L_V and L_W are isomorphic. The converse is not true: we construct two \mathbb K[x,y]-modules V and W of dimension 4 that are not weakly isomorphic but their associated Lie algebras are isomorphic. We characterize such pairs of \mathbb K[x, y]-modules of arbitrary dimension. We prove that indecomposable modules V and W with \dim V=\dim W\geq 7 are weakly isomorphic if and only if their associated Lie algebras L_V and L_W are isomorphic.
