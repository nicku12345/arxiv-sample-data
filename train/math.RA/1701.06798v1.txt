The group-scheme of automorphisms of the ten-dimensional exceptional Kac's Jordan superalgebra is shown to be isomorphic to the semidirect product of the direct product of two copies of SL2 by the constant group scheme C2.   This is used to revisit, extend, and simplify, known results on the classification of the twisted forms of this superalgebra and of its gradings.
