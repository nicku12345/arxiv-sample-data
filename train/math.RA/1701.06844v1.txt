We introduce grading on certain finite dimensional simple Lie superalgebras of type P(t) by elementary abelian 2-group. This grading gives rise to Pauli matrices and is a far generalization of (\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_2)-grading on Lie algebra of (2\times 2)-traceless matrices.We use this grading for studying numerical invariants of polyomial identities of Lie superalgebras. In particular, we compute graded PI-exponent corresponding to Pauli grading.
