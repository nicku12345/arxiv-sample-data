\textbf{Theorem 1.2.} For a ring A, the following conditions are equivalent. \textbf{1)} A is a right automorphism-invariant right non-singular ring. \textbf{2)} A is a right automorphism-invariant regular ring. \textbf{3)} A=S\times T, where S is a right injective regular ring and T is a strongly regular ring which contains all invertible elements of its maximal right ring of quotients. \textbf{Theorem 1.5.} For a ring A with right Goldie radical G(A_A), the following conditions are equivalent. \textbf{1)} A/G(A_A) is a semiprime right Goldie ring. \textbf{2)} Any direct sum of automorphism-invariant non-singular right A-modules is an automorphism-invariant module. \textbf{3)} Any direct sum of automorphism-invariant non-singular right A-modules is an injective module.
