\textbf{Theorem 1.3.} For a given ring A with right Goldie radical G(A_A), the following conditions are equivalent. \textbf{1)} Every non-singular right A-module X which is is injective with respect to some essential right ideal of the ring A is an injective module. \textbf{2)} A/G(A_A) is a right strongly semiprime ring. \textbf{Theorem 1.4.} For a given ring A, the following conditions are equivalent. \textbf{1)} A is a right strongly semiprime ring. \textbf{2)} Every right A-module which is injective with respect to some essential right ideal of the ring A, is an injective module and A is right non-singular.
