In this paper, we consider the problem of how to establish algebraic structures on nearness approximation spaces. Essentially, our approach is to define the nearness ring, nearness ideal and nearness ring of all weak cosets by considering new operations on the set of all weak cosets. Afterwards, our aim is to study nearness homomorphism on nearness approximation spaces, and to investigate some properties of nearness rings and ideals.
