Let F be an infinite field, and let M_{n}(F) be the algebra of n\times n matrices over F. Suppose that this algebra is equipped with an elementary grading whose neutral component coincides with the main diagonal. In this paper, we find a basis for the graded polynomial identities of M_{n}(F) with the transpose involution. Our results generalize for infinite fields of arbitrary characteristic previous results in the literature which were obtained for the field of complex numbers and for a particular class of elementary G-gradings.
