In this paper, we derive some necessary and sufficient solvability conditions for some systems of one sided coupled Sylvester-type real quaternion matrix equations in terms of ranks and generalized inverses of matrices. We also give the expressions of the general solutions to these systems when they are solvable. Moreover, we provide some numerical examples to illustrate our results. The findings of this paper extend some known results in the literature.
