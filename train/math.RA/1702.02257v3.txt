Given a poset P and a standard closure operator \Gamma:\wp(P)\to\wp(P) we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the lattice of \Gamma-closed sets of \wp(P) to be a frame in terms of the recursive construction of the \Gamma-closure of sets. We use this condition to show that given a set \mathcal{U} of distinguished joins from P, the lattice of \mathcal{U}-ideals of P fails to be a frame if and only if it fails to be \sigma-distributive, with \sigma depending on the cardinalities of sets in \mathcal{U}. From this we deduce that if a poset has the property that whenever a\wedge(b\vee c) is defined for a,b,c\in P it is necessarily equal to (a\wedge b)\vee (a\wedge c), then it has an (\omega,3)-representation. This answers a question from the literature.
