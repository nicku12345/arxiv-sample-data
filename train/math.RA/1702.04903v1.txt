Let B and C be non-degenerate idempotent algebras and assume that E is a regular separability idempotent in M(B\otimes C). Define A=C\otimes B and \Delta:A\to M(A\otimes A) by \Delta(c\otimes b)=c\otimes E\otimes b. The pair (A,\Delta) is a weak multiplier Hopf algebra. Because we assume that E is regular, it is a regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra. There is a faithful left integral on (A,\Delta) that is also right invariant. Therefore, we call (A,\Delta) a unimodular algebraic quantum groupoid. By the general theory, the dual (\widehat A,\widehat \Delta) can be constructed and it is again an algebraic quantum groupoid. In this paper, we treat this algebraic quantum groupoid and its dual in great detail. The main purpose is to illustrate various aspects of the general theory. For this reason, we will also recall the basic notions and results of separability idempotents and weak multiplier Hopf algebras with integrals. The paper is to be considered as an expository note.
