Idempotents dominate the structure theory of rings. The Peirce decomposition induced by an idempotent provides a natural environment for defining and classifying new types of rings. This point of view offers a way to unify and to expand the classical theory of semiperfect rings and idempotents to much larger classes of rings. Examples and applications are included.
