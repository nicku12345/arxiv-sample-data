We study different algebraic structures associated to an operad and their relations: to any operad \mathbf{P} is attached a bialgebra,the monoid of characters of this bialgebra, the underlying pre-Lie algebra and its enveloping algebra; all of them can be explicitely describedwith the help of the operadic composition. non-commutative versions are also given. We denote by \mathbf{b\_\infty} the operad of \mathbf{b\_\infty} algebras, describing all Hopf algebra structures on a symmetric coalgebra.If there exists an operad morphism from \mathbf{b\_\infty} to \mathbf{P}, a pair (A,B) of cointeracting bialgebras is also constructed, that it to say:B is a bialgebra, and A is a graded Hopf algebra in the category of B-comodules. Most examples of such pairs (on oriented graphs, posets\ldots) known in the literature are shown to be obtained from an operad; colored versions of these examples andother ones, based on Feynman graphs, are introduced and compared.
