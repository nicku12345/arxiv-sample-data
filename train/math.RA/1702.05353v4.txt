Suppose throughout that \mathcal V is a congruence distributive variety. If m \geq 1, let  J _{ \mathcal V} (m)  be the smallest natural number k such that the congruence identity \alpha ( \beta \circ \gamma \circ \beta \dots ) \subseteq \alpha \beta \circ \alpha \gamma \circ \alpha \beta \circ \dots  holds in \mathcal V, with m occurrences of  \circ on the left and k occurrences of \circ on the right. We show that if  J _{ \mathcal V} (m) =k, then  J _{ \mathcal V} (m \ell ) \leq k \ell , for every natural number \ell. The key to the proof is an identity which, through a variety, is equivalent to the above congruence identity, but involves also reflexive and admissible relations. If  J _{ \mathcal V} (1)=2 , that is, \mathcal V is 3-distributive, then  J _{ \mathcal V} (m) \leq m , for every m \geq 3 (actually, a more general result is presented which holds even in nondistributive varieties). If \mathcal V is m-modular, that is, congruence modularity of \mathcal V is witnessed by m+1 Day terms, then  J _{ \mathcal V} (2) \leq J _{ \mathcal V} (1) + 2m^2-2m -1 . Various problems are stated at various places.
