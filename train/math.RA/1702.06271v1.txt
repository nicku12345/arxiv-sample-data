Let R be a ring with identity 1. Jacobson's lemma states that for any a,b\in R, if 1-ab is invertible then so is 1-ba. Jacobson's lemma has suitable analogues for several types of generalized inverses, e.g., Drazin inverse, generalized Drazin inverse, and inner inverse. In this note we give a constructive way via Groebner-Shirshov basis theory to obtain the inverse of 1-ab in terms of (1-ba)^{-1}, assuming the latter exists.
