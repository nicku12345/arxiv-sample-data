A ring R is Zhou nil-clean if every element in R is the sum of two tripotents and a nilpotent that commute. Let R be a Zhou nil-clean ring. If R is 2-primal (of bounded index), we prove that every square matrix over R is the sum of two tripotents and a nilpotent. These provides a large class of rings over which every square matrix has such decompositions by tripotent and nilpotent matrices.
