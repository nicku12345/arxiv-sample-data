In this study, we investigate Horadam sequence as generalization of linear recurrence equations of order two. By the aid of this sequence we obtain a new generalization for sequences of dual quaternions and dual octonions. Moreover, we derive some important identities such as Binet formula, generating function, Cassini identity, sum formula and norm formula by their Binet forms. We generalize all studied linear second order recurrence relations over dual octonions and quaternions in a single formula.
