It has been shown by McCoy that a right ideal of a polynomial ring with several indeterminates has a non-trivial homogeneous right annihilator of degree 0 provided its right annihilator is non-trivial to begin with. In this note, it is documented that any \mathbb{N}-graded ring R has a slightly weaker property: the right annihilator of a right ideal contains a homogeneous non-zero element, if it is non-trivial to begin with. If R is a subring of a \mathbb{Z}^k -graded ring S satisfying a certain non-annihilation property (which is the case if S is strongly graded, for example), then it is possible to find annihilators of degree 0.
