We study the automorphisms of Jha-Johnson semifields obtained from an invariant irreducible twisted polynomial f\in K[t;\sigma], where K=\mathbb{F}_{q^n} is a finite field and \sigma an automorphism of K of order n, with a particualr emphasis on inner automorphisms and the automorphisms of Sandler and Hughes-Kleinfeld semifields. We include the automorphisms of some Knuth semifields (which do not arise from skew polynomial rings). Isomorphism between Jha-Johnson semifields are considered as well.
