In this paper, by studying the maximal good subspaces, we determine the dual Lie coalgebras of the centerless twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra. Based on this, we construct the dual Lie bialgebras structures of the twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro type. As by-products, four new infinite dimensional Lie algebras are obtained.
