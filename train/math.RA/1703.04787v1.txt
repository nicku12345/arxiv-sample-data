In this paper we study the Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein problem for modules. We obtain a positive solution for the Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein problem for modules invariant under endomorphisms of their general envelopes under some mild conditions that are always satisfied, for example, in the case of injective, pure-injective or cotorsion envelopes. In the particular cases of injective envelopes and pure-injective envelopes, we are able to extend it further and we show that the Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein problem has a positive solution even for modules that are invariant only under automorphisms of their injective envelopes or pure-injective envelopes.
