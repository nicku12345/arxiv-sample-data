The non-commuting graph \Gamma_R of a finite ring R with center Z(R) is a simple undirected graph whose vertex set is R \setminus Z(R) and two distinct vertices a and b are adjacent if and only if ab \ne ba. In this paper, we show that \Gamma_R is not isomorphic to certain graphs of any finite non-commutative ring R. Some connections between \Gamma_R and commuting probability of R are also obtained. Further, it is shown that the non-commuting graphs of two \mathbb{Z}-isoclinic rings are isomorphic if the centers of the rings have same order
