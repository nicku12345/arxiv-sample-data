Lie superbialgebra structures on the twisted N=1 Schr\"{o}dinger-Neveu-Schwarz algebra \frak{tsns} are described. The corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions for such superbialgebra to be coboundary triangular are given. Meanwhile, the first cohomology group of \frak{tsns} with coefficients in the tensor product of its adjoint module is completely determined.
