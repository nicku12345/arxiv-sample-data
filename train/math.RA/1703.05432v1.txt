In this paper, Lie super-bialgebra structures on a class of generalized super W-algebra \mathfrak{L} are investigated. By proving the first cohomology group of \mathfrak{L} with coefficients in its adjoint tensor module is trivial, namely, H^1(\mathfrak{L},\mathfrak{L}\otimes {\mathfrak{L}})=0, we obtain that all Lie super-bialgebra structures on \mathfrak{L} are triangular coboundary.
