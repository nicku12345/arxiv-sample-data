For a free presentation 0 \to R \to F \to G \to 0 of a Leibniz algebra G, the Baer invariant {\cal M}^{\sf Lie}(G) = \frac{R \cap [F, F]_{Lie}}{[F, R]_{Lie}} is called the Schur multiplier of G relative to the Liezation functor or Schur Lie-multiplier. For a two-sided ideal N of a Leibniz algebra G, we construct a four-term exact sequence relating the Schur Lie-multiplier of G and G/N, which is applied to study and characterize Lie-nilpotency, Lie-stem covers and Lie-capability of Leibniz algebras.
