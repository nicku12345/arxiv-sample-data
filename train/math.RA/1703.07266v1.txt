Let q be a power of a prime and let V be a vector space of finite dimension n over the field of order q. Let Bil(V) denote the set of all bilinear forms defined on V x V, let Symm(V) denote the subspace of Bil(V) consisting of symmetric bilinear forms, and Alt(V) denote the subspace of alternating bilinear forms. Let M denote a subspace of any of the spaces Bil(V), Symm(V), or Alt(V). In this paper we investigate hypotheses on the rank of the non-zero elements of M which lead to reasonable bounds for dim M. Typically, we look at the case where exactly two or three non-zero ranks occur, one of which is usually n. In the case that M achieves the maximal dimension predicted by the dimension bound, we try to enumerate the number of forms of a given rank in M and describe geometric properties of the radicals of the degenerate elements of M.
