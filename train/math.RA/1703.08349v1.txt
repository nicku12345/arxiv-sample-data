An exponent matrix is an n\times n matrix A=(a_{ij}) over {\mathbb N}^0 satisfying (1) a_{ii}=0 for all i=1,\ldots, n and (2) a_{ij}+a_{jk}\geq a_{ik} for all pairwise distinct i,j,k\in\{1,\dots, n\}. In the present paper we study the set {\mathcal E}_n of all non-negative n\times n exponent matrices as an algebra with the operations \oplus of component-wise maximum and \odot of component-wise addition. We provide a basis of the algebra ({\mathcal E}_n, \oplus, \odot,0) and give a row and a column decompositions of a matrix A\in {\mathcal E}_n with respect to this basis. This structure result determines all n\times n tiled orders over a fixed discrete valuation ring. We also study automorphisms of {\mathcal E}_n with respect to each of the operations \oplus and \odot and prove that {\rm Aut}(\mathcal{E}_n,\, \odot ) = {\rm Aut}(\mathcal{E}_n,\, \oplus ) = {\rm Aut}(\mathcal{E}_n,\, \odot ,\oplus ,0) \simeq {\mathcal{S}}_n \times C_2,n>2.
