Given a directed graph E and an associative unital ring R one may define the Leavitt path algebra with coefficients in R, denoted by L_R(E). For an arbitrary group G, L_R(E) can be viewed as a G-graded ring. In this article, we show that L_R(E) is always nearly epsilon-strongly G-graded. We also show that if E is finite, then L_R(E) is epsilon-strongly G-graded. We present a new proof of Hazrat's characterization of strongly \mathbb{Z}-graded Leavitt path algebras, when E is finite. Moreover, if E is row-finite and has no source, then we show that L_R(E) is strongly \mathbb{Z}-graded if and only if E has no sink. We also use a result concerning Frobenius epsilon-strongly G-graded rings, where G is finite, to obtain criteria which ensure that L_R(E) is Frobenius over its identity component.
