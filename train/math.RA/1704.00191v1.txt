Let (\sigma,\delta) be a quasi derivation of a ring R and M_R a right R-module. In this paper, we introduce the notion of (\sigma,\delta)-skew McCoy modules which extends the notion of McCoy modules and \sigma-skew McCoy modules. This concept can be regarded also as a generalization of (\sigma,\delta)-skew Armendariz modules. Some properties of this concept are established and some connections between (\sigma,\delta)-skew McCoyness and (\sigma,\delta)-compatible reduced modules are examined. Also, we study the property (\sigma,\delta)-skew McCoy of some skew triangular matrix extensions V_n(M,\sigma), for any nonnegative integer n\geq 2. As a consequence, we obtain: (1) M_R is (\sigma,\delta)-skew McCoy if and only if M[x]/M[x](x^n) is (\overline{\sigma},\overline{\delta})-skew McCoy, and (2) M_R is \sigma-skew McCoy if and only if M[x;\sigma]/M[x;\sigma](x^n) is \overline{\sigma}-skew McCoy.
