The semisimple subalgebras of the rank 2 symplectic Lie algebra \mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{C}) are well-known, and we recently classified its Levi decomposable subalgebras. In this article, we classify the solvable subalgebras of \mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{C}), up to inner automorphism. This completes the classification of the subalgebras of \mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{C}). More broadly speaking, in completing the classification of the subalgebras of \mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{C}) we have completed the classification of the subalgebras of the rank 2 semisimple Lie algebras.
