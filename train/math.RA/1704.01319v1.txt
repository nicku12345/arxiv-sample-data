For any differential graded (DG for short) Poisson algebra A given by generators and relations, we give a "formula" for computing the universal enveloping algebra A^e of A. Moreover, we prove that A^e has a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt basis provided that A is a graded commutative polynomial algebra. As an application of the PBW-basis, we show that a DG symplectic ideal of a DG Poisson algebra A is the annihilator of a simple DG Poisson A-module, where A is the DG Poisson homomorphic image of a DG Poisson algebra R whose underlying algebra structure is a graded commutative polynomial algebra.
