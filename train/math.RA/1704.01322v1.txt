In this paper, the so-called differential graded (DG for short) Poisson Hopf algebra is introduced, which can be considered as a natural extension of Poisson Hopf algebras in the differential graded setting. The structures on the universal enveloping algebras of differential graded Poisson Hopf algebras are discussed.
