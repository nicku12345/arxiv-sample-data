Let M_n(K) denote the algebra of n \times n matrices over a field K of characteristic zero. A nonunital subalgebra N \subset M_n(K) will be called a nonunital intersection if N is the intersection of two unital subalgebras of M_n(K). Appealing to recent work of Agore, we show that for n \ge 3, the dimension (over K) of a nonunital intersection is at most (n-1)(n-2), and we completely classify the nonunital intersections of maximum dimension (n-1)(n-2). We also classify the unital subalgebras of maximum dimension properly contained in a parabolic subalgebra of maximum dimension in M_n(K).
