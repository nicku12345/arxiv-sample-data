We show that a variety \mathcal V is congruence distributive if and only if there is some h such that the inclusion   (1) \Theta \cap ( \sigma \circ \sigma ) \subseteq ( \Theta \cap \sigma ) \circ ( \Theta \cap \sigma ) \circ \dots  (h factors)   holds in every algebra in \mathcal V, for every tolerance \Theta and every U-admissible relation \sigma. By a U-admissible relation we mean a binary relation which is the set-theoretical union of a set of reflexive and admissible relations. For any fixed h, a Maltsev-type characterization is given for the inclusion (1). It is an open problem whether (1) is still equivalent to congruence distributivity when \Theta is assumed to be a U-admissible relation, rather than a tolerance. In both cases many equivalent formulations for (1) are presented. The results suggest that it might be interesting to study the structure of the set of U-admissible relations on an algebra, as well as identities dealing with such relations.
