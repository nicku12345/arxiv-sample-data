We study a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the group ring of finitely generated abelian groups. The Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structure for finite abelian groups comes from the fact that the group ring of finite groups is a symmetric algebra, and the Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structure for free abelian groups of finite rank comes from the fact that its group ring is a Calabi-Yau algebra.
