In this paper we discuss under which conditions cyclic essential extensions of simple modules over a differential operator ring R[z;d] are Artinian. In particular, we study the case when R is either d-simple or d-primitive. Furthermore, we obtain important results when R is an affine algebra of Kull dimension 2. As an application we characterize the differential operator rings C[x,y][z;d] for which cyclic essential extensions of simple modules are Artinian.
