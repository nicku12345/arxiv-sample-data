Let G be a finite group, \Omega(G) be its Burnside ring, and \Delta(G) its augmentation ideal. Denote by \Delta^n(G) and Q_n(G) the n-th power of \Delta(G) and the n-th consecutive quotient group \Delta^n(G)/\Delta^{n+1}(G), respectively. This paper provides an explicit \mathbb{Z}-basis for \Delta^n(\mathcal{H}) and determine the isomorphism class of Q_n(\mathcal{H}) for each positive integer n, where \mathcal{H}=\langle g,h |\, g^{p^m}=h^p=1, h^{-1}gh=g^{p^{m-1}+1}\rangle, p is an odd prime.
