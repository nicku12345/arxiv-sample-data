Let (\mathfrak{g},\omega) be a finite-dimensional non-Lie complex \omega-Lie algebra. We study the derivation algebra Der(\mathfrak{g}) and the automorphism group Aut(\mathfrak{g}) of (\mathfrak{g},\omega). We introduce the notions of \omega-derivations and \omega-automorphisms of (\mathfrak{g},\omega) which naturally preserve the bilinear form \omega. We show that the set Der_{\omega}(\mathfrak{g}) of all \omega-derivations is a Lie subalgebra of Der(\mathfrak{g}) and the set Aut_{\omega}(\mathfrak{g}) of all \omega-automorphisms is a subgroup of Aut(\mathfrak{g}). For any 3-dimensional and 4-dimensional nontrivial \omega-Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}, we compute Der(\mathfrak{g}) and Aut(\mathfrak{g}) explicitly, and study some Lie group properties of Aut(\mathfrak{g}). We also study representation theory of \omega-Lie algebras. We show that all 3-dimensional nontrivial \omega-Lie algebras are multiplicative, as well as we provide a 4-dimensional example of \omega-Lie algebra that is not multiplicative. Finally, we show that any irreducible representation of the simple \omega-Lie algebra C_{\alpha}(\alpha\neq 0,-1) is 1-dimensional.
