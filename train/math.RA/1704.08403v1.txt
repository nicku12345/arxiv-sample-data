In this paper, we introduce a weak group inverse (called the WG inverse in the present paper) for square matrices of an arbitrary index, and give some of its characterizations and properties. Furthermore, we introduce two orders: one is a pre-order and the other is a partial order, and derive several characterizations of the two orders. At last, one characterization of the core-EP order is derived by using the WG inverses.
