When A = \mathbb{k}[x_1, \ldots, x_n] and G is a small subgroup of \operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{k}), Auslander's Theorem says that the skew group algebra A \# G is isomorphic to \operatorname{End}_{A^G}(A) as graded algebras. We prove a generalization of Auslander's Theorem for permutation actions on (-1)-skew polynomial rings, (-1)-quantum Weyl algebras, three-dimensional Sklyanin algebras, and a certain graded down-up algebra. We also show that certain fixed rings A^G are graded isolated singularities in the sense of Ueyama.
