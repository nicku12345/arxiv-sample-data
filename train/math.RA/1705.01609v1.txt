In this article the p-essential dimension of generic symbols over fields of characteristic p is studied. In particular, the p-essential dimension of the length \ell generic p-symbol of degree n+1 is bounded below by n+\ell when the base field is algebraically closed of characteristic p. The proof uses new techniques for working with residues in Milne-Kato p-cohomology and builds on work of Babic and Chernousov in the Witt group in characteristic 2. Two corollaries on p-symbol algebras (i.e, degree 2 symbols) result from this work. The generic p-symbol algebra of length \ell is shown to have p-essential dimension equal to \ell+1 as a p-torsion Brauer class. The second is a lower bound of \ell+1 on the p-essential dimension of the functor \mathrm{Alg}_{p^\ell,p}. Roughly speaking this says that you will need at least \ell+1 independent parameters to be able to specify any given algebra of degree p^{\ell} and exponent p over a field of characteristic p and improves on the previously established lower bound of 3.
