Let S be a subring of a finite ring R and C_R(S) = \{r \in R : rs = sr \;\forall\; s \in S\}. The relative non-commuting graph of the subring S in R, denoted by \Gamma_{S, R}, is a simple undirected graph whose vertex set is R \setminus C_R(S) and two distinct vertices a, b are adjacent if and only if a or b \in S and ab \neq ba. In this paper, we discuss some properties of \Gamma_{S, R}, determine diameter, girth, some dominating sets and chromatic index for \Gamma_{S, R}. Also, we derive some connections between \Gamma_{S, R} and the relative commuting probability of S in R. Finally, we show that the relative non-commuting graphs of two relative \Z-isoclinic pairs of rings are isomorphic under some conditions.
