In this paper, we compute the dimension of the Hochschild cohomology groups of any m-cluster tilted algebra of type \tilde{\mathbb{A}}. Moreover, we give conditions on the bounded quiver of an m-cluster tilted algebra \Lambda of type \tilde{\mathbb{A}} such that the Gerstenhaber algebra \operatorname{HH}^*(\Lambda) has non-trivial multiplicative structures. We also show that the derived class of gentle m-cluster tilted algebras is not always completely determined by the Hochschild cohomology.
