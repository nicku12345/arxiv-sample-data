In this paper we study properties of the secondary Hochschild homology of the triple (A,B,\varepsilon) with coefficients in M. We establish a type of Morita equivalence between two triples and show that H_\bullet((A,B,\varepsilon);M) is invariant under this equivalence. We also prove the existence of an exact sequence which connects the usual and the secondary Hochschild homologies in low dimension, allowing one to perform easy computations. The functoriality of H_\bullet((A,B,\varepsilon);M) is also discussed.
