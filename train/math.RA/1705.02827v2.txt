In this paper, we give a study of the \mathbb{C}[\partial]-split extending structures problem for associative conformal algebras. Using the unified product as a tool, which includes interesting products such as bicrossed product, cocycle semi-direct product and so on, a cohomological type object is constructed to characterize the \mathbb{C}[\partial]-split extending structures for associative conformal algebras. Moreover, using this theory, the extending structures of an associative conformal algebra A which is free as a \mathbb{C}[\partial]-module by the \mathbb{C}[\partial]-module Q=\mathbb{C}[\partial]x are described using flag datums of A. Furthermore, we give a classification of the extending structures of A by Q=\mathbb{C}[\partial]x in detail up to equivalence when A is a free associative conformal algebra of rank 1.
