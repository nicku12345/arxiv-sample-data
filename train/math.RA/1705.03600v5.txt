In this expository article, we describe the classification of the subalgebras of the rank 2 semisimple Lie algebras. Their semisimple subalgebras are well-known, and in a recent series of papers, we completed the classification of the subalgebras of the classical rank 2 semisimple Lie algebras. Finally, Mayanskiy finished the classification of the subalgebras of the remaining rank 2 semisimple Lie algebra, the exceptional Lie algebra G_2. We identify subalgebras of the classification in terms of a uniform classification scheme of Lie algebras of low dimension. The classification is up to inner automorphism, and the ground field is the complex numbers.
