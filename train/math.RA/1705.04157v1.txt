The mitosis process of an eukaryotic cell can be represented by the structure constants of an evolution algebra. Any isotopism of the latter corresponds to a mutation of genotypes of the former. This paper uses Computational Algebraic Geometry to determine the distribution of three-dimensional evolution algebras over any field into isotopism classes and hence, to describe the spectrum of genetic patterns of three distinct genotypes during a mitosis process. Their distribution into isomorphism classes is also determined in case of dealing with algebras having a one-dimensional annihilator.
