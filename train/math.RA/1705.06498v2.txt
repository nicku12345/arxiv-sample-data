For an effect algebra A, we examine the category of all morphisms from finite Boolean algebras into A. This category can be described as a category of elements of a presheaf R(A) on the category of finite Boolean algebras. We prove that some properties (being an orthoalgebra, the Riesz decomposition property, being a Boolean algebra) of an effect algebra A can be characterized by properties of the category of elements of the presheaf R(A). We prove that the tensor product of of effect algebras arises as a left Kan extension of the free product of finite Boolean algebras along the inclusion functor. As a consequence, the tensor product of effect algebras can be expressed by means of the Day convolution of presheaves on finite Boolean algebras.
