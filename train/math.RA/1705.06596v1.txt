Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and \alpha an automorphism of R. This paper addresses the question: when does the skew polynomial ring S = R[\theta; \alpha] satisfy the property (\diamond), that for every simple S-module V the injective hull E_S(V) of V has all its finitely generated submodules Artinian. The question is largely reduced to the special case where S is primitive, for which necessary and sufficient conditions are found, which however do not between them cover all possibilities. Nevertheless a complete characterisation is found when R is an affine algebra over a field k and \alpha is a k-algebra automorphism - in this case (\diamond) holds if and only if all simple S-modules are finite dimensional over k. This leads to a discussion, involving close study of some families of examples, of when this latter condition holds for affine k-algebras S = R[\theta;\alpha]. The paper ends with a number of open questions.
