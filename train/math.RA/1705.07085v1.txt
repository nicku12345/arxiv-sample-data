Madden has shown that in contrast to the situation with frames, the smallest dense quotient of a \kappa-frame need not be Boolean. We characterise these so-called d-reduced \kappa-frames as those which may be embedded as a generating sub-\kappa-frame of a Boolean frame. We introduce the notion of the closure of a \kappa-frame congruence and call a congruence clear if it is the largest congruence with a given closure. These ideas are used to prove \kappa-frame analogues of known results concerning Boolean frame quotients. In particular, we show that d-reduced \kappa-frames are precisely the quotients of \kappa-frames by clear congruences and that every \kappa-frame congruence is the meet of clear congruences.
