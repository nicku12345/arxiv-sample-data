A nilpotent Lie algebra {\mathfrak g} is said to be naturally graded if it is isomorphic to its associated graded Lie algebra {\rm gr} \mathfrak{g} with respect to filtration by ideals of the lower central series. This concept is equivalent to the concept of the Carnot algebra arising in sub-Riemannian geometry and the geometric control theory.   We classify finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional naturally graded Lie algebras (Carnot algebras) {\mathfrak g}=\oplus_{i=1}^{{+}\infty}{\mathfrak g}_i with properties  [{\mathfrak g}_1, {\mathfrak g}_i]={\mathfrak g}_{i{+}1}, \; \dim{{\mathfrak g}_i}+\dim{{\mathfrak g}_{i{+}1}} \le 3, \; i \ge 1.  For growth functions of such Lie algebras, we have the estimate F(n) \le \frac{3}{2}n{+}1.
