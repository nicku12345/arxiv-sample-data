Let M be an (A,B)-bi-module over left and right respectively Artinian rings. Let C be a multiplication ring of bi-module M, i.e. the ring C is generated by images of a and B in End(M). Let Z be a center of C. Bi-module M over rings C and Z we call a bi-module of translation of (A,B)-bi-module M.   We investigate a relationship between the fact that (A,B)-bi-module M is quasi-Frobenius and the fact that (C,Z)-bi-module M is quasi-Frobenius.
