Given a prime number p, a field F with \operatorname{char}(F)=p and a positive integer n, we study the class-preserving modifications of Kato-Milne classes of decomposable differential forms. These modifications demonstrate a natural connection between differential forms and p-regular forms. A p-regular form is defined to be a homogeneous polynomial form of degree p for which there is no nonzero point where all the order p-1 partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. We define a \widetilde C_{p,m} field to be a field over which every p-regular form of dimension greater than p^m is isotropic. The main results are that for a \widetilde C_{p,m} field F, the symbol length of H_p^2(F) is bounded from above by p^{m-1}-1 and for any n \geq \lceil (m-1) \log_2(p) \rceil+1, H_p^{n+1}(F)=0.
