Let E be an arbitrary directed graph and let L be the Leavitt path algebra of the graph E over a field K. The necessary and sufficient con- ditions are given to assure the existence of a maximal ideal in L and also the necessary and sufficient conditions on the graph which assure that every ideal is contained in a maximal ideal is given. It is shown that if a maximal ideal M of L is non-graded, then the largest graded ideal in M , namely gr(M ), is also maximal among the graded ideals of L. Moreover, if L has a unique maximal ideal M , then M must be a graded ideal. The necessary and sufficient conditions on the graph for which every maximal ideal is graded, is discussed.
