We consider finite-dimensional irreducible transitive graded Lie algebras L = \sum_{i=-q}^rL_i over algebraically closed fields of characteristic three. We assume that the null component L_0 is classical and reductive. The adjoint representation of L on itself induces a representation of the commutator subalgebra L_0' of the null component on the minus-one component L_{-1}. We show that if the depth q of L is greater than one, then this representation must be restricted.
