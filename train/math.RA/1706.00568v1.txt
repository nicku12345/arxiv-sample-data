Let S and R be rings and _SC_R a (faithfully) semidualizing bimodule. We introduce and study C-weak flat and C-weak injective modules as a generalization of C-flat and C-injective modules (J. Math. Kyoto Univ. 47(2007), 781-808) respectively, and use them to provide additional information concerning the important Foxby equivalence between the subclasses of the Auslander class \mathcal{A}_C(R) and that of the Bass class \mathcal{B}_C(S). Then we study the stability of Auslander and Bass classes, which enables us to give some alternative characterizations of the modules in \mathcal{A}_C(R) and \mathcal{B}_C(S). Finally we consider an open question which is closely relative to the main results (Proc. Edinb. Math. Soc. 48(2005), 75-90), and discuss the relationship between the Bass class \mathcal{B}_C(S) and the class of Gorenstein injective modules.
