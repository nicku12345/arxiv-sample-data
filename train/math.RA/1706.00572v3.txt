Let D be a DVR, let K be its quotient field, and let R be a D-order in a quaternion algebra A over K. The elasticity of R^\bullet is \rho(R^\bullet) = \sup\{\, k/l : u_1\cdots u_k = v_1 \cdots v_l \text{ with u_i, v_j atoms of R^\bullet and k, l \ge 1} \,\} and is one of the basic arithmetical invariants that is studied in factorization theory. We characterize finiteness of \rho(R^\bullet) and show that the set of distances \Delta(R^\bullet) and all catenary degrees \mathsf c_\mathsf d(R^\bullet) are finite. In the setting of noncommutative orders in central simple algebras, such results have only been understood for hereditary orders and for a few individual examples.
