Leibniz algebras are certain generalization of Lie algebras. In this paper we give the classification of 5-dimensional complex non-Lie nilpotent Leibniz algebras. We use the canonical forms for the congruence classes of matrices of bilinear forms to classify the case \dim(A^2)=3 and \dim(Leib(A))=1 which can be applied to higher dimensions. The remaining cases are classified via direct method.
