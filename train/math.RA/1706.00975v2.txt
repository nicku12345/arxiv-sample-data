An inverse semigroup S is a semigroup in which every element has a unique inverse in the sense of semigroup theory, that is, if a \in S then there exists a unique b\in S such that a = aba and b = bab. We say that an inverse semigroup S is a homogeneous (inverse) semigroup if any isomorphism between finitely generated (inverse) subsemigroups of S extends to an automorphism of S. In this paper, we consider both these concepts of homogeneity for inverse semigroups, and show when they are equivalent. We also obtain certain classifications of homogeneous inverse semigroups, in particular periodic commutative inverse semigroups. Our results extend both the classification of homogeneous semilattices and the classification of certain classes of homogeneous groups, in particular the homogeneous abelian groups and homogeneous finite groups.
