Let A be a finite commutative nilpotent \mathbb{F}_p-algebra structure on G, an elementary abelian group of order p^n. If K/k is a Galois extension of fields with Galois group G and A^p = 0, then corresponding to A is an H-Hopf Galois structure on K/k of type G. For that Hopf Galois structure we may study the image of the Galois correspondence from k-subHopf algebras of H to subfields of K containing k by utilizing the fact that the intermediate subfields correspond to the \mathbb{F}_p-subspaces of A, while the subHopf algebras of H correspond to the ideals of A. We obtain upper and lower bounds on the proportion of subspaces of A that are ideals of A, and test the bounds on some examples.
