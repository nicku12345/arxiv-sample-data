Nonassociative algebras satisfying the polynomial identities x(yz)=y(xz) and (xy)z=(xz)y are called bicommutative. We prove the following results: (i) Finitely generated bicommutative algebras are weakly noetherian, i.e., satisfy the ascending chain condition for two-sided ideals. (ii) We give the positive solution to the Specht problem (or the finite basis problem) for varieties of bicommutative algebras over an arbitrary field of any characteristic.
