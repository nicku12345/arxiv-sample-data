A semiring S which is a union of rings is called completely regular, if moreover, it is orthodox then S is called an orthoring. Here we study the orthorings S such that E^+(S) is a band semiring. Every band semiring is a spined product of a left band semiring and a right band semiring with respect to a distributive lattice. A similar spined product decomposition for the band orthorings have been proved. The interval [\mathbf{Ri}, \mathbf{BOR}] is lattice isomorphic to the lattice \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{BI}) of all varieties of band semirings, where \mathbf{Ri} and \mathbf{BOR} are the varieties of all rings and band orthorings, respectively.
