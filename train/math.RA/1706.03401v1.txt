Motivated by a recent paper of G. Gr\"atzer, a finite distributive lattice D is said to be fully principal congruence representable if for every subset Q of D containing 0, 1, and the set J(D) of nonzero join-irreducible elements of D, there exists a finite lattice L and an isomorphism from the congruence lattice of L onto D such that Q corresponds to the set of principal congruences of L under this isomorphism. Based on earlier results of G. Gr\"atzer, H. Lakser, and the present author, we prove that a finite distributive lattice D is fully principal congruence representable if and only if it is planar and it has at most one join-reducible coatom. Furthermore, even the automorphism group of L can arbitrarily be stipulated in this case. Also, we generalize a recent result of G. Gr\"atzer on principal congruence representable subsets of a distributive lattice whose top element is join-irreducible by proving that the automorphism group of the lattice we construct can be arbitrary.
