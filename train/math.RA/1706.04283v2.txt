A skew polynomial ring R=K[x;\sigma,\delta] is a ring of polynomials with non-commutative multiplication. This creates a difference between left and right divisibility, and thus a concept of left and right evaluations and roots. A polynomial in such a ring may have more roots than its degree, which leads to the concepts of closures and independent sets of roots. There is also a structure of conjugacy classes on the roots. In R=F_{q^m}[x,\sigma], this leads to matroids of right independent and left independent sets. These matroids are isomorphic via the extension of the map \phi:[1]\to[1] defined by \phi(a)=a^{\frac{q^{i-1}-1}{q-1}}. Additionally, extending the field of coefficients of R results in a new skew polynomial ring S of which R is a subring, and if the extension is taken to include roots of an evaluation polynomial of f(x) (which does not depend on which side roots are being considered on), then all roots of f(x) in S are in the same conjugacy class.
