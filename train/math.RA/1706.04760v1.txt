We consider a generalization of the quaternion ring \Big(\frac{a,b}{R}\Big) over a commutative unital ring R that includes the case when a and b are not units of R. In this paper, we focus on the case R=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} for and odd n. In particular, for every odd integer n we compute the number of non-isomorphic generalized quaternion rings \Big(\frac{a,b}{\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}}\Big)
