Here we describe the least distributive lattice congruence \eta on an idempotent semiring in general and characterize the varieties D^\bullet, L^\bullet and R^\bullet of all idempotent semirings such that \eta=\mathcal{D}^\bullet, \mathcal{L}^\bullet and \mathcal{R}^\bullet, respectively. If S \in D^\bullet [L^\bullet, R^\bullet], then the multiplicative reduct (S, \cdot) is a [left, right] normal band. Every semiring S \in D^\bullet is a spined product of a semiring in L^\bullet and a semiring in R^\bullet with respect to a distributive lattice.
