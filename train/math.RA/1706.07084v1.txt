We introduce the class of split Lie-Rinehart algebras as the natural extension of the one of split Lie algebras. We show that if L is a tight split Lie-Rinehart algebra over an associative and commutative algebra A, then L and A decompose as the orthogonal direct sums L = \bigoplus_{i \in I}L_i, A = \bigoplus_{j \in J}A_j, where any L_i is a nonzero ideal of L, any A_j is a nonzero ideal of A, and both decompositions satisfy that for any i \in I there exists a unique \tilde{i} \in J such that A_{\tilde{i}}L_i \neq 0. Furthermore any L_i is a split Lie-Rinehart algebra over A_{\tilde{i}}. Also, under mild conditions, it is shown that the above decompositions of L and A are by means of the family of their, respective, simple ideals.
