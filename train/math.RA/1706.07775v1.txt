Existence criteria for the (b,c)-inverse are given.% in terms of annihilators. We present explicit expressions for the (b,c)-inverse by using inner inverses. We answer the question when the (b,c)-inverse of a\in R is an inner inverse of a. As applications, we give a unified theory of some well-known results of the \{1,3\}-inverse, the \{1,4\}-inverse, the Moore-Penrose inverse, the group inverse and the core inverse.
