Our aim is to establish relations between Drazin inverses of the pesudo-block matrix (P,Q,R,S) and the block matrix composed of P,R,S,Q, where R^2=S^2=0. Based on the relations, we give representations for Drazin inverses of the sum P+Q+R+S under weaker restrictions. As its applications, several expressions for Drazin inverses of a 2\times 2 block matrix are presented under some assumptions. Our results generalize several results in the literature.
