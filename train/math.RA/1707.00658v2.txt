Let D be a division ring with centre F. Let T(D) be the vector space over F generated by all multiplicative commutators in D. In [1], authors have conjectured that every division ring is generated as a vector space over its centre by all of its multiplicative commutators. In this note it is shown that if D is centrally finite, then the conjecture holds.
