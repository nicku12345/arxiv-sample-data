A linear quaternionic equation in one quaternionic variable q is of the form a_1 q b_1+a_2 q b_2+ ... +a_m q b_m = c, where the a_i, b_j, c are given quaternionic coefficients. If introducing basis elements \bf i, j, k of pure quaternions, then the quaternionic equation becomes four linear equations in four unknowns over the reals, and solving such equations is trivial. On the other hand, finding a quaternionic rational function expression of the solution that involves only the input quaternionic coefficients and their conjugates, called a basis-free solution, is non-trivial.   In 1884, Sylvester initiated the study of basis-free solution to linear quaternionic equation. He considered the three-termed equation aq+qb=c, and found its solution q=(a^2+b\overline{b}+a(b+\overline{b}))^{-1}(ac+c\overline{b}) by successive left and right multiplications. In 2013, Schwartz extended the technique to the four-termed equation, and obtained the basis-free solution in explicit form.   This paper solves the general problem for arbitrary number of terms in the non-degenerate case.
