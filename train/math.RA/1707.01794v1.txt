In this note we mainly study the fine Jordan-Chevalley decomposition: a refinement of the classical Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of a matrix and we pay a particular attention to the field of the coefficients of the matrix. Moreover we obtain some further additive and multiplicative decompositions of a matrix under suitable conditions.
