A nonzero element x in a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} with Lie product [ , ] is called extremal if [x,[x,y]] is a multiple of x for all y. In this paper we characterize the (finitary) symplectic Lie algebras as simple Lie algebras generated by their extremal elements satisying the condition that any two noncommuting extremal elements x,y generate an \mathfrak{sl}_2 and any third extremal element z commutes with at least one extremal element in this \mathfrak{sl}_2.
