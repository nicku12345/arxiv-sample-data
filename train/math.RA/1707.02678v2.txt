We study Tate-Vogel and relative cohomologies of complexes by applying the model structure induced by a complete hereditary cotorsion pair (\A, \B) of modules. We show first that the class of complexes admitting a complete \A resolution is exactly the class of complexes with finite Gorenstein \A dimension. This lets us give general techniques for computing Tate-Vogel cohomoloies of complexes with finite Gorenstein \A dimension. As a consequence, relative cohomology groups for complexes with finite Gorenstein \A dimension are investigated. Finally, the relationships between Gorenstein \A dimensions and \A dimensions for complexes are given.
