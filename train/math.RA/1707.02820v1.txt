A ring R is said to be an almost Armendariz ring if whenever product of two polynomials in R[x] is zero, then product of their coefficients are in N_{*}(R). In this article, for an endomorphism \alpha on R, we define an \alpha-almost Armendariz ring of R considering the polynomials in skew polynomial ring R[x; \alpha] instead of R[x]. It is the generalisation of an almost Armendariz ring [9] and an \alpha-Armendariz ring [4]. Moreover, for an endomorphism \alpha of R, we define an \alpha-skew almost Armendariz ring, and prove that a reversible ring R with certain condition on endomorphism \alpha, its polynomial ring R[x] is an \overline{\alpha}-skew almost Armendariz ring.
