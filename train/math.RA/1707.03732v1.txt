Let L_K(E) denote the Leavitt path algebra associated to the finite graph E and field K. For any closed path c in E, we define and investigate the uniserial, artinian, non-noetherian left L_K(E)-module U_{E,c-1}. The unique simple factor of each proper submodule of U_{E,c-1} is isomorphic to the Chen simple module V_{[c^\infty]}. In our main result, we classify those closed paths c for which U_{E,c-1} is injective. In this situation, U_{E,c-1} is the injective hull of V_{[c^\infty]}.
