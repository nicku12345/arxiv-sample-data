We classify gradings by arbitrary abelian groups on the classical simple Lie superalgebras P(n), n \geq 2, and on the simple associative superalgebras M(m,n), m, n \geq 1, over an algebraically closed field: fine gradings up to equivalence and G-gradings, for a fixed group G, up to isomorphism. As a corollary, we also classify up to isomorphism the G-gradings on the classical Lie superalgebra A(m,n) that are induced from G-gradings on M(m+1,n+1). In the case of Lie superalgebras, the characteristic is assumed to be 0.
