Let (\mathcal{A,B}) be a complete and hereditary cotorsion pair in the category of left R-modules. In this paper, the so-called Gorenstein projective complexes respect to the cotorsion pair (\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}) are introduced. We show that these complexes are just the complexes of Gorenstein projective modules respect to the cotorsion pair (\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}). As applications, we prove that both Gorenstein projective modules with respect to cotorsion pairs and Gorenstein projective complexes with respect to cotorsion pairs possess of stability.
