The purpose of this paper is to identify all eight of the basic Cayley-Dickson doubling products. A Cayley-Dickson algebra \cda{N+1} of dimension 2^{N+1} consists of all ordered pairs of elements of a Cayley-Dickson algebra \cda{N} of dimension 2^N where the product (a,b)(c,d) of elements of \cda{N+1} is defined in terms of a pair of second degree binomials \left(f(a,b,c,d),g(a,b,c,d)\right) satisfying certain properties. The polynomial pair(f,g) is called a `doubling product.' While \cda{0} may denote any ring, here it is taken to be the set \mathbb{R} of real numbers. The binomials f and g should be devised such that \cda{1}=\mathbb{C} the complex numbers, \cda{2}=\mathbb{H} the quaternions, and \cda{3}=\mathbb{O} the octonions. Historically, various researchers have used different yet equivalent doubling products.
