Let F be a finite field with the characteristic p > 2 and let G be the unitary Grassmann algebra generated by an infinite dimensional vector space V over F. In this paper, we determine a basis for \mathbb{Z}_{2}-graded polynomial identities for any non-trivial \mathbb{Z}_{2}-grading such that its underlying vector space is homogeneous.
