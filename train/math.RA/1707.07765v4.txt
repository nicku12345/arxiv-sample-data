In this short note we present an elementary matrix-constructive proof of Quillen-Suslin theorem for Ore extensions: If K is a division ring and A:=K[x;\sigma,\delta] is an Ore extension, with \sigma bijective, then every finitely generated projective A-module is free. We will show an algorithm that computes the basis of a given finitely generated projective module. The algorithm has been implemented in a computational package, and some illustrative examples are included.
