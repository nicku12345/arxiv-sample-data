In this paper, first we give the cohomologies of an n-Hom-Lie algebra and introduce the notion of a derivation of an n-Hom-Lie algebra. We show that a derivation of an n-Hom-Lie algebra is a 1-cocycle with the coefficient in the adjoint representation. We also give the formula of the dual representation of a representation of an n-Hom-Lie algebra. Then, we study (n-1)-order deformation of an n-Hom-Lie algebra. We introduce the notion of a Hom-Nijenhuis operator, which could generate a trivial (n-1)-order deformation of an n-Hom-Lie algebra. Finally, we introduce the notion of a generalized derivation of an n-Hom-Lie algebra, by which we can construct a new n-Hom-Lie algebra, which is called the generalized derivation extension of an n-Hom-Lie algebra.
