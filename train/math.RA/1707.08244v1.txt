The main result of this paper shows that if \mathcal{M} is a consistent strong linear Maltsev condition which does not imply the existence of a cube term, then for any finite algebra \mathbb{A} there exists a new finite algebra \mathbb{A}_\mathcal{M} which satisfies the Maltsev condition \mathcal{M}, and whose subpower membership problem is at least as hard as the subpower membership problem for \mathbb{A}. We characterize consistent strong linear Maltsev conditions which do not imply the existence of a cube term, and show that there are finite algebras in varieties that are congruence distributive and congruence k-permutable (k \geq 3) whose subpower membership problem is EXPTIME-complete.
