In this paper, the complete algebraic structure of finite semisimple group algebra of a normally monomial group is described. The main result is illustrated by computing the explicit Wedderburn decomposition of finite semisimple group algebras of various normally monomial groups. The automorphism groups of these group algebras are also determined.
