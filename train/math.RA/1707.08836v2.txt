We describe all degenerations of the variety \mathfrak{Jord}_3 of Jordan algebras of dimension three over \mathbb{C}. In particular, we describe all irreducible components in \mathfrak{Jord}_3. For every n we define an n-dimensional rigid ''marginal'' Jordan algebra of level one. Also, we discuss ''marginal'' algebras in associative, alternative, left alternative, non-commutative Jordan, Leibniz, and anticommutative cases.
