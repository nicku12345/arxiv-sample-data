If \mathfrak{g} is a Lie algebra then the semi-centre of the Poisson algebra S(\mathfrak{g}) is the subalgebra generated by ad(\mathfrak{g})-eigenvectors. In this paper we abstract this definition to the context of integral Poisson algebras. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions for the Poisson semi-centre A^{\operatorname{sc}} to be a Poisson algebra graded by its weight spaces. In that situation we show the Poisson semi-centre exhibits many nice properties: the rational Casimirs are quotients of Poisson normal elements and the Poisson Dixmier-M{\oe}glin equivalence holds for the semi-centre.
