Let A be a unital associative algebra over a field F and V be a unital left A-module. The module V is called zero action determined if every bilinear map f: A\times V\rightarrow F with the property that f(a,m)=0 whenever am=0 is of the form f(x,v)=\Phi(xv) for some linear map \Phi: V\rightarrow F. In this paper, we classify the finite dimensional irreducible and principal projective zero action determined modules of A. As an application, two classes of zero product determined algebras are shown: some semiperfect algebras (infinite dimensional in general); quasi-hereditary cellular algebras.
