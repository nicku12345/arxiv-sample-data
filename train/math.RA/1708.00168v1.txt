Universal enveloping Rota-Baxter algebras of preassociative and postassociative algebras are constructed. The question of Li Guo is answered: the pair of varieties (Rota-Baxter algebras of nonzero weight,postassociative algebras) is a PBW-pair and the pair (Rota-Baxter algebras of zero weight,preassociative algebras) is not.
