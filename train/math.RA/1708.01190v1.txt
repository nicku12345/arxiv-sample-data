A finite-dimensional unital and associative algebra over \mathbb{R}, or what we shall call simply "an algebra" in this paper for short, generalities the construction by which we derive the complex numbers by "adjoining an element i" to \mathbb{R} and imposing the relation i^2 = -1. In this paper, we examine some of the elementary algebraic properties of such algebras, how they break-down when compared to standard grade-school algebra, and discuss how such properties are relevant to other areas of our research regarding algebras, such as the \mathcal{A}-calculus and the theory of \mathcal{A}-ODEs.
