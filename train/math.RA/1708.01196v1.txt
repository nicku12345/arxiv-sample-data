In this paper, the authors apply a stratification of moduli spaces of complex Lie algebras to analyzing the moduli spaces of nxn matrices under scalar similarity and bilinear forms under the cogredient action. For similar matrices, we give a complete description of a stratification of the space by some very simple projective orbifolds of the form P^n/G, where G is a subgroup of the symmetric group sigma_{n+1} acting on P^n by permuting the projective coordinates. For bilinear forms, we give a similar stratification up to dimension 3.
