Extending the work of Freese and Cook, which develop the basic theory of calculus and power series over real associative algebras, we examine what can be said about the logarithmic functions over an algebra. In particular, we find that for any multiplicative unital nil algebra the exponential function is injective, and hence the algebra has a unique logarithm on the image of the exponential. We extend this result to show that for a large class of algebras, the logarithms behave incredibly similarly to the logarithms over the real and complex numbers depending on if they are "Type-R" or "Type-C" algebras.
