In this paper, we study partial actions of groups on R-algebras, where R is a commutative ring. We describe the partial actions of groups on the indecomposable algebras with enveloping actions. Then we work on algebras that can be decomposed as product of indecomposable algebras and we give a description of the partial actions of groups on these algebras in terms of global actions.
