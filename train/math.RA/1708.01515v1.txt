Weighted singular value decomposition (WSVD) of a quaternion matrix and with its help determinantal representations of the quaternion weighted Moore-Penrose inverse have been derived recently by the author. In this paper, using these determinantal representations, explicit determinantal representation formulas for the solution of the restricted quaternion matrix equations, {\bf A}{\bf X}{\bf B}={\bf D}, and consequently, {\bf A}{\bf X}={\bf D} and {\bf X}{\bf B}={\bf D} are obtained within the framework of the theory of column-row determinants. We consider all possible cases depending on weighted matrices.
