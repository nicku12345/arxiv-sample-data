We show that E is a finite graph with no sinks if and only if the Leavitt path algebra L_R(E) is isomorphic to an algebraic Cuntz-Krieger algebra if and only if the C^*-algebra C^*(E) is unital and rank(K_0(C^*(E)))=rank(K_1(C^*(E))). When k is a field and rank(k^{\times})< \infty, we show that the Leavitt path algebra L_k(E) is isomorphic to an algebraic Cuntz-Krieger algebra if and only if L_k(E) is unital and rank(K_1(L_k(E)))=(rank(k^{\times})+1)rank(K_0(L_k(E))). We also show that any unital k-algebra which is Morita equivalent or stably isomorphic to an algebraic Cuntz-Krieger algebra, is isomorphic to an algebraic Cuntz-Krieger algebra. As a consequence, corners of algebraic Cuntz-Krieger algebras are algebraic Cuntz-Krieger algebras.
