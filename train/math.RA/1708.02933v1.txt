We study the degeneration relations on the varieties of associative and Lie algebra structures on a fixed finite dimensional vector space and give a description of them in terms of Gerstenhaber formal deformations. We use this result to show how the orbit closure of the 3-dimensional Lie algebras can be determined using homological algebra. For the case of finite dimensional associative algebras, we prove that the N-Koszul property is preserved under the degeneration relation for all N\geq2.
