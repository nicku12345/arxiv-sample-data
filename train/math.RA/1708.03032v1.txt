Let G be an arbitrary group and let K be a field of characteristic different from 2. We classify the G-gradings on the Jordan algebra of upper triangular matrices of order n over K. It turns out that there are, up to a graded isomorphism, two families of gradings: the elementary gradings (analogous to the ones in the associative case), and the so called mirror type (MT) gradings. Moreover we prove that the G-gradings on this algebra are uniquely determined, up to a graded isomorphism, by the graded identities they satisfy.
