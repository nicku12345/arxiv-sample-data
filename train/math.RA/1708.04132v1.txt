Extending the work of Freese, we further develop the theory of generalized trigonometric functions. In particular, we study to what extent the notion of polar form for the complex numbers may be generalized to arbitrary associative algebras, and how the general trigonometric functions may be used to give particularly elegant formulas for the logarithm over an algebra. Finally, we close with an array of open questions relating to this line of inquiry.
