Geometrically, the eigenvectors of a square matrix \mathbf{A} are not rotated by \mathbf{A}. Here we consider vectors that are rotated \pi/2 by \mathbf{A}; that is, vectors orthogonal to their images. We call these vectors fremdervectors of \mathbf{A} and discuss conditions for their existence. We also define fremdervalues, scalars z such that z\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A} has a fremdervector, and discuss several known applications for fremdervectors.
