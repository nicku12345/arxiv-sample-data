We construct free modules over an associative conformal algebra. We establish Composition-Diamond lemma for associative conformal modules. As applications, Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases of the Virasoro conformal module and module over the semidirect product of Virasoro conformal algebra and current algebra are given respectively.
