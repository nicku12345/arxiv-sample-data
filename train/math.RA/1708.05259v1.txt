Given a graded ample Hausdorff groupoid, we realise its graded Steinberg algebra as a partial skew inverse semigroup ring. We use this to show that for a partial action of a discrete group on a locally compact Hausdorff topological space, the Steinberg algebra of the associated groupoid is graded isomorphic to the corresponding partial skew group ring. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the open invariant subsets of the topological space and the graded ideals of the partial skew group ring. We also consider the algebraic version of the partial C^{*}-algebra of an abelian group and realise it as a partial skew group ring via a partial action of the group on a topological space. Applications to the theory of Leavitt path algebras are given.
