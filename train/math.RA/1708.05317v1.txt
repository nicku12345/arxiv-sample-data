In this paper, we study homological properties of twisted tensor products of connected graded algebras. We focus on the Ext-algebras of twisted tensor products with a certain form of twisting maps firstly. We show those Ext-algebras are also twisted tensor products, and depict the twisting maps for such Ext-algebras in-depth. With those preparations, we describe Nakayama automorphisms of twisted tensor products of noetherian Artin-Schelter regular algebras.
