For any primitive matrix M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n} with positive diagonal entries, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a positive vector \mathbf{x}=(x_1,\dots,x_n)^t such that M\mathbf{x}=(\frac{1}{x_1},\dots,\frac{1}{x_n})^t. The contribution of this note is to provide an alternative proof of a result of Brualdi et al. (1966) on the diagonal equivalence of a nonnegative matrix to a stochastic matrix.
