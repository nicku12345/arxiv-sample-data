In this paper, we construct a pre-Lie structure on the free Lie algebra L(E) generated by a set E, giving an explicit presentation of L(E) as the quotient of the free pre-Lie algebra generated by E, by some ideal I. The main result in this paper is a description of Gr\"obner bases in terms of trees.
