Let D be a division ring finite dimensional over its center F. The goal of this paper is to prove that for any positive integer n there exists a in D^(n); the n-th multiplicative derived subgroup, such that F(a) is a maximal subfield of D. We also show that a single depth-n iterated additive commutator would generate a maximal subfield of D.
