Let A be a brace algebra. This structure implies that A is also a pre-Lie algebra. In this paper, we establish Composition-Diamond lemma for brace algebras. Using this Composition-Diamond lemma we prove that each pre-Lie algebra L can be embedded into a brace algebra A_L, i.e., L is a pre-Lie subalgebra of A_L up to isomorphism. We also determine an explicit linear basis for the brace algebra A_{L}.
