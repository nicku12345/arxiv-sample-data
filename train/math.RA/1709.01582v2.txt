The author has previously associated to each commutative ring with unit R and \'etale groupoid \mathscr G with locally compact, Hausdorff and totally disconnected unit space an R-algebra R\mathscr G. In this paper we characterize when R\mathscr G is Noetherian and when it is Artinian. As corollaries, we extend the characterization of Abrams, Aranda~Pino and Siles~Molina of finite dimensional and of Noetherian Leavitt path algebras over a field to arbitrary commutative coefficient rings and we recover the characterization of Okni\'nski of Noetherian inverse semigroup algebras and of Zelmanov of Artinian inverse semigroup algebras.
