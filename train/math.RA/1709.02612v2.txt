Let \mathbb{F} be a field, and let q\in\mathbb{F}. The q-deformed Heisenberg algebra is the unital associative \mathbb{F}-algebra \mathcal{H}(q) with generators A,B and relation AB-qBA=I, where I is the multiplicative identity in \mathcal{H}(q). The set of all Lie polynomials in A,B is the Lie subalgebra \mathcal{L}(q) of \mathcal{H}(q) generated by A,B. If q\neq 1 or the characteristic of \mathbb{F} is not 2, then the equation AB-qBA=I cannot be expressed in terms of Lie algebra operations only, yet this equation still has consequences on the Lie algebra structure of \mathcal{L}(q), which we investigate. We show that if q is not a root of unity, then \mathcal{L}(q) is a Lie ideal of \mathcal{H}(q), and the resulting quotient Lie algebra is infinite-dimensional and one-step nilpotent.
