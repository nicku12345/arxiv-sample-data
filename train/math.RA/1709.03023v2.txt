A Lie algebra L is said to be (\Theta_{n},sl_{n})-graded if it contains a simple subalgebra \mathfrak{g} isomorphic to sl_{n} such that the \mathfrak{g}-module L decomposes into copies of the adjoint module, the trivial module, the natural module V, its symmetric and exterior squares S^{2}V and \wedge^{2}V and their duals. We describe the multiplicative structures and the coordinate algebras of (\Theta_{n},sl_{n})-graded Lie algebras for n\ge5, classify these Lie algebras and determine their central extensions.
