In previous work [Adv. Math. 298, pp. 325-368, 2016], the structure of the simultaneous kernels of Hadamard powers of any positive semidefinite matrix were described. Key ingredients in the proof included a novel stratification of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices and a well-known theorem of Hershkowitz, Neumann, and Schneider, which classifies the Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices whose entries are 0 or 1 in modulus. In this paper, we show that each of these results extends to a larger class of matrices which we term 3-PMP (principal minor positive).
