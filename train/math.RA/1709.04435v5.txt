Let K be a commutative Noetherian ring with identity, let A be a K-algebra, and let B be a subalgebra of A such that A/B is finitely generated as a K-module. The main result of the paper is that A is finitely presented (resp. finitely generated) if and only if B is finitely presented (resp. finitely generated). As corollaries we obtain: a subring of finite index in a finitely presented ring is finitely presented; a subalgebra of finite co-dimension in a finitely presented algebra over a field is finitely presented (already shown by Voden in 2009). We also discuss the role of the Noetherian assumption on K, and show that for finite generation it can be replaced by a weaker condition that the module A/B be finitely presented. Finally, we demonstrate that the results do not readily extend to non-associative algebras, by exhibiting an ideal of co-dimension 1 of the free Lie algebra of rank 2 which is not finitely generated as a Lie algebra.
