In this paper, we introduce two new generalized inverses of matrices, namely, the \bra{i}{m}-core inverse and the \pare{j}{m}-core inverse. The \bra{i}{m}-core inverse of a complex matrix extends the notions of the core inverse defined by Baksalary and Trenkler \cite{BT} and the core-EP inverse defined by Manjunatha Prasad and Mohana \cite{MM}. The \pare{j}{m}-core inverse of a complex matrix extends the notions of the core inverse and the {\rm DMP}-inverse defined by Malik and Thome \cite{MT}. Moreover, the formulae and properties of these two new concepts are investigated by using matrix decompositions and matrix powers.
