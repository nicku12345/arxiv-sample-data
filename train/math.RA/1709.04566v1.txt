Let \mathbb{F}_q be the finite field with q elements, where q is a power of a prime p. Recently, a particular action of the group \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb F_q) on irreducible polynomials in \mathbb F_q[x] has been introduced and many questions concerning the invariant polynomials have been discussed. In this paper, we give a natural extension of this action on the polynomial ring \mathbb F_q[x_1, \ldots, x_n] and study the algebraic properties of the invariant elements.
