In this paper we study non-central almost subnormal subgroups of the multiplicative group of a division ring satisfying a non-zero generalized rational identity. The main result generalizes Chiba's theorem on subnormal subgroups. As an application, we get a theorem on almost subnormal subgroups satisfying a generalized algebraic rational identity. The last theorem has several corollaries which generalize completely or partially some previous results.
