In this paper we characterize those linear bijective maps on the monoid of all n \times n square matrices over an anti-negative semifield which preserve and strongly preserve each of Green's equivalence relations \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{D}, \mathcal{J} and the corresponding three pre-orderings \leq_\mathcal{L}, \leq_\mathcal{R}, \leq_\mathcal{J}. These results apply in particular to the tropical and boolean semirings, and for these two semirings we also obtain corresponding results for the \mathcal{H} relation.
