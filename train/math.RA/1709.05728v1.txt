Let G be a group generated by a set X. It is well known and easy to check that \[ [g_1, g_2, \dots ,g_n] = 1 \mbox{ for all } g_i \in G \qquad \iff \qquad [x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n] =1 \mbox{ for all } x_i \in X. \] Let L be a Lie algebra generated by a set X. Then it is also well known and easy to check that \[ [h_1, h_2, \dots , h_n] = 0 \mbox{ for all } h_i \in L \qquad \iff \qquad [x_1, x_2, \dots ,x_n] = 0 \mbox{ for all } x_i \in X. \]   Now let A be a unital associative algebra generated by a set X. Then the assertion similar to the above does not hold: for n > 2, it is easy to find an algebra A with a generating set X such that [x_1, x_2, \dots ,x_n] = 0 for all x_i \in X but [a_1, a_2, \dots ,a_n] \ne 0 for some a_i \in A.   However, we prove the following result. Let R be a unital associative and commutative ring such that \frac{1}{3} \in R. Let A be a unital associative R-algebra generated by a set X. Let X^2 = \{ x_1 x_2 \mid x_i \in X \} be the set of all products of 2 elements of X. Then \[ [a_1, a_2, \dots ,a_n] = 0 \mbox{ for all } a_i \in A \qquad \iff \qquad [y_1, y_2, \dots , y_n] =0 \mbox{ for all } y_i \in X \cup X^2. \] Moreover, one can assume that in the commutator [y_1, y_2, \dots , y_n] above y_1, y_n \in X.
