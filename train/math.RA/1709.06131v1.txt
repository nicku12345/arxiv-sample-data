For tensors in \mathbb{C}^d \otimes \mathbb{C}^d \otimes \mathbb{C}^d, Landsberg provides non-trivial equations for tensors of border rank 2d-3 for d even and 2d-5 for d odd were found by Landsberg. In previous work, we observe that Landsberg's method can be interpreted in the language of tensor blow-ups of matrix spaces, and using concavity of blow-ups we improve the case for odd d from 2d-5 to 2d-4. The purpose of this paper is to show that the aforementioned results extend to tensors in K^d \otimes K^d \otimes K^d for any field K.
