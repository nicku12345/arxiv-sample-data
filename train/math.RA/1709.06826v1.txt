Based on the relation between the notions of Lie triple systems and Jordan algebras, we introduce the n-ary Jordan algebras,an n-ary generalization of Jordan algebras obtained via the generalization of the following property \left[ R_{x},R_{y}\right] \in Der\left( \mathcal{A}\right), where \mathcal{A} is an n-ary algebra. Next, we study a ternary example of these algebras. Finally, based on the construction of a family of ternary algebras defined by means of the Cayley-Dickson algebras, we present an example of a ternary D_{x,y}-derivation algebra (n-ary D_{x,y}-derivation algebras are the non-commutative version of n-ary Jordan algebras).
