We consider finite dimensional Jordan superalgebras \jor over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, with solvable radical \rad such that \radd=0 and \jor/\rad is a simple Jordan superalgebra of one of the following types: Kac \kac, Kaplansky \mathcal{K}_3 superform or \algdt.   We prove that an analogue of the Wedderburn Principal Theorem (WPT) holds if certain restrictions on the types of irreducible subsuperbimodules of N are imposed, where N is considered as a J-superbimodule, and J is a simple Jordan superalgebra. Using counterexamples, it is shown that the imposed restrictions are essential.
