In this article, we investigate the representation ring (or Green ring) of the Drinfeld double D(H_n(q)) of the Taft algebra H_n(q), where n is an integer with n>2 and q is a root of unity of order n. It is shown that the Green ring r(D(H_n(q))) is a commutative ring generated by infinitely many elements subject to certain relations.
