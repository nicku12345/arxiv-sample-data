We prove that the skew Calabi-Yau property is preserved under normal extension for locally finite positively graded algebras. We also obtain a homological identity which describes the relationship between the Nakayama automorphisms of skew Calabi-Yau locally finite positively graded algebras and their normal extensions. As a preliminary, we show that the Nakayama automorphisms of skew Calabi-Yau algebras always send a regular normal element to a multiple of itself by a unit.
