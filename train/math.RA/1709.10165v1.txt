An analogue of the Wedderbur principal theorem (WPT) is considered for finite dimensional Jordan superalgebras A with solvable radical N, such that N^2=0 and A/N is isomorphic to Josp_n|2m(F), where F is an algebraicallly closed field of characteristic zero. Let's we prove that the WPT is valid under some restrictions over the irreducible Josp_n|2m(F)-bimodules contained in N, and it is shown with counter-examples that these restrictions can not be weakened.
