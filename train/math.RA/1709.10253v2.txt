Let \det_2(A) be the block-wise determinant (partial determinant). We consider the condition for completing the determinant \det(\det_2(A)) = \det(A), and characterize the case for an arbitrary Kronecker product A of matrices over an arbitrary field. Further insisting that \det_2(AB)=\det_2(A)\det_2(B), for Kronecker products A and B, yields a multiplicative monoid of matrices. This leads to a determinant-root operation \text{Det} which satisfies \text{Det}(\text{Det}_2(A)) = \text{Det}(A) when A is a Kronecker product of matrices for which \text{Det} is defined.
