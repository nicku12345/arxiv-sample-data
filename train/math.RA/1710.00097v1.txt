Let R be a right and left Ore ring, S its set of regular elements and Q = R[S^{-1}] = [S^{-1}] R the classical ring of quotients of R. We prove that if F.dim(Q_Q) = 0, then the following conditions are equivalent: (i) Flat right R-modules are strongly flat.  (ii) Matlis-cotorsion right R-modules are Enochs-cotorsion. (iii)  h-divisible right R-modules are weak-injective. (iv) Homomorphic images of weak-injective right R-modules are weak-injective. (v) Homomorphic images of injective right R-modules are weak-injective. (vi) Right R-modules of weak dimension  \le 1 are of projective dimension \le1. (vii) The cotorsion pairs (\mathcal{P_1},\mathcal{D}) and (\mathcal{F}_1,\mathcal{WI}) coincide. (viii) Divisible right R-modules are weak-injective. This extends a result by Fuchs and Salce (2017) for modules over a commutative ring R.
