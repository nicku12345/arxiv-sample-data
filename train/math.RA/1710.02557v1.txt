A ring R is a UU ring if every unit is unipotent, or equivalently if every unit is a sum of a nilpotent and an idempotent that commute. These rings have been investigated in C\u{a}lug\u{a}reanu \cite{C} and in Danchev and Lam \cite{DL}. In this paper, two generalizations of UU rings are discussed. We study rings for which every unit is a sum of a nilpotent and an idempotent, and rings for which every unit is a sum of a nilpotent and two idempotents that commute with one another.
