The supercommutator algebra of a right alternative superalgebra is a Bol superalgebra. Hom-Bol superalgebras are defined and it is shown that they are closed under even self-morphisms. Any Bol superalgebra along with any even self-morphism is twisted into a Hom-Bol superalgebra. The supercommutator algebra of a right Hom-alternative superalgebra has a natural Hom-Bol superalgebra structure.
