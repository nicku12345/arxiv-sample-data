We introduce the notion of curved \mathcal{O}-operator systems as a generalization of T. Brzezi\'{n}ski's (curved) Rota-Baxter systems, and then investigate their relations with (tri)dendriform systems and pre-Lie algebras. Moreover, we consider the special cases of generalized Rota-Baxter algebras with respect to associative compatible pairs and then double curved Rota-Baxter systems.
