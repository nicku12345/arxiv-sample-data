Marks showed that \mathbb{F}_2Q_8, the \mathbb{F}_2 group algebra over the quaternion group, is a reversible nonsymmetric ring, then questioned whether or not this ring is minimal with respect to cardinality. In this work, it is shown that the cardinality of a minimal reversible nonsymmetric ring is indeed 256. Furthermore, it is shown that although \mathbb{F}_2Q_8 is a duo ring, there are also examples of minimal reversible nonsymmetric rings which are nonduo.
