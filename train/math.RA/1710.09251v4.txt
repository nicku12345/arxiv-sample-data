We continue a study of separable equivalence from Hokkaido Mathematical Journal 24 (1995), 527-549. We prove that symmetric separable equivalent rings A and B are linked by a Frobenius bimodule {}_AP_B such that A is P-separable over B. Separably equivalent rings are linked by a biseparable bimodule P. In addition, the ring extension A \rightarrow End P_B is split, separable Frobenius. It is observed that left and right finite projective bimodules over symmetric algebras are Frobenius bimodules; twisted by the Nakayama automorphisms if over Frobenius algebras.
