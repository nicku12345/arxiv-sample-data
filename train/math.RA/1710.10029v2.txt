Let W_+ be the positive Witt algebra, which has a C-basis \{e_n: n \in Z_{\geq 1}\}, with Lie bracket [ e_i, e_j] = (j-i) e_{i+j}. We study the two-sided ideal structure of the universal enveloping algebra U(W_+) of W_+. We show that if I is a (two-sided) ideal of U(W_+) generated by quadratic expressions in the e_i, then U(W_+)/I has finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, and that such ideals satisfy the ascending chain condition. We conjecture that analogous facts hold for arbitrary ideals of U(W_+), and verify a version of these conjectures for radical Poisson ideals of the symmetric algebra S(W_+).
