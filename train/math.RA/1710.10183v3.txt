In this paper, we study the congruences, prime filters and prime ideals of horizontal sums of bounded lattices, then, through a construction based on horizontal sums and without enforcing the Continuum Hypothesis, we are modifying an example from \cite{eucard} into a solution to the problem we have proposed in the same article: finding a lattice with the cardinalities of the sets of filters, ideals and congruences pairwise distinct.
