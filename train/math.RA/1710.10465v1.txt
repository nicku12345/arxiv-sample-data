In \cite{F}, Faith asked for what rings R does the Dual Baer Criterion hold in Mod-R, that is, when does R-projectivity imply projectivity for all right R-modules? Such rings R were called right testing. Sandomierski proved that if R is right perfect, then R is right testing. Puninski et al.\ \cite{AIPY} have recently shown for a number of non-right perfect rings that they are not right testing, and noticed that \cite{T2} proved consistency with ZFC of the statement {\lq}each right testing ring is right perfect{\rq} (the proof used Shelah's uniformization).   Here, we prove the complementing consistency result: the existence of a right testing, but not right perfect ring is also consistent with ZFC (our proof uses Jensen-functions). Thus the answer to the Faith's question above is undecidable in ZFC. We also provide examples of non-right perfect rings such that the Dual Baer Criterion holds for {\lq}small{\rq} modules (where {\lq}small{\rq} means countably generated, or \leq 2^{\aleph_0}-presented of projective dimension \leq 1).
