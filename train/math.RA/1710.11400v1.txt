Inspired by the commutator and anticommutator algebras derived from algebras graded by groups, we introduce noncommutatively graded algebras. We generalize various classical graded results to the noncommutatively graded situation concerning identity elements, inverses, existence of limits and colimits and adjointness of certain functors. In the particular instance of noncommutatively graded Lie algebras, we establish the existence of universal graded enveloping algebras and we show a graded version of the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem.
