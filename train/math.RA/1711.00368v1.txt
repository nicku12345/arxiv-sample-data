(Multiplicative) Hom-Lie-Yamaguti superalgebras which generalize Hom-Lie supertriple systems (and subsequently ternary multiplicative Hom-Nambu superalgebras) and Hom-Lie superalgebras in the same way as Lie-Yamaguti superalgebras [Frac] generalize Lie supertriple systems and Lie superalgebras are defined. We show that the category of (multiplicative) Hom-Lie-Yamaguti superalgebras is closed under twisting by self-morphisms. Construction of some examples of Hom-Lie-Yamaguti superalgebras is given. The notion of an n^{th}-derived (binary) Hom-superalgebras is extended to the one of an n^{th}-derived binary-ternary Hom-superalgebras and it is shown that the category of Hom-Lie-Yamaguti superalgebras is closed under the process of taking n^{th}- derived Hom-superalgebras.
