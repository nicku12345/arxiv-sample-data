In this paper, we introduce and study differential graded (DG for short) polynomial algebras. In brief, a DG polynomial algebra \mathcal{A} is a connected cochain DG algebra such that its underlying graded algebra \mathcal{A}^{\#} is a polynomial algebra \mathbb{k}[x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_n] with |x_i|=1, for any i\in \{1,2,\cdots, n\}.   We describe all possible differential structures on DG polynomial algebras; compute their DG automorphism groups; study their isomorphism problems; and show that they are all homologically smooth and Gorestein DG algebras. Furthermore, it is proved that the DG polynomial algebra \mathcal{A} is a Calabi-Yau DG algebra when its differential \partial_{\mathcal{A}}\neq 0 and the trivial DG polynomial algebra (\mathcal{A}, 0) is Calabi-Yau if and only if n is an odd integer.
