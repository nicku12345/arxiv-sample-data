We call a finite, spanning set of a semi-simple real Lie algebra a distinguished set if it satisfies the following property: The Lie bracket of any two elements out of the set is, up to some constant, another element in the set; conversely, for any element in the set, there are two elements out of the set whose Lie bracket is, up to some constant, the given element. We show in the paper that every semi-simple real Lie algebra has a distinguished set.
