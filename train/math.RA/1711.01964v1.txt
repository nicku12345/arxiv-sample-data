We show that for a given nilpotent Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} with Z(\mathfrak{g})\subseteq [\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}] all commutative post-Lie algebra structures, or CPA-structures, on \mathfrak{g} are complete. This means that all left and all right multiplication operators in the algebra are nilpotent. Then we study CPA-structures on free-nilpotent Lie algebras F_{g,c} and discover a strong relationship to solving systems of linear equations of type [x,u]+[y,v]=0 for generator pairs x,y\in F_{g,c}. We use results of Remeslennikov and St\"ohr concerning these equations to prove that, for certain g and c, the free-nilpotent Lie algebra F_{g,c} has only central CPA-structures.
