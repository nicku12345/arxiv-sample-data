We discuss the notion of characteristic Lie algebra of a hyperbolic PDE. The integrability of a hyperbolic PDE is closely related to the properties of the corresponding characteristic Lie algebra \chi. We establish two explicit isomorphisms between characteristic Lie algebras of sinh-Gordon and Tzitzeica equations and pro-solvable Lie subalgebras of affine Kac-Moody algebras A_1^{(1)} and A_2^{(2)} respectively. Hence both characteristic Lie algebras are slowly linearly growing Lie algebras with average growth rates \frac{3}{2} and \frac{4}{3} respectively.
