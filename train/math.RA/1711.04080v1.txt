We introduce a non-symmetric operad \mathcal{N}, whose dimension in degree n is given by the Catalan number c_{n-1}. It arises naturally in the study of coalgebra structures defined on compatible associative algebras. We prove that any free compatible associative algebra admits a compatible infinitesimal bialgebra structure, whose subspace of primitive elements is a \mathcal{N}-algebra. The data ({\rm As},{\rm As}^2, \mathcal{N}) is a good triple of operads, in J.-L. Loday's sense. Our construction induces another triple of operads ({\rm As},{\rm As}_2,{\rm As}), where {\rm As}_2 is the operad of matching dialgebras. Motivated by A. Goncharov's Hopf algebra of paths P(S), we introduce the notion of bi-matching dialgebras and show that the Hopf algebra P(S) is a bi-matching dialgebras.
