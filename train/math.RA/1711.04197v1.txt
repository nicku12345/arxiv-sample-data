Let H be a semisimple Hopf algebra, and let R be a noetherian left H-module algebra. If R/R^H is a right H^*-dense Galois extension, then the invariant subalgebra R^H will inherit the AS-Cohen-Macaulay property from R under some mild conditions, and R, when viewed as a right R^H-module, is a Cohen-Macaulay module. In particular, we show that if R is a noetherian complete semilocal algebra which is AS-regular of global dimension 2 and H=\operatorname{\bf k} G for some finite subgroup G\subseteq Aut(R), then all the indecomposable Cohen-Macaulay module of R^H is a direct summand of R_{R^H}, and hence R^H is Cohen-Macaulay-finite, which generalizes a classical result for commutative rings. The main tool used in the paper is the extension groups of objects in the corresponding quotient categories.
