The main purpose of this paper is to study and investigate concerning a ({\alpha},{\alpha})-symmetric derivations D on semiprime rings and prime rings R, we give some results when R admits a ({\alpha},{\alpha})-symmetric derivations D to satisfy some conditions on R.Where {\alpha}: R to R is an automorphism mapping.
