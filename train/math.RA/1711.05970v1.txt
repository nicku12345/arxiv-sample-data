Homological smoothness and twisted Calabi-Yau property of generalized Weyl algebras over polynomial algebras in two variables is studied. A necessary and sufficient condition to be homologically smooth is given. The Nakayama automorphisms of such algebras are also computed in terms of the Jacobian determinants of defining automorphisms.
