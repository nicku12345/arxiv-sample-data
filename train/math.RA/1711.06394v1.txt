Let \lambda and \kappa be cardinal numbers such that \kappa is infinite and either 2\leq \lambda\leq \kappa, or \lambda=2^\kappa. We prove that there exists a lattice L with exactly \lambda many congruences, 2^\kappa many ideals, but only \kappa many filters. Furthermore, if \lambda\geq 2 is an integer of the form 2^m\cdot 3^n, then we can choose L to be a modular lattice generating one of the minimal modular nondistributive congruence varieties described by Ralph Freese in 1976, and this L is even relatively complemented for \lambda=2. Related to some earlier results of George Gr\"atzer and the first author, we also prove that if P is a bounded ordered set (in other words, a bounded poset) with at least two elements, G is a group, and \kappa is an infinite cardinal such that \kappa\geq |P| and \kappa\geq |G|, then there exists a lattice L of cardinality \kappa such that (i) the principal congruences of L form an ordered set isomorphic to P, (ii) the automorphism group of L is isomorphic to G, (iii) L has 2^\kappa many ideals, but (iv) L has only \kappa many filters.
