A ring A is called Hopfian if A cannot be isomorphic to a proper homomorphic image A/J. A is called Bassian if there cannot be an injection of A into a proper homomorphic image A/J. We consider classes of Hopfian and Bassian rings, and tie representability of algebras and chain conditions on ideals to these properties. In particular, any semiprime algebra satisfying the ACC on semiprime ideals is Hopfian, and any semiprime affine PI-algebra over a field is Bassian.
