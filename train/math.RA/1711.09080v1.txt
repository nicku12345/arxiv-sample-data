We extend the notion of intrinsic entropy for endomorphisms of Abelian groups to endomorphisms of modules over an Archimedean non-discrete valuation domain R, using the natural non-discrete length function introduced by Northcott and Reufel for such a category of modules. We prove that this notion of entropy is a length function for the category of R[X]-modules, it satisfies (a suitably adapted version of) the Intrinsic Algebraic Yuzvinski Formula and that it is essentially the unique invariant for Mod(R[X]) with these properties.
