Let A be an associative algebra of arbitrary dimension over a field F and G a finite soluble group of automorphisms of A oforder n, prime to the characteristic of F. We prove that if the fixed-point subalgebra of A under the action of G contains a two-sided nilpotent ideal of nilpotency index d and of finite codimension m in I, then A contains a nilpotent two-sided ideal of nilpotency index bounded by a function of n and d and of finite codimension bounded by a function of m, n and d.
