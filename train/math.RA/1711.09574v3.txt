Let \mathbb{F} denote a field with {\rm char\,}\mathbb{F}\not=2. The Racah algebra \mathfrak{R} is the unital associative \mathbb{F}-algebra defined by generators and relations in the following way. The generators are A, B, C, D. The relations assert that  [A,B]=[B,C]=[C,A]=2D  and each of the elements \begin{gather*} \alpha=[A,D]+AC-BA, \qquad \beta=[B,D]+BA-CB, \qquad \gamma=[C,D]+CB-AC \end{gather*} is central in \mathfrak{R}. Additionally the element \delta=A+B+C is central in \mathfrak{R}. The algebra \mathfrak{R} was introduced by Genest-Vinet-Zhedanov. We consider a mild change in their setting to call each element in \begin{equation*} D^2+A^2+B^2 +\frac{(\delta+2)\{A,B\}-\{A^2,B\}-\{A,B^2\}}{2} +A (\beta-\delta) +B (\delta-\alpha)+\mathfrak{C} \end{equation*} a Casimir element of \mathfrak{R}, where \mathfrak{C} is the commutative subalgebra of \mathfrak{R} generated by \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta. The main results of this paper are as follows. Each of the following distinct elements is a Casimir element of \mathfrak{R}: \begin{align*} \Omega_A = D^2 + \frac{B A C +C A B}{2} + A^2 +B \gamma -C \beta -A \delta, \Omega_B = D^2 + \frac{C B A +A B C}{2} + B^2 +C \alpha -A \gamma -B\delta, \Omega_C = D^2 + \frac{A C B +B C A}{2} + C^2 +A \beta -B\alpha -C\delta. \end{align*} The set \{\Omega_A,\Omega_B,\Omega_C\} is invariant under a faithful D_6-action on \mathfrak{R}. Moreover we show that any Casimir element \Omega is algebraically independent over \mathfrak{C}; if {\rm char\,}\mathbb{F}=0 then the center of \mathfrak{R} is \mathfrak{C}[\Omega].
