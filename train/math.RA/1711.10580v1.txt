Matlis showed that the injective hull of a simple module over a commutative Noetherian ring is Artinian. Many non-commutative Noetherian rings whose injective hulls of simple modules are locally Artinian have been extensively studied recently. This property had been denoted by property (\diamond). In this paper we investigate, which non-Noetherian semiprimary commutative quasi-local rings (R, m) satisfy property (\diamond). For quasi-local rings (R,m) with m^3=0, we prove a characterisation of this property in terms of the dual space of Soc(R). Furthermore, we show that (R,m) satisfies (\diamond) if and only if its associated graded ring gr(R) does.   Given a field F and vector spaces V and W and a symmetric bilinear map \beta:V\times V\rightarrow W we consider commutative quasi-local rings of the form F\times V \times W, whose product is given by (\lambda_1, v_1,w_1)(\lambda_2,v_2,w_2) = (\lambda_1\lambda_2, \lambda_1v_2+\lambda_2v_1, \lambda_1w_2+\lambda_2w_1+\beta(v_1,v_2)) in order to build new examples and to illustrate our theory. In particular we prove that any quasi-local commutative ring with radical cube-zero does not satisfy (\diamond) if and only if it has a factor, whose associated graded ring is of the form F\times V \times F with V infinite dimensional and \beta non-degenerated.
