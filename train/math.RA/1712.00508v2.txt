In this paper we discourse basises of representable algebras. This question lead to arithmetic problems. We prove algorithmical solvability of exponential-Diophantine equations in rings represented by matrices over fields of positive characteristic. Consider the system of exponential-Diophantine equations  \sum\limits_{i=1}^s P_{ij}(n_1,\dots,n_t) b_{ij0} a_{ij1}^{n_1} b_{ij1} \dots a_{ijt}^{n_t}b_{ijt}=0  where b_{ijk},a_{ijk} are constants from matrix ring of characteristic p, n_i are indeterminates. For any solution (n_1,\dots,n_t) of the system we construct a word (over an alphabet containing p^t symbols) {\overline \alpha_0},\dots,{\overline \alpha_q} where {\overline \alpha_i} is a t-tuple \langle n_1^{(i)},\dots,n_t^{(i)}\rangle, n^{(i)} is the i-th digit in the p-adic representation of n. The main result of this paper is as follows: the set of words corresponding in this sense to solutions of a system of exponential-Diophantine equations is a regular language (i.e. recognizable by a finite automaton). There exists an effective algorithm which calculates this language. This algorithm is constructed in the paper.
