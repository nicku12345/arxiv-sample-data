An arbitrary group action on an algebra R results in an ideal \mathfrak{r} of R. This ideal \mathfrak{r} fits into the classical radical theory, and will be called the radical of the group action. If R is a noetherian algebra with finite GK-dimension and G is a finite group, then the difference between the GK-dimensionsof R and that of R/\mathfrak{r} is called the pertinency of the group action. We provide some methods to find elements of the radical, which helps to calculate the pertinency of some special group actions. The \mathfrak{r}-adic local cohomology of R is related to the singularities of the invariant subalgebra R^G. We establish an equivalence between the quotient category of the invariant R^G and that of the skew group ring R*G through the torsion theory associated to the radical \mathfrak{r}. With the help of the equivalence, we show that the invariant subalgebra R^G will inherit certain Cohen-Macaulay property from R.
