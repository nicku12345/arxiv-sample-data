We realize the \mathbb{F}_q-algebra M(\mathbb{F}_q) studied by von Neumann and Halperin as the Fra\"iss\'e limit of the class of finite-dimensional matrix algebras over a finite field \mathbb{F}_q equipped with the rank metric. We then provide a new Fra\"iss\'e-theoretic proof of uniqueness of such an object. Using the results of Carderi and Thom, we show that the automorphism group of \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_q ) is extremely amenable. We deduce a Ramsey-theoretic property for the class of algebras M(\mathbb{F}_q), and provide an explicit bound for the quantities involved.
