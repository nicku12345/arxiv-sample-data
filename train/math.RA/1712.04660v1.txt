In this paper, we introduce and study the notion of cointegrals in a weak multiplier Hopf algebras (A, \Delta).   A cointegral is a non-zero element h in the multiplier algebra M(A) such that ah=\v_t(a)h for any a\in A. When A has a faithful set of cointegrals (now we call A of {\it discrete type}), we give a sufficient and necessary condition for existence of integrals on A. Then we consider a special case, i.e., A has a single faithful cointegral, and we obtain more better results, such as A is Frobenius, quasi-Frobenius, et al. Moreover when an algebraic quantum groupoid A has a faithful cointegral, then the dual \widehat{A} must be weak Hopf algebra. In the end, we investigate when A has a cointegral and study relation between compact and discrete type.
