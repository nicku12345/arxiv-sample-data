Let KG be the group algebra of a torsion group G over a field K. We show that if the units of KG satisfy a Laurent polynomial identity which is not satisfied by the units of the relative free algebra K[\alpha,\beta : \alpha^2=\beta^2=0] then KG satisfies a polynomial identity. This extends Hartley Conjecture which states that if the units of KG satisfies a group identity then KG satisfies a polynomial identity. As an application of our results we prove that if the units of KG satisfies a Laurent polynomial identity with a support of cardinality at most 3 then KG satisfies a polynomial identity.
