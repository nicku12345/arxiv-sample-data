The notion of double Lie algebroid was defined by M. Van den Bergh and was illustrated by the double quasi Poisson case. We give new examples of double Lie algebroids and develop a differential calculus in that context. We recover the non commutative de Rham complex and the double Poisson-Lichnerowicz cohomology (Pichereau-vanWeyer) as particular cases of our construction.
