Let n be a positive integer. For each 0\leq j \leq n-1 we let C_n^j denote the Cayley graph of the cyclic group \mathbb{Z}_n with respect to the subset \{1,j\}. Utilizing the Smith Normal Form process, we give an explicit description of the Grothendieck group of each of the Leavitt path algebras L_K(C_n^j) for any field K. Our general method significantly streamlines the approach that was used in previous work to establish this description in the specific case j=2. Along the way, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the pairs (j,n) which yield that this group is infinite. We subsequently focus on the case j = 3, where the structure of this group turns out to be related to a Fibonacci-like sequence, called the Narayana's Cows sequence.
