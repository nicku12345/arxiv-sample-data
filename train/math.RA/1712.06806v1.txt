We classify finite irreducible conformal modules over a class of infinite Lie conformal algebras {\frak {B}}(p) of Block type, where p is a nonzero complex number. In particular, we obtain that a finite irreducible conformal module over {\frak {B}}(p) may be a nontrivial extension of a finite conformal module over {\frak {Vir}} if p=-1, where {\frak {Vir}} is a Virasoro conformal subalgebra of {\frak {B}}(p). As a byproduct, we also obtain the classification of finite irreducible conformal modules over a series of finite Lie conformal algebras {\frak b}(n) for n\ge1.
