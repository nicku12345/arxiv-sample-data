For a,b\in \mathbb{C}, the Lie algebra \mathcal{W}(a,b) is the semidirect product of the Witt algebra and a module of the intermediate series. In this paper, all biderivations of \mathcal{W}(a,b) are determined. Surprisingly, these Lie algebras have symmetric (and skewsymmetric) non-inner biderivations. As an applications, commutative post-Lie algebra structures on \mathcal{W}(a,b) are obtained.
