An interval matrix is a matrix whose entries are intervals in the set of real numbers. Let p , q  be nonzero natural numbers and let \mu =( [m_{i,j}, M_{i,j}])_{i,j} be a p \times q interval matrix; given a p \times q matrix A with entries in the set of real numbers, we say that  A \in \mu  if a_{i,j} \in [m_{i,j}, M_{i,j}]  for any i,j. We establish a criterion to say if an interval matrix contains a matrix of rank 1. Moreover we determine the maximum rank of the matrices contained in a given interval matrix. Finally, for any interval matrix \mu with no more than 3 columns, we describe a way to find the range of the ranks of the matrices contained in \mu.
