A ring R with center C is said to be \textit{centrally essential} if the module R_C is an essential extension of the module C_C. In the paper, we study groups whose group algebras over fields are centrally essential rings. We focus on the centrally essential modular group algebras of finite groups over fields of nonzero characteristic.
