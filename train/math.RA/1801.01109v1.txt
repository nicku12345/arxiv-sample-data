Let L be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic different from 2. If L is perfect and centerless, then every skew-symmetric biderivation \delta:L\times L\to L is of the form \delta(x,y)=\gamma([x,y]) for all x,y\in L, where \gamma\in{\rm Cent}(L), the centroid of L. Under a milder assumption that [c,[L,L]]=\{0\} implies c=0, every commuting linear map from L to L lies in {\rm Cent}(L). These two results are special cases of our main theorems which concern biderivations and commuting linear maps having their ranges in an L-module. We provide a variety of examples, some of them showing the necessity of our assumptions and some of them showing that our results cover several results from the literature.
