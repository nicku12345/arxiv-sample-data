The class of generalized Lie-type color algebras contains the ones of generalized Lie-type algebras, of n-Lie algebras and superalgebras, commutative Leibniz n-ary algebras and superalgebras, among others. We focus on the class of generalized Lie-type color algebras \frak L admitting a quasi-multiplicative basis, with restrictions neither on the dimensions nor on the base field \mathbb F and study its structure. If we write \frak L = \mathbb V \oplus \mathbb W with \mathbb V and 0 \neq \mathbb W linear subspaces, we say that a basis of homogeneous elements \mathfrak{B} = \{e_i\}_{i \in I} of \mathbb W is quasi-multiplicative if given 0 < k < n, for i_1,\dots,i_k \in I and \sigma \in \mathbb S_n satisfies \langle e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_k}, \mathbb V, \dots, \mathbb V \rangle_{\sigma} \subset \mathbb{F}e_{j_{\sigma}} for some j_{\sigma} \in I; the product of elements of the basis \langle e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n} \rangle belongs to \mathbb{F}e_j for some j \in I or to \mathbb V, and a similar condition is verified for the product \langle \mathbb V, \dots,\mathbb V \rangle. We state that if \frak L admits a quasi-multiplicative basis then it decomposes as \mathfrak{L} ={\mathcal U} \oplus (\sum\limits {\frak J}_{k}) with any {\frak J}_k a well described color gLt-ideal of \frak L admitting also a quasi-multiplicative basis, and {\mathcal U} a linear subspace of \mathbb V.   Also the minimality of \frak L is characterized in terms of the connections and it is shown that the above direct sum is by means of the family of its minimal color gLt-ideals, admitting each one a \mu-quasi-multiplicative basis inherited by the one of \frak L.
