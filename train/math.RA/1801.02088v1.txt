We begin by introducing an algebraic structure with three constants and one ternary operation to which we call mobi algebra. This structure has been designed to capture the most relevant properties of the unit interval that are needed in the study of geodesic paths. Another algebraic structure, called involutive medial monoid (IMM), can be derived from a mobi algebra. We prove several results on the interplay between mobi algebras, IMM algebras and unitary rings. It turns out that every unitary ring with one half uniquely determines and is uniquely determined by a mobi algebra with one double. This paper is the second of a planned series of papers dedicated to the study of geodesic paths from an algebraic point of view.
