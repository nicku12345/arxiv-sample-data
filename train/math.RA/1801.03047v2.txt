A quadratic Lie algebra is a Lie algebra endowed with a symmetric, invariant and non degenerate bilinear form; such a bilinear form is called an invariant metric. The aim of this work is to describe the general structure of those central extensions of quadratic Lie algebras which in turn have invariantmetrics. The structure is such that the central extensions can be described algebraically in terms of the original quadratic Lie algebra, and geometrically in terms of the direct sum decompositions that the invariant metrics involvedgive rise to.
