In this paper, first we prove that all finite dimensional special Heisenberg Lie superalgebras with even center have same dimension, say (2m+1\mid n) for some non-negative integers m,n and are isomorphism with them. Further, for a nilpotent Lie superalgebra L of dimension (m\mid n) and \dim (L') = (r\mid s) with r+s \geq 1, we find the upper bound \dim \mathcal{M}(L)\leq \frac{1}{2}\left[(m + n + r + s - 2)(m + n - r -s -1) \right] + n + 1, where \mathcal{M}(L) denotes the Schur multiplier of L. Moreover, if (r, s) =(1, 0)\; (\mathrm{respectively}\; (r,s) = (0,1)), then the equality holds if and only if L \cong H(1,0) \oplus A_{1}\; (\mathrm{respectively}\; H(0,1) \oplus A_{2}), where A_{1} and A_{2} are abelian Lie superalgebras with \dim A_{1}=(m-3 \mid n), \dim A_{2}=(m-1 \mid n-1) and H(1,0), H(0,1) are special Heisenberg Lie superalgebras of dimension 3 and 2 respectively.
