Let n be an arbitrary natural number. The class of (strongly) n-torsion clean rings is introduced and investigated. Abelian n-torsion clean rings are somewhat characterized and a complete characterization of strongly n-torsion clean rings is given in the case when n is odd. Some open questions are posed at the end.
