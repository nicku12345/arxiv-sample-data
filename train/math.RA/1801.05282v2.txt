We study the smallest, as well as the largest numbers of congruences of lattices of an arbitrary finite cardinality n. Continuing the work of Freese and Cz\' edli, we prove that the third, fourth and fifth largest numbers of congruences of an n--element lattice are: 5\cdot 2^{n-5} if n\geq 5, respectively 2^{n-3} and 7\cdot 2^{n-6} if n\geq 6. We also determine the structures of the n--element lattices having 5\cdot 2^{n-5}, respectively 2^{n-3} congruences, along with the structures of their congruence lattices.
