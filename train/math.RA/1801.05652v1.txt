We study post-Lie algebra structures on (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n}) for nilpotent Lie algebras. First we show that if \mathfrak{g} is nilpotent such that H^0(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n})=0, then also \mathfrak{n} must be nilpotent, of bounded class. For post-Lie algebra structures x\cdot y on pairs of 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n}) we give necessary and sufficient conditions such that x\circ y=\frac{1}{2}(x\cdot y+y\cdot x) defines a CPA-structure on \mathfrak{g}, or on \mathfrak{n}. As a corollary we obtain that every LR-structure on a Heisenberg Lie algebra of dimension n\ge 5 is complete. Finally we classify all post-Lie algebra structures on (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n}) for \mathfrak{g}\cong \mathfrak{n}\cong \mathfrak{n}_3, where \mathfrak{n}_3 is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra.
