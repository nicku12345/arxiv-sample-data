From the definition and properties of unital hom-associative algebras, and the use of the Kaplansky's constructions, we develop new algebraic structures called 2-hom-associative bialgebras, 2-hom-bialgebras, and 2-2-hom-bialgebras. Besides, we devise a construction of hom-left symmetric dialgebras and discuss their main relevant properties.
