In 2016, Y\"uce and Torunbalc\i\ Ayd\i n \cite{Yuc-Tor} defined dual Fibonacci quaternions. In this paper, we defined the dual third-order Jacobsthal quaternions and dual third-order Jacobsthal-Lucas quaternions. Also, we investigated the relations between the dual third-order Jacobsthal quaternions and third-order Jacobsthal numbers. Furthermore, we gave some their quadratic properties, the summations, the Binet's formulas and Cassini-like identities for these quaternions.
