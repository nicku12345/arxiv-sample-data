In a paper on the taxonomy of 2-primal rings, examples of various types of rings that are related to commutativity such as reduced, symmetric, duo, reversible and PS~I were given in order to show that the ring class inclusions were strict. Many of the rings given in the examples were infinite. In this paper, where possible, examples of minimal finite rings of the various types are given. Along with the rings in the previous taxonomy, NI, abelian and reflexive rings are also included.
