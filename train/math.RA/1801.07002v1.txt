Some connections between quadratic forms over the field of two elements, Clifford algebras of quadratic forms over the real numbers, real graded division algebras, and twisted group algebras will be highlighted. This allows to revisit real Clifford algebras in terms of the Arf invariant of the associated quadratic forms over the field of two elements, and give new proofs of some classical results.
