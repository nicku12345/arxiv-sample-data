We prove that all Rota---Baxter operators on a quadratic division algebra are trivial. For nonzero weight, we state that all Rota---Baxter operators on the simple odd-dimensional Jordan algebra of bilinear form are projections on a subalgebra along another one. For weight zero, we find a connection between the Rota---Baxter operators and the solutions to the alternative Yang---Baxter equation on the Cayley---Dickson algebra. We also investigate the Rota---Baxter operators on the matrix algebras of order two, the Grassmann algebra of plane, and the Kaplansky superalgebra.
