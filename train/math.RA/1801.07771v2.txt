We study relatively free associative algebras F^{(n)}_r of ranks r=2,3 with the identity [x_1,\dots, x_n]=0 of Lie nilpotency of step n\geqslant 3 over a field K of characteristic \neq 2,3. First we prove a Theorem on the inclusion  T^{(m)}T^{(n)}\subseteq T^{(m+n-1)} for an associative algebra A of rank 3, where T^{(n)}=T^{(n)}(A) is a T-ideal of A generated by the commutator [x_1,\dots, x_n]; the restriction on rank is essential. Further, we describe 3-variable identities of the algebra F^{(n)}. In particular, the obtained description implies that Z(F^{(n)}_r)=(T^{(n-1)}+Z_q)(F^{(n)}_r), where p=\mathrm{char}(K)\geqslant 5 and q is a least power of p such that q\geqslant n-1 and Z_q is a T-space generated by x^q. We also prove the equality Z(F^{(n)}_2)=F^{(n)}_2\cap Z(F^{(n)}). Finally, we obtain certain generalizations and refinements of some results by A. V. Grishin and V. V. Shchigolev, respectively. For example, we prove that a unital algebra F^{(n)}_2 (n\geqslant 4) over a field K of characteristic p\geqslant n possesses a finite strictly descending "composition" series of T-ideals T^{(3)}=T_1\supset T_2\supset \dots \supset T_k\supset T_{k+1}=0 such that each quotient T_i/T_{i+1} does not contain any proper T-spaces.   Key words: Lie nilpotency identity, center, kernel, proper polynomial, 3-variable identity, T-space.
