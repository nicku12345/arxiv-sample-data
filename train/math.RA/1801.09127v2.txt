In this paper, we mainly investigate the \mathfrak{X}-Gorenstein projective dimension of modules and the (left) \mathfrak{X}-Gorenstein global dimension of rings. Some properties of \mathfrak{X}-Gorenstein projective dimensions are obtained. Furthermore, we prove that the (left) \mathfrak{X}-Gorenstein global dimension of ring R is equal to the supremum of the set of \mathfrak{X}-Gorenstein projective dimensions of all cyclic (left) R-modules. This result extends the well-known Auslander's theorem on the global dimension and its Gorenstein homological version.
