We outline the proof of a conjecture of Kontsevich on the isomorphism between the group of polynomial symplectomorphisms in 2n variables and the group of automorphisms of the n-th Weyl algebra over complex numbers. Our proof uses lifting of polynomial symplectomorphisms to Weyl algebra automorphisms by means of approximation by tame symplectomorphisms and gauging of the lifted morphism. Approximation by tame symplectomorphisms is the symplectic version of the well-known theorem of D. Anick and is a result of our prior work.
