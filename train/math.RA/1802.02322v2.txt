For a p-adic curve X, we study conditions under which all classes in the n-torsion of Br(X) are \mathbb{Z}/n-cyclic. We show that in general not all classes are \mathbb{Z}/n-cyclic classes. On the other hand, if X has good reduction and n is prime to p, of if X is an elliptic curve over \mathbb{Q}_p with split multiplicative reduction and n is a power of p, then we prove that all order n elements of Br(X) are \mathbb{Z}/n-cyclic. Finally, if X has good reduction and its function field K(X) contains all p^2-th roots of 1, we show the existence of indecomposable division algebras over K(X) with period p^2 and index p^3.
