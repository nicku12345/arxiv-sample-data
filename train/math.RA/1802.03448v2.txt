Let L/K be a Galois extension of fields with Galois group \Gamma, and suppose L/K is also an H-Hopf Galois extension. Using the recently uncovered connection between Hopf Galois structures and skew left braces, we introduce a method to quantify the failure of surjectivity of the Galois correspondence from subHopf algebras of H to intermediate subfields of L/K, given by the Fundamental Theorem of Hopf Galois Theory. Suppose L \otimes_K H = LN where N \cong (G, \star). Then there exists a skew left brace (G, \star, \circ) where (G, \circ) \cong \Gamma. We show that there is a bijective correspondence between intermediate fields E between K and L and certain sub-skew left braces of G, which we call the \circ-stable subgroups of (G, \star). Counting these subgroups and comparing that number with the number of subgroups of \Gamma \cong (G, \circ) describes how far the Galois correspondence for the H-Hopf Galois structure is from being surjective. The method is illustrated by a variety of examples.
