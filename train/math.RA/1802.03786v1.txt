In a Dedekind domain D, every non-zero proper ideal A factors as a product A=P_1^{t_1}\cdots P_k^{t_k} of powers of distinct prime ideals P_i. For a Dedekind domain D, the D-modules D/P_i^{t_i} are uniserial. We extend this property studying suitable factorizations A=A_1\dots A_n of a right ideal A of an arbitrary ring R as a product of proper right ideals A_1,\dots,A_n with all the modules R/A_i uniserial modules. When such factorizations exist, they are unique up to the order of the factors. Serial factorizations turn out to have connections with the theory of h-local Pr\"ufer domains and that of semirigid commutative GCD domains.
