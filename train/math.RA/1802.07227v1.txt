Every reduced ring R has a natural partial order defined by a\le b if a^2=ab; it generalizes the natural order on a boolean ring. The article examines when R is a lower semi-lattice in this order with examples drawn from weakly Baer rings (pp-rings) and rings of continuous functions. Locally connected spaces and basically disconnected spaces give rings C(X) which are such lower semi-lattices. Liftings of countable orthogonal (in this order) sets over surjective ring homomorphisms are studied.
