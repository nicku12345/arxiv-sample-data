In this paper we show that for a Koszul Calabi-Yau algebra, there is a shifted bi-symplectic structure in the sense of Crawley-Boevey-Etingof-Ginzburg, on the cobar construction of its co-unitalized Koszul dual coalgebra, and hence its DG representation schemes, in the sense of Berest-Khachatryan-Ramadoss, have a shifted symplectic structure in the sense of Pantev-To\"en-Vaqui\'e-Vezzosi.
