A Com-PreLie bialgebra is a commutative bialgebra with an extra preLie product satisfying some compatibilities with the product and the coproduct. We here give examples of cofree Com-PreLie bialgebras, including all the ones such that the preLie product is homogeneous of degree \ge --1. We also give a graphical description of free unitary Com-PreLie algebras, explicit their canonical bialgebra structure and exhibit with the help of a rigidity theorem certain cofree quotients, including the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of rooted trees. We finally prove that the dual of these bialgebras are also enveloping algebras of preLie algebras, combinatorially described.
