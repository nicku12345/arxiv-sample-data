In a paper by E. Dieterich 2017, the category \mathscr{C}(k) of four-dimensional unital division algebras, whose right nucleus is non-trivial and whose automorphism group contains Klein's four group V, is studied over a general ground field k with \mathrm{char}\,k\neq 2. In particular, the objects in \mathscr{C}(k) are exhaustively constructed from parameters in k^3 and explicit isomorphism conditions for the constructed objects are found in terms of these parameters.   In this paper, we specialize to the case k=\mathbb{Q} and present results towards a classification of \mathscr{C}(\mathbb{Q}). In particular, for each field \ell with [\ell:k]=2 we present explicity a two-parameter family of pairwise non-isomorphic non-associative objects in \mathscr{C}(\mathbb{Q}) that admit \ell as a subfield and we provide a method for classifying the full subcategory of central skew fields admitting \ell as a subfield and kV-submodule. We also classify the subcategory of \mathscr{C}(\mathbb{Q}) of all four-dimensional Galois extensions of \mathbb{Q} with Galois group V that admit \ell as a subfield.
