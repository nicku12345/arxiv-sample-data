We give necessary conditions for the existence of degenerations between two complex Lie superalgebras of dimension (m,n). As an application, we study the variety \mathcal{LS}^{(2,2)} of complex Lie superalgebras of dimension (2,2). First we give the algebraic classification and then obtain that \mathcal{LS}^{(2,2)} is the union of seven irreducible components, three of which are the Zariski closures of rigid Lie superalgebras. As byproduct, we obtain an example of a nilpotent rigid Lie superalgebra, in contrast to the classical case where no example is known.
