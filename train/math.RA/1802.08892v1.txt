Let \mathbb V be an arbitrary linear space and f:\mathbb V \times \ldots \times \mathbb V \to \mathbb V an n-linear map. It is proved that, for each choice of a basis {\mathcal B} of \mathbb V, the n-linear map f induces a (nontrivial) decomposition \mathbb V= \oplus V_j as a direct sum of linear subspaces of \mathbb V, with respect to {\mathcal B}. It is shown that this decomposition is f-orthogonal in the sense that f(\mathbb V, \ldots, V_j, \ldots, V_k, \ldots, \mathbb V) =0 when j \neq k, and in such a way that any V_j is strongly f-invariant, meaning that f(\mathbb V, \ldots, V_j, \ldots, \mathbb V) \subset V_j. A sufficient condition for two different decompositions of \mathbb V induced by an n-linear map f, with respect to two different bases of \mathbb V, being isomorphic is deduced. The f-simplicity -- an analogue of the usual simplicity in the framework of n-liner maps -- of any linear subspace V_j of a certain decomposition induced by f is characterized. Finally, an application to the structure theory of arbitrary n-ary algebras is provided. This work is a close generalization the results obtained by A. J. Calder\'on (2018).
