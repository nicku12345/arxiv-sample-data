The notion of a noncommutative quasi-resolution is introduced for a noncommutative noetherian algebra with singularities, even for a non-Cohen-Macaulay algebra. If A is a commutative normal Gorenstein domain, then anoncommutative quasi-resolution of A naturally produces a noncommutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of A in the sense of Van den Bergh, and vice versa. Under some mild hypotheses, we prove that (i) in dimension two, all noncommutative quasi-resolutions of a given non-commutative algebra are Morita equivalent, and (ii) in dimension three, all noncommutative quasi-resolutions of a given non-commutative algebra are derived equivalent. These assertions generalize important results of Van den Bergh, Iyama-Reiten and Iyama-Wemyss in the commutative and central-finite cases.
