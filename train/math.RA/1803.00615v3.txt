For a sequence of the naturally graded quasi-filiform Leibniz algebra of second type \mathcal{L}^2 introduced by Camacho, G\'{o}mez, Gonz\'{a}lez and Omirov, all possible right and left solvable indecomposable extensions over the field \Bbb R are constructed so that the algebra serves as the nilradical of the corresponding solvable Leibniz algebras we find in the paper.
