Let R be an integral domain of characteristic zero. We prove that a function D\colon R\to R is a derivation of order n if and only if D belongs to the closure of the set of differential operators of degree n in the product topology of R^R, where the image space is endowed with the discrete topology. In other words, f is a derivation of order n if and only if, for every finite set F\subset R, there is a differential operator D of degree n such that f=D on F. We also prove that if d_1, \dots, d_n are nonzero derivations on R, then d_1 \circ \ldots \circ d_n is a derivation of exact order n.
