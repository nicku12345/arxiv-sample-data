We extend the classical notion of standardly stratified k-algebra (stated for finite dimensional k-algebras) to the more general class of rings, possibly without 1, with enough idempotents. We show that many of the fundamental results, which are known for classical standardly stratified algebras, can be generalized to this context. Furthermore, new classes of rings appear as: ideally standardly stratified and ideally quasi-hereditary. In the classical theory, it is known that quasi-hereditary and ideally quasi-hereditary algebras are equivalent notions, but in our general setting this is no longer true. To develop the theory, we use the well known connection between rings with enough idempotents and skeletally small categories (ringoids or rings with several objects).
