The aim of this paper is to introduce the notion of restricted Hom- Lie superalgebras. This class of algebras is a generalization of both restricted Hom-Lie algebras and restricted Lie superalgebras. In this paper, we present a way to obtain restricted Hom-Lie superalgebras from the classical restricted Lie superalgebras along with algebra en- domorphisms. Homomorphisms relations between restricted Hom-Lie superalgebras are defined and studied. Also, we obtain some proper- ties of p-maps and restrictable Hom-Lie superalgebras.
