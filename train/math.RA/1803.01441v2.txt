In the recent definition of Hom-Hopf algebras the antipode S is the relative Hominverse of the identity map with respect to the convolution product. We observe that some fundamental properties of the antipode of Hopf algebras and Hom-Hopf algebras, with the original definition, do not hold generally in the new setting. We show that the antipode is a relative Hom-anti algebra and a relative anti-coalgebra morphism. It is also relative Hom-unital, and relative Hom-counital. Furthermore if the twisting maps of multiplications and comultiplications are invertible then S is an anti-algebra and an anti-coalgebra map. We show that any Hom-bialgebra map between two Hom-Hopf algebras is a relative Hom-morphism of Hom-Hopf alegbras. Specially if the corresponding twisting maps are all invertible then it is a Hom-Hopf algebra map. If the Hom-Hopf algebra is commutative or cocommutative we observe that S^2 is equal to the identity map in some sense. At the end we study the images of primitive and group-like elements under the antipode.
