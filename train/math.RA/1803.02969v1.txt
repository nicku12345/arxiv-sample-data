Assume that a basic algebra A over an algebraically closed field \Bbbk with a basic set A_0 of primitive idempotents has the property that eAe=\Bbbk for all e \in A_0. Let n be a nonzero integer, and \phi and \psi two automorphisms of the repetitive category \hat{A} of A with jump n (namely, they send A^{[0]} to A^{[n]}, where A^{[i]} is the i-th copy of A in \hat{A} for all i \in \mathbb{Z}). If \phi and \psi coincide on the objects and if there exists a map \rho \colon A_0 \to \Bbbk such that \rho_0(y)\phi_0(a)=\psi_0(a)\rho _0(x) for all morphisms a\in A(x,y), then the orbit categories \hat{A}/\langle \phi \rangle and \hat{A}/\langle \psi \rangle are isomorphic as \mathbb{Z}-graded categories.
