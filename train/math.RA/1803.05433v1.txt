A general closed interval matrix is a matrix whose entries are closed connected nonempty subsets of the set of the real numbers, while an interval matrix is defined to be a matrix whose entries are closed bounded nonempty intervals in the set of real numbers. We say that a matrix A with constant entries is contained in a general closed interval matrix \mu if and only if, for every i,j, we have that A_{i,j} \in \mu_{i,j}. Rhon characterized full-rank square interval matrices, that is, square interval matrices \mu such that every constant matrix contained in \mu is nonsingular. In this paper we generalize this result to general closed interval matrices.
