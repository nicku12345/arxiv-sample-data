In this paper we initiate the study of the total zero-divisor graphs over commutative rings with unity. These graphs are constructed by both relations that arise from the zero-divisor graph and from the total graph of a ring. We characterize Artinian rings with the connected total zero-divisor graphs and give their diameters. Moreover, we compute major characteristics of the total zero-divisor graphs of the ring {\mathbb Z}_m of integers modulo m and prove that the total zero-divisor graphs of {\mathbb Z}_m and {\mathbb Z}_n are isomorphic if and only if m=n.
