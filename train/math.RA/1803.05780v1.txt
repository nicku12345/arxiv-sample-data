We define new generalized factorials in several variables over an arbitrary subset \underline{S} \subseteq R^n, where R is a Dedekind domain and n is a positive integer. We then study the properties of the fixed divisor d(\underline{S},f) of a multivariate polynomial f \in R[x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n]. We generalize the results of Polya, Bhargava, Gunji & McQuillan and strengthen that of Evrard, all of which relate the fixed divisor to generalized factorials of \underline{S}. We also express d(\underline{S},f) in terms of the images f(\underline{a}) of finitely many elements \underline{a} \in R^n, generalizing a result of Hensel, and in terms of the coefficients of f under explicit bases.
