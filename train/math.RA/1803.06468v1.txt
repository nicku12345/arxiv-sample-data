A ring R is a strongly 2-nil-clean if every element in R is the sum of two idempotents and a nilpotent that commute. A ring R is feebly clean if every element in R is the sum of two orthogonal idempotents and a unit. In this paper, strongly 2-nil-clean rings are studied with an emphasis on their relations with feebly clean rings. This work shows new interesting connections between strongly 2-nil-clean rings and weakly exchange rings
