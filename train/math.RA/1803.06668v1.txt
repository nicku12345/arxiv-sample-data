We show that in the class of solvable Lie algebras there exist algebras which admit local derivations which are not ordinary derivation and also algebras for which every local derivation is a derivation. We found necessary and sufficient conditions under which any local derivation of solvable Lie algebras with abelian nilradical and one-dimensional complementary space is a derivation. Moreover, we prove that every local derivation on a finite-dimensional solvable Lie algebra with model nilradical and maximal dimension of complementary space is a derivation.
