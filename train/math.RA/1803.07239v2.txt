For a multiplier Hopf algebra pairing \langle A, B\rangle, we construct a class of group-cograded multiplier Hopf algebras D(A, B), generalizing the classical construction of finite dimensional Hopf algebras introduced by Panaite and Staic Mihai. Furthermore, if the multiplier Hopf algebra pairing admits a canonical multiplier in M(B\otimes A) we show the existence of quasitriangular structure on D(A, B). As an application, some special cases and examples are provided.
