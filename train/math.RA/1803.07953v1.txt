In this article, left {g, h}-derivation and Jordan left {g, h}-derivation on algebras are introduced. It is shown that there is no Jordan left {g, h}-derivation over \mathcal{M}_n(C) and \mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{R}}, for g not equal to h. Examples are given which show that every Jordan left \{g, h\}-derivation over \mathcal{T}_n(C), \mathcal{M}_n(C) and \mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{R}} are not left \{g, h\}-derivations. Moreover, we characterize left \{g, h\}-derivation and Jordan left \{g, h\}-derivation over \mathcal{T}_n(C), \mathcal{M}_n(C) and \mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{R}} respectively. Also, we prove the result of Jordan left \{g, h\}-derivation to be a left \{g, h\}-derivation over tensor products of algebras as well as for algebra of polynomials.
