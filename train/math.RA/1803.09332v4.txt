This is the last in a series of three notes on an investigation into core regular double Stone algebras, CRDSA, which are meant to be read in order. This note ends our initial investigation of duality for CRDSA through bi-topological spaces. More succinctly, duality through refinement of a pre-established duality of pairwise Stone spaces and bounded distributive lattices. In this note we show that the pairwise Stone derived from a CRDSA L has a base that is a CRDSA isomorphic to L. For the purposes of this note only we will call any such pairwise zero-dimensional space a core regular double pairwise zero-dimensional space and similarly for the corresponding pairwise Stone spaces. Then we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a bi-continuous map to have an inverse that is a CRDSA homomorphism. These results are topologically indactive of just how "nearly Boolean" CRDSA are, these inverses must respect the appropriate conditions on the boundary of non-clopen elements of the bases of the bi-topological space. From that result we validate our earlier claim that the category of core regular double Stone algebras is dually equivalent to the category of core regular double pairwise Stone spaces. We note that the conditions for this duality should be able to be easily relaxed to yield a duality for a less rigid subclass of bounded distributive lattices than CRDSA, bounded distributive pseudo-complemented lattices for example.
