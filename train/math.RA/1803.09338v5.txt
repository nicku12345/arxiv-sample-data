This is the second in a series of three notes on an investigation into core regular double Stone algebras, CRDSA, which are meant to be read in order. This note begins our investigation of duality for CRDSA through bi-topological spaces. More succinctly, duality through refinement of a pre- established duality of pairwise Stone spaces and bounded distributive lattices. In this note we establish necessary and sufficient conditions on a pairwise zero-dimensional space such that it will have a core regular double Stone algebra base. We note that these conditions can easily be relaxed to that which is necessary for a pairwise zero-dimensional space to have a base that is not as rigid as a CRDSA such as bounded distributive-pseudo complemented lattices for example. Furthermore, these conditions give a topological representation indicative of just how "nearly Boolean" CRDSA are, the closure of non-clopen/complemented base elements are clopen/complemented base elements. For the purposes of this note only we will call any pairwise zero-dimensional space with a core regular double Stone algebra base a core regular double pairwise zero-dimensional space. From that result we gain confidence to claim that the category of core regular double Stone algebras is dually equivalent to what we refer to in this note as the category of core regular double pairwise Stone spaces. We validate this claim in the next note, Exploring Core Regular Double Stone Algebras, CRDSA, III. Establishing Duality.
