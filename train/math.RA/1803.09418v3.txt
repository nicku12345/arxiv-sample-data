We study (\sigma,\tau)-derivations of a group ring RG of a finite group G over an integral domain R with 1. As an application we extend a well known result on derivation of an integral group ring \Bbb{Z}G to (\sigma,\tau)-derivation on it for a finite group G with some conditions on \sigma and \tau. In the process of the extension, a generalization of an application of Skolem-Noether Theorem to derivation on a finite dimensional central simple algebra has also been given for the (\sigma,\tau)-derivation case.
