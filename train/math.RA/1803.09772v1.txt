Let \mathbb F be a field \mathbb F  of characteristic zero. Let W_{n}(\mathbb F) be the Lie algebra of all \mathbb F-derivations with the Lie bracket [D_1, D_2]:=D_1D_2-D_2D_1 on the polynomial ring \mathbb F [x_1, \ldots , x_n]. The problem of classifying finite dimensional subalgebras of W_{n}(\mathbb F) was solved if  n\leq 2 and \mathbb F=\mathbb C or \mathbb F=\mathbb R. We prove that this problem is wild if n\geq 4, which means that it contains the classical unsolved problem of classifying matrix pairs up to similarity. The structure of finite dimensional subalgebras of W_{n}(\mathbb F) is interesting since each derivation in case \mathbb F=\mathbb R can be considered as a vector field with polynomial coefficients on the manifold \mathbb R^{n}.
