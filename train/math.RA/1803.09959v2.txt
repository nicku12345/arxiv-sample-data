The classification of gradings by abelian groups on finite direct sums of simple finite-dimensional nonassociative algebras over an algebraically closed field is reduced, by means of the use of loop algebras, to the corresponding problem for simple algebras. This requires a good definition of (free) products of group-gradings.
