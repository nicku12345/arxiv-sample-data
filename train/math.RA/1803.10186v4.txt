In this paper, we investigate the weighted core-EP inverse introduced by Ferreyra, Levis and Thome. Several computational representations of the weighted core-EP inverse are obtained in terms of singular-value decomposition, full-rank decomposition and QR decomposition. These representations are expressed in terms of various matrix powers as well as matrix product involving the core-EP inverse, Moore-Penrose inverse and usual matrix inverse. Finally, those representations involving only Moore-Penrose inverse are compared and analyzed via computational complexity and numerical examples.
