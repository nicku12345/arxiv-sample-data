In this paper, bimodules over Hom-Jordan algebras and the ones over Hom-alternative algebras are defined. It is shown that bimodules over Jordan and alternative algebras are twisted into bimodules over Hom-Jordan and Hom-alternative algebras via endomorphisms respectively. Some relations between bimodules over Hom-associative, Hom-Jordan and Hom-alternative algebras, are given.
