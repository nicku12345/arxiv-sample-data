Which matrices can be written as sums or products of square-zero matrices? This question is the central premise of this dissertation. Over the past 25 years a significant body of research on products and linear combinations of square-zero matrices has developed, and it is the aim of this study to present this body of research in a consolidated, holistic format, that could serve as a theoretical introduction to the subject. The content of the research is presented in three parts: first results within the broader context of sums and products of nilpotent matrices are discussed, then products of square-zero matrices, and finally sums of square-zero matrices.
