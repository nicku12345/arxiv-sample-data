Many theorems and formulas of Lie algebras run quite parallel to Lie superalgebra case, sometimes giving interesting results. So it is quite natural to extend the new concepts of Lie algebra immediately to Lie superalgebra case, as these type of algebras have wide applications in physics and related theories. Using the concept of isoclinism, F. Saeedi and S. Sheikh-Mohseni recently studied the central derivation of nilpotent Lie algebra with nilindex 2. The purpose of the present paper is to continue and extend the investigation to obtain some similar results for Lie superalgebras, as isoclinism in Lie superalgebra is being recently introduced.
