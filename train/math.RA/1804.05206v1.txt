In this paper, we present three limit representations of the core-EP inverse. The first approach is based on the full-rank decomposition of a given matrix. The second and third approaches, which depend on the explicit expression of the core-EP inverse, are established. The corresponding limit representations of the dual core-EP inverse are also given. In particular, limit representations of the core and dual core inverse are derived
