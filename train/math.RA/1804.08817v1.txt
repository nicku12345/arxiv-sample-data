Let \mathscr{C} be a category with an involution \ast. Suppose that \varphi : X \rightarrow X is a morphism and (\varphi_1, Z, \varphi_2) is an (epic, monic) factorization of \varphi through Z, then \varphi is core invertible if and only if (\varphi^{\ast})^2\varphi_1 and \varphi_2\varphi_1 are both left invertible if and only if ((\varphi^{\ast})^2\varphi_1, Z, \varphi_2), (\varphi_2^{\ast}, Z, \varphi_1^{\ast}\varphi^{\ast}\varphi) and (\varphi^{\ast}\varphi_2^{\ast}, Z, \varphi_1^{\ast}\varphi) are all essentially unique (epic, monic) factorizations of (\varphi^{\ast})^2\varphi through Z. We also give the corresponding result about dual core inverse. In addition, we give some characterizations about the coexistence of core inverse and dual core inverse of an R-morphism in the category of R-modules of a given ring R.
