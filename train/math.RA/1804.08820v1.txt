Let \mathscr{C} be an additive category with an involution \ast. Suppose that \varphi : X \rightarrow X is a morphism with kernel \kappa : K \rightarrow X in \mathscr{C}, then \varphi is core invertible if and only if \varphi has a cokernel \lambda: X \rightarrow L and both \kappa\lambda and \varphi^{\ast}\varphi^3+\kappa^{\ast}\kappa are invertible. In this case, we give the representation of the core inverse of \varphi. We also give the corresponding result about dual core inverse.
