We establish a criterion for a semigroup identity to hold in the monoid of n \times n upper unitriangular matrices with entries in a commutative semiring S. This criterion is combinatorial modulo the arithmetic of the multiplicative identity element of S. In the case where S is idempotent, the generated variety is the variety \mathbf{J_{n-1}}, which by a result of Volkov is generated by any one of: the monoid of unitriangular Boolean matrices, the monoid R_n of all reflexive relations on an n element set, or the Catalan monoid C_n. We propose S-matrix analogues of these latter two monoids in the case where S is an idempotent semiring whose multiplicative identity element is the `top' element with respect to the natural partial order on S, and show that each generates \mathbf{J_{n-1}}. As a consequence we obtain a complete solution to the finite basis problem for lossy gossip monoids.
