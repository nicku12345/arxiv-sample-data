In this paper, we are interested in the study of the existence of connections between partial groupoid actions and partial group actions. Precisely, we prove that there exists a datum connecting a partial action of a connected groupoid and a partial action of any of its isotropy groups. Furthermore, it will be proved that under a suitable condition the partial skew groupoid ring corresponding to a partial action by a connected groupoid is isomorphic to a specific partial skew group ring. We also present a Morita theory and a Galois theory related to these partial actions as well as considerations about the strictness of the corresponding Morita contexts. Semisimplicity, separability and Frobenius properties of the corresponding partial skew groupoid rings are also considered.
