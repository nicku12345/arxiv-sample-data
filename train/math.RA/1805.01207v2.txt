A hom-associative algebra is an algebra whose associativity is twisted by an algebra homomorphism. In this paper, we define a cup product on the cohomology of a hom-associative algebra. We show that the cup product together with the degree -1 graded Lie bracket (which controls the deformation of the hom-associative algebra structure) on the cohomology forms a Gerstenhaber algebra. This generalizes a classical fact that the Hochschild cohomology of an associative algebra carries a Gerstenhaber algebra structure.
