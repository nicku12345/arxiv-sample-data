Let \mathbf{A} be a finite nilpotent algebra in a congruence modular variety with finitely many fundamental operations. If \mathbf{A} is of prime power order, then it is known that there is a polynomial p such that for every n \in \mathbb{N}, every n-generated algebra in the variety generated by \mathbf{A} has at most 2^{p(n)} elements. We present a bound on the degree of this polynomial.
