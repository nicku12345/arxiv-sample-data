A differential graded (DG for short) free algebra \mathcal{A} is a connected cochain DG algebra such that its underlying graded algebra is \mathcal{A}^{\#}=\k\langle x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_n\rangle,\,\, \text{with}\,\, |x_i|=1,\,\, \forall i\in \{1,2,\cdots, n\}. We prove that the differential structures on DG free algebras are in one to one correspondence with the set of crisscross ordered n-tuples of n\times n matrixes. We also give a criterion to judge whether two DG free algebras are isomorphic.   As an application, we consider the case of n=2. Based on the isomorphism classification, we compute the cohomology graded algebras of non-trivial DG free algebras with 2 generators, and show that all those non-trivial DG free algebras are Koszul and Calabi-Yau.
