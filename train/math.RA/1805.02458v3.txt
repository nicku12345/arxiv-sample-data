Let \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \dots \Theta, \Psi, \dots R, S, T, \dots be variables for, respectively, congruences, tolerances and reflexive admissible relations. Let juxtaposition denote intersection. We show that if the identity \alpha(\beta \circ \Theta) \subseteq \alpha \beta \circ \alpha \Theta \circ \alpha \beta  holds in a variety \mathcal {V}, then \mathcal {V} has a majority term, equivalently, \mathcal {V} satisfies  \alpha (\beta \circ \gamma) \subseteq \alpha \beta \circ \alpha \gamma . The result is unexpected, since in the displayed identity we have one more factor on the right and, moreover, if we let \Theta be a congruence, we get a condition equivalent to 3-distributivity, which is well-known to be strictly weaker than the existence of a majority term. The above result is optimal in many senses, for example, we show that slight variations on the displayed identity, such as  R (S \circ \gamma) \subseteq R S \circ R \gamma \circ R S or R(S \circ T) \subseteq R S \circ RT \circ RT \circ RS hold in every 3-distributive variety. Similar identities are valid even in varieties with 2 Gumm terms, with no distributivity assumption. We also discuss relation identities in n-permutable varieties and present a few remarks about implication algebras.
