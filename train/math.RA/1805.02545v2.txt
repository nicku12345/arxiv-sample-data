Let \F denote a field and let V denote a vector space over \F with finite positive dimension. Consider a pair A,A^* of diagonalizable \F-linear maps on V, each of which acts on an eigenbasis for the other one in an irreducible tridiagonal fashion. Such a pair is called a Leonard pair. We consider the self-dual case in which there exists an automorphism of the endomorphism algebra of V that swaps A and A^*. Such an automorphism is unique, and called the duality A \leftrightarrow A^*. In the present paper we give a comprehensive description of this duality. In particular, we display an invertible \F-linear map T on V such that the map X \mapsto T X T^{-1} is the duality A \leftrightarrow A^*. We express T as a polynomial in A and A^*. We describe how T acts on 4 flags, 12 decompositions, and 24 bases for V.
