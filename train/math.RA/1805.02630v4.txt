We introduce a concept of an embedding of a quadratic space in an associative algebra. The general properties of such embeddings are analyzed by linking it to the Clifford algebra. Conversely, there isa simple description of the standard involution and the Spin groups in terms of the algebra in which the quadratic space is embedded.   Though Clifford Algebras have been studied in detail, they may not always be easy to work with. Sometimes it may be useful to switch to a more concrete embedding to study low dimensional Spin and Epin (or Elementary Spin) groups.
