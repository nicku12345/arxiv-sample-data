In a series of papers, we used full quivers as tools in describing PI-varieties of algebras and providing a complete proof of Belov's solution of Specht's problem for affine algebras over an arbitrary Noetherian ring. In this paper, utilizing ideas from that work, we give a full exposition of Belov's theorem that relatively free affine PI-algebras over an arbitrary field are representable. (Kemer proved the theorem over an infinite field.)
