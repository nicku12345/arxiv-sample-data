In this paper some characterizations of Hom-Leibniz superalgebras are given and some of their basic properties are found. These properties can be seen as a generalization of corresponding well-known properties of Hom-Leibniz algebras. Considering the Hom-Akivis superalgebra associated to a given Hom-Leibniz superalgebra, it is observed that the Hom-super Akivis identity leads to an additional property of Hom-Leibniz superalgebras, which in turn gives a necessary and sufficient condition for Hom-super Lie admissibility of Hom-Leibniz superalgebras. We show also that every (left) Hom-Leibniz superalgebra has a natural Hom-Lie-Yamaguti superalgebra structure.
