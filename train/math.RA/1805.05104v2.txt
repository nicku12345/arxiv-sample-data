Rota--Baxter operators R of weight 1 on \mathfrak{n} are in bijective correspondence to post-Lie algebra structures on pairs (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n}), where \mathfrak{n} is complete. We use such Rota--Baxter operators to study the existence and classification of post-Lie algebra structures on pairs of Lie algebras (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n}), where \mathfrak{n} is semisimple. We show that for semisimple \mathfrak{g} and \mathfrak{n}, with \mathfrak{g} or \mathfrak{n} simple, the existence of a post-Lie algebra structure on such a pair (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n}) implies that \mathfrak{g} and \mathfrak{n} are isomorphic, and hence both simple. If \mathfrak{n} is semisimple, but \mathfrak{g} is not, it becomes much harder to classify post-Lie algebra structures on (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n}), or even to determine the Lie algebras \mathfrak{g} which can arise. Here only the case \mathfrak{n}=\mathfrak{sl}_2(\Bbb{C}) was studied. In this paper we determine all Lie algebras \mathfrak{g} such that there exists a post-Lie algebra structure on (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n}) with \mathfrak{n}=\mathfrak{sl}_2(\Bbb{C})\oplus \mathfrak{sl}_2(\Bbb{C}).
