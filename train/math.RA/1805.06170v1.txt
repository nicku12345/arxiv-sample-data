In this paper we introduce the concept of n-Lie-isoclinism on non-Lie Leibniz algebras. Among the results obtained, we provide several characterizations of n-Lie-isoclinic classes of Leibniz algebras. Also, we provide a characterization of n-Lie-stem Leibniz algebras, and prove that every n-Lie-isoclinic class of Leibniz algebras contains a n-Lie-stem Leibniz algebra.
