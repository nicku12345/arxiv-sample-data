We study the structure of the Lie algebra \mathfrak{s}(n,\mathbb R) corresponding to the so-called stochastic Lie group \mathcal{S} (n,\mathbb R). We obtain the Levi decomposition of the Lie algebra, classify Levi factor and classify the representation of the factor in \mathbb{R}^n. We discuss isomorphism of \mathcal{S}(n,\mathbb R) with the group of invertible affine maps {\it Aff}(n-1,\mathbb R). We prove that \mathfrak s(n, \mathbb R) is generated by two generic elements.
