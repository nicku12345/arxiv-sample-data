We prove two approximations of the open problem of whether the adjoint group of a non-nilpotent nil ring can be finitely generated: We show that the adjoint group of a non-nilpotent Jacobson radical cannot be boundedly generated, and on the other hand construct a finitely generated, infinite dimensional nil algebra whose adjoint group is generated by elements of bounded torsion.
