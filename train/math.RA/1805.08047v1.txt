Let A be a nondegenerate dimer (or homotopy) algebra on a torus, and let Z be its center. Using cyclic contractions, we show the following are equivalent: A is noetherian; Z is noetherian; A is a noncommutative crepant resolution; each arrow of A is contained in a perfect matching whose complement supports a simple module; and the vertex corner rings e_iAe_i are pairwise isomorphic.
