In this paper, firstly we study the continuity of the core-EP inverse without explicit error bounds by virtue of two methods. One is the rank equality, followed from the classical generalized inverse. The other one is matrix decomposition. The continuity of the core inverse can be derived as a particular case. Secondly, we study perturbation bounds for the core-EP inverse under prescribed conditions. Perturbation bounds for the core inverse can be derived as a particular case. Also, as corollaries, the sufficient (and necessary) conditions for the continuity of the core-EP inverse are obtained. Thirdly, a numerical example is illustrated to compare the derived upper bounds. Finally, an application to semistable matrices is provided.
