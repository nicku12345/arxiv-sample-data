In this paper is devoted to nilpotent finite-dimensional evolution algebras E with dimE^2 = dimE-1. We described Lie algebras associated with evolution algebras whose nilindex is maximal. Moreover, in terms of this Lie algebra we fully construct nilpotent evolution algebra with maximal index of nilpotency. Furthermore, this result allowed us fully characterize all local and 2-local derivations of the considered evolution algebras. All automorphisms and local automorphisms of the nilpotent evolution algebras with maximal nilindex are found.
