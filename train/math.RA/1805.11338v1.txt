Let {\mathfrak g} be a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic 0. A linear map \varphi:{\mathfrak g}\to {\mathfrak g} is called a local automorphism if for every x in {\mathfrak g} there is an automorphism \varphi_x of {\mathfrak g} such that \varphi(x)=\varphi_x(x). We prove that a linear map \varphi:{\mathfrak g}\to {\mathfrak g} is local automorphism if and only if it is an automorphism or an anti-automorphism.
