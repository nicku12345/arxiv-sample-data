In this paper, we investigate 2-absorbing ideals of commutative semirings and prove that if \mathfrak{a} is a nonzero proper ideal of a subtractive valuation semiring S then \mathfrak{a} is a 2-absorbing ideal of S if and only if \mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{p} or \mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{p}^2 where \mathfrak{p}=\sqrt\mathfrak{a} is a prime ideal of S. We also show that each 2-absorbing ideal of a subtractive semiring S is prime if and only if the prime ideals of S are comparable and if \mathfrak{p} is a minimal prime over a 2-absorbing ideal \mathfrak{a}, then \mathfrak{am} = \mathfrak{p}, where \mathfrak{m} is the unique maximal ideal of S.
