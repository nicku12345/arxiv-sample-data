We obtain sufficient criteria for simplicity of systems, that is, rings R that are equipped with a family of additive subgroups R_s, for s \in S, where S is a semigroup, satisfying R = \sum_{s \in S} R_s and R_s R_t \subseteq R_{st}, for s,t \in S. These criteria are specialized to obtain sufficient criteria for simplicity of, what we call, s-unital epsilon-strong systems, that is systems where S is an inverse semigroup, R is coherent, in the sense that for all s,t \in S with s \leq t, the inclusion R_s \subseteq R_t holds, and for each s \in S, the R_s R_{s^*}-R_{s^*}R_s-bimodule R_s is s-unital. As an aplication of this, we obtain generalizations of recent criteria for simplicity of skew inverse semigroup rings, by Beuter, Goncalves, \"{O}inert and Royer, and then, in turn, for Steinberg algebras, over non-commutative rings, by Brown, Farthing, Sims, Steinberg, Clark and Edie-Michel.
