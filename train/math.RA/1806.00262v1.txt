We search an identity basis for the adjoint Lie algebra of the algebra M_{1,1}(K) over a field, where K is either the infinite generated Grassmann algebra E or E^1, the variant of the algebra with 1. In particular, we prove that in the case of an infinite base field of characteristic different from two the identities of M_{1,1}(E^1) are exactly all the consequences of the identity [x,y,[z,t],v]=0. We also find an identity basis of M_{1,1}(E) consisting of three identities.
