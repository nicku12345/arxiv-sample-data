In this paper, we continue our study of the tensor product structure of category \mathcal W of weight modules over the Hopf-Ore extensions kG(\chi^{-1}, a, 0) of group algebras kG, where k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We first describe the tensor product decomposition rules for all indecomposable weight modules under the assumption that the orders of \chi and \chi(a) are different. Then we describe the Green ring r(\mathcal W) of the tensor category \mathcal W. It is shown that r(\mathcal W) is isomorphic to the polynomial algebra over the group ring \mathbb{Z}\hat{G} in one variable when |\chi(a)|=|\chi|=\infty, and that r(\mathcal W) is isomorphic to the quotient ring of the polynomial algebra over the group ring \mathbb{Z}\hat{G} in two variables modulo a principle ideal when |\chi(a)|<|\chi|=\infty. When |\chi(a)|\le|\chi|<\infty, r(\mathcal W) is isomorphic to the quotient ring of a skew group ring \mathbb{Z}[X]\sharp\hat{G} modulo some ideal, where \mathbb{Z}[X] is a polynomial algebra over \mathbb{Z} in infinitely many variables.
