Let S be a domain and S[t;\sigma,\delta] a skew polynomial ring, where \sigma is an injective endomorphism of S and \delta a left \sigma-derivation. We give criteria for skew polynomials f\in S[t;\sigma,\delta] of degree less or equal to four to be irreducible and apply them to skew polynomials over polynomial rings, for instance quantized Weyl algebras and quantum planes. We also consider the skew polynomial f(t)=t^m-a.
