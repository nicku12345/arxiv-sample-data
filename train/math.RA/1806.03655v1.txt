In this paper, we first give an expression for the Moore-Penrose inverse of the product of two tensors via the Einstein product. We then introduce a new generalized inverse of a tensor called product Moore-Penrose inverse. A necessary and sufficient condition for the coincidence of the Moore-Penrose inverse and the product Moore-Penrose inverse is also proposed. Finally, the triple reverse order law of tensors is introduced.
