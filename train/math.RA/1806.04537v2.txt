Let S be a unital associative ring and S[t;\sigma,\delta] be a skew polynomial ring, where \sigma is an injective endomorphism of S and \delta a left \sigma-derivation. For each f\in S[t;\sigma,\delta] of degree m>1 with a unit as leading coefficient, we construct a unital nonassociative algebra whose behaviour reflects the properties of f. The algebras obtained yield canonical examples of right division algebras when f is irreducible. We investigate the structure of these algebras. The structure of their right nucleus depends on the choice of f. In the classical literature, this nucleus appears as the eigenspace of f, and is used to investigate the irreducible factors of f. We give necessary and sufficient criteria for skew polynomials of low degree to be irreducible.
