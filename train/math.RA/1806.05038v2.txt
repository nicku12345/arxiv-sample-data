In this work, we made a generalization that includes all bicomplex Fibonacci-like numbers such as; Fibonacci, Lucas, Pell, etc.. We named this generalization as bicomplex Horadam numbers. For bicomplex Fibonacci and Lucas numbers we gave some additional identities. Moreover, we have obtained the Binet formula and generating function for bicomplex Horadam numbers for the first time. We have also obtained two important identities that relate the matrix theory to the second order recurrence relations.
