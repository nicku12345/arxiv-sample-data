We extend the classical links between valuations and orderings on fields to Tignol-Wadsworth gauges and positive cones on finite-dimensional simple algebras with involution. We also study the compatibility of gauges and positive cones, and prove lifting results in the style of the Baer-Krull theorem for fields.
