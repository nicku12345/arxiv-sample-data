Using the concept of (K,L)-eigenvector, we investigate the structure of the max-min eigenspace associated with a given eigenvalue of a matrix in the max-min algebra (also known as fuzzy algebra). In our approach, the max-min eigenspace is split into several regions according to the order relations between the eigenvalue and the components of x. The resulting theory of (K,L)-eigenvectors, being based on the fundamental results of Gondran and Minoux, allows to describe the whole max-min eigenspace explicitly and in more detail.
