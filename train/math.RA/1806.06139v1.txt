A group graded K-algebra A=\bigoplus\limits_{g\in G} A_g is called "locally finite" if \dim_K A_g < \infty for every g\in G. We characterise the weighted graphs (E,w) for which the weighted Leavitt path algebra L_K(E,w) is locally finite with respect to its standard grading. We also prove that the locally finite weighted Leavitt path algebras are precisely the Noetherian ones and that L_K(E,w) is locally finite iff (E,w) is finite and the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of L_K(E,w) equals 0 or 1. Further it is shown that a locally finite weighted Leavitt path algebra is isomorphic to a locally finite Leavitt path algebra and therefore is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of matrix algebras over K and K[X,X^{-1}].
