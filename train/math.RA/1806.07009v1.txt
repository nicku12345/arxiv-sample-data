Let {\mathbb V} be an n-dimensional linear space over an algebraically closed base field. We provide a classification, up to equivalence, of all of the bilinear maps f:{\mathbb V} \times {\mathbb V} \to {\mathbb V} such that dim(rad(f)) =n-2. This is equivalent to give a complete classification (up to isomorphism) of all n-dimensional algebras with annihilator of dimension n-2 or, in other words, a classification of the annihilator extensions of all 2-dimensional algebras.
