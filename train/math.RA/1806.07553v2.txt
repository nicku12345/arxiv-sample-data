We study the coadjoint orbits of a Lie algebra in terms of Cartan class. In fact, the tangent space to a coadjoint orbit \mathcal{O}(\alpha) at the point \alpha corresponds to the characteristic space associated to the left invariant form;\alpha and its dimension is the even part of the Cartan class of \alpha. We apply this remark to determine Lie algebras such that all the nontrivial orbits (nonreduced to a point) have the same dimension, in particular when this dimension is 2 or 4. We determine also the Lie algebras of dimension 2n or 2n+1 having an orbit of dimension 2n.
