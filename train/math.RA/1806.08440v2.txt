In this paper we introduce the notion of an orientation-preserving transformation on an arbitrary chain, as a natural extension for infinite chains of the well known concept for finite chains introduced in 1998 by McAlister \cite{McAlister:1998} and, independently, in 1999 by Catarino and Higgins \cite{Catarino&Higgins:1999}. We consider the monoid \mathscr{POP}(X) of all orientation-preserving partial transformations on a finite or infinite chain X and its submonoids \mathscr{OP}(X) and \mathscr{POPJ}(X) of all orientation-preserving full transformations and of all orientation-preserving partial permutations on X, respectively. The monoid \mathscr{PO}(X) of all order-preserving partial transformations on X and its injective counterpart \mathscr{POJ}(X) are also considered. We study the regularity and give descriptions of the Green's relations of the monoids \mathscr{POP}(X), \mathscr{PO}(X), \mathscr{OP}(X), \mathscr{POPJ}(X) and \mathscr{POJ}(X).
