In this paper first by the fact that the relation \alpha^* is the transitive closure of two its subrelations we introduce and analyze a binary relation \lambda^*_e on a hyperring such that the derived ring is a unitary ring. Next we introduce and study the notion of \lambda_e-parts in a hyperring and we characterize \lambda_e-parts in a \lambda_e-strong hyperring R. Finally we introduce a new relation \Lambda^* such that its derived ring be a unitary commutative ring.
