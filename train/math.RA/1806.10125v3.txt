Let \mathrm{Lie} \left(n, k\right) denote the class of all n-dimensional real solvable Lie algebras having k-dimensional derived ideal (1 \leqslant k \leqslant n-1). In 1993, the class \mathrm{Lie} \left(n, 1\right) was completely classified by Sch\"obel \cite{Sch93}. In 2016, Vu A. Le et al. \cite{VHTHT16} considered the class \mathrm{Lie} \left(n, n-1\right) and classified its subclass containing all the algebras having 1-codimensional commutative derived ideal. One subclass in {\Li} was firstly considered and incompletely classified by Sch\"obel \cite{Sch93} in 1993. Later, Janisse also gave an incomplete classification of {\Li} and published as a scientific report \cite{Jan10} in 2010. In this paper, we set up a new approach to study the classifying problem of classes {\Li} as well as {\li} and present the new complete classification of {\Li} in the combination with the well-known Eberlein's result of 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras from \cite[p.\,37--72]{Ebe03}. The paper will also classify a subclass of {\li} and will point out missings in Sch\"obel \cite{Sch93}, Janisse \cite{Jan10}, Mubarakzyanov \cite{Mub63a} as well as revise an error of Morozov \cite{Mor58}.
