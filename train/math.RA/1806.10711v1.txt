Let R be an algebra over a commutative ring k. Suppose that R is endowed with a descending filtration indexed on an ordered group (G,<) such that the restriction to k is positive. We show that the existence of free algebras on a certain set of generators in the induced graded ring grad(R) implies the existence of free group algebras in R. Our best results are obtained for division rings endowed with a valuation.
