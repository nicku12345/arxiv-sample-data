We study polynomial identities of nonassociative algebras constructed by using infinite binary words and their combinatorial properties. Infinite periodic and Sturmian words were first applied for constructing examples of algebras with arbitrary real PI-exponent greater than one. Later we used these algebras for confirmation of the conjecture that PI-exponent increases precisely by one after adjoining an external unit to a given algebra. Here we prove the same result for these algebras for graded identities and graded PI-exponent, provided that the grading group is cyclic of order two.
