In this paper, we introduce a representation theory of Hom-Lie conformal superalgebras and discuss the cases of adjoint representations. Furthermore, we develop cohomology theory of Hom-Lie conformal superalgebras and discuss some applications to the study of deformations of regular Hom-Lie conformal superalgebras. Finally, we introduce derivations of multiplicative Hom-Lie conformal superalgebras and study their properties.
