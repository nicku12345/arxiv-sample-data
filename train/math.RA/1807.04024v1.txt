Here we continue to characterize a recently introduced notion, le-modules _{R}M over a commutative ring R with unity \cite{Bhuniya}. This article introduces and characterizes Zariski topology on the set Spec(M) of all prime submodule elements of M. Thus we extend many results on Zariski topology for modules over a ring to le-modules. The topological space Spec(M) is connected if and only if R/Ann(M) contains no idempotents other than \overline{0} and \overline{1}. Open sets in the Zariski topology for the quotient ring R/Ann(M) induces a base of quasi-compact open sets for the Zariski-topology on Spec(M). Every irreducible closed subset of Spec(M) has a generic point. Besides, we prove a number of different equivalent characterizations for Spec(M) to be spectral.
