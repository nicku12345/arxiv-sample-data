Various families of octonion number sequences (such as Fibonacci octonion, Pell octonion and Jacobsthal octonion) have been established by a number of authors in many different ways. In addition, formulas and identities involving these number sequences have been presented. In this paper, we aim at establishing new classes of octonion numbers associated with the generalized Tribonacci numbers. We introduce the Tribonacci and generalized Tribonacci octonions (such as Narayana octonion, Padovan octonion and third-order Jacobsthal octonion) and give some of their properties. We derive the relations between generalized Tribonacci numbers and Tribonacci octonions.
