The elliptical range theorem asserts that the field of values (or numerical range) of a two-by-two matrix with complex entries is an elliptical disk, the foci of which are the eigenvalues of the given matrix. Many proofs of this result are available in the literature, but most, with one exception, are computational and quite involved. In this note, it is shown that the elliptical range theorem follows from the properties of plane algebraic curves and a straightforward application of a well-known result due to Kippenhahn.
