We introduce and describe the class of split regular Hom-Leibniz color 3-algebras as the natural extension of the class of split Lie algebras, split Leibniz algebras, split Lie 3-algebras, split Lie triple systems, split Leibniz 3-algebras, and some other algebras.   More precisely, we show that any of such split regular Hom-Leibniz color 3-algebras T is of the form {T}={\mathcal U} +\sum\limits_{j}I_{j}, with \mathcal U a subspace of the 0-root space {T}_0, and I_{j} an ideal of T satisfying {for} j\neq k: \[[{ T},I_j,I_k]+[I_j,{ T},I_k]+[I_j,I_k,T]=0.\] Moreover, if T is of maximal length, we characterize the simplicity of T in terms of a connectivity property in its set of non-zero roots.
