In this paper we introduce a class of noncommutative (finitely generated) monomial algebras whose Hilbert series are algebraic functions. We use the concept of graded homology and the theory of unambiguous context-free grammars for this purpose. We also provide examples of finitely presented graded algebras whose corresponding leading monomial algebras belong to the proposed class and hence possess algebraic Hilbert series.
