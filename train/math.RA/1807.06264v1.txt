Let \mathbb{F} be a field and f : \mathfrak{S}_n \rightarrow \mathbb{F} \setminus \{0\} be an arbitrary map. The Schur matrix functional associated to f is defined as M \in \text{M}_n(\mathbb{F}) \mapsto \widetilde{f}(M):=\sum_{\sigma \in \mathfrak{S}_n} f(\sigma) \prod_{j=1}^n m_{\sigma(j),j}. Typical examples of such functionals are the determinant (where f is the signature morphism) and the permanent (where f is constant with value 1). Given two such maps f and g, we study the endomorphisms U of the vector space \text{M}_n(\mathbb{F}) that satisfy \widetilde{g}(U(M))=\widetilde{f}(M) for all M \in \text{M}_n(\mathbb{F}). In particular, we give a closed form for the linear preservers of the functional \widetilde{f} when f is central, and as a special case we extend to an arbitrary field Botta's characterization of the linear preservers of the permanent.
