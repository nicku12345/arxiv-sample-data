A ring R is called right principally-injective if every R-homomorphism from a principal right ideal aR to R (a in R), extends to R, or equivalently if every system of equations xa=b (a, b in R) is solvable in R. In this paper we show that for any arbitrary graph E and for a field K, principally-injective conditions for the Leavitt path algebra LK(E) are equivalent to that the graph E being acyclic. We also show that the principally injective Leavitt path algebras are precisely the von Neumann regular Leavitt path algebras.
