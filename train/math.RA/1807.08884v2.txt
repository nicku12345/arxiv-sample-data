In this paper, we introduce the concept of (super-)multiplier-rank for Lie superalgeras and classify all the finite-dimensional nilpotent Lie superalgebras of multiplier-rank \leq 2 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. In the process, we also determine the multipliers of Heisenberg superalgebras.
