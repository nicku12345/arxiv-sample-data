In 1999, Y. Kashina introduced the exponent of a Hopf algebra. In this paper, we prove that the exponent of a finite dimensional non-cosemisimple Hopf algebra with Chevalley property in characteristic 0 is infinite, and the exponent of a finite dimensional non-cosemisimple pointed Hopf algebra in positive characteristic is finite.
