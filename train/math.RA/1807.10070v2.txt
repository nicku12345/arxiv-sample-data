We apply small cancellation methods originating from group theory to investigate the structure of a quotient ring \mathbb{Z}_2\mathcal{F} / \mathcal{I}, where \mathbb{Z}_2\mathcal{F} is the group algebra of the free group \mathcal{F} over the field \mathbb{Z}_2, and the ideal \mathcal{I} is generated by a single trinomial 1 + v + vw, where v is a complicated word depending on w. In \mathbb{Z}_2\mathcal{F} / \mathcal{I} we have (1 + w)^{-1} = v, so 1 + w becomes invertible. We construct an explicit linear basis of \mathbb{Z}_2\mathcal{F} / \mathcal{I} (thus showing that \mathbb{Z}_2\mathcal{F} / \mathcal{I}\neq 0). This is the first step in constructing rings with exotic properties.
