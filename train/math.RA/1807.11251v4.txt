Let R be a not necessarily commutative ring with 1. In the present paper we first introduce a notion of quasi-orderings, which axiomatically subsumes all the orderings and valuations on R. We proceed by uniformly defining a coarsening relation \leq on the set \mathcal{Q}(R) of all quasi-orderings on R. One of our main results states that (\mathcal{Q}(R),\leq') is a rooted tree for some slight modification \leq' of \leq, i.e. a partially ordered set admitting a maximum such that for any element there is a unique chain to that maximum. As an application of this theorem we obtain that (\mathcal{Q}(R),\leq') is a spectral set, i.e. order-isomorphic to the spectrum of some commutative ring with 1. We conclude this paper by studying \mathcal{Q}(R) as a topological space.
