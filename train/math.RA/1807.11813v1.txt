Let k be a field and let R be a left noetherian k-algebra. The algebra R satisfies the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence if the annihilators of irreducible representations are precisely those prime ideals that are locally closed in the {\rm Spec}(R) and if, moreover, these prime ideals are precisely those whose extended centres are algebraic extensions of the base field. We show that if R and S are two left noetherian k-algebras with {\rm dim}_k(R), {\rm dim}_k(S)<|k| then if R and S have homeomorphic spectra then R satisfies the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence if and only if S does. In particular, the topology of {\rm Spec}(R) can detect the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence in this case. In addition, we show that if k is uncountable and R is affine noetherian and its prime spectrum is a disjoint union of subspaces that are each homeomorphic to the spectrum of an affine commutative ring then R satisfies the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence. We show that neither of these results need hold if k is countable and R is infinite-dimensional. Finally, we make the remark that satisfying the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence is a Morita invariant and finally we show that R and S are left noetherian k-algebras that satisfy the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence then R\otimes_k S does too, provided it is left noetherian and satisfies the Nullstellensatz; and we show that eRe also satisfies the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence, where e is a nonzero idempotent of R.
