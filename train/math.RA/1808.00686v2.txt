In this paper we exhibit a minimal set of generators form the annihilator of even neat elements of the exterior algebra of a vector space, when the base field is of positive characteristic and thus we prove the conjecture we established in [3]. In order to do that we heavily use the results obtained in [1] and [2]. This also allows us to exhibit a vector space basis for the annihilators under consideration.
