We study actions by filtered automorphisms on classical generalized Weyl algebras (GWAs). In the case of a defining polynomial of degree two, we prove that the fixed ring under the action of a finite cyclic group of filtered automorphisms is again a classical GWA, extending a result of Jordan and Wells. Partial results are provided for the case of higher degree polynomials. In addition, we establish a version of Auslander's theorem for finite cyclic groups of filtered automorphisms acting on classical GWAs.
