In this article we begin the study of representations of simple finite-dimensional noncommutative Jordan superalgebras. In the case of degree \geq 3 we show that any finite-dimensional representation is completely reducible and, depending on the superalgebra, quasiassociative or Jordan. Then we study representations of superalgebras D_t(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) and K_3(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) and prove the Kronecker factorization theorem for superalgebras D_t(\alpha,\beta,\gamma). In the last section we use a new approach to study noncommutative Jordan representations of simple Jordan superalgebras.
