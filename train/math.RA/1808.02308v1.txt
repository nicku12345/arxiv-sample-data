We show that a ring \,R\, has two idempotents \,e,e'\, with an invertible commutator \,ee'-e'e\, if and only if \,R \cong {\mathbb M}_2(S)\, for a ring \,S\, in which \,1\, is a sum of two units. In this case, the "anti-commutator" \,ee'+e'e\, is automatically invertible, so we study also the broader class of rings having such an invertible anti-commutator. Simple artinian rings \,R\, (along with other related classes of matrix rings) with one of the above properties are completely determined. In this study, we also arrive at various new criteria for {\it general\} \,2\times 2\, matrix rings. For instance, R\, is such a matrix ring if and only if it has an invertible commutator \,er-re\, where \,e^2=e.
