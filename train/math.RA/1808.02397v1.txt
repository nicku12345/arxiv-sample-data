We study some closely interrelated notions of Homological Algebra: (1) We define a topology on modules over a not-necessarily commutative ring R that coincides with the R-topology defined by Matlis when R is commutative. (2) We consider the class  \mathcal{SF} of strongly flat modules when R is a right Ore domain with classical right quotient ring Q. Strongly flat modules are flat. The completion of R in its R-topology is a strongly flat R-module. (3) We consider some results related to the question whether  \mathcal{SF} a covering class implies  \mathcal{SF} closed under direct limit. This is a particular case of the so-called Enochs' Conjecture (whether covering classes are closed under direct limit).   Some of our results concerns right chain domains. For instance, we show that if the class of strongly flat modules over a right chain domain R is covering, then R is right invariant. In this case, flat R-modules are strongly flat.
