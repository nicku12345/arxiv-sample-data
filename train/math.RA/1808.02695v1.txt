We study the Leibniz n-algebra \textbf{U}_n(\mathfrak{L}), whose multiplication is defined via the bracket of a Leibniz algebra \mathfrak{L} as [x_1,\dots,x_n]=[x_1,[\dots, [x_{n-2},[x_{n-1},x_n]]\dots]]. We show that \textbf{U}_n(\mathfrak{L}) is simple if and only if \mathfrak{L} is a simple Lie algebra. An analogue of Levi's theorem for Leibniz algebras in \textbf{U}_n(\textbf{Lb}) is established and it is proven that the Leibniz n-kernel of \textbf{U}_n(\mathfrak{L}) for any semisimple Leibniz algebra \mathfrak{L} is the n-algebra \textbf{U}_n(\mathfrak{L}).
