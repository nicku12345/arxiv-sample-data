In this paper we present a complete method for finding the roots of all polynomials of the form \phi(z)=c_n z^n+c_{n-1} z^{n-1}+\dots+c_1 z+c_0 over a given octonion division algebra. When \phi(z) is monic we also consider the companion matrix and its left and right eigenvalues and study their relations to the roots of \phi(z), showing that the right eigenvalues form the conjugacy classes of the roots of \phi(z) and the left eigenvalues form a larger set than the roots of \phi(z).
