Suppose that the underlying field is of characteristic different from 2, 3. In this paper we first prove that the so-called stem deformations of a free presentations of a finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra L exhaust all the maximal stem extensions of L, up to equivalence of extensions. Then we prove that multipliers and covers always exist for a Lie superalgebra and they are unique up to Lie superalgebra isomorphisms. Finally, we describe the multipliers, covers and maximal stem extensions of Heisenberg superalgebras of odd centers and model filiform Lie superalgebras.
