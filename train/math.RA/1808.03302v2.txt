In {\it Set-theoretical solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation} (Duke Math. J. {\bf 100} (1999), 169--209), Etingof, Schedler and Soloviev introduced, for each non-degenerate involutive set-theoretical solution (X,\sigma,\tau) of the Yang-Baxter equation, the equivalence relation \sim defined on the set X and they considered a new non-degenerate involutive induced \emph{retraction} solution defined on the quotient set X^{\sim}. It is well known that translating set-theoretical non-degenerate solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation into the universal algebra language we obtain an algebra called a \emph{birack}. In the paper we introduce the \emph{generalized retraction} relation \approx on a birack, which is equal to \sim in an involutive case. We present a complete algebraic proof that the relation \approx is a congruence of the birack. Thus we show that the retraction of a set-theoretical non-degenerate solution is well defined not only in the involutive case but also in the case of all non-involutive solutions.
