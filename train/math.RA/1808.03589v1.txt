Nakayama automorphisms play an important role in several mathematical branches, which are known to be tough to compute in general. We compute the Nakayama automorphism \nu of any Ore extension R[x; \sigma, \delta] over a polynomial algebra R in n variables for an arbitrary n. The formula of \nu is obtained explicitly. When \sigma is not the identity map, the invariant E^G is also investigated in term of Zhang's twist, where G is a cyclic group sharing the same order with \sigma.
