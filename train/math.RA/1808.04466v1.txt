This survey of the recent developments in the investigations of a Leavitt path algebra L of an arbitrary graph E over a field K consists of two parts. In the first part describes how very often a single graph property of E implies multiple ring properties of L, thus making Leavitt path algebras effective tools in constructing rings of various desirable properties. The second part describes methods of constructing simple modules over L and characterizes Leavitt path algebras all of whose simple modules possess some specific properties such as being flat, finitely presented,being graded, injective etc.
