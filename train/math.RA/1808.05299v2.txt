A linear locally nilpotent derivation of the polynomial algebra K[X_m] in m variables over a field K of characteristic 0 is called a Weitzenb\"ock derivation. It is well known from the classical theorem of Weitzenb\"ock that the algebra of constants K[X_{m}]^{\delta} of a Weitzenb\"ock derivation \delta is finitely generated. Assume that \delta acts on the polynomial algebra K[X_{2d}] in 2d variables as follows: \delta(x_{2i})=x_{2i-1}, \delta(x_{2i-1})=0, i=1,\ldots,d. The Nowicki conjecture states that the algebra K[X_{2d}]^{\delta} is generated by x_1,x_3.\ldots,x_{2d-1}, and x_{2i-1}x_{2j}-x_{2i}x_{2j-1}, 1\leq i<j\leq d. The conjecture was proved by several authors based on different techniques. We apply the same idea to two relatively free algebras of rank 2d. We give the infinite set of generators of the algebra of constants in the the free metabelian associative algebras F_{2d}(\mathfrak A), and finite set of generators in the free algebra F_{2d}(\mathcal G) in the variety determined by the identities of the infinite dimensional Grassmann algebra.
