Let K be a field and q\in K, q\neq 0, 1. Let \mathcal {H}_n(q, Q) be an Ariki-Koike algebra, where the cyclotomic parameter Q=(Q_1, Q_2, \cdots, Q_r)\in K^r with r\geq 2, Q_i=q^{a_i}, a_i\in \mathbb{Z}. For a weight one block B of \mathcal {H}_n(q, Q), we prove in this paper that \text{rad}\:B=I, where I is the nilpotent ideal constructed for a symmetric cellular algebra in [Radicals of symmetric cellular algebras, Colloq. Math. {\bf 133} (2013) 67-83]. We also give some applications of this result.
