In this paper we classify filiform associative algebras of degree k over a field of characteristic zero. Moreover, we also classify naturally graded complex filiform and quasi-filiform nilpotent associative algebras which are described by the characteristic sequence C(\mathcal{A})=(n-2,1,1) or C(\mathcal{A})=(n-2,2).
