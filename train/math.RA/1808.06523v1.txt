We construct a Gr\"obner-Shirshov basis of the Temperley-Lieb algebra \mathfrak{T}(d,n) of the complex reflection group G(d,1,n), inducing the standard monomials expressed by the generators \{E_i\} of \mathfrak{T}(d,n). This result generalizes the one for the Coxeter group of type B_n in \cite{KimSSLeeDI}. We also give a combinatorial interpretation of the standard monomials of \mathfrak{T}(d,n), relating to the fully commutative elements of the complex reflection group G(d,1,n). In this way, we obtain the dimension formula of \mathfrak{T}(d,n).
