Let D be a division ring with center F and K a division subring of D. In this paper, we show that a non-central normal subgroup N of the multiplicative group D^* is left algebraic over K if and only if so is D provided F is uncountable and contained in K. Also, if K is a field and the n-th derived subgroup D^{(n)} of D^{*} is left algebraic of bounded degree d over K, then \dim_FD\le d^2.
