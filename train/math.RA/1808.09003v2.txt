We study the congeniality property of algebras, as defined by Bao, He, and Zhang, in order to establish a version of Auslander's theorem for various families of filtered algebras. It is shown that the property is preserved under homomorphic images and tensor products under some mild conditions. Examples of congenial algebras in this paper include enveloping algebras of Lie superalgebras, iterated differential operator rings, quantized Weyl algebras, down-up algebras, and symplectic reflection algebras.
