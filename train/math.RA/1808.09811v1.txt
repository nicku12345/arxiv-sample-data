In this paper, we introduce the notion of a BiHom-Lie conformal algebra and develop its cohomology theory. Also, we discuss some applications to the study of deformations of regular BiHom-Lie conformal algebras. Finally, we introduce derivations of multiplicative BiHom-Lie conformal algebras and study their properties.
