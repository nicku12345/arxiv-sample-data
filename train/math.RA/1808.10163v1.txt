Let G be a group with neutral element e and let S=\bigoplus_{g \in G}S_g be a G-graded ring. A necessary condition for S to be noetherian is that the principal component S_e is noetherian. The following partial converse is well-known: If S is strongly-graded and G is a polycyclic-by-finite group, then S_e being noetherian implies that S is noetherian. We will generalize the noetherianity result to the recently introduced class of epsilon-strongly graded rings. We will also provide results on the artinianity of epsilon-strongly graded rings.   As our main application we obtain characterizations of noetherian and artinian Leavitt path algebras with coefficients in a general unital ring. This extends a recent characterization by Steinberg for Leavitt path algebras with coefficients in a commutative unital ring and previous characterizations by Abrams, Aranda Pino and Siles Molina for Leavitt path algebras with coefficients in a field. Secondly, we obtain characterizations of noetherian and artinian unital partial crossed products.
