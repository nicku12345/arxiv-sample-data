Pr\"{u}fer domains and subclasses of integral domains such as Dedekind domains admit characterizations by means of the properties of their ideal lattices. Interestingly, a Leavitt path algebra L, in spite of being non-commutative and possessing plenty of zero divisors, seems to have its ideal lattices possess the characterizing properties of these special domains. In [8] it was shown that the ideals of L satisfy the distributive law, a property of Pr\"{u}fer domains and that L is a multiplication ring, a property of Dedekind domains. In this paper, we first show that L satisfies two more characterizing properties of Pr\"{u}fer domains which are the ideal versions of two theorems in Elementary Number Theory, namely, for positive integers a,b,c, \gcd(a,b)\cdot\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=a\cdot b and a\cdot \operatorname{gcd}(b,c)=\operatorname{gcd}(ab,ac). We also show that L satisfies a characterizing property of almost Dedekind domains in terms of the ideals whose radicals are prime ideals. Finally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions under which L satisfies another important characterizing property of almost Dedekind domains, namely the cancellative property of its non-zero ideals.
