A generalized matrix function d_\chi^G : M_n(\mathbb{C}) \rightarrow \mathbb{C} is a function constructed by a subgroup G of S_n and a complex valued function \chi of G.   The main purpose of this paper is to find a necessary and sufficient condition for the equality of two generalized matrix functions on the set of all symmetric matrices, \mathbb{S}_n(\mathbb{C}).   In order to fulfill the purpose, a symmetric matrix S_\sigma is constructed and d_\chi^G(S_\sigma) is evaluated for each \sigma \in S_n.   By applying the value of d_\chi^G(S_\sigma), it is shown that d_\chi^G(AB) = d_\chi^G(A)d_\chi^G(B) for each A, B \in \mathbb{S}_n(\mathbb{C}) if and only if d_\chi^G = \det.   Furthermore, a criterion when d_\chi^G(AB) = d_\chi^G(BA) for every A, B \in \mathbb{S}_n(\mathbb{C}), is established.
