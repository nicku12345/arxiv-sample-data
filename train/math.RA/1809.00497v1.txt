Suppose the ground field \mathbb{F} is an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from 2, 3. We determine the Betti numbers and make a decomposition of the associative superalgebra of the cohomology for the model filiform Lie superalgebra. We also describe the associative superalgebra structures of the (divided power) cohomology for some low-dimensional filiform Lie superalgebras.
