We introduce the notion of a generalized metric n-Leibniz algebra and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between generalized metric n-Leibniz algebras and faithful generalized orthogonal representations of metric Lie algebras (called Lie triple data). We further show that there is also a one-to-one correspondence between generalized orthogonal derivations (resp. generalized orthogonal automorphisms) on generalized metric n-Leibniz algebras and Lie triple datas.
