Let L be a Lie superalgebra over a field of characteristic different from 2,3 and write \mathrm{ID}^{*}(L) for the Lie superalgebra consisting of superderivations mapping L to L^{2} and the central elements to zero. In this paper we first give an upper bound for the superdimension of \mathrm{ID}^{*}(L) by means of linear vector space decompositions. Then we characterize the \mathrm{ID}^{*}-superderivation superalgebras for the nilpotent Lie superalgebras of class 2 and the model filiform Lie superalgebras by methods of block matrices.
