We show that given a Hom-Lie algebra one can construct the n-ary Hom-Lie bracket by means of an (n-2)-cochain of given Hom-Lie algebra and find the conditions under which this n-ary bracket satisfies the Filippov-Jacobi identity, there by inducing the structure of n-Hom-Lie algebra. We introduce the notion of Hom-Lie n-uplet system which is the generalization of Hom-Lie triple system. We construct Hom-Lie n-uplet system using a Hom-Lie algebra.
