A hom-associative algebra is an algebra whose associativity is twisted by an algebra homomorphism. In this paper, we introduce a strongly homotopy version of hom-associative algebras (HA_\infty-algebras in short) on a graded vector space. We describe 2-term HA_\infty-algebras in details. In particular, we study 'skeletal' and 'strict' 2-term HA_\infty-algebras. We also introduce hom-associative 2-algebras as categorification of hom-associative algebras. The category of 2-term HA_\infty-algebras and the category of hom-associative 2-algebras are shown to be equivalent. An appropriate skew-symmetrization of HA_\infty-algebras give rise to HL_\infty-algebras introduced by Sheng and Chen. Finally, we define a suitable Hochschild cohomology theory for HA_\infty-algebras which control the deformation of the structures.
