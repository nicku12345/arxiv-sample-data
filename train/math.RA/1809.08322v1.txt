Within the framework of the theory of quaternion column-row determinants and using determinantal representations of the Moore-Penrose inverse previously obtained by the author, we get explicit determinantal representation formulas of solutions (analogs of Cramer's rule) to the quaternion two-sided generalized Sylvester matrix equation  {\bf A}_{1}{\bf X}_{1}{\bf B}_{1}+ {\bf A}_{2}{\bf X}_{2}{\bf B}_{2}={\bf C} and its all special cases when its first term or both terms are one-sided. Finally, we derive determinantal representations of two like-Lyapunov equations.
