Let R and S be any rings and _RC_S a semidualizing bimodule, and let \mathcal{A}_C(R^{op}) and \mathcal{B}_C(R) be the Auslander and Bass classes respectively. Then both the pairs (\mathcal{A}_C(R^{op}),\mathcal{B}_C(R))\ {\rm and}\ (\mathcal{B}_C(R),\mathcal{A}_C(R^{op})) are coproduct-closed and product-closed duality pairs and both \mathcal{A}_C(R^{op}) and \mathcal{B}_C(R) are covering and preenveloping; in particular, the former duality pair is perfect. Moreover, if \mathcal{B}_C(R) is enveloping in \Mod R, then \mathcal{A}_C(S) is enveloping in \Mod S. Then some applications to the Auslander projective dimension of modules are given.
