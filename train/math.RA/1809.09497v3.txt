Let L/F be a Galois extension of fields with Galois group isomorphic to the quaternion group of order  8 . We describe all of the Hopf-Galois structures admitted by  L/F , and determine which of the Hopf algebras that appear are isomorphic as Hopf algebras. In the case that  F  has characteristic zero we also determine which of these Hopf algebras are isomorphic as  F -algebras and explicitly compute their Wedderburn-Artin decompositions.
