L. P. Belluce, A. Di Nola and B. Gerla established a connection between MV-algebras and (dually) lattice ordered semirings by means of so-called coupled semirings. A similar connection was found for basic algebras and semilattice ordered right near semirings by the authors. The aim of this paper is to derive an analogous connection for orthomodular lattices and certain semilattice ordered near semirings via so-called coupled right orthosemirings.
