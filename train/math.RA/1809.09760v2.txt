Let k be an algebraically-closed field, and B a unital, associative k-algebra with n := \dim_kB < \infty. For each 1 \le m \le n, the collection of all m-dimensional subalgebras of B carries the structure of a projective variety, which we call \operatorname{AlgGr_m(B)}. The group \operatorname{Aut}_k(B) of all k-algebra automorphisms of B acts regularly on \operatorname{AlgGr}_m(B). In this paper, we study the problem of explicitly describing \operatorname{AlgGr}_m(B), and classifying its \operatorname{Aut}_k(B)-orbits. Inspired by recent results on maximal subalgebras of finite-dimensional algebras, we compute the homogeneous vanishing ideal of \operatorname{AlgGr}_{n-1}(B) when B is basic, and explictly describe its irreducible components. We show that in this case, \operatorname{AlgGr}_{n-1}(B) is a finite union of \operatorname{Aut}_k(B)-orbits if B is monomial or its Ext quiver is Schur, but construct a class of examples to show that these conditions are not necessary.
