Let A be a ring with identity, \sigma a ring endomorphism of A that maps the identity to itself, \delta a \sigma-derivation of A, and consider the skew-polynomial ring A[X;\sigma,\delta]. When A is a finite field, a Galois ring, or a general ring, some fairly recent literature used A[X;\sigma,\delta] to construct new interesting codes (e.g. skew-cyclic and skew-constacyclic codes) that generalize their classical counterparts over finite fields (e.g. cyclic and constacyclic linear codes). This paper presents results concerning {\it principal} (f, \sigma, \delta)-codes over a ring A, where f\in A[X;\sigma,\delta] is monic. We provide recursive formulas that compute the entries of both a generating matrix and a control matrix of such a code \mathcal{C}. When A is a finite commutative ring with identity and \sigma is a ring automorphism of A, we also give recursive formulas for the entries of a parity-check matrix of \mathcal{C}. Also in this case, with \delta=0, we give a generating matrix of the dual \mathcal{C}^\perp, present a characterization of principal \sigma-codes whose duals are also principal \sigma-codes, and deduce a characterization of self-dual principal \sigma-codes. Some corollaries concerning principal \sigma-constacyclic codes are also given, and some highlighting examples are provided.
