A criterion for elements of free Zinbiel algebras to be Lie or Jordan is established. This criterion is used in studying speciality problems of Tortkara algebras. We construct a base of free special Tortkara algebras. Furthermore, we prove analogues of classical Cohn's and Shirshov's theorems for Tortkara algebras.
