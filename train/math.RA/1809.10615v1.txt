In this article we investigate the interplay between stem covers, the Schur multiplier of Leibniz crossed modules and the non-abelian exterior product of Leibniz algebras. In concrete, we obtain a six-term exact sequence associated to a central extension of Leibniz crossed modules, which is useful to characterize stem covers. We show the existence of stem covers and determine the structure of all stem covers of Leibniz crossed modules. Also, we give the connection between the stem cover of a Lie crossed module in the categories of Lie and Leibniz crossed modules respectively.
