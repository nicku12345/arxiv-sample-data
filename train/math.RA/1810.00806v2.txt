Let k be an algebraically-closed field, and let B = kQ/I be a basic, finite-dimensional associative k-algebra with n := \dim_kB < \infty. Previous work shows that the collection of maximal subalgebras of B carries the structure of a projective variety, denoted by \operatorname{msa} (Q), which only depends on the underlying quiver Q of B. The automorphism group \operatorname{Aut}_k(B) acts regularly on \operatorname{msa} (Q). Since \operatorname{msa} (Q) does not depend on the admissible ideal I, it is not necessarily easy to tell when two points of \operatorname{msa} (Q) actually correspond to isomorphic subalgebras of B. One way to gain insight into this problem is to study \operatorname{Aut}_k(B)-orbits of \operatorname{msa} (Q), and attempt to understand how isoclasses of maximal subalgebras decompose as unions of \operatorname{Aut}_k(B)-orbits. This paper investigates the problem for B = kQ, where Q is a type \mathbb{A} Dynkin quiver. We show that for such B, two maximal subalgebras with connected Ext quivers are isomorphic if and only if they lie in the same \operatorname{Aut}_k(B)-orbit of \operatorname{msa} (Q).
