Using the algebraic classification of all 2-dimensional algebras, we give the algebraic classification of all 2-dimensional rigid, conservative and terminal algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. We have the geometric classification of the variety of 2-dimensional terminal algebras, and based on the geometric classification of these algebras we formulate some open problems.
