Let q be a scalar that is not a root of unity. We show that any polynomial in the Casimir element of the Fairlie-Odesskii algebra U_q'(\mathfrak{so}_3) cannot be expressed in terms of only Lie algebra operations performed on the generators I_1,I_2,I_3 in the usual presentation of U_q'(\mathfrak{so}_3). Hence, the vector space sum of the center of U_q'(\mathfrak{so}_3) and the Lie subalgebra of U_q'(\mathfrak{so}_3) generated by I_1,I_2,I_3 is direct.
