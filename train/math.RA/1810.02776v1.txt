We extend the notion of the compressed zero-divisor graph \varTheta(R) to noncommutative rings in a way that still induces a product preserving functor \varTheta from the category of finite unital rings to the category of directed graphs. For a finite field F, we investigate the properties of \varTheta(M_n(F)), the graph of the matrix ring over F, and give a purely graph-theoretic characterization of this graph when n \neq 3. For n \neq 2 we prove that every graph automorphism of \varTheta(M_n(F)) is induced by a ring automorphism of M_n(F). We also show that for finite unital rings R and S, where S is semisimple and has no homomorphic image isomorphic to a field, if \varTheta(R) \cong \varTheta(S), then R \cong S. In particular, this holds if S=M_n(F) with n \neq 1.
