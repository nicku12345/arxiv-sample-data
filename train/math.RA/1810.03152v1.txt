In this paper, the third-order Jacobsthal generalized quaternions are introduced. We use the well-known identities related to the third-order Jacobsthal and third-order Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers to obtain the relations regarding these quaternions. Furthermore, the third-order Jacobsthal generalized quaternions are classified by considering the special cases of quaternionic units. We derive the relations between third-order Jacobsthal and third-order Jacobsthal-Lucas generalized quaternions.
