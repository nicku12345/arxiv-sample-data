Hyperstructures are a natural extension of regular algebraic structures in which one of the operations, known as the hyperoperation, is multivalued; a hyperfield is such an extension on a field. M. Krasner (1962) proved that the quotient \mathbb{F}_p/G, where G is a subgroup of units in \mathbb{F}_p is a hyperfield. The characteristic of a field may be explicitly determined from the order of the field, but there are no existing generalizations for determining the characteristic of a hyperfield of the form \mathbb{F}_p/G. We show that for odd primes p, there exists an explicit form for the characteristic of the hyperfield \mathbb{F}_p/G and |G|=1,2,3,4. Finally, we prove a general form of the characteristic for hyperfields where |G| is prime.
