We study numerical invariants of identities of finite-dimensional solvable Lie superalgebras. We define new series of finite-dimensional solvable Lie superalgebras L with non-nilpotent derived subalgebra L' and discuss their codimension growth. For the first algebra of this series we prove the existence and integrality of exp(L).
