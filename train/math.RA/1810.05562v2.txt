Let A be a symmetrisable generalised Cartan matrix, and let \mathfrak g(A) be the corresponding Kac-Moody algebra. In this paper, we address the following fundamental question on the structure of \mathfrak g(A): given two homogeneous elements x,y \in \mathfrak g(A), when is their bracket [x,y] a nonzero element? As an application of our results, we give a description of the solvable and nilpotent graded subalgebras of \mathfrak g(A).
