We associate to any ring R with identity a partially ordered set Hom(R), whose elements are all pairs (\mathfrak a,M), where \mathfrak a=\ker\varphi and M=\varphi^{-1}(U(S)) for some ring morphism \varphi of R into an arbitrary ring S. Here U(S) denotes the group of units of S. The assignment R\mapsto{}Hom(R) turns out to be a contravariant functor of the category Ring of associative rings with identity to the category ParOrd of partially ordered sets. The maximal elements of Hom(R) constitute a subset Max(R) which, for commutative rings R, can be identified with the Zariski spectrum Spec(R) of R. Every pair (\mathfrak a,M) in Hom(R) has a canonical representative, that is, there is a universal ring morphism \psi\colon R\to S_{(R/\mathfrak a,M/\mathfrak a)}  corresponding to the pair (\mathfrak a,M), where the ring S_{(R/\mathfrak a,M/\mathfrak a)}  is constructed as a universal inverting R/\mathfrak a-ring in the sense of Cohn. Several properties of the sets Hom(R) and Max(R) are studied.
