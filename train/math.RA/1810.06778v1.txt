In this paper we present necessary and sufficient conditions for a graded (trimmed) double Ore extension to be a graded (quasi-commutative) skew PBW extension. Using this fact, we prove that a graded skew PBW extension A = \sigma(R)\langle x_1,x_2 \rangle of an Artin-Schelter regular algebra R is Artin-Schelter regular. As a consequence, every graded skew PBW extension A = \sigma(R)\langle x_1,x_2 \rangle of a connected skew Calabi-Yau algebra R of dimension d is skew Calabi-Yau of dimension d+2.
