In this paper we introduce a particular class of matrices. We study the concept of a matrix to be balanced. We study some properties of this concept in the context of matrix operations. We examine the behaviour of various matrix statistics in this setting. The crux will be to understanding the determinants and the eigen-values of balanced matrices. It turns out that there does exist a direct communication among the leading entry, the trace, determinants and, hence, the eigen-values of these matrices of order 2\times 2. These matrices have an interesting property that enables us to predict their quadratic forms, even without knowing their entries but given their spectrum.
