There is an extensive recent literature on the graded, non-graded, prime, primitive, maximal ideals of Leavitt path algebras. In this introductory level survey, we will be giving an overview of different types of ideals and the correspondence between the lattice of ideals and the lattice of hereditary and saturated subsets of the graph over which the Leavitt path algebra is constructed.
