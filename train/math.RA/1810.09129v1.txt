Let L be a nilpotent Lie superalgebras of dimension (m\mid n) for some non-negative integers m and n and put s(L) = \frac{1}{2}[(m + n - 1)(m + n -2)]+ n+ 1 - \dim \mathcal{M}(L), where \mathcal{M}(L) denotes the Schur multiplier of L. Recently, the author has shown that s(L) \geq 0 and the structure of all nilpotent Lie superalgebras has been determined when s(L) = 0 \cite{Nayak2018}. The aim of this paper is to classify all nilpotent Lie superalgebras L for which s(L) = 1 and 2.
