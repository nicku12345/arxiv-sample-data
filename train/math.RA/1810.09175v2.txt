We give a full description of all sets of functions on the group (\mathbb{ Z}_p, +) of prime order which are closed under the composition with the clone generated by + from both sides. Thereby, we also get a description of all iterative algebras on \mathbb{Z}_p which are closed under the composition with the clone generated by + from both sides. As another consequence, there are infinitely many non finitely generated clones above \operatorname{Clo}({\mathbb{ Z}_p \times \mathbb{ Z}_p, +}) for p > 2.
