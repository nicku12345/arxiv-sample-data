In this paper we study the widely considered endomorphisms and weak endomorphisms of a finite undirected path from monoid generators perspective. Our main aim is to determine the ranks of the monoids wEnd P_n and End P_n of all weak endomorphisms and all endomorphisms of the undirected path P_n with n vertices. We also consider strong and strong weak endomorphisms of P_n.
