We introduce the notion of Hom-co-represention and low-dimensional chain complex. We study universal central extensions of Hom-preLie algebras and generlize some classical results. As the same time, we introduce \alpha-central extensions, universal \alpha-central extensions and \alpha-perfect Hom-preLie algebras. We construct universal (\alpha)-central extensions of Hom-preLie algebras.
