For a postive integer n and a subset S of \mathbb{Z}_n, let \left\langle S\right\rangle =\mathbb{Z}_n, and w:S\rightarrow\mathbb{N} be a function. The weighted Cayley graph of the cyclic group \mathbb{Z}_n with respect to S and w is denoted by C_n(S,w). We give an explicit description of the Grothendieck group of the Leavitt path algebras of C_n(S,w). We also give description of Leavitt path algebras of C_n(S,w) in some special cases.
