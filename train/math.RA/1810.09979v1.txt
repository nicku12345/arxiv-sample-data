This paper is devoted to survey composition algebras and some of their applications.   After overviewing the classical algebras of quaternions and octonions, both unital composition algebras (or Hurwitz algebras) and symmetric composition algebras will be dealt with. Their main properties, as well as their classifications, will be reviewed. Algebraic triality, through the use of symmetric composition algebras, will be considered too.
