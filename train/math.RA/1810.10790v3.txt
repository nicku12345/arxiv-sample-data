As a uniform of two versions of infinitesimal bialgebras introduced respectively by Joni-Rota and Loday-Ronco, weighted infinitesimal bialgebras play an important role in mathematics and mathematical physics. In this paper, we introduce the concept of weighted infinitesimal Hopf modules and show that any module carries a natural structure of weighted infinitesimal unitary Hopf module over a weighted quasitriangular infinitesimal unitary bialgebra. We decorate planar rooted forests H_{\mathrm{RT}}(X, \Omega) in a new way, and prove that the H_{\mathrm{RT}}(X, \Omega), together with a coproduct \Delta_{\epsilon} and grafting operations \{ B^+_\omega \mid \omega\in \Omega\}, is the free \Omega-cocycle infinitesimal unitary bialgebra (resp. Hopf algebra) of weight zero on a set X. A combinatorial description of \Delta_{\epsilon} is given. As applications, we obtain the initial object in the category of cocycle infinitesimal unitary bialgebras (resp. Hopf algebras) on undecorated planar rooted forests, which is the object studied in the (noncommutative) Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra. Finally, we derive two pre-Lie algebras from an arbitrary weighted infinitesimal bialgebra and weighted commutative infinitesimal bialgebra, respectively. The second construction generalizes the Gelfand-Dorfman Theorem on Novikov algebras.
