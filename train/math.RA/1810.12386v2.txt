We study solvable Lie algebras in prime characteristic p that admit non-singular derivations. We show that Jacobson's Theorem remains true if the quotients of the derived series have dimension less than~p. We also study the structure of Lie algebras with non-singular derivations in which the derived subalgebra is abelian and has codimension~one. The paper presents some new examples of solvable, but not nilpotent, Lie algebras of derived length~3 with non-singular derivations.
