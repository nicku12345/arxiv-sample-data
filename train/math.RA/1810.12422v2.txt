A clonoid is a set of finitary functions from a set A to a set B that is closed under taking minors. Hence clonoids are generalizations of clones. By a classical result of Post, there are only countably many clones on a 2-element set. In contrast to that, we present continuum many clonoids for A = B = \{0,1\}. More generally, for any finite set A and any 2-element algebra \mathbf{B}, we give the cardinality of the set of clonoids from A to \mathbf{B} that are closed under the operations of \mathbf{B}.
