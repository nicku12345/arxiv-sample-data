We apply the filtered and graded methods developed in earlier works to find (noncommutative) free group algebras in division rings.   If L is a Lie algebra, we denote by U(L) its universal enveloping algebra. P. M. Cohn constructed a division ring \mathfrak{D}_L that contains U(L). We denote by \mathfrak{D}(L) the division subring of \mathfrak{D}_L generated by U(L).   Let k be a field of characteristic zero and L be a nonabelian Lie k-algebra. If either L is residually nilpotent or U(L) is an Ore domain, we show that \mathfrak{D}(L) contains (noncommutative) free group algebras. In those same cases, if L is equipped with an involution, we are able to prove that the free group algebra in \mathfrak{D}(L) can be chosen generated by symmetric elements in most cases.   Let G be a nonabelian residually torsion-free nilpotent group and k(G) be the division subring of the Malcev-Neumann series ring generated by the group algebra k[G]. If G is equipped with an involution, we show that k(G) contains a (noncommutative) free group algebra generated by symmetric elements.
