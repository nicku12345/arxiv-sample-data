Let H be a semisimple Hopf algebra acting on an Artin-Schelter regular algebra A, homogeneously, inner-faithfully, preserving the grading on A, and so that A is an H-module algebra. When the fixed subring A^H is also AS regular, thus providing a generalization of the Chevalley-Shephard-Todd Theorem, we say that H is a reflection Hopf algebra for A. We show that each of the semisimple Hopf algebras H_{2n^2} of Pansera, and \mathcal{A}_{4m} and \mathcal{B}_{4m} of Masuoka is a reflection Hopf algebra for an AS regular algebra of dimension 2 or 3.
