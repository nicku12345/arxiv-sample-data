In this paper, all (super)algebras are over a field \mathbb{F} of characteristic different from 2, 3. We construct the so-called 5-sequences of cohomology for central extensions of a Lie superalgebra and prove that they are exact. Then we prove that the multipliers of a Lie superalgebra are isomorphic to the second cohomology group with coefficients in the trivial module for the Lie superalgebra under consideration.
