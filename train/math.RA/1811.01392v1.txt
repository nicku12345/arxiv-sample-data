This paper aims at the following results: \begin{enumerate} \item The class of all *-regular rings forms a variety. \item A subdirectly irreducible   *-regular ring R   is faithfully representable   (i.e. isomorphic to a subring of an endomorphisms ring of   vector spaces, where the involution is given by   adjunction with respect to a scalar product on the vector space) if so is its ortholattice of projections. \end{enumerate} This is a short version of the second author's PhD thesis.
