We present an elementary approach in characterizing Lie polynomials in the generators A,B of an algebra with a defining relation that is in the form of a deformed or twisted commutation relation AB=\sigma(BA) where the deformation or twisting map \sigma is a linear polynomial with a slope parameter that is not a root of unity. The class of algebras defined as such encompasses q-deformed Heisenberg algebras, rotation algebras, and some types of q-oscillator algebras whose deformation parameters are not roots of unity, and so we have a general solution for the Lie polynomial characterization problem for these algebras.
