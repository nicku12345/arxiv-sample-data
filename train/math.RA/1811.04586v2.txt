Let H_4 and H_8 be the Sweedler's and Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebras, respectively. In this paper we prove that any Hopf algebra which factorizes through H_8 and H_4 (equivalently, any bicrossed product between the Hopf algebras H_8 and H_4) must be isomorphic to one of the following four Hopf algebras: H_8 \otimes H_4, H_{32,1}, H_{32,2}, H_{32,3}. The set of all matched pair (H_8, H_4, \triangleright, \triangleleft) is explicitly described, and then the associated bicrossed products is given by generators and relations.
