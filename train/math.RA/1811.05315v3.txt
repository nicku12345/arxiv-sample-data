In this paper, we mainly study a class of biderivations and triple homomorphisms on perfect Jordan algebras. Let J be a Jordan algebra and \delta :J \times J \rightarrow J a symmetric biderivation satisfying \delta(w , u \circ v) = w \cdot \delta(u , v), \forall u,v,w \in J. If J is perfect and satisfies Z(J) = \{0\}, then \delta is of the form \delta(x , y) = \gamma(x \circ y) for all x , y \in J, where \gamma \in Cent(J) satisfying z \cdot \gamma(x \circ y) = x \cdot \gamma(y \circ z) + y \cdot \gamma(x \circ z), \forall x , y , z \in J. This is the special case of our main theorem which concerns biderivations having their range in a J-module. What's more, we give an algorithm which can be applied to find biderivations satisfying \delta(w , u \circ v) = w \cdot \delta(u , v), \forall u,v,w \in J on any Jordan algebra. We also show that for a triple homomorphism between perfect Jordan algebras, f(x^{2}) = (f(x))^{2} or f(x^{2}) = -(f(x))^{2}. As an application, such f is a homomorphism if and only if f(x^{2}) = (f(x))^{2}. Moreover, we give an algorithm which can be applied to any Jordan algebra.
