Let \left( H,R\right)  be a finite dimensional semisimple and cosemisimple quasi-triangular Hopf algebra over a field k. In this paper, we give the structure of irreducible objects of the Yetter-Drinfeld module category {} {}_{H}^{H}\mathcal{YD}. Let H_{R} be the Majid's transmuted braided group of \left( H,R\right) , we show that H_{R} is cosemisimple. As a coalgebra, let H_{R}=D_{1}\oplus\cdots\oplus D_{r} be the sum of minimal H-adjoint-stable subcoalgebras. For each i \left( 1\leq i\leq r\right) , we choose a minimal left coideal W_{i} of D_{i}, and we can define the R-adjoint-stable algebra N_{W_{i}} of W_{i}. Using Ostrik's theorem on characterizing module categories over monoidal categories, we prove that V\in{}_{H}^{H}\mathcal{YD} is irreducible if and only if there exists an i \left( 1\leq i\leq r\right)  and an irreducible right N_{W_{i}}-module U_{i}, such that V\cong U_{i}\otimes_{N_{W_{i}}}\left( H\otimes W_{i}\right) .   Our structure theorem generalizes the results of Dijkgraaf-Pasquier-Roche and Gould on Yetter-Drinfeld modules over finite group algebras. If k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic, we stress that the R-adjoint-stable algebra N_{W_{i}} is an algebra over which the dimension of each irreducible right module divides its dimension.
