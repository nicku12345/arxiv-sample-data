We introduce an embedding of the free magma on a set A into the direct product of the free magma on a singleton set and the free semigroup on A. This embedding is then used to prove several theorems related to algebraic independence of subsets of the free non-associative algebra on A. Among these theorems is a generalization of a result due to Kurosh, which states that every subalgebra of a free non-associative algebra is also free.
