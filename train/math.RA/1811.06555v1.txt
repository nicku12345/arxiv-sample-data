We give some statements that are equivalent to the existence of group inverses of Peirce corner matrices of a 2 \times 2 block matrix and its generalized Schur complements. As applications, several new results for the Drazin inverses of the generalized Schur complements and the 2 \times 2 block matrix are obtained and some of them generalize several results in the literature.
