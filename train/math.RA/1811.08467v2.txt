Let \mathcal A = \{A_{ij} \}_{i, j \in \mathcal I}, where \mathcal I is an index set, be a doubly indexed family of matrices, where A_{ij} is n_i \times n_j. For each i \in \mathcal I, let \mathcal V_i be an n_i-dimensional vector space. We say \mathcal A is reducible in the coupled sense if there exist subspaces, \mathcal U_i \subseteq \mathcal V_i, with \mathcal U_i \neq \{0\} for at least one i \in \mathcal I, and \mathcal U_i \neq \mathcal V_i for at least one i, such that A_{ij} (\mathcal U_j) \subseteq \mathcal U_i for all i, j. Let \mathcal B = \{B_{ij} \}_{i, j \in \mathcal I} also be a doubly indexed family of matrices, where B_{ij} is m_i \times m_j. For each i \in \mathcal I, let X_i be a matrix of size n_i \times m_i. Suppose A_{ij} X_j = X_i B_{ij} for all~i, j. We prove versions of Schur's Lemma for \mathcal A, \mathcal B satisfying coupled irreducibility conditions. We also consider a refinement of Schur's Lemma for sets of normal matrices and prove corresponding versions for \mathcal A, \mathcal B satisfying coupled normality and coupled irreducibility conditions.
