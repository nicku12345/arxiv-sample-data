The purpose of this paper is to introduce and study BiHom-alternative algebras and BiHom-Malcev algebras. It is shown that BiHom-alternative algebras are BiHom-Malcev admissible and BiHom-Jordan admissible. Moreover, BiHom-type generalizations of some well known identities in alternative algebras, including the Moufang identities, are obtained.
