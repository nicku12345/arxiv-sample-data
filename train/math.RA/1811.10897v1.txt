We prove that A_R(G) \otimes_R A_R(H) \cong A_R(G \times H), if G and H are Hausdorff ample groupoids. As part of the proof, we give a new universal property of Steinberg algebras. We then consider the isomorphism problem for tensor products of Leavitt algebras, and show that no diagonal-preserving isomorphism exists between L_{2,R} \otimes L_{3,R} and L_{2,R} \otimes L_{2,R}. Indeed, there are no unexpected diagonal-preserving isomorphisms between tensor products of finitely many Leavitt algebras. We give an easy proof that every *-isomorphism of Steinberg algebras over the integers preserves the diagonal, and it follows that L_{2,\mathbb{Z}} \otimes L_{3,\mathbb{Z}} \not \cong L_{2,\mathbb{Z}} \otimes L_{2,\mathbb{Z}} (as *-rings).
