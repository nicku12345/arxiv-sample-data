Isoclinism of Lie superalgebras has been defined and studied currently. In this article it is shown that for finite dimensional Lie superalgebras of same dimension, the notation of isoclinism and isomorphism are equivalent. Furthermore we show that covers of finite dimensional Lie superalgebras are isomorphic using isoclinism concept.
