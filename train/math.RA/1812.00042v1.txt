The Dixmier Conjecture says that every endomorphism of the (first) Weyl algebra A_1 (over a field of characteristic zero) is an automorphism, i.e., if PQ-QP=1 for some P, Q \in A_1 then A_1 = K \langle P, Q \rangle. The Weyl algebra A_1 is a \Z-graded algebra. We prove that the Dixmier Conjecture holds if the elements P and Q are sums of no more than two homogeneous elements of A (there is no restriction on the total degrees of P and Q).
