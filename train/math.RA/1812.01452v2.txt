In this paper, we define a new coproduct on the space of decorated planar rooted forests to equip it with a weighted infinitesimal unitary bialgebraic structure. We introduce the concept of \Omega-cocycle infinitesimal bialgebras of weight \lambda and then prove that the space of decorated planar rooted forests H_{\mathrm{RT}}(X,\Omega), together with a set of grafting operations \{ B^+_\omega \mid \omega\in \Omega\}, is the free \Omega-cocycle infinitesimal unitary bialgebra of weight \lambda on a set X, involving a weighted version of a Hochschild 1-cocycle condition. As an application, we equip a free cocycle infinitesimal unitary bialgebraic structure on the undecorated planar rooted forests, which is the object studied in the well-known (noncommutative) Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra. Finally, we construct a new pre-Lie algebraic structure on decorated planar rooted forests.
