For the n-dimensional multiparameter quantum torus algebra \Lambda_{\mathfrak q} over a field k defined by a multiplicatively antisymmetric matrix \mathfrak q = (q_{ij}) we show that in the case when the torsion-free rank of the subgroup of k^\times generated by the q_{ij} is large enough there is a characteristic set of values (possibly with gaps) from 0 to n that can occur as the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension of simple modules. The special case when \mathrm{K}.\dim(\Lambda_{\mathfrak q}) = n - 1 and \Lambda_{\mathfrak q} is simple studied in A.~Gupta, {\it \uppercase{\mbox{GK}}-dimensions of simple modules over K[X^{\pm 1}, \sigma]}, Comm. Algebra, {\bf 41(7)} (2013), 2593--2597 is considered without assuming simplicity and it is shown that a dichotomy still holds for the GK dimension of simple modules.
