In this paper, we study on the primeness and semiprimeness of a Morita context related to the rings and modules. Necessary and sufficient conditions are investigated for an ideal of a Morita context to be a prime ideal and a semiprime ideal. In particular, we determine the conditions under which a Morita context is prime and semiprime.
