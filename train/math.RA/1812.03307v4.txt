In this short note, we complete a proof of Bergman's centralizer theorem for the free associative algebra using generic matrices approach based on our previous work Alexei Kanel Belov, Farrokh Razavinia, Wenchao Zhang, "Bergman's Centralizer Theorem and quantization", 10 pp., Quantum Algebra (math.QA), 16R50, 13A99, 53D55, Comm. in Algebra, 46:5 (2018), 2123-2129, arXiv: 1708.04802
