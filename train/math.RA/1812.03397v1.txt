A basic theory on the first order right and left linear quaternion differential systems (LQDS) is given systematic in this paper. To proceed the theory of LQDS we adopt the theory of column-row determinants recently introduced by the author. In this paper, the algebraic structure of their general solutions are established. Determinantal representations of solutions of systems with constant coefficient matrices and sources vectors are obtained in both cases when coefficient matrices are invertible and singular. In the last case, we use determinantal representations of the quaternion Drazin inverse within the framework of the theory of column-row determinants.   Numerical examples to illustrate the main results are given.
