In this paper, we study when the kernel of a complete hereditary cotorsion pair is the additive closure of a tilting module. Applications go in three directions. The first is to characterize when the little finitistic dimension is finite. The second is to obtain equivalent formulations for a Wakamatsu tilting module to be a tilting module. The third is to give some new characterizations of Gorenstein rings.
