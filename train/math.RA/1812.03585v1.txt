Let A be a unital associative ring and let T^{(k)} be the two-sided ideal of A generated by all commutators [a_1, a_2, \dots , a_k] (a_i \in A) where [a_1, a_2] = a_1 a_2 - a_2 a_1, [a_1, \dots , a_{k-1}, a_k] = \bigl[ [a_1, \dots , a_{k-1}], a_k \bigr] (k >2). It has been known that, if either m or n is odd then \[ 6 \, [a_1, a_2, \dots , a_m] [b_1, b_2, \dots , b_n] \in T^{(m+n-1)} \] for all a_i, b_j \in A. This was proved by Sharma and Srivastava in 1990 and independently rediscovered later (with different proofs) by various authors. The aim of our note is to give a simple proof of the following result: if at least one of the integers m,n is odd then, for all a_i, b_j \in A, \[ 3 \, [a_1, a_2, \dots , a_m] [b_1, b_2, \dots , b_n] \in T^{(m+n-1)}. \] Since it has been known that, in general, \[ [a_1, a_2, a_3] [b_1, b_2] \notin T^{(4)}, \] our result cannot be improved further for all m, n such that at least one of them is odd.
