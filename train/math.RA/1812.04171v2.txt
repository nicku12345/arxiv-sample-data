Let R be a finite unitary ring such that R=R_0[R^*] where R_0 is the prime ring and R^* is not a nilpotent group. We show that if all proper subgroups of R^* are nilpotent groups, then the cardinal of R is a power of prime number 2. In addition, if (R/Jac(R))^* is not a p-group, then either R\cong M_2(GF(2)) or R\cong M_2(GF(2))\oplus A where M_2(GF(2)) is the ring of 2\times 2 matrices over the finite field GF(2) and A is a direct sum of finite field GF(2).
