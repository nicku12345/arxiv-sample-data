The first part of this article is concerned with proving the symmetric PBW theorem using Magnus commutators. Extensions of the Dynkin--Specht--Wever lemma and a general theorem of Nouaz\'e--Revoy type are also obtained. The second part focuses on free Lie K-algebras and the basic PBW theorem. Appendices are provided in order make the discussion self-contained, and also putting it into context.
