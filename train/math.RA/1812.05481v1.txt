We study polynomial identities satisfied by the mutation product xpy - yqx on the underlying vector space of an associative algebra A where p, q are fixed elements of A. We simplify known results for identities in degree n \le 4, determine three new identities in degree 5, and demonstrate the existence of a large number of new identities in degree 6.
