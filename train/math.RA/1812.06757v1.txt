Let \mathbb{F} be a field, and fix a q\in\mathbb{F}. The q-deformed Heisenberg algebra \mathcal{H}(q) is the unital associative algebra over \mathbb{F} with generators A, B and a relation which asserts that AB - qBA is the multiplicative identity in \mathcal{H}(q). We extend \mathcal{H}(q) into an algebra \mathcal{R}(q) defined by generators A, B and a relation which asserts that AB-qBA is central in \mathcal{R}(q). We identify all elements of \mathcal{R}(q) that are Lie polynomials in A, B.
