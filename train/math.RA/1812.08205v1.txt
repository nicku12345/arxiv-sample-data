Let f be a polynomial in the free algebra over a field K, and let A be a K-algebra. We denote by \S_A(f), \A_A(f) and \I_A(f), respectively, the `verbal' subspace, subalgebra, and ideal, in A, generated by the set of all f-values in A. We begin by studying the following problem: if \S_A(f) is finite-dimensional, is it true that \A_A(f) and \I_A(f) are also finite-dimensional? We then consider the dual to this problem for `marginal' subspaces that are finite-codimensional in A. If f is multilinear, the marginal subspace, \widehat{\S}_A(f), of f in A is the set of all elements z in A such that f evaluates to 0 whenever any of the indeterminates in f is evaluated to z. We conclude by discussing the relationship between the finite-dimensionality of \S_A(f) and the finite-codimensionality of \widehat{\S}_A(f).
