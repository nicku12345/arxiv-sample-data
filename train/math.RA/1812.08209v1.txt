In this paper we give an affirmative answer to two conjectures on generalized (m,n)-Jordan derivations and generalized (m,n)-Jordan centralizers raised in [S. Ali and A. Fo\v{s}ner, \textit{On Generalized (m, n)-Derivations and Generalized (m, n)-Jordan Derivations in Rings,} Algebra Colloq. \textbf{21} (2014), 411--420] and [A. Fo\v{s}ner, \textit{A note on generalized (m,n)-Jordan centralizers,} Demonstratio Math. \textbf{46} (2013), 254--262]. Precisely, when R is a semiprime ring, we prove, under some suitable torsion restrictions, that every nonzero generalized (m,n)-Jordan derivation (resp., a generalized (m,n)-Jordan centralizer) is a derivation (resp., a two-sided centralizer).
