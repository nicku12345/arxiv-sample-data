In a recent paper we proposed the study of aggregation functions on lattices via clone theory approach. Observing that aggregation functions on lattices just correspond to 0,1-monotone clones, we have shown that all aggregation functions on a finite lattice L can be obtained as usual composition of lattice operations \wedge,\vee, and certain unary and binary aggregation functions.   The aim of this paper is to present a generating set for the class of intermediate (or, equivalently, idempotent) aggregation functions. This set consists of lattice operations and certain ternary idempotent aggregation functions.
