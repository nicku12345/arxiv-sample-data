The main aim of this paper is to study aggregation functions on lattices via clone theory approach. Observing that the aggregation functions on lattices just correspond to 0,1-monotone clones, as the main result we show that for any finite n-element lattice L there is a set of at most 2n+2 aggregation functions on L from which the respective clone is generated. Namely, the set of generating aggregation functions consists only of at most n unary functions, at most n binary functions, and lattice operations \wedge,\vee, and all aggregation functions of L are composed of them by usual term composition. Moreover, our approach works also for infinite lattices (such as mostly considered bounded real intervals [a,b]), where in contrast to finite case infinite suprema and (or, equivalently, a kind of limit process) have to be considered.
