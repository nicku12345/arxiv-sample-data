Following a previous work with Boudi, we continue to investigate Bernstein algebras satisfying chain conditions. First, it is shown that a Bernstein algebra (A, \omega) with ascending or descending chain condition on subalgebras is finite-dimensional. We also prove that A is N\oe therian (Artinian) if and only if its barideal N=\ker(\omega) is. Next, as a generalization of Jordan and nuclear Bernstein algebras, we study whether a N\oe therian (Artinian) Bernstein algebra A with a locally nilpotent barideal N is finite-dimensional. The response is affirmative in the N\oe therian case, unlike in the Artinian case. This question is closely related to a result by Zhevlakov on general locally nilpotent nonassociative algebras that are N\oe therian, for which we give a new proof. In particular, we derive that a commutative nilalgebra of nilindex 3 which is N\oe therian or Artinian is finite-dimensional. Finally, we improve and extend some results of Micali and Ouattara to the N\oe therian and Artinian cases.
