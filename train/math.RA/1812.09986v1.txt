The paper is devoted to the study of evolution algebras that are power-associative algebras.   We give the Wedderburn decomposition of evolution algebras that are power-associative algebras and we prove that these algebras are Jordan algebras. Finally, we use this decomposition to classify these algebras up to dimension six.
