We give classifications of group gradings, up to equivalence and up to isomorphism, on the tensor product of a Cayley algebra \mathcal{C} and a Hurwitz algebra over a field of characteristic different from 2. We also prove that the automorphism group schemes of \mathcal{C}^{\otimes n} and \mathcal{C}^n are isomorphic.   On the other hand, we prove that the automorphism group schemes of a Smirnov algebra (a 35-dimensional simple exceptional structurable algebra constructed from a Cayley algebra \mathcal{C}) and \mathcal{C} are isomorphic. This is used to obtain classifications, up to equivalence and up to isomorphism, of the group gradings on Smirnov algebras.
