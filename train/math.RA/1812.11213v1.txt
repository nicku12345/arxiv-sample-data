The classification of graded non-alternating Hamiltonian Lie algebras over perfect field of characteristic 2 is obtained. It is shown that the filtered deformations of such algebras correspond to non-alternating Hamiltonian forms with polynomial coefficients in divided powers. It is proved that graded non-alternating Hamiltonian algebras are rigid with respect to filtered deformations except for some cases when the number of variables is 2, 3, 4 or when the heights of some variables are equal to 1.
