Let K be a field, and A=K[a_1,\ldots ,a_n] a solvable polynomial algebra in the sense of [K-RW, {\it J. Symbolic Comput.}, 9(1990), 1--26]. It is shown that if A is an \mathbb{N}-graded algebra of ({\cal B},d(~))-type, then A has a graded monomial ordering \prec_{gr}. It is also shown that A is an \mathbb{N}-filtered algebra of ({\cal B},d(~))-type if and only if A has a graded momomial ordering, where {\cal B} is the PBW basis of A.
