Given a field F of characteristic 3 and division symbol p-algebras [\alpha,\beta)_{3,F} and [\alpha,\gamma)_{3,F} of degree 3 over F, we prove that if \alpha \text{dlog}(\beta)\wedge \text{dlog}(\gamma) is trivial in the Kato-Milne cohomology group H_3^3(F) then the algebras share a common splitting field which is an inseparable degree 3 extension of either F or a quadratic extension of F. In the special case of quadratically closed fields, if \alpha \text{dlog}(\beta)\wedge \text{dlog}(\gamma)=0, then they share an inseparable degree 3 extension of F.
