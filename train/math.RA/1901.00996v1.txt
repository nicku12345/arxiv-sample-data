We describe associative center N(R) and the center Z(R) of the ring R obtained by applying the generalized Cayley-Dickson construction and we find conditions under which the ring R is N-essential or centrally essential. The obtained results are applied to generalized quaternion rings and octonion rings; we use them to construct an example of a non-associative centrally essential ring.
