Let R be a finite commutative ring with identity. In this paper, we give a necessary condition for the existence of an orthogonal decomposition of the special linear Lie algebra over R. Additionally, we study orthogonal decompositions of the symplectic Lie algebra and the special orthogonal Lie algebra over R.
