The aim of this paper is characterizing right subdirectly irreducible completely 0-simple semigroups. We prove that such semigroups are indeed groups with least nontrivial subgroups. On the other hand we prove that right irreducible completely 0-simple semigroups are groups for which nontrivial subgroups have nontrivial intersection. Ultimately, we characterize the class of uniform acts as an overclass of subdirectly irreducible acts over rectangular bands.
