Let K be a 2-torsion free ring with identity and R_{n}(K,J) be the ring of all n\times n matrices over K such that the entries on and above the main diagonal are elements of an ideal J of K. We describe all Jordan derivations of the matrix ring R_{n}(K,J) in this paper. The main result states that every Jordan derivation \Delta  of R_{n}(K,J) is of the form \Delta =D+\Omega  where D is a derivation of R_{n}(K,J) and \Omega  is an extremal Jordan derivation of R_{n}(K,J).
