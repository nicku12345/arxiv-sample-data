The present paper is devoted to study 2-local derivations on infinite-dimensional Lie algebras over a field of characteristic zero. We prove that all 2-local derivations on the Witt algebra as well as on the positive Witt algebra are (global)derivations, and give an example of infinite-dimensional Lie algebra with a 2-local derivation which is not a derivation.
