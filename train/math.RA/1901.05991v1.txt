As pointed out in the monographs by J. S. Golan and by W. Kuich and A. Salomaa on semirings, ideals play an important role despite the fact that they need not be congruence kernels as in the case of rings. Hence, having two commutative semirings S1 and S2, one can ask whether an ideal I of their direct product S = S1 x S2 can be expressed in the form I1 x I2 where Ij is an ideal of Sj for j=1,2. Of course, the converse is elementary, namely if Ij is an ideal of Sj for j=1,2 then I1 x I2 is an ideal of S1 x S2. Having a congruence on a commutative semiring S, its 0-class is an ideal of S, but not every ideal is of this form. Hence, the lattice Id S of all ideals of S and the lattice Ker S of all congruence kernels (i.e. 0-classes of congruences) of S need not be equal. Furthermore, we show that the mapping which assigns to every congruence its kernel need not be a homomorphism from Con S onto Ker S. Moreover, the question arises when a congruence kernel of the direct product S1 x S2 of two commutative semirings can be expressed as a direct product of the corresponding kernels on the factors. In the paper we present necessary and sufficient conditions for such direct decompositions both for ideals and for congruence kernels of commutative semirings. We also provide sufficient conditions for varieties of commutative semirings to have directly decomposable kernels.
