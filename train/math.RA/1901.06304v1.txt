We begin by investigating the class of commutative unital rings in which no two distinct elements divide the same elements. We prove that this class forms a finitely axiomatizable, relatively ideal distributive quasivariety, and it equals the quasivariety generated by the class of integral domains with trivial unit group. We end the paper by proving a representation theorem that provides more evidence to the conjecture that B\'ezout monoids describe exactly the monoids of finitely generated ideals of commutative unital rings with distributive ideal lattice.
