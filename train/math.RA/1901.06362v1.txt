It is known that an ideal of a direct product of commutative unitary rings is directly decomposable into ideals of the corresponding factors. We show that this does not hold in general for commutative rings and we find necessary and sufficient conditions for direct decomposability of ideals. For varieties of commutative rings we derive a Mal'cev type condition characterizing direct decomposability of ideals and we determine explicitly all varieties satisfying this condition.
