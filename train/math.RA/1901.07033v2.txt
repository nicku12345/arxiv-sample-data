Trusses, defined as sets with a suitable ternary and a binary operations, connected by the distributive laws, are studied from a ring and module theory point of view. The notions of ideals and paragons in trusses are introduced and several constructions of trusses are presented. A full classification of truss structures on the Abelian group of integers is given. Modules over trusses are defined and their basic properties and examples are analysed. In particular, the sufficient and necessary condition for a sub-heap of a module to induce a module structure on the quotient heap is established.
