In this paper, we characterize properly purely infinite Steinberg algebras A_K(\mathcal{G}) for strongly effective, ample Hausdorff groupoids \mathcal{G}. As an application, when \Lambda is a strongly aperiodic k-graph, we show that the notions of pure infiniteness and proper pure infiniteness are equivalent for the Kumjian-Pask algebra \text{KP}_K(\Lambda), which may be determined by the proper infiniteness of vertex idempotents. In particular, for unital cases, we give simple graph-theoretic criteria for the (proper) pure infiniteness of \text{KP}_K(\Lambda).   Furthermore, since the complex Steinberg algebra A_\mathbb{C}(\mathcal{G}) is a dense subalgebra of the reduced groupoid C^*-algebra C^*_r(\mathcal{G}), we focus on the problem that "when does the proper pure infiniteness of A_\mathbb{C}(\mathcal{G}) imply that of C^*_r(\mathcal{G}) in the C^*-sense?". In particular, we show that if the Kumjian-Pask algebra \mathrm{KP}_{\mathbb{C}}(\Lambda) is purely infinite, then so is C^*(\Lambda) in the sense of Kirchberg-R{\o}rdam.
