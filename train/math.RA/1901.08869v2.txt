It was proved by Valenti and Zaicev, in 2011, that, if G is an abelian group and K is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, then any G-grading on the algebra of upper block triangular matrices over K is isomorphic to a tensor product M_n(K)\otimes UT(n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_d), where UT(n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_d) is endowed with an elementary grading and M_n(K) is provided with a division grading.   In this paper, we prove the validity of the same result for a non necessarily commutative group and over an adequate field (characteristic either zero or large enough), not necessarily algebraically closed.
