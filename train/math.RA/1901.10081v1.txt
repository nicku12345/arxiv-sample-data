Which groups can be the group of units in a ring? This open question, posed by L\'{a}szl\'{o} Fuchs in 1960, has been studied by the authors and others with a variety of restrictions on either the class of groups or the class of rings under consideration. In the present work, we investigate Fuchs' problem for the class of p-groups. Ditor provided a solution in the finite, odd-primary case in 1970. Our first main result is that a finite 2-group G is the group of units of a ring of odd characteristic if and only if G is of the form C_8^t \times \prod_{i = 1}^k C_{2^{n_i}}^{s_i}, where t and s_i are non-negative integers and 2^{n_i}+1 is a Fermat prime for all i. We also determine the finite abelian 2-groups of rank at most 2 that are realizable over the class of rings of characteristic 2, and we give some results concerning the realizability of 2-groups in characteristic 0 and 2^n. Finally, we show that the only almost cyclic 2-groups which appear as the group of units in a ring are C_2, C_4, C_8, C_{q-1} (q a Fermat prime), C_2 \times C_{2^n} (n \ge 1), D_8, and Q_8. From this list we obtain the p-groups with periodic cohomology which arise as the group of units in a ring.
