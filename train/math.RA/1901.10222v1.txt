Every Lie algebra over a field E gives rise to new Lie algebras over any subfield F \subseteq E by restricting the scalar multiplication. This paper studies the structure of these underlying Lie algebra in relation to the structure of the original Lie algebra, in particular the question how much of the original Lie algebra can be recovered from its underlying Lie algebra over subfields F. By introducing the conjugate of a Lie algebra we show that in some specific cases the Lie algebra is completely determined by its underlying Lie algebra. Furthermore we construct examples showing that these assumptions are necessary.   As an application, we give for every positive n an example of a real 2-step nilpotent Lie algebra which has exactly n different bi-invariant complex structures. This answers an open question by Di Scala, Lauret and Vezzoni motivated by their work on quasi-K\"ahler Chern-flat manifolds in differential geometry. The methods we develop work for general Lie algebras and for general Galois extensions F \subseteq E, in contrast to the original question which only considered nilpotent Lie algebras of nilpotency class 2 and the field extension \mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{C}. We demonstrate this increased generality by characterizing the complex Lie algebras of dimension \leq 4 which are defined over \mathbb{R} and over \mathbb{Q}.
