Let V denote a vector space with finite positive dimension. We consider an ordered pair of linear transformations A: V\rightarrow V and A^{*}: V\rightarrow V that satisfy (i) and (ii) below.   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A^{*} is diagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A^{*} is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A is diagonal.   We call such a pair a Leonard pair on V. In the literature, there are some parameters that are used to describe Leonard pairs called the intersection numbers \{a_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d}, \{b_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d-1}, \{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{d}, and the dual eigenvalues \{\theta^{*}_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d}. In this paper, we provide two characterizations of Leonard pairs. For the first characterization, the focus is on the \{a_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d} and \{\theta^{*}_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d}. For the second characterization, the focus is on the \{b_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d-1}, \{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{d}, and \{\theta^{*}_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d}.
