A new class of Poisson algebras, the class of {\em generalized Weyl Poisson algebras}, is introduced. It can be seen as Poisson algebra analogue of generalized Weyl algebras or as giving a Poisson structure to (certain) generalized Weyl algebras. A Poisson simplicity criterion is given for generalized Weyl Poisson algebras and explicit descriptions of the Poisson centre and the absolute Poisson centre are obtained. Many examples are considered.
