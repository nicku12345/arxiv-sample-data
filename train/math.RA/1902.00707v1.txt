In this paper, we are interested in a class of modules partaking in the hierarchy of injective and cotorsion modules, so-called Harmanci injective modules, which turn out by the motivation of relations among the concepts of injectivity, flatness and cotorsionness. We give some characterizations and properties of this class of modules. It is shown that the class of all Harmanci injective modules is enveloping, and forms a perfect cotorsion theory with the class of modules whose character modules are Matlis injective. One of the main objectives we pursue is to know when the injective envelope of a ring as a module over itself is a flat module.
