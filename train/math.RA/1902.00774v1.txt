Let L be the Leavitt path algebra of an arbitrary directed graph E over a field K. This survey article describes how this highly non-commutative ring L shares a number of the characterizing properties of a Dedekind domain or a Pr\"ufer domain expressed in terms of their ideal lattices. Special types of ideals such as the prime, the primary, the irreducible and the radical ideals of L are described by means of the graphical properties of E. The existence and the uniqueness of the factorization of a non-zero ideal of L as an irredundant product of prime or primary or irreducible ideals is established. Such factorization always exists for every ideal in L if the graph E is finite or if L is two-sided artinian or two-sided noetherian. In all these factorizations, the graded ideals of L seem to play an important role. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given under which L is a generalized ZPI ring, that is, when every ideal of L is a product of prime ideals. Intersections of various special types of ideals are investigated and an anlogue of Krull's theorem on the intersection of powers of an ideal in L is established.
