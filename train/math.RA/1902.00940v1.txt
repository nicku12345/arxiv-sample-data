If M is an R-module, we study the submodules K\leq M with the property that K is invariant with respect to all monomorphisms K\rightarrow M. Such submodules are called \textsl{strictly invariant}. For the case of % \mathbb{Z}-modules (i.e. Abelian groups) we prove that in many situations these submodules are invariant with respect to all homomorphisms % K\rightarrow M, submodules which were called \textsl{strongly invariant}.
