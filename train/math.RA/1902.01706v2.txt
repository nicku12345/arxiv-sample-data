The paper is devoted to give the complete algebraic classification of nilpotent binary Lie algebras of dimension \leq 6 over an arbitrary base field {\mathbb{F}} of characteristic not 2 and the complete geometric classification of nilpotent binary Lie algebras of dimension 6 over \mathbb C. As an application, we have the algebraic and geometric classification of nilpotent anticommutative \mathfrak{CD}-algebras of dimension \leq 6.
