The affine group scheme of automorphisms of an evolution algebra that is equal to its square, is shown to lie in an exact sequence, such that the other terms depend solely on the directed graph associated to the algebra. As a consequence, the Lie algebra of derivations is shown to be trivial in characteristic 0 or 2, and to be abelian, with a precise description depending just on the graph, otherwise.
