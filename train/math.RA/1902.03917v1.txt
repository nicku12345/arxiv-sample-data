In this paper, we first introduce the notion of a 3-Hom-Lie bialgebra and prove that it is equivalent to a Manin triple of 3-Hom-Lie algebras. Also, we study the \mathcal{O}-operator and construct solutions of the 3-Lie classical Hom-Yang-Baxter equation interms of \mathcal{O}-operators and 3-Hom-pre-Lie algebras. Finally, we show that a 3-Hom-Lie algebra has a phase space if and only if it is sub-adjacent to a 3-Hom-pre-Lie algebra.
