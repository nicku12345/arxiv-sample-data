The present article is a part of the study of solvable Leibniz algebras with a given nilradical. In this paper solvable Leibniz algebras, whose nilradicals is naturally graded p-filiform non-Lie Leibniz algebra (n-p\geq4) and the complemented space to nilradical has maximal dimension, are described up to isomorphism. Moreover, among obtained algebras we indicate the rigid and complete algebras
