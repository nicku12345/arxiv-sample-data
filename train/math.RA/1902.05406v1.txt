The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the zero-divisors of semigroups with zero and semirings and in particular, to discuss eversible and reversible semigroups and semirings. We also introduce a new ring-like algebraic structure called prenearsemiring and generalize Cohn's theorem for reversible rings in this context. Finally, we discuss when expectation semirings are reversible or eversible.
