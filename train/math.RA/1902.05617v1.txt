Let K[X_d]=K[x_1,\ldots,x_d] be the polynomial algebra in d variables over a field K of characteristic 0. The classical theorem of Weitzenb\"ock from 1932 states that for linear locally nilpotent derivations \delta (known as Weitzenb\"ock derivations) the algebra of constants K[X_{d}]^{\delta} is finitely generated. When the Weitzenb\"ock derivation \delta acts on the polynomial algebra K[X_d,Y_d] in 2d variables by \delta(y_i)=x_i, \delta(x_i)=0, i=1,\ldots,d, Nowicki conjectured that K[X_d,Y_d]^{\delta} is generated by X_d and x_iy_j-y_ix_j for all 1\leq i<j\leq d. There are several proofs based on different ideas confirming this conjecture. Considering arbitrary Weitzenb\"ock derivations of the free d-generated metabelian Lie algebra F_d, with few trivial exceptions, the algebra F_d^{\delta} is not finitely generated. However, the vector subspace (F_d')^{\delta} of the commutator ideal F_d' of F_d is finitely generated as a K[X_d]^{\delta}-module. In this paper we study an analogue of the Nowicki conjecture in the Lie algebra setting and give an explicit set of generators of the K[X_d,Y_d]^{\delta}-module (F_{2d}')^{\delta}.
