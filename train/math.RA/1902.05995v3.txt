Both congruence distributive and congruence modular varieties admit Maltsev characterizations by means of the existence of a finite but variable number of appropriate terms. A. Day showed that from J\'onsson terms t_0, \dots, t_n witnessing congruence distributivity it is possible to construct terms u_0, \dots, u _{2n-1}  witnessing congruence modularity. We show that Day's result about the number of such terms is sharp when n is even. We also deal with other kinds of terms, such as alvin, Gumm, directed, specular, mixed and defective.   All the results hold also when restricted to locally finite varieties. We introduce some families of congruence distributive varieties and characterize many congruence identities they satisfy.
