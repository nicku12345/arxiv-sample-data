We examine an argument of Reeder suggesting that the nilpotent infinitesimals in Paolo Giordano's ring extension of the real numbers ^{\bullet}\mathbb{R} are smaller than any infinitesimal hyperreal number from Abraham Robinson's nonstandard analysis ^\ast\mathbb{R}. Our approach consists in the study of two canonical order-preserving homomorphisms taking values in {^{\bullet}\mathbb{R}} and in {^\ast\mathbb{R}}, respectively, and whose domain is Henle's extension of the real numbers in the framework of "non-nonstandard" analysis. In particular, we will show that there exists a nonzero element in Henle's ring that is "too small" to be registered as nonzero in Paolo Giordano's ring, while it is seen as a nonzero infinitesimal in {^\ast\mathbb{R}}. This result suggests that some hyperreal infinitesimals are smaller than the nilpotent infinitesimals. We argue that the apparent contradiction with the conclusions by Reeder is only due to the presence of nilpotent elements in {^{\bullet}\mathbb{R}}.
