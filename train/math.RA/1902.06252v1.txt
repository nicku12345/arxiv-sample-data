Let (H,\alpha) be a monoidal Hom-Hopf algebra and ^{H}_{H}\mathcal{HYD} the Hom-Yetter-Drinfeld category over (H,\alpha). Then in this paper, we first introduce the definition of braided Hom-Lie algebras and show that each monoidal Hom-algebra in ^{H}_{H}\mathcal{HYD} gives rise to a braided Hom-Lie algebra. Second, we prove that if (A,\beta) is a sum of two H-commutative monoidal Hom-subalgebras, then the commutator Hom-ideal [A,A] of A is nilpotent. Also, we study the central invariant of braided Hom-Lie algebras as a generalization of generalized Lie algebras. Finally, we obtain a construction of the enveloping algebras of braided Hom-Lie algebras and show that the enveloping algebras are H-cocommutative Hom-Hopf algerbas.
