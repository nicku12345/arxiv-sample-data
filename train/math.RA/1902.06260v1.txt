The paper introduces the class of split regular BiHom-Poisson superalgebras, which is a natural generalization of split regular Hom-Poisson algebras and split regular BiHom-Lie superalgebras. By developing techniques of connections of roots for this kind of algebras, we show that such a split regular BiHom-Poisson superalgebras A is of the form A=U+\sum_{\a}I_\a with U a subspace of a maximal abelian subalgebra H and any I_{\a}, a well described ideal of A, satisfying [I_\a, I_\b]+I_\a I_\b = 0 if [\a]\neq [\b]. Under certain conditions, in the case of A being of maximal length, the simplicity of the algebra is characterized.
