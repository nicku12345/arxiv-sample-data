We study and classify the 3-dimensional Hom-Lie algebras over \mathbb{C}. We provide first a complete set of representatives for the isomorphism classes of skew-symmetric bilinear products defined on a 3-dimensional complex vector space \mathfrak{g}. The well known Lie brackets for the 3-dimensional Lie algebras are included into appropriate isomorphism classes of such products representatives. For each product representative, we provide a complete set of canonical forms for the linear maps \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g} that turn g into a Hom-Lie algebra, thus characterizing the corresponding isomorphism classes. As by-products, Hom-Lie algebras for which the linear maps \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g} are not homomorphisms for their products, are exhibited. Examples also arise of non-isomorphic families of HomLie algebras which share, however, a fixed Lie-algebra product on \mathfrak{g}. In particular, this is the case for the complex simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C}). Similarly, there are isomorphism classes for which their skew-symmetric bilinear products can never be Lie algebra brackets on \mathfrak{g}.
