We define Leavitt path algebras of hypergraphs generalizing simultaneously Leavitt path algebras of finitely separated graphs and Leavitt path algebras of row-finite vertex-weighted graphs. We find linear bases for those algebras, compute their Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, obtain some results on ring-theoretic properties like simplicity, von Neumann regularity and Noetherianess and investigate their K-theory and graded K-theory. By doing so we obtain new results on the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension and graded K-theory of Leavitt path algebras of separated graphs and on the graded K-theory of weighted Leavitt path algebras.
