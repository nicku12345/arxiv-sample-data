Let \mathbb{F}G denote the group algebra of the group G over the field \mathbb{F} with char(\mathbb{F})\neq 2. Given both a homomorphism \sigma:G\rightarrow \{\pm1\} and a group involution \ast: G\rightarrow G, an oriented involution of \mathbb{F}G is defined by \alpha=\Sigma\alpha_{g}g \mapsto \alpha^\circledast=\Sigma\alpha_{g}\sigma(g)g^{\ast}. In this paper, we determine the conditions under which the group algebra \mathbb{F}G is normal, that is, conditions under which \mathbb{F}G satisfies the \circledast-identity \alpha\alpha^\circledast=\alpha^\circledast\alpha. We prove that \mathbb{F}G is normal if and only if the set of symmetric elements under \circledast is commutative.
