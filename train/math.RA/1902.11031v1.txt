Dimension effect algebras were introduced in (A. Jencova, S. Pulmannova, Rep. Math. Phys. 62 (2008), 205-218), and it was proved that they are unit intervals in dimension groups. We prove that the effect algebra tensor product of dimension effect algebras is a dimension effect algebra, which is the unit interval in the unital abelian po-groups tensor product of the corresponding dimension groups.
