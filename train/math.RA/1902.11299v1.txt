Let Z be the center of a nonnoetherian dimer algebra on a torus. We show that the nilradical \operatorname{nil}Z of Z is prime, may be nonzero, and consists precisely of the central elements that vanish under a cyclic contraction. This implies that the nonnoetherian scheme \operatorname{Spec}Z is irreducible. We also show that the reduced center \hat{Z} = Z/\operatorname{nil}Z embeds into the center R of the corresponding homotopy algebra, and that their normalizations are equal. Finally, we characterize the normality of R, and show that if \hat{Z} is normal, then it has the special form k + J where J is an ideal of the cycle algebra.
