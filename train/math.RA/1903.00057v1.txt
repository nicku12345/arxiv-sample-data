Simple Lie algebras of finite dimension over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 or p> 3 were recently classified. However, the problem over an algebraically closed field of characteristics 2 or 3 there exist only partial results. The first result on the problem of classification of simple Lie algebra of finite dimension over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2 is that these algebras have absolute toral rank greater than or equal to 2. In this paper we show that there are not simple Lie 2-algebras with toral rank 3 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2 and dimension less or equal to 16.
