We give an explicit description of commutative post-Lie algebra structures on some classes of nilpotent Lie algebras. For non-metabelian filiform nilpotent Lie algebras and Lie algebras of strictly upper-triangular matrices we show that all CPA-structures are associative and induce an associated Poisson-admissible algebra.
