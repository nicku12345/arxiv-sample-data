We identify two Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structures, one obtained by Kowalzig and Krahmer on the Hochschild cohomology of an Artin-Schelter regular algebra with semisimple Nakayama automorphism and the other obtained by Lambre, Zhou and Zimmermann on the Hochschild cohomology of a Frobenius algebra also with semisimple Nakayama automorphism, provided that these two algebras are Koszul dual to each other.
