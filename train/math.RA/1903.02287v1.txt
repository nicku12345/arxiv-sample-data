In this article, we introduce a new graph theoretic structure associated with a finite commutative ring, called nil clean divisor graph. For a ring R, nil clean divisor graph is denoted by G_N(R), where the vertex set is \{x\in R\,:\, x\neq 0, \,\exists\, y(\neq 0, \neq x)\in R such that xy is nil clean\}, two vertices x and y are adjacent if xy is a nil clean element. We prove some interesting results of nil clean divisor graph of a ring.
