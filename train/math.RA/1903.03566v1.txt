In this paper, we characterize the local superderivations on Cartan type Lie superalgebras over the complex field \mathbb{C}. Furthermore, we prove that every local superderivations on Cartan type simple Lie superalgebras is a superderivations. As an application, using the results on local superderivations we characterize the 2-local superderivations on Cartan type Lie superalgebras. We prove that every 2-local superderivations on Cartan type Lie superalgebras is a superderivations.
