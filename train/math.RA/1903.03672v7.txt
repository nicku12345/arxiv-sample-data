The purpose of this paper is to show that there are Hom-Lie algebra structures on \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{F}) \oplus \mathbb{F}D, where D is a special type of generalized derivation of \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{F}), and \mathbb{F} is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. It is shown that the generalized derivations D of \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{F}) that we study in this work, satisfy the Hom-Lie Jacobi identity for the Lie bracket of \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{F}). We study the representation theory of Hom-Lie algebras within the appropriate category and prove that any finite dimensional representation of a Hom-Lie algebra of the form \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{F}) \oplus \mathbb{F}D, is completely reducible, in analogy to the well known Theorem of Weyl from the classical Lie theory. We apply this result to characterize the non-solvable Lie algebras having an invertible generalized derivation of the type of D. Finally, using root space decomposition techniques we provide an intrinsic proof of the fact that \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{F}) is the only simple Lie algebra admitting non-trivial Hom-Lie structures.
