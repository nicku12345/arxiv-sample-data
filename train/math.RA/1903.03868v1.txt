In this paper, we introduce the notion of abelian endoregular modules as those modules whose endomorphism rings are abelian von Neumann regular. We characterize an abelian endoregular module M in terms of its M-generated submodules. We prove that if M is an abelian endoregular module then so is every M-generated submodule of M. Also, the case when the (quasi-)injective hull of a module as well as the case when a direct sum of modules is abelian endoregular are presented. At the end, we study abelian endoregular modules as subdirect products of simple modules.
