Let T_n(q) be the ring of lower triangular matrices of order n \geq 2 with entries from the finite field F(q) of order q \geq 2 and let {^2T_n(q)} denote its free left module. For n=2,3 it is shown that the projective line over T_n(q) gives rise to a set of (q+1)^{(n-1)}q^{\frac{3(n-1)(n-2)}{2}} affine planes of order q. The points of such an affine plane are non-free cyclic submodules of {^2T_n(q)} not contained in any non-unimodular free cyclic submodule of {^2T_n(q)} and its lines are points of the projective line. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that each affine plane can be extended to the projective plane of order q, with the `line at infinity' being represented by those free cyclic submodules of {^2T_n(q)} that are generated by non-unimodular pairs. Our approach can straightforwardly be adjusted to address the case of arbitrary n.
