We consider quantum symmetric algebras, FRT bialgebras and, more generally, intertwining algebras for pairs of Hecke symmetries which represent quantum hom-spaces. The paper makes an attempt to investigate Koszulness and Gorensteinness of those graded algebras without a restriction on the parameter q of the Hecke relation used earlier. When q is a root of 1, positive results require a restriction on the indecomposable modules for the Hecke algebras of type A that can occur as direct summands of representations in the tensor powers of the base space.
