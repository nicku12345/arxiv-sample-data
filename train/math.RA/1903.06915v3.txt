This paper is a contribution to the isomorphism problem for universal enveloping algebras of finite-dimensional Lie algebras. We focus on solvable Lie algebras of small dimensions over fields of arbitrary characteristic. We prove, over an arbitrary field, that the isomorphism type of a metabelian Lie algebra whose derived subalgebra has codimension one is determined by its universal enveloping algebra. As an application of the results in this paper, we solve the isomorphism problem for solvable Lie algebras of dimension four over fields of characteristic zero and also point out the problems that occur in prime characteristic.
