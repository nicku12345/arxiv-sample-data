Let T be a \delta-Jordan Lie supertriple system. We first introduce the notions of generalized derivations and representations of T and present some properties. Also, we study the low dimension cohomology and the coboundary operator of T, and then we investigate the deformations and Nijenhuis operators of T by choosing some suitable cohomology.
