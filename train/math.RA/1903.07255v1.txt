The Witt ring W(K) of a field is a central object in the algebraic theory of quadratic forms. In general, we can define a Witt ring for commutative rings with involution. But if (A,\sigma) is a central simple algebra with involution of the first over a field K, we only have Witt groups W^\varepsilon(A,\sigma), mainly because A is not commutative, so there is no appropriate tensor product of modules. We use the fact that there is a hermitian Morita equivalence between (A\otimes_K A,\sigma\otimes \sigma) and (K,Id) to define a commutative graded ring structure on \widetilde{W}(A,\sigma) = W(K) \oplus W^+(A,\sigma)\oplus W^-(A,\sigma), the main difficulty being the associativity. We study the basic properties of this ring (the mixed Witt ring of (A,\sigma)), as well as the mixed Grothendieck-Witt ring \widetilde{GW}(A,\sigma). In particular, \widetilde{GW}(A,\sigma) is a pre-\lambda-ring for some exterior power operations defined through hermitian Morita equivalences. The mixed Witt ring has a fundamental filtration, and the associated graded ring has strong links with modulo 2 Galois cohomology. We also classify the prime ideals of \widetilde{W}(A,\sigma) and relate this to the previous studies on signatures for hermitian forms.
