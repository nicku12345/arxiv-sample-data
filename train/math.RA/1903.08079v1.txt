A module is called coneat injective if it is injective with respect to all coneat exact sequences. The class of such modues is enveloping and falls properly between injectives and pure injectives. Generalizations of coneat injectivity, like relative coneat injectivity and full invariance of a module in its coneat injective envelope, are studied. Using properties of such classes of modules, we characterize certain types of rings like von Neumann regular and right SF-rings. For instance, R is a right SF-ring if and only if every coneat injective left R-module is injective.
