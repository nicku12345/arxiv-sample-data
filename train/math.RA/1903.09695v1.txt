For any nearfield (R,+, \circ), denote by D(R) the set of all distributive elements of R. Let R be a finite Dickson nearfield that arises from Dickson pair (q,n). For a given pair (\alpha, \beta) \in R^2 we study the generalized distributive set  D(\alpha, \beta) where "\circ" is the multiplication of the Dickson nearfield. We find that  D(\alpha, \beta) is not in general a subfield of the finite field \mathbb{F}_{q^n}. In contrast to the situation for D(R), we also find that D(\alpha, \beta) is not in general a subnearfield of R. We obtain sufficient conditions on \alpha, \beta for  D(\alpha, \beta) to be a subfield of \mathbb{F}_{q^n} and derive an algorithm that tests if D(\alpha, \beta) is a subfield of \mathbb{F}_{q^n} or not. We also study the notions of R-dimension, R-basis, seed sets and seed number of R-subgroups of the Beidleman near-vector spaces R^m where m is a positive integer. Finally we determine the maximal R-dimension of gen(v_1,v_2) for v_1,v_2 \in R^m, where gen(v_1,v_2) is the smallest R-subgroup containing the vectors v_1 and v_2.
