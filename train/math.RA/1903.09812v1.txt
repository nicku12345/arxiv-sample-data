In this paper we extend notions of the core inverse, core EP inverse, DMP inverse, and CMP inverse over the quaternion skew-field {\mathbb{H}} and get their determinantal representations within the framework of the theory of column-row determinants previously introduced by the author. Since the Moore-Penrose inverse and the Drazin inverse are necessary tools to represent these generalized inverses, we use their determinantal representations previously obtained by using row-column determinants. As the special case, we give their determinantal representations for matrices with complex entries as well. A numerical example to illustrate the main result is given.
