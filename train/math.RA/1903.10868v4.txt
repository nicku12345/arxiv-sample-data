This paper aims at studying solvable-by-finite and locally solvable maximal subgroups of an almost subnormal subgroup of the general skew linear group \GL_n(D) over a division ring D. It turns out that in the case where D is non-commutative, if such maximal subgroups exist, then either it is abelian or [D:F]<\infty. Also, if F is an infinite field and n\geq 5, then every locally solvable maximal subgroup of a normal subgroup of \GL_n(F) is abelian.
