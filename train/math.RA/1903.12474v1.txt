The goal of this paper is to study the structure of split regular BiHom-Leiniz superalgebras, which is a natural generalization of split regular Hom-Leiniz algebras and split regular BiHom-Lie superalgebras. By developing techniques of connections of roots for this kind of algebras, we show that such a split regular BiHom-Leiniz superalgebras \mathfrak{L} is of the form \mathfrak{L}=U+\sum_{\a}I_\a with U a subspace of a maximal abelian subalgebra H and any I_{\a}, a well described ideal of \mathfrak{L}, satisfying [I_\a, I_\b]= 0 if [\a]\neq [\b]. In the case of \mathfrak{L} being of maximal length, the simplicity of \mathfrak{L} is also characterized in terms of connections of roots.
