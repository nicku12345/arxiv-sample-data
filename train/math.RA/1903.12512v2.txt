In the first part of this article we prove that one of the conditions required in the original definition of nearly Frobenius algebra, the coassociativity, is redundant. Also, we determine the Frobenius dimension of the product and tensor product of two nearly Frobenius algebras from the Frobenius dimension of each of them. We apply these results to semisimple algebras.   In the second part we introduce the notion of normalized nearly Frobenius algebra. We prove a series of equivalences: the concept of normalized nearly Frobenius algebra is equivalent to the concept of separable algebra, equivalent to the fact that the algebra is projective as a bimodule on itself and, finally, equivalent to the category of bimodules is semisimple. Also, we relate these concepts with the property of semisimplicity of the category of modules over the algebra.
