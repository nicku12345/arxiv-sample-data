Clifford algebras are an active area of mathematical research. The main objective of the paper is to exhibit a construction of a matrix algebra isomorphic to a Clifford algebra of signature (p,q), which can be automatically implemented using general purpose linear algebra software. While this is not the most economical way of implementation for lower-dimensional algebras it offers a transparent mechanism of translation between a Clifford algebra and its isomorphic faithful real matrix representation. Examples of lower dimensional Clifford algebras are presented.
