The genus gen(D) of a finite-dimensional central division algebra D over a field F is defined as the collection of classes [D']\in Br(F), where D' is a central division F-algebra having the same maximal subfields as D. We show that the fact that quaternion division algebras D and D' have the same maximal subfields does not imply that the matrix algebras M_l(D) and M_l(D') have the same maximal subfields for l>1. Moreover, for any odd n>1, we construct a field L such that there are two quaternion division L-algebras D and D' and a central division L-algebra C of degree and exponent n such that gen(D) = gen(D') but gen(D \otimes C) \ne gen(D' \otimes C).
