Given a subdirectly irreducible *-regular ring R, we show that R is a homomorphic image of a regular *-subring of an ultraproduct of the (simple) eRe, e in the minimal ideal of R; moreover, R (with unit) is directly finite if all eRe are unit-regular. Finally, unit-regularity is shown for every member of the variety generated by artinian *-regular rings (endowed with unit and pseudo-inversion).
