We study the Zariski cancellation problem for Poisson algebras asking whether A[t]\cong B[t] implies A\cong B when A and B are Poisson algebras. We resolve this affirmatively in the cases when A and B are both connected graded Poisson algebras finitely generated in degree one without degree one Poisson central elements and when A is a Poisson integral domain of Krull dimension two with nontrivial Poisson bracket. We further introduce Poisson analogues of the Makar-Limanov invariant and the discriminant to deal with the Zariski cancellation problem for other families of Poisson algebras.
