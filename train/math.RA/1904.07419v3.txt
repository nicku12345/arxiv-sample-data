Let G be a finite group of order n, and Z_G=\mathbb{Z}\langle\zeta_{i,g}\mid g\in G,\ i=1,2,\dots,n\rangle be the free generic algebra, with canonical action of G according to (\zeta_{i,g})^x=\zeta_{i,x^{-1}g}. It is proved that there exists a positive integer \upsilon(G) such that for any g_1,g_2,\dots, g_{n}\in G  \upsilon(G)\cdot \zeta_{1,g_1}\zeta_{2,g_2}\dots\zeta_{n,g_{n}}=\sum_{i=1}^N \gamma_i a_i\mathbf{tr}_G(b_i)c_i,  where \gamma_1,\gamma_2,\dots,\gamma_N are integers, and a_i, b_i, c_i are monomials in \zeta_{i,g} such that {\rm deg}(b_i)>0 and {\rm deg}(a_i)+{\rm deg}(b_i)+{\rm deg}(c_i)=n. As a consequence, if R is a ring (not necessarily unital) acted on by G, then the product \upsilon(G)\cdot R^{n} is contained in the ideal \langle\mathbf{tr}_G(R)\rangle generated by all traces \mathbf{tr}_G(r)=\sum\limits_{g\in G}r^g, r\in R. This gives the best possible nilpotence bound in Bergman-Isaacs theorem for finite group actions on non-commutative rings, which was a long standing problem. The main result was obtained by transferring the problem to certain family of Cayley graphs, and estimating their minimal eigenvalues by the clique numbers. It is proved that the clique number \omega(\Gamma) of any k-regular graph \Gamma admits the Delsarte upper bound \omega(\Gamma)\leqslant\lfloor1-k/\lambda_{\rm min}\rfloor.
