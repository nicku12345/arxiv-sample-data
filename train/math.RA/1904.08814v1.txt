We define a bi-skew brace to be a set G with two group operations \star and \circ so that (G, \circ, \star) is a skew brace with additive group (G, \star) and also with additive group (G, \circ). If G is a skew brace, then G corresponds to a Hopf Galois structure of type (G, \star) on any Galois extension of fields with Galois group isomorphic to (G, \circ). If G is a bi-skew brace, then G also corresponds to a Hopf Galois structure of type (G, \circ) on a Galois extension of fields with Galois group isomorphic to (G, \star). Many non-trivial examples exist. One source is radical rings A with A^3 = 0, where one of the groups is abelian and the other need not be. The left braces of degree p^3 classified by Bachiller are bi-skew braces if and only they are radical rings. A different source of bi-skew braces is semidirect products of arbitrary finite groups, which yield many examples where both groups are non-abelian, and a skew brace proof of a result of Crespo, Rio and Vela that if G = H\rtimes J is a semidirect product of finite groups, then a Galois extension of fields with Galois group G has a Hopf Galois structure of type H \times J.
