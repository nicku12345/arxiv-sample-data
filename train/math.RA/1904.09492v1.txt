Let S be an integral domain with field of fractions F and let A be an F-algebra. An S-subalgebra R of A is called S-nice if R is lying over S and the localization of R with respect to S \setminus \{ 0 \} is A. Let \mathbb S be the set of all S-nice subalgebras of A. We define a notion of open sets on \mathbb S which makes this set a T_0 Alexandroff space. This enables us to study the algebraic structure of \mathbb S from the point of view of topology. We prove that an irreducible subset of \mathbb S has a supremum with respect to the specialization order. We present equivalent conditions for an open set of \mathbb S to be irreducible, and characterize the irreducible components of \mathbb S
