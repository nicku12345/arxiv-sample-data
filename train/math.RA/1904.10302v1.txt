In this paper, the class of quasicomplemented residuated lattices is introduced and investigated, as a subclass of residuated lattices in which any prime filter not containing any dense element is a minimal prime filter. The notion of disjunctive residuated lattices is introduced and it is observed that a residuated lattice is Boolean if and only if it is disjunctive and quasicomplemented. Finally, some characterizations for quasicomplemented residuated lattices are given by means of the new notion of \alpha-filters.
