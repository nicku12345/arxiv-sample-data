Let k be a field containing an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. If G is a finite group and D is a division algebra over k, finite dimensional over its center, we can associate to a faithful G-grading on D a normal abelian subgroup H, a positive integer d and an element of Hom(M(H), k^\times)^G, where M(H) is the Schur multiplier of H. Our main theorem is the converse: Given an extension 1\rightarrow H\rightarrow G\rightarrow G/H\rightarrow 1, where H is abelian, a positive integer d, and an element of Hom(M(H), k^\times)^G, there is a division algebra with center containing k that realizes these data. We apply this result to classify the G-simple algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero that admit a division algebra form over a field containing an algebraically closed field.
