The aim of this paper is to study the structures of split regular Hom-Lie Rinehart algebras. Let (L,A) be a split regular Hom-Lie Rinehart algebra. We first show that L is of the form L=U+\sum_{[\gamma]\in\Gamma/\thicksim}I_{[\gamma]} with U a vector space complement in H and I_{[\gamma]} are well described ideals of L  satisfying I_{[\gamma]},I_{[\delta]}=0 if I_{[\gamma]}\neq I_{[\delta]}. Also, we discuss the weight spaces and decompositions of A and present the relation between the decompositions of L and A. Finally, we consider the structures of tight split regular Hom-Lie Rinehart algebras.
