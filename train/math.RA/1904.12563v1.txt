We define a nonassociative generalization of cyclic Azumaya algebras employing skew polynomial rings D[t;\sigma], where D is an Azumaya algebra of constant rank with center C and \sigma an automorphism of D, such that \sigma|_{C} has finite order. The automorphisms of these algebras are canonically induced by ring automorphisms of the skew polynomial ring D[t;\sigma] used in their construction. We achieve a description of their inner automorphisms. Results on the automorphisms of classical Azumaya algebras and central simple algebras of this type are obtained as special cases.
