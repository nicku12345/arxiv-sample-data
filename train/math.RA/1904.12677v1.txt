The Gelfand-Kirillov dimension measures the asymptotic growth rate of algebras. For every associative dialgebra \mathcal{D}, the quotient \mathcal{A}_\mathcal{D}:=\mathcal{D}/\mathsf{Id}(S), where \mathsf{Id}(S) is the ideal of \mathcal{D} generated by the set S:=\{x \vdash y-x\dashv y \mid x,y\in \mathcal{D}\}, is called the associative algebra associated to \mathcal{D}. Here we show that the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension of \mathcal{D} is bounded above by twice the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension of \mathcal{A}_\mathcal{D}. Moreover, we prove that no associative dialgebra has Gelfand-Kirillov dimension strictly between 1 and 2.
