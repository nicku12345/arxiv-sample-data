We present here a theory of noncommutative cross-ratio, Schwarz derivative and their connections and relations to the operator cross-ratio. We apply the theory to "noncommutative elementary geometry" and relate it to noncommutative integrable systems. We also provide a noncommutative version of the celebrated "pentagramma mirificum".
