We define an algebra A to be centrally stable if, for every epimorhism \varphi from A to another algebra B, the center Z(B) of B is equal to \varphi(Z(A)), the image of the center of A. After providing some examples and basic observations, we consider in somewhat greater detail central stability in tensor products of algebras, and finally establish our main result which states that a finite-dimensional unital algebra A over a perfect field F is centrally stable if and only if A is isomorphic to a direct product of algebras of the form C_i\otimes_{F_i}A_i, where F_i is a field extension of F, C_i is a commutative F_i-algebra, and A_i is a central simple F_i-algebra.
