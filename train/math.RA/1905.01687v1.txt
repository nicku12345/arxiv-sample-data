A complex fuzzy Lie algebra is a fuzzy Lie algebra whose membership function takes values in the unit circle in the complex plane. In this paper, we deine the complex fuzzy Lie subalgebras and complex fuzzy ideals of Lie algebras. Then, we investigate some of characteristics of complex fuzzy Lie subalgebras. The relationship between complex fuzzy Lie subalgebras and fuzzy Lie subalgebras is also investigated. Finally, we define the image and the inverse image of complex fuzzy Lie subalgebra under Lie algebra homomorphism. The properties of complex fuzzy Lie subalgebras and complex fuzzy ideals under homomorphisms of Lie algebras are studied.
