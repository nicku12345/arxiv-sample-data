Let k be an algebraically closed field and A a \mathbb{Z}-graded finitely generated simple k-algebra which is a domain of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 2. We show that the category of \mathbb{Z}-graded right A-modules is equivalent to the category of quasicoherent sheaves on a certain quotient stack. The theory of these simple algebras is closely related to that of a class of generalized Weyl algebras (GWAs). We prove a translation principle for the noncommutative schemes of these GWAs, shedding new light on the classical translation principle for the infinite-dimensional primitive quotients of U(\mathfrak{sl}_2).
