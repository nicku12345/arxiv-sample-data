The purpose of this paper is to study the relationships between a BiHom-Lie superalgebras and its induced 3-BiHom-Lie superalgebras. We introduce the notion of (\alpha^s,\beta^r)-derivation, (\alpha^s,\beta^r)-quasiderivation and generalized (\alpha^s,\beta^r)-derivation of 3-BiHom-Lie superalgebras, and their relation with derivation of BiHom-Lie superalgebras. We introduce also the concepts of Rota-Baxter operators and Nijenhuis Operators of BiHom 3-Lie superalgebras. We also explore the construction of 3-BiHom-Lie superalgebras by using Rota-Baxter of BiHom-Lie superalgebras.
