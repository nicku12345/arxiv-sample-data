Let E be a Koszul Frobenius algebra. A Clifford deformation of E is a finite dimensional \mathbb Z_2-graded algebra E(\theta), which corresponds to a noncommutative quadric hypersurface E^!/(z), for some central regular element z\in E^!_2. It turns out that the bounded derived category D^b(\text{gr}_{\mathbb Z_2}E(\theta)) is equivalent to the stable category of the maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over E^!/(z) provided that E^! is noetherian. As a consequence, E^!/(z) is a noncommutative isolated singularity if and only if the corresponding Clifford deformation E(\theta) is a semisimple \mathbb Z_2-graded algebra. The preceding equivalence of triangulated categories also indicates that Clifford deformations of trivial extensions of a Koszul Frobenius algebra are related to the Kn\"{o}rrer Periodicity Theorem for quadric hypersurfaces. As an application, we recover Kn\"{o}rrer Periodicity Theorem without using of matrix factorizations.
