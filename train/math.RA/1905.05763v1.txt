We describe types of double magma associated with Ward quasigroups, double Ward quasigroups, their duals and the groups they generate. Ward quasigroup double magma and unipotent, right modular, left unital double magma are proved to be improper. Necessary and sufficient conditions are found on a pair of right modular, left unital magma (and right-left unital magma) for them to form a double magma. We give further insight into the intimate connection between mediality and the interchange law by proving that a quasigroup is medial if and only if any pair of its parastrophic binary operations satisfy the interchange law.
