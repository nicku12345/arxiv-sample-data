The symbol length of {_pBr}(k(\!(\alpha_1)\!)\dots(\!(\alpha_n)\!)) for an algebraically closed field k of \operatorname{char}(k) \neq p is known to be \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor. We prove that the symbol length for the case of \operatorname{char}(k) = p is rather n-1. We also show that pairs of anisotropic quadratic or bilinear n-fold Pfister forms over this field need not share an (n-1)-fold factor.
