In 1973, Gauger proposed a generator-relation method and a duality theory for two-step nilpotent Lie algebras. Based upon these, he classified two-step nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 8. In 1999, Galitski and Timashev continued this approach to classify two-step nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 9. Their results were partially improved by Ren and Zhu in 2011, Yan and Deng in 2013. Some decomposable two-step nilpotent Lie algebras were excluded in the case of dimension 8. In this paper, we define generating hypergraph for a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra. The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra is decomposable if and only if its generating hypergraph is not connected under certain bases. Using this result, we identify some decomposable two-step nilpotent Lie algebras in dimension 9. We give a direct proof that the five two-step nilpotent Lie algebras for dimension 8, classified by Ren and Zhu in 2011, are all indecomposable. We also introduce a conventional nomenclature for two-step nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension n = 8, 9, classified by Ren, Zhu, Yan and Deng, etc.
