We continue the algebraic study of almost inner derivations of Lie algebras over a field of characteristic zero and determine these derivations for free nilpotent Lie algebras, for almost abelian Lie algebras, for Lie algebras whose solvable radical is abelian and for several classes of filiform nilpotent Lie algebras. We find a family of n-dimensional characteristically nilpotent filiform Lie algebras \mathfrak{f}_n, for all n\ge 13, all of whose derivations are almost inner. Finally we compare the almost inner derivations of Lie algebras considered over two different fields K\supseteq k for a finite-dimensional field extension.
