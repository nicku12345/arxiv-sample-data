We introduce the notion of Krull super-dimension of a super-commutative super-ring. This notion is used to describe regular super-rings and calculate Krull super-dimensions of completions of super-rings. Moreover, we use this notion to introduce the notion of super-dimension of any irreducible superscheme of finite type. Finally, we describe nonsingular superschemes in terms of sheaves of K\"{a}hler superdifferentials.
