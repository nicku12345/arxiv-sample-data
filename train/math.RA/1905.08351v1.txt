Let V_k be a k-dimensional vector space with a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form over a field K of characteristic 0 and let C_k be the Clifford algebra on V_k. We study the weak polynomial identities of the pair (C_k,V_k). We establish that all they follow from [x_1^2,x_2]=0 when k=\infty and from [x_1^2,x_2]=0 and S_{k+1}(x_1,\ldots,x_{k+1})=0 when k<\infty. We also prove that the weak identity [x_1^2,x_2]=0 satisfies the Specht property. As a consequence we obtain a new proof of the theorem of Razmyslov that the weak Lie polynomial identities of the pair (M_2(K),sl_2(K)) follow from [x_1^2,x_2]=0.
