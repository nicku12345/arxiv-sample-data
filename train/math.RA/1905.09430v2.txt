Parallel to operated algebras built on top of planar rooted trees via the grafting operator B^+, we introduce and study \vee-algebras and more generally \vee_\Omega-algebras based on planar binary trees. Involving an analogy of the Hochschild 1-cocycle condition, cocycle \vee_\Omega-bialgebras (resp.~\vee_\Omega-Hopf algebras) are also introduced and their free objects are constructed via decorated planar binary trees. As a special case, the well-known Loday-Ronco Hopf algebra H_{LR} is a free cocycle \vee-Hopf algebra. By means of admissible cuts, a combinatorial description of the coproduct \Delta_{LR(\Omega)} on decorated planar binary trees is given, as in the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra by admissible cuts.
