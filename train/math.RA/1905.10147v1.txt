In this paper we study symmetric Leibniz and related algebras, namely symmetric dialgebras and symmetric Perm-algebras. We also calculate their Koszul duals, if not known. This will give us Lie-admissible algebras and new types of algebras, which we call commutative and associative admissible algebras. Finally we prove that all operads describing the considered algebras are Koszul.
