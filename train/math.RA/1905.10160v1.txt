We identify largest ideals in Leavitt path algebras: the largest locally left/right artinian (which is the largest semisimple one), the largest locally left/right noetherian without minimal idempotents, the largest exchange, and the largest purely infinite. This last ideal is described as a direct sum of purely infinite simple pieces plus purely infinite non-simple and non-decomposable pieces. The invariance under ring isomorphisms of these ideals is also studied.
