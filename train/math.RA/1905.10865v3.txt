We raise the following general question regarding a ring graded by a group: "If P is a ring-theoretic property, how does one define the graded version P_{\operatorname{gr}} of the property P in a meaningful way?". Some properties of rings have straightforward and unambiguous generalizations to their graded versions and these generalizations satisfy all the matching properties of the nongraded case. If P is either being unit-regular, having stable range 1 or being directly finite, that is not the case. The first part of the paper addresses this issue. Searching for appropriate generalizations, we consider graded versions of cancellation, internal cancellation, substitution, and module-theoretic direct finiteness.   In the second part of the paper, we turn to Leavitt path algebras. If K is a trivially graded field and E is an oriented graph, the Leavitt path algebra L_K(E) is naturally graded by the ring of integers. If E is a finite graph, we present a property of E which is equivalent with L_K(E) being graded unit-regular. This property critically depends on the lengths of paths to cycles making it stand out from other known graph conditions which characterize algebraic properties of L_K(E). It also further illustrates that graded unit-regularity is quite restrictive in comparison to the alternative generalization of unit-regularity which we consider in the first part of the paper.
