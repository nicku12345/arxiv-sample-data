In this paper we derive a representation of an arbitrary real matrix M as the difference of a real matrix A and the transpose of its inverse. This expression may prove useful for progressing beyond known results for which the appearance of transpose-inverse terms prove to be obstacles, particularly in control theory and related applications such as computational simulation and analysis of matrix representations of articulated figures.
