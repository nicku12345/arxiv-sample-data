The Bitableax correspondence isomorphism/Koszul map Theorem (BCK Theorem, for short, Theorem 6.5 below) describes a relevant pair of mutually inverse vector space isomorphisms, the Koszul map K : U(gl(n))-> Sym(gl(n)) and the bitableaux correspondence iWe describe a linear \emph{equivariant isomorphism} \mathcal{K} from the enveloping algebra \mathbf{U}(gl(n)) to the algebra {\mathbb C}[M_{n,n}] \cong \mathbf{Sym}(gl(n)) of polynomials in the entries of a ``generic'' square matrix of order n. The isomorphism \mathcal{K} maps any {\textit{Capelli bitableau}} [S|T] in \mathbf{U}(gl(n)) to the {\textit{(determinantal) bitableau}} (S|T) in {\mathbb C}[M_{n,n}] and any {\textit{Capelli *-bitableau}} [S|T]^* in \mathbf{U}(gl(n)) to the {\textit{(permanental) *-bitableau}} (S|T)^* in {\mathbb C}[M_{n,n}]. These results are far-reaching generalizations of the pioneering result of J.-L. Koszul [19] on the Capelli determinant in \mathbf{U}(gl(n)) (see, e.g. [24], [27]). We introduce {\textit{column}} Capelli bitableaux and *-bitableaux in Section 6; since they are mapped by the isomorphism \mathcal{K} to {\textit{monomials}} in {\mathbb C}[M_{n,n}], this isomorphism can be regarded as a sharpened version of the PBW isomorphism for the enveloping algebra \mathbf{U}(gl(n)). Since the center \boldsymbol{\zeta}(n) of \mathbf{U}(gl(n)) equals the subalgebra of invariants \mathbf{U}(gl(n))^{Ad_{gl(n)}}, then  \mathcal{K} \big[ \boldsymbol{\zeta}(n) \big] = {\mathbb C}[M_{n,n}]^{ad_{gl(n)}}. somorphism B : Sym(gl(n)) -> U(gl(n)) that deeply link the enveloping algebra U(gl(n)) of the general linear Lie algebra gl(n) and the symmetric algebra Sym(gl(n)). The BCK Theorem can be regarded as a sharpened version of the PBW Theorem for the enveloping algebra U(gl(n)).
