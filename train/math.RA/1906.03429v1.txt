A generalized matrix function is a generalization of determinant and permanent function. In this paper, we introduced the formula for the value of a generalized matrix function of a linear sum of permutation matrices. We show that a linear sum of permutation matrices satisfies the permanent dominance conjecture. Finally, we apply the result to some cousins of permutation matrices.
