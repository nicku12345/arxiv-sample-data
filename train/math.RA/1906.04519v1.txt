In this paper we introduce the concept of morphisms of K\"ahler-Poisson algebras and study their algebraic properties. In particular, we find conditions, in terms of the metric, for two algebras to be isomorphic, and we introduce direct sums and tensor products of K\"ahler-Poisson algebras. We provide detailed examples to illustrate the novel concepts.
