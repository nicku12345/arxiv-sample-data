Let K denote the contact Lie superalgebra K(m,n;\underline{t}) over a field of characteristic p>3, which has a finite \mathbb{Z}-graded structure. Let T_K be the canonical torus of K, which is an abelian subalgebra of K_{0} and operates on K_{-1} by semisimple endomorphisms. Utilizing the weight space decomposition of K with respect to T_K, %we show the action of the skew-symmetric super-biderivation on the elements of T and the contact of K. %Moreover, we prove that each skew-symmetric super-biderivation of K is inner.
