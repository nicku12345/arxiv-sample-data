In this paper, we give some properties of generalized derivation algebras of Hom-Jordan algebras. In particular, we show that GDer(V) = QDer(V) + QC(V), the sum of the quasiderivation algebra and the quasicentroid. We also prove that QDer(V) can be embedded as derivations into a larger Hom-Jordan algebra. General results on centroids of Hom-Jordan algebras are also developed in this paper.
