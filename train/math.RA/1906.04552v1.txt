In this paper, we mainly study the derivation algebras of semi-simple Jordan algebras over a field of characteristic 0 and give sufficient and necessary conditions that the derivation algebras of them are simple. As an application, we prove that for a semi-simple Jordan algebra J, TDer(Der(J)) = Der(Der(J)) = ad(Der(J)) under some assumptions. Moreover, we also show that for a semi-simple Jordan algebra J which has a finite basis over a field of characteristic 0, TDer(J) = Der(J) = Inn(J). This is a corollary about our theorem which concerns Jordan algebras with unit.
