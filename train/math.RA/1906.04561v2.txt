In this paper, we mainly study structure of multiplicative simple Hom-Jordan algebras. We talk about equivalent conditions for multiplicative Hom-Jordan algebras being solvable, simple and semi-simple. As an application, we give a theorem about classification of multiplicative simple Hom-Jordan algebras. Moreover, some propositions about bimodules of multiplicative Hom-Jordan algebras are also displayed.
