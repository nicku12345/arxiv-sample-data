The purpose of this paper is to study the structure and the algebraic varieties of Hom-associative algebras. We give characterize multiplicative simple Hom-associative algebras and show some examples deforming the 2\times 2-matrix algebra to simple Hom-associative algebras. We provide a classification of n-dimensional Hom-associative algebras for n\leq3. Then study their derivations and compute small Hom-Type Hochschild cohomology groups. Furthermore, we discuss their irreducible components.
