We give an explicit formula showing how the double Poisson algebra introduced in \cite{VdB} appears as a particular part of a pre-Calabi-Yau structure, i.e. cyclically invariant, with respect to the natural inner form, solution of the Maurer-Cartan equation on A\oplus A^*. Specific part of this solution is described, which is in one-to-one correspondence with the double Poisson algebra structures. The result holds for any associative algebra A and emphasizes the special role of the fourth component of a pre-Calabi-Yau structure in this respect. As a consequence we have that appropriate pre-Calabi-Yau structures induce a Poisson brackets on representation spaces ({\rm Rep}_n A)^{Gl_n} for any associative algebra A.
