We develop the theory of the higher commutator for Taylor varieties. A new higher commutator operation called the hypercommutator is defined using a type of invariant relation called a higher dimensional congruence. The hypercommutator is shown to be symmetric and satisfy an inequality relating nested terms. For a Taylor algebra the term condition higher commutator and the hypercommutator are equal when evaluated at a constant tuple, and it follows that every supernilpotent Taylor algebra is nilpotent. We end with a characterization of congruence meet-semidistributive varieties in terms of the neutrality of the higher commutator.
