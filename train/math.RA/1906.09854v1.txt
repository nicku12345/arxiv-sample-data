We introduce post-associative algebra structures and study their relationship to post-Lie algebra structures, Rota--Baxter operators and decompositions of associative algebras and Lie algebras. We show several results on the existence of such structures. In particular we prove that there exists no post-Lie algebra structure on a pair (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n}), where \mathfrak{n} is a simple Lie algebra and \mathfrak{g} is a reductive Lie algebra, which is not isomorphic to \mathfrak{n}. We also show that there is no post-associative algebra structure on a pair (A,B) arising from a Rota--Baxter operator of B, where A is a semisimple associative algebra and B is not semisimple. The proofs use results on Rota--Baxter operators and decompositions of algebras.
