Let \mathbb{K} denote an algebraically closed field and let V denote a vector space over \mathbb{K} with finite positive dimension. Let A,A^* denote a tridiagonal pair on V. We assume that A,A^* belongs to a family of tridiagonal pairs said to have q-Racah type. Let \{U_i\}_{i=0}^d and \{U_i^\Downarrow\}_{i=0}^{d} denote the first and second split decompositions of V. In an earlier paper we introduced a double lowering operator \psi:V\to V with the notable feature that both \psi U_i\subseteq U_{i-1} and \psi U_i^\Downarrow\subseteq U_{i-1}^\Downarrow for 0\leq i\leq d, where U_{-1}=0 and U_{-1}^\Downarrow=0. In the same paper, we showed that there exists a unique linear transformation \Delta:V\to V such that \Delta(U_i)\subseteq U_i^{\Downarrow} and (\Delta -I)U_i\subseteq U_0+U_1+\cdots +U_{i-1} for 0\leq i \leq d. In the present paper, we show that \Delta can be expressed as a product of two linear transformations; one is a q-exponential in \psi and the other is a q^{-1}-exponential in \psi. We view \Delta as a transition matrix from the first split decomposition of V to the second. Consequently, we view the q^{-1}-exponential in \psi as a transition matrix from the first split decomposition to a decomposition of V which we interpret as a kind of halfway point. This halfway point turns out to be the eigenspace decomposition of a certain linear transformation \mathcal{M}. We discuss the eigenspace decomposition of \mathcal{M} and give the actions of various operators on this decomposition.
