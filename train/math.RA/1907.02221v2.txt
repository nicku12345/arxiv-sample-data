The Frobenius-Perron theory of an endofunctor of a \Bbbk-linear category (recently introduced in \cite{CG}) provides new invariants for abelian and triangulated categories. Here we study Frobenius-Perron type invariants for derived categories of commutative and noncommutative projective schemes. In particular, we calculate the Frobenius-Perron dimension for domestic and tubular weighted projective lines, define Frobenius-Perron generalizations of Calabi-Yau and Kodaira dimensions, and provide examples. We apply this theory to the derived categories associated to certain Artin-Schelter regular and finite-dimensional algebras.
