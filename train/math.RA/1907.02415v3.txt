Let \mathfrak{g} be a finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra and \textrm{HLie}_{m}(\mathfrak{g}) be the affine variety of all multiplicative Hom-Lie algebras on \mathfrak{g}. We use a method of computational ideal theory to describe \textrm{HLie}_{m}(\mathfrak{gl}_{n}(\mathbb{C})), showing that \textrm{HLie}_{m}(\mathfrak{gl}_{2}(\mathbb{C})) consists of two 1-dimensional and one 3-dimensional irreducible components, and showing that \textrm{HLie}_{m}(\mathfrak{gl}_{n}(\mathbb{C}))=\{\textrm{diag}\{\delta,\dots,\delta,a\}\mid \delta=1\textrm{ or }0,a\in\mathbb{C}\} for n\geqslant 3. We construct a new family of multiplicative Hom-Lie algebras on the Heisenberg Lie algebra \mathfrak{h}_{2n+1}(\mathbb{C}) and characterize the affine varieties \textrm{HLie}_{m}(\mathfrak{u}_{2}(\mathbb{C})) and \textrm{HLie}_{m}(\mathfrak{u}_{3}(\mathbb{C})). We also study the derivation algebra \textrm{Der}_{D}(\mathfrak{g}) of a multiplicative Hom-Lie algebra D on \mathfrak{g} and under some hypotheses on D, we prove that the Hilbert series \mathcal{H}(\textrm{Der}_{D}(\mathfrak{g}),t) is a rational function.
