Let K be a field. We characterise the row-finite weighted graphs (E,w) such that the weighted Leavitt path algebra L_K(E,w) is isomorphic to an unweighted Leavitt path algebra. Moreover, we prove that if L_K(E,w) is locally finite, or Noetherian, or Artinian, or von Neumann regular, or has finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, then L_K(E,w) is isomorphic to an unweighted Leavitt path algebra.
