The notion of rigidity of Lie algebra is linked to the following problem: when does a Lie brackets \mu on a vector space g satisfy that every Lie bracket \mu_1 sufficiently close to \mu is of the form \mu_1 = P.\mu  for some P in GL(g) close to the identity? A Lie algebra which satisfies the above condition will be called rigid. The most famous example is the Lie algebra sl(2,C) of square matrices of order 2 with vanishing trace. This Lie algebra is rigid, that is any close deformation is isomorphic to it. Let us note that, for this Lie algebra, there exists a quantification of its universal algebra. This led to the definition of the famous quantum group SL(2). Another interest of studying the rigid Lie algebras is the fact that there exists, for a given dimension, only a finite number of isomorphic classes of rigid Lie algebras. So we are tempted to establish a classification. This problem has been solved up to the dimension 8. To continue in this direction, properties must be established on the structure of these algebras. One of the first results establishes an algebraicity criterion \cite{Carles}. However, the notion of algebraicity which is used is not the classical notion and it includes non-algebraic Lie algebras in the usual sense. The aim of this work is to show that a the Lie algebra is rigid, then its algebra of inner derivations is algebraic.
