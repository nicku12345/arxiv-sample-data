Recognizing when a ring is a complete matrix ring is of significant importance in algebra. It is well-known folklore that a ring R is a complete n\times n matrix ring, so R\cong M_{n}(S) for some ring S, if and only if it contains a set of n\times n matrix units \{e_{ij}\}_{i,j=1}^n. A more recent and less known result states that a ring R is a complete (m+n)\times(m+n) matrix ring if and only if, R contains three elements, a, b, and f, satisfying the two relations af^m+f^nb=1 and f^{m+n}=0. In many instances the two elements a and b can be replaced by appropriate powers a^i and a^j of a single element a respectively. In general very little is known about the structure of the ring S. In this article we study in depth the case m=n=1 when R\cong M_2(S). More specifically we study the universal algebra over a commutative ring A with elements x and y that satisfy the relations x^iy+yx^j=1 and y^2=0. We describe completely the structure of these A-algebras and their underlying rings when \gcd(i,j)=1. Finally we obtain results that fully determine when there are surjections onto M_2({\mathbb F}) when {\mathbb F} is a base field {\mathbb Q} or {\mathbb Z}_p for a prime number p.
