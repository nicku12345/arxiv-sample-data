We first construct a linear basis for a free metabelian Poisson algebra generated by an arbitrary well-ordered set. It turns out that such a linear basis depends on the characteristic of the underlying field.   Then we elaborate the method of Gr\"{o}bner--Shirshov bases for metabelian Poisson algebras. Finally, we show that the word problem for finitely presented metabelian Poisson algebras are solvable.
