We establish Gr\"obner--Shirshov bases theory for commutative dialgebras. We show that for any ideal I of Di[X], I has a unique reduced Gr\"obner--Shirshov basis, where Di[X] is the free commutative dialgebra generated by a set X, in particular, I has a finite Gr\"obner--Shirshov basis if X is finite. As applications, we give normal forms of elements of an arbitrary commutative disemigroup, prove that the word problem for finitely presented commutative dialgebras (disemigroups) is solvable, and show that if X is finite, then the problem whether two ideals of Di[X] are identical is solvable. We construct a Gr\"obner--Shirshov basis in associative dialgebra Di\langle X\rangle by lifting a Gr\"obner--Shirshov basis in Di[X].
