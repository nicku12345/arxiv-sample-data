For each nontrivial semisimple Hopf algebra H of dimension sixteen over \mathbb{C}, the smallest dimension inner-faithful representation of H acting on a quadratic AS regular algebra A of dimension 2 or 3, homogeneously and preserving the grading, is determined. Each invariant subring A^H is determined. When A^H is also AS regular, thus providing a generalization of the Chevalley-Shephard-Todd Theorem, we say that H is a reflection Hopf algebra for A.
