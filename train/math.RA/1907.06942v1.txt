In this paper we express the eigenvalues of a sort of real heptadiagonal symmetric matrices as the zeros of explicit rational functions establishing upper and lower bounds for each of them. From these prescribed eigenvalues we compute also eigenvectors for these type of matrices. A formula not depending on any unknown parameter for the determinant and the inverse of these heptadiagonal matrices is still provided.
