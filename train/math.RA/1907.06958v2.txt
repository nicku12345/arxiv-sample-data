Let H be a cocommutative Hopf algebra acting on an algebra A. Assuming the base field to be algebraically closed and the H-action on A to be integral, that is, it is given by a coaction of some Hopf subalgebra of the finite dual H^\circ that is an integral domain, we stratify the prime spectrum \mbox{Spec}\, A in terms of the prime spectra of certain commutative algebras. For arbitrary H-actions in characteristic 0, we show that the largest H-stable ideal of A that is contained in a given semiprime ideal of A is semiprime as well.
