The aim of this work is to introduce representations of BiHom-left-symmetric algebras. and develop its cohomology theory. As applications, we study linear deformations of BiHom-left-symmetric algebras, which are characterized by its second cohomology group with the coefficients in the adjoint representation. The notion of a Nijenhuis operator on a BiHom-left-symmetric algebra is introduced. We will prove that it can generate trivial linear deformations of a BiHom-left-symmetric algebra.
