In this paper, we introduce the notion Lie-derivation. This concept generalizes derivations for non-Lie Leibniz algebras. We study these Lie-derivations in the case where their image is contained in the Lie-center, call them Lie-central derivations. We provide a characterization of Lie-stem Leibniz algebras by their Lie-central derivations, and prove several properties of the Lie algebra of Lie-central derivations for Lie-nilpotent Leibniz algebras of class 2. We also introduce {\sf ID}_*-Lie-derivations. A {\sf ID}_*-Lie-derivation of a Leibniz algebra G is a Lie-derivation of G in which the image is contained in the second term of the lower Lie-central series of G, and that vanishes on Lie-central elements. We provide an upperbound for the dimension of the Lie algebra ID_*^{Lie}(G) of ID_*Lie-derivation of G, and prove that the sets ID_*^{Lie}(G) and ID_*^{Lie}(G) are isomorphic for any two Lie-isoclinic Leibniz algebras G and Q.
