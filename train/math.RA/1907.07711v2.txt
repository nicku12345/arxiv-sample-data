Let L/K be a G-Galois extension of fields with an H-Hopf Galois structure of type N. We study the ratio GC(G, N), which is the number of intermediate fields E with K \subseteq E \subseteq L that are in the image of the Galois correspondence for the H-Hopf Galois structure on L/K, divided by the number of intermediate fields. By Galois descent, L \otimes_K H = LN where N is a G-invariant regular subgroup of \mathrm{Perm}(G), and then GC(G, N) is the number of G-invariant subgroups of N, divided by the number of subgroups of G. We look at the Galois correspondence ratio for a Hopf Galois structure by translating the problem into counting certain subgroups of the corresponding skew brace. We look at skew braces arising from finite radical algebras A and from Zappa-Sz\'ep products of finite groups, and in particular when A^3 = 0 or the Zappa-Sz\'ep product is a semidirect product, in which cases the corresponding skew brace is a bi-skew brace, that is, a set G with two group operations \circ and \star in such a way that G is a skew brace with either group structure acting as the additive group of the skew brace. We obtain the Galois correspondence ratio for several examples. In particular, if (G, \circ, \star) is a bi-skew brace of squarefree order 2m where (G, \circ) \cong Z_{2m} is cyclic and (G, \star) = D_m is dihedral, then for large m, GC(Z_{2m},D_m),  is close to 1/2 while GC(D_m, Z_{2m}) is near 0.
