Let R be a finite ring and r\in R. The r-noncommuting graph of R, denoted by \Gamma_R^r, is a simple undirected graph whose vertex set is R and two vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if [x,y] \neq r and -r. In this paper, we study several properties of \Gamma_R^r. We show that \Gamma_R^r is not a regular graph, a lollipop graph and complete bipartite graph. Further, we consider an induced subgraph of \Gamma_R^r (induced by the non-central elements of R) and obtained some characterizations of R.
