An F-algebra A with unit 1 is said to be a locally matrix algebra if an arbitrary finite collection of elements a_1, \ldots, a_s  from  A lies in a subalgebra B with 1 of the algebra A, that is isomorphic to a matrix algebra M_n(F), n\geq 1. To an arbitrary unital locally matrix algebra A we assign a Steinitz number \mathbf{n}(A) and study a relationship between \mathbf{n}(A) and A.
