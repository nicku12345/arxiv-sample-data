We study the representation theoretic results of the binary cubic generic Clifford algebra \mathcal C, which is an Artin-Schelter regular algebra of global dimension five. In particular, we show that \mathcal C is a PI algebra of PI degree three and compute its point variety and discriminant ideals. As a consequence, we give a necessary and sufficient condition on a binary cubic form f for the associated Clifford algebra \mathcal C_f to be an Azumaya algebra.
