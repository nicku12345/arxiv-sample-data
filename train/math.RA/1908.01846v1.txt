We explore how the higher order Hochschild cohomology controls a deformation theory when the simplicial set models the 3-sphere. Besides generalizing to the d-sphere for any d\geq1, we also investigate a deformation theory corresponding to the tertiary Hochschild cohomology, which naturally reduces to those studied for the secondary and usual Hochschild cohomologies under certain conditions.
