In this paper we describe solvable Leibniz algebras whose quotient algebra by one-dimensional ideal is a Lie algebra with rank equal to the length of the characteristic sequence of its nilpotent radical. We prove that such Leibniz algebra is unique and centerless. Also it is proved that the first and the second cohomology groups of the algebra with coefficients in itself is trivial.
