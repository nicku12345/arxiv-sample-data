In this paper we discuss some open problems of non-commutative algebra and non-commutative algebraic geometry from the approach of skew PBW extensions and semi-graded rings. More exactly, we will analyze the isomorphism arising in the investigation of the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture about the commutation between the center and the total ring of fractions of an Ore domain. The Serre's conjecture will be discussed for a particular class of skew PBW extensions. The questions about the noetherianity and the Zariski cancellation property of Artin-Schelter regular algebras will be reformulated for semi-graded rings. Advances for the solution of some of the problems are included.
