In commutative invariant theory, a classical result due to Auslander says that if R = \Bbbk[x_1, \dots, x_n] and G is a finite subgroup of \text{Aut}_{\text{gr}}(R) \cong \text{GL}(n,\Bbbk) which contains no reflections, then there is a natural graded isomorphism R \hspace{1pt} \# \hspace{1pt} G \cong \text{End}_{R^G}(R). In this paper, we show that a version of Auslander's Theorem holds if we replace R by an Artin-Schelter regular algebra A of global dimension 2, and G by a finite subgroup of \text{Aut}_{\text{gr}}(A) which contains no quasi-reflections. This extends work of Chan-Kirkman-Walton-Zhang. As part of the proof, we classify all such pairs (A,G), up to conjugation of G by an element of \text{Aut}_{\text{gr}}(A). In all but one case, we also write down explicit presentations for the invariant rings A^G, and show that they are isomorphic to factors of AS regular algebras.
