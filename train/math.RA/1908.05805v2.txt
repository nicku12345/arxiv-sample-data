Ideals in Leavitt path algebras have been shown to share many properties with those of integral domains. Since studying factorizations of ideals in integral domains into special types of ideals (particularly, prime, prime-power, primary, irreducible, semiprime, and quasi-primary ones) has proved fruitful, we conduct an analogous investigation in the context of Leavitt path algebras. Specifically, we classify the proper ideals in these rings that admit factorizations into products of each of the above types of ideals. We also classify the Leavitt path algebras where every proper ideal admits a factorization of each of these sorts, as well as those Leavitt path algebras where every proper ideal is of one of those types.
