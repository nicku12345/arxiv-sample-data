The simplest version of Bertini's irreducibility theorem states that the generic fiber of a non-composite polynomial function is an irreducible hypersurface. The main result of this paper is its analog for a free algebra: if f is a noncommutative polynomial such that f-\lambda factors for infinitely many scalars \lambda, then there exist a noncommutative polynomial h and a nonconstant univariate polynomial p such that f=p\circ h. Two applications of free Bertini's theorem for matrix evaluations of noncommutative polynomials are given. An eigenlevel set of f is the set of all matrix tuples X where f(X) attains some given eigenvalue. It is shown that eigenlevel sets of f and g coincide if and only if fa=ag for some nonzero noncommutative polynomial a. The second application pertains quasiconvexity and describes polynomials f such that the connected component of \{X \text{ tuple of symmetric n\times n matrices}: \lambda I\succ f(X) \} about the origin is convex for all natural n and \lambda>0. It is shown that such a polynomial is either everywhere negative semidefinite or the composition of a univariate and a convex quadratic polynomial.
