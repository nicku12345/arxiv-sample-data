A semigroup is completely simple if it has no proper ideals and contains a primitive idempotent. We say that a completely simple semigroup S is a homogeneous completely simple semigroup if any isomorphism between finitely generated completely simple subsemigroups of S extends to an automorphism of S. Motivated by the study of homogeneous completely regular semigroups, we obtain a complete classification of homogeneous completely simple semigroups, modulo the group case. As a consequence, all finite regular homogeneous semigroups are described, thus extending the work of Cherlin on homogeneous finite groups.
