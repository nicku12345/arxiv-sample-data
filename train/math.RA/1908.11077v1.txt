In this paper,we study the constrained matrix approximation problem in the Frobenius norm by using the core inverse:\begin{align}\nonumber \left\|{Mx - b} \right\|_F=\min\ \ {\rm subject\ to} \ \ {x\in\mathcal{R}(M)} ,\end{align} where M\in\mathbb{C}^{\texttt{CM}}_n. We get the unique solution to the problem, provide two Cramer's rules for the unique solution, and establish two new expressions for the core inverse.
