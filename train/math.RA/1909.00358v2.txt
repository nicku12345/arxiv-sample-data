We give algebraic and geometric classifications of 4-dimensional complex nilpotent terminal algebras. Specifically, we find that, up to isomorphism, there are 41 one-parameter families of 4-dimensional nilpotent terminal (non-Leibniz) algebras, 18 two-parameter families of 4-dimensional nilpotent terminal (non-Leibniz) algebras, 2 three-parameter families of 4-dimensional nilpotent terminal (non-Leibniz) algebras, complemented by 21 additional isomorphism classes. The corresponding geometric variety has dimension 17 and decomposes into 3 irreducible components determined by the Zariski closures of a one-parameter family of algebras, a two-parameter family of algebras and a three-parameter family of algebras. In particular, there are no rigid 4-dimensional complex nilpotent terminal algebras.
