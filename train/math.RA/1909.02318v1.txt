The universal enveloping algebra \mathscr{U} of a two-dimensional nonabelian Lie algebra L is a Lie algebra itself with the commutator as Lie bracket. There exists a presentation of \mathscr{U} with generators x,y and relation xy-yx=x such that the Lie subalgebra of \mathscr{U} generated by x,y is isomorphic to L, which is only a two-dimensional vector subspace of the infinite-dimensional \mathscr{U}. Much then of the Lie structure of \mathscr{U} is ubiquitous, yet unexamined when the characteristic of the scalar field is zero. In such a case, we show that there exists a linear complement of L in \mathscr{U} that contains an infinite-dimensional Lie subalgebra of \mathscr{U} for which we give a presentation by generators and relations. We extend this Lie subalgebra into a filtration of \mathscr{U}.
