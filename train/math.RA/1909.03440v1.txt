The Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein Theorem for sets is well known. The question of whether two subisomorphic algebraic structures are isomorphic to each other, is of interest. An R-module M is said to satisfy the Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein (or SB) property if any pair of direct summands of M are isomorphic provided that each one is isomorphic to a direct summand of the other. A ring R (with an involution \star) is called a Baer (Baer \star-)ring if the right annihilator of every nonempty subset of R is generated by an idempotent (a projection). It is clear that every Baer \star-ring is a Baer ring. Kaplansky showed that Baer \star-rings satisfy the SB property. This motivated us to investigate whether any Baer ring satisfies the SB property. In this paper we carry out a study of this question and investigate when two subisomorphic Baer modules are isomorphic. Besides, we study extending modules which satisfy the SB property. We characterize a commutative domain R over which any pair of subisomorphic extending modules are isomorphic.
