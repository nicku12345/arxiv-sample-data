We show that the endomorphism ring of any nonzero finitely generated projective module over the Leavitt path algebra L_K(E) of an arbitrary graph E with coefficients in a field K is isomorphic to a Steinberg algebra. This yields in particular that every nonzero corner of the Leavitt path algebra of an arbitrary graph is isomorphic to a Steinberg algebra. This in its turn gives that every K-algebra with local units which is Morita equivalent to the Leavitt path algebra of a row-countable graph is isomorphic to a Steinberg algebra. Moreover, we prove that a corner by a projection of a C^*-algebra of a countable graph is isomorphic to the C^*-algebra of an ample groupoid.
