An algebraic analogue of the family of Fredholm operators is introduced for the family of row and column finite matrices, dubbed "Fredholm matrices." In addition, a measure is introduced which indicates how far a Fredholm matrix is from an invertible matrix. It is further shown that this measure respects multiplication, is invariant under perturbation by a matrix from M_\infty(K), and is invariant under conjugation by an invertible row and column finite matrix.
