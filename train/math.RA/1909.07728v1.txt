Let R=K[t;\sigma], where K/F is a field extension and  \sigma  an automorphism of K. We study the eigenspace of a skew polynomial f\in K[t;\sigma] employing methods from nonassociative algebra, and obtain lower bounds on its dimension. When K/F is a cyclic Galois extension of degree n with Galois group {\rm Gal}(K/F)=\langle \sigma \rangle, we show that the eigenspace of an irreducible polynomial f of degree m is a central simple algebra over a field extension of F and is determined by the minimal central left multiple of f.
