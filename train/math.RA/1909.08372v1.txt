Let R be the associative k-algebra generated by two elements x and y with defining relation yx=1. A complete description of simple modules over R is obtained by using the results of Irving and Gerritzen. We examine the short exact sequence 0\rightarrow U\rightarrow E \rightarrow V\rightarrow 0, where U and V are simple R-modules. It shows that nonsplit extension only occurs when both U and V are one-dimensional, or, under certain condition, U is infinite-dimensional and V is one-dimensional.
