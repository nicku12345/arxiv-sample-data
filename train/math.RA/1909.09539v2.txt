If every block of a (compatible) tolerance (relation) T on a modular lattice L of finite length consists of at most two elements, then we call T a \emph{doubling tolerance} on L. We prove that, in this case, L and T determines a modular lattice of size 2|L|. This construction preserves distributivity and modularity. In order to give an application of the new construct, let P be a partially ordered set (poset). Following a 1995 paper by G.\ Poll\'ak and the present author, the subsets of P are called the \emph{coalitions} of P. For coalitions X and Y of P, let X\leq Y mean that there exists an injective map f from X to Y such that x\leq f(x) for every x\in X. If P is a finite chain, then its coalitions form a distributive lattice by the 1995 paper; we give a new proof of its distributivity by means of doubling tolerances.
