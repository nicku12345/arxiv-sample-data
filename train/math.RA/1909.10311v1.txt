In this paper, the notion of quasi-pseudo injectivity relative to a class of submodules, namely, quasi-pseudo principally injective has been studied. This notion is closed under direct summands. Several properties and characterizations have been given. In particular, we characterize Noetherian Rings and Dedekind Domains by quasi-pseudo principally injectivity.
