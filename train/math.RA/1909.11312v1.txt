We study possible connections between Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight and non-skew-symmetric solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation on finite-dimensional quadratic Lie algebras. The particular attention is made to the case when for a solution r the element r+\tau(r) is L-invariant.
