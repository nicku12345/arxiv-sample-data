Given a partial action \alpha=(A_g,\alpha_g)_{g\in \mathcal{G}} of a connected groupoid \mathcal{G} on a ring A and an object x of \mathcal{G}, the isotropy group \mathcal{G}(x) acts partially on the ideal A_x of A by the restriction of \alpha. In this paper we investigate the following reverse question: under what conditions a partial group action of \mathcal{G}(x) on an ideal of A can be extended to a partial groupoid action of \mathcal{G} on A? The globalization problem and some applications to the Morita and Galois theories are also considered, as extensions of similar results from the group actions case.
