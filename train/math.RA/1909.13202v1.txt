One well-known necessary and sufficient condition for equality in the Frobenius rank inequality due to Tian and Styan is that the matrix equation B = BCX + YAB be solvable for X and Y. We develop an algorithm to construct the matrices X and Y using a quotient space formulation of the Frobenius rank inequality, and provide several necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability.
