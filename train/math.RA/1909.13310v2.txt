We introduce the notion of a BV-operator \Delta=\{\Delta^n:V^n\longrightarrow V^{n-1}\}_{n\geq 0} on a homotopy G-algebra V^\bullet such that the Gerstenhaber bracket on H(V^\bullet) is determined by \Delta in a manner similar to the BV-formalism. As an application, we produce a BV-operator on the cochain complex defining the secondary Hochschild cohomology of a symmetric algebra A over a commutative algebra B.
