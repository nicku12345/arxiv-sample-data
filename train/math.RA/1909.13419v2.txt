We study the existence of nontrivial and of representable (dual) weak complementations, along with the lattice congruences that preserve them, in different constructions of bounded lattices, then use this study to determine the finite (dual) weakly complemented lattices with the largest numbers of congruences, along with the structures of their congruence lattices. It turns out that, if n\geq 7 is a natural number, then the four largest numbers of congruences of the n--element (dual) weakly complemented lattices are: 2^{n-2}+1, 2^{n-3}+1, 5\cdot 2^{n-6}+1 and 2^{n-4}+1. For smaller numbers of elements, several intermediate numbers of congruences appear between the elements of this sequence. After determining these numbers, along with the structures of the (dual) weakly complemented lattices having these numbers of congruences, we derive a similar result for weakly dicomplemented lattices.
