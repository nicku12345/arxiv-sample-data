In this paper, we prove some combinatorial results on generalized cluster algebras. To be more precisely, we prove that (i) the seeds of a generalized cluster algebra \mathcal A(\mathcal S) whose clusters contain particular cluster variables form a connected subgraph of the exchange graph of \mathcal A(\mathcal S); (ii) there exists a bijection from the set of cluster variables of a generalized cluster algebra to the set of cluster variables of another generalized cluster algebra, if their initial exchange matrices satisfying a mild condition. Moreover, this bijection preserves the set of clusters of these two generalized cluster algebras.   As applications of the second result, we prove some properties of the components of the d-vectors of a generalized cluster algebra and we give a characterization for the clusters of a generalized cluster algebra.
