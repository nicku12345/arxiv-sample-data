While every matrix algebra over a field K can be realized as a Leavitt path algebra, this is not the case for every graded matrix algebra over a graded field. We provide a complete description of graded matrix algebras over a field, trivially graded by the ring of integers, which are graded isomorphic to Leavitt path algebras. As a consequence, we show that there are graded corners of Leavitt path algebras which are not graded isomorphic to Leavitt path algebras. This contrasts a recent result stating that every corner of a Leavitt path algebra of a finite graph is isomorphic to a Leavitt path algebra. If R is a finite direct sum of graded matricial algebras over a trivially graded field and over naturally graded fields of Laurent polynomials, we also present conditions under which R can be realized as a Leavitt path algebra.
