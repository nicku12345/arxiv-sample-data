Results of Vancliff, Van Rompay and Willaert in 1998 prove that point modules over a regular graded Clifford algebra (GCA) are determined by (commutative) quadrics of rank at most two that belong to the quadric system associated to the GCA. In 2010, Cassidy and Vancliff generalized the notion of a GCA to that of a graded skew Clifford algebra (GSCA). The results in this article show that prior results may be extended, with suitable modification, to GSCAs. In particular, using the notion of {\mu}-rank introduced recently by the authors, the point modules over a regular GSCA are determined by (noncommutative) quadrics of {\mu}-rank at most two that belong to the noncommutative quadric system associated to the GSCA.
