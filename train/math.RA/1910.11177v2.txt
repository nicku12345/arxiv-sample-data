In this article we give a description for the centralizer of the coefficient ring R in the skew PBW extension \sigma(R)<x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n>. We give an explicit description in the quasi-commutative case and state a necessary condition in the general case. We also consider the PBW extension \sigma(\mathcal{A})<x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n> of the algebra of functions with finite support on a countable set, describing the centralizer of \mathcal{A} and the center of the skew PBW extension.
