Assume that {\mathbb F} is an algebraically closed field with characteristic zero. The Racah algebra \Re is the unital associative {\mathbb F}-algebra defined by generators and relations in the following way. The generators are A, B, C, D and the relations assert that [A,B]=[B,C]=[C,A]=2D and that each of [A,D]+AC-BA, [B,D]+BA-CB, [C,D]+CB-AC is central in \Re. In this paper we discuss the finite-dimensional irreducible \Re-modules in detail and classify them up to isomorphism. To do this, we apply an infinite-dimensional \Re-module and its universal property. We additionally give the necessary and sufficient conditions for A, B, C to be diagonalizable on finite-dimensional irreducible \Re-modules.
