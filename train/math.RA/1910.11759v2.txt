We investigate the finitary functions from a finite field \mathbb{F}_q to the finite field \mathbb{F}_p, where p and q are powers of different primes. An (\mathbb{F}_p,\mathbb{F}_q)-linearly closed clonoid is a subset of these functions which is closed under composition from the right and from the left with linear mappings.   We give a characterization of these subsets of functions through the invariant subspaces of the vector space \mathbb{F}_p^{\mathbb{F}_q\backslash\{0\}} with respect to a certain linear transformation with minimal polynomial x^{q-1} - 1. Furthermore we prove that each of these subsets of functions is generated by one unary function.
