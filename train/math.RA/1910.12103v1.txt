This paper surveys basic properties of finite presentation in groups, Lie algebras and rings. It includes some new results and also new, more elementary proofs, of some results that are already in the literature. In particular, we discuss examples of Stallings and of Roos on coherence by using a purely algebraic, nonhomological, approach.
