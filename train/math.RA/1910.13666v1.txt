Let k be a field and A\in M_n(k) be an n\times n matrix. We denote C_{M_n(k)}(A) = \{B\in M_n(k) : BA = AB\} be its centralizers in M_n(k). The dimension of the space of centralizer was already known by Frobenius. This paper will give the explicit k-basis for C_{M_n(k)}(A) and also an algorithm (with polynomial complexity respect to multiplication in the field k) to construct the explicit basis. Lastly, the result can be used to solve a weaker version of the Wild Problem.
