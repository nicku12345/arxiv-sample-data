In this paper we study certain infinite-dimensional graded modular Lie algebras of maximal class generated by two elements of weights 1 and n. Such Lie algebras, which we call algebras of type n, can be viewed as a generalization of certain graded Lie algebras of maximal class generated by two elements of weights 1 and 2 investigated in 2000 by Caranti and Vaughan-Lee.
