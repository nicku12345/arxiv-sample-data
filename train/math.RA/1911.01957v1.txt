In this paper we focus on the structure of the variety of Lie algebras with a finite number of ideals and their graph representations using Hasse diagrams. The large number of necessary conditions on the algebraic structure of this type of algebras leads to the explicit description of those algebras in the variety with trivial Frattini subalgebra. To illustrate our results, we have included and discussed lots of examples throughout the paper.
