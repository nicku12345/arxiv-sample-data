Let L be a lattice of finite length and let d denote the minimum path length metric on the covering graph of L. For any \xi=(x_1,\dots,x_k)\in L^k, an element y belonging to L is called a median of \xi if the sum d(y,x_1)+\cdots+d(y,x_k) is minimum. The lattice L satisfies the c_1-median property if, for any \xi=(x_1,\dots,x_k)\in L^k and for any median y of \xi, y\leq x_1\vee\dots\vee x_k. Our main theorem asserts that if L is an upper semimodular lattice of finite length and the breadth of L is less than or equal to 2, then L satisfies the c_1-median property. Also, we give a construction that yields semimodular lattices, and we use a particular case of this construction to prove that our theorem is sharp in the sense that 2 cannot be replaced by 3.
