Let T be a right exact functor from an abelian category \mathscr{B} into another abelian category \mathscr{A}. Then there exists a functor {\bf p} from the product category \mathscr{A}\times\mathscr{B} to the comma category (T\downarrow\mathscr{A}). In this paper, we study the property of the extension closure of some classes of objects in (T\downarrow\mathscr{A}), the exactness of the functor {\bf p} and the detail description of orthogonal classes of a given class {\bf p}(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}) in (T\downarrow\mathscr{A}). Moreover, we characterize when special precovering classes in abelian categories \mathscr{A} and \mathscr{B} can induce special precovering classes in (T\downarrow\mathscr{A}). As an application, we prove that under suitable cases, the class of Gorenstein projective left \Lambda-modules over a triangular matrix ring \Lambda=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}R & M \\ O & S \end{smallmatrix} \right) is special precovering if and only if both the classes of Gorenstein projective left R-modules and left S-modules are special precovering. Consequently, we produce a large variety of examples of rings such that the class of Gorenstein projective modules is special precovering over them.
