We show that any local derivation on the solvable Leibniz algebras with model or abelian nilradicals, whose the dimension of complementary space is maximal is a derivation. We show that solvable Leibniz algebras with abelian nilradicals, which have 1-dimension complementary space, admit local derivations which are not derivations. Moreover, similar problem concerning 1-local derivations of such algebras are investigated and an example of solvable Leibniz algebra given such that any 2-local derivation on it is a derivation, but which admit local derivations which are not derivations.
