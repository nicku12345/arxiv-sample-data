Let F\langle X, \ast \rangle be the free associative algebra with involution \ast over a field F of characteristic zero. We study the asymptotic behavior of the sequence of \ast-codimensions of the T-\ast-ideal \Gamma_{M+1,L+1}^\ast of F\langle X, \ast \rangle generated by the \ast-Capelli polynomials Cap^\ast_{M+1} [Y,X] and Cap^\ast_{L+1} [Z,X] alternanting on M+1 symmetric variables and L+1 skew variables, respectively.   It is well known that, if F is an algebraic closed field of characteristic zero, every finite dimensional \ast-simple algebra is isomorphic to one of the following algebras:   \begin{itemize}   \item [\cdot](M_{k}(F),t) the algebra of k \times k matrices with the transpose involution;   \item [\cdot](M_{2m}(F),s) the algebra of 2m \times 2m matrices with the symplectic involution;   \item [\cdot](M_{h}(F)\oplus M_{h}(F)^{op}, exc) the direct sum of the algebra of h \times h matrices and the opposite algebra with the exchange involution. \end{itemize}   We prove that the \ast-codimensions of a finite dimensional \ast-simple algebra are asymptotically equal to the \ast-codimensions of \Gamma_{M+1,L+1}^\ast, for some fixed natural numbers M and L. In particular:  c^{\ast}_n(\Gamma^{\ast}_{\frac{k(k+1)}{2} +1,\frac{k(k-1)}{2} +1})\simeq c^{\ast}_n((M_k(F),t));   c^{\ast}_n(\Gamma^{\ast}_{m(2m-1)+1,m(2m+1)+1})\simeq c^{\ast}_n((M_{2m}(F),s));  and  c^{\ast}_n(\Gamma^{\ast}_{h^2+1,h^2+1})\simeq c^{\ast}_n((M_{h}(F)\oplus M_{h}(F)^{op},exc)).
