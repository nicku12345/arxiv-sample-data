Let \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{B} be abelian categories and \mathbf{F}:\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{B} an additive and right exact functor which is perfect, and let (\mathbf{F},\mathcal{B}) be the left comma category. We give an equivalent characterization of Gorenstein projective objects in (\mathbf{F},\mathcal{B}) in terms of Gorenstein projective objects in \mathcal{B} and \mathcal{A}. We prove that there exists a left recollement of the stable category of the subcategory of (\mathbf{F},\mathcal{B}) consisting of Gorenstein projective objects modulo projectives relative to the same kind of stable categories in \mathcal{B} and \mathcal{A}. Moreover, this left recollement can be filled into a recollement when \mathcal{B} is Gorenstein and \mathbf{F} preserves projectives.
