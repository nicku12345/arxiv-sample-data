In this paper, we provide new applications of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. In some circumstances, we find algebraic structures on some sets defined with these numbers, we generalize Fibonacci and Lucas numbers by using an arbitrary binary relation over the real fields instead of addition of the real numbers and we give properties of the new obtained sequences. Moreover, by using some relations between Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, we provide a method to find new examples of split quaternion algebras and we give new properties of these elements.
