In this paper, we discuss the inverse problem of determining a semisimple group algebra from the knowledge of rings of the type sum_{t=1}^s M_{n_t}(Ft), where j is an arbitrary integer and F_t is finite field for each t, and show that it is ill-posed. After then, we define the concept of completeness of the rings of the type sum_{t=1}^s M_{n_t}(Ft) to pose a well-posed inverse problem and propose a conjecture in this direction.
