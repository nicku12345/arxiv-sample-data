Let R be an associative ring with identity and let N be a nil ideal of R. It is shown that units of R/N can be lifted to units in R. Under some mild conditions on the ring, a procedure is given to determine those lifted units in a recursive way. As an application, the units of several classes of rings are determined, including: matrix rings, chain rings, and group rings where the ring is a chain ring. Numerical examples are given illustrating the main results.
