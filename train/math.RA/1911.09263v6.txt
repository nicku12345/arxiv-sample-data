In Baker and Lorscheid's paper, they introduce a new hyperstructure: the polynomial hyperstructure Poly(\mathbb{F}) over a hyperfield \mathbb{F}. In this work, the author focuses on associativity of hypermultiplications in those hyperstructures and gives elementary propositions. The author also shows examples of polynomial hyperstructures over hyperfields with non-associative hypermultiplications. Then, he proves that though the hypermultiplication in Poly(\mathbb{T}) is associative for linear polynomials, it is not associative in general. Moreover, he shows that if 1\boxplus_{\mathbb{F}}1 is not a singleton for hyperfield \mathbb{F}:=(\mathbb{F},\odot,\boxplus_{\mathbb{F}},1,0), the hypermultiplication in Poly(\mathbb{F}) is not associative.
