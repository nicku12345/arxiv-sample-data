We construct a unital locally matrix algebra of uncountable dimension that   (1) does not admit a primary decomposition,   (2) has an infinite locally finite Steinitz number.   It gives negative answers to questions from \cite{BezOl} and \cite{Kurochkin}. We also show that for an arbitrary infinite Steinitz number s there exists a unital locally matrix algebra A having the Steinitz number s and not isomorphic to a tensor product of finite dimensional matrix algebras.
