We introduce the notion of 3-Hom-Lie-Rinehart algebra and systematically describe a cohomology complex by considering coefficient modules. Furthermore, we consider extensions of a 3-Hom-Lie-Rinehart algebra and characterize the first cohomology space in terms of the group of automorphisms of an A-split abelian extension and the equivalence classes of A-split abelian extensions. Finally, we study formal deformations of 3-Hom-Lie-Rinehart algebras.
