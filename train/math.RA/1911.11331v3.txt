In this article we analyze the category gr-mod of unitary \mathcal{G}-graded modules over such rings. Which is done by considering the forgetful functor U \colon {\rm gr-mod} \to R{\rm -mod} and determine properties \mathcal{P} for which the following implications are valid for modules M in gr-mod: M is \mathcal{P} \Rightarrow U(M) is \mathcal{P}; U(M) is \mathcal{P} \Rightarrow M is \mathcal{P}. Here we treat the cases when \mathcal{P} is any of the properties: direct summand, projective, injective, free, simple and semisimple. Moreover, graded versions of results concerning classical module theory are established, as well as some structural properties related to the category gr-mod.
