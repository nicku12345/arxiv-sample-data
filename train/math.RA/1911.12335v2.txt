Let L be a finite dimensional Lie F-algebra endowed with a generalized action by an associative algebra H. We investigate the exponential growth rate of the sequence of H-graded codimensions c_n^H(L) of L which is a measure for the number of non-polynomial H-identities of L. More precisely, we construct the first example of an S-graded Lie algebra having a non-integer, even irrational, exponential growth rate \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[n]{c_n^{S}(L)}. Hereby S is a semigroup and an exact value is given. On the other hand, returning to general H, if L is semisimple and also semisimple for the H-action we prove the analog of Amitsur's conjecture (i.e. \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[n]{c_n^{H}(L)} \in \mathbb{Z}). Moreover if H=FS is a semigroup algebra the semisimplicity on L can be dropped which is in strong contract to the associative setting.
