Two observations in support of the thesis that trusses are inherent in ring theory are made. First, it is shown that every equivalence class of a congruence relation on a ring or, equivalently, any element of the quotient of a ring R by an ideal I is a paragon in the truss \mathrm{T}(R) associated to R. Second, an extension of a truss by a one-sided module is described. Even if the extended truss is associated to a ring, the resulting object is a truss, never a ring, unless the module is trivial. On the other hand, if the extended truss is associated to a brace, the resulting truss is also associated to a brace, irrespective of the module used.
