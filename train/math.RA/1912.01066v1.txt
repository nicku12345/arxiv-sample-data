Let K[X_n] be the commutative polynomial algebra in the variables X_n=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\} over a field K of characteristic zero. A theorem from undergraduate course of algebra states that the algebra K[X_n]^{S_n} of symmetric polynomials is generated by the elementary symmetric polynomials which are algebraically independent over K. In the present paper we study a noncommutative and nonassociative analogue of the algebra K[X_n]^{S_n} replacing K[X_n] with the free metabelian Lie algebra F_n of rank n\geq 2 over K. It is known that the algebra F_n^{S_n} is not finitely generated but its ideal (F_n')^{S_n} consisting of the elements of F_n^{S_n} in the commutator ideal F_n' of F_n is a finitely generated K[X_n]^{S_n}-module. In our main result we describe the generators of the K[X_n]^{S_n}-module (F_n')^{S_n} which gives the complete description of the algebra F_n^{S_n}.
