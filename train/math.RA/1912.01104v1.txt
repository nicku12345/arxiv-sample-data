We completely determine those natural numbers n for which the full matrix ring M_n(F_2) and the triangular matrix ring T_n(F_2) over the two elements field F_2 are either n-torsion clean or are almost n-torsion clean, respectively. These results somewhat address and settle a question, recently posed by Danchev-Matczuk in Contemp. Math. (2019) as well as they supply in a more precise aspect the nil-cleanness property of the full matrix n\times n ring M_n(F_2) for all naturals n \geq 1, established in Linear Algebra and Appl. (2013) by Breaz-Calugareanu-Danchev-Micu and again in Linear Algebra & Appl. (2018) by Ster as well as in Indag. Math. (2020) by Shitov.
