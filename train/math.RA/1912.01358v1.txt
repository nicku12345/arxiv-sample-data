In many previous papers, the authors used an endomorphism of algebra to twist the original algebraic structures in order to produce the corresponding Hom-algebraic structures. In this works, we use these either a bijective linear map, either an element of centroid either an averaging operator either Nijenhuis operator, either a multiplier to produce Hom-Poisson color algebras from given one.
