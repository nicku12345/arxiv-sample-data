In this paper, we mainly give some equivalent characterisations of Hopf braces, show that the category \mathcal{CB}(A) of Hopf braces is equivalent to the category \mathcal{C}(A) of bijective 1-cocycles, and prove that the category \mathcal{CB}(A) of Hopf braces is also equivalent to the category \mathcal{M}(A) of Hopf matched pairs. Moreover, we construct many more Hopf braces on polynomial Hopf algebras, Long copaired Hopf algebras and Drinfel'd doubles of finite dimensional Hopf algebras, and give a sufficient and necessary condition for a given bicrossed coproduct A\bowtie H to be a Hopf brace if A or H is a Hopf brace.
