The goal of this paper is to introduce and give some constructions and study properties of Hom-left-symmetric color dialgebras and Hom-tridendriform color algebras. Next, we study their connection with Hom-associative color algebra, Hom-post-Lie color algebra and Hom-Poisson color dialgebras. Finally, we generalize Yau's twisting to a class of color Hom-algebras and used endomorphisms or elements of centroids to produce other color Hom-algebras from given one.
