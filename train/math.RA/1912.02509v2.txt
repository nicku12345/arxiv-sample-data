We study the ore condition for a prime noetherian right fully bounded ring We study this condition for a certain set of prime ideals which we call as the full set of prime ideals We define the full set of prime ideals of R in section (1). Then we prove our main theorem given below Main theorem Let R be a prime noetherian right fully bounded ring with krull dimension R equal to n a finite integer and let m be a fixed integer m less than or equal to n. Let X be a full set of m- prime ideals of R (defined in section 1 ) Let V denote the set C(X) = Intersection of all C(P) , for all P in X . Then we prove that v is an ore set
