We explore the generalized Drazin inverse in a Banach algebra. Let \mathcal{A} be a Banach algebra, and let a,b\in \mathcal{A}^{d}. If ab=\lambda a^{\pi}bab^{\pi} then a+b\in \mathcal{A}^{d}. The explicit representation of (a+b)^d is also presented. As applications of our results, we present new representations for the generalized Drazin inverse of a block matrix in a Banach algebra. The main results of Liu and Qin [Representations for the generalized Drazin inverse of the sum in a Banach algebra and its application for some operator matrices, Sci. World J., {\bf 2015}, 156934.8] are extended.
