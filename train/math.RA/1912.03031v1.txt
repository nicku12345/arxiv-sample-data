This paper presents the right-left symmetry of the CS and max-min CS conditions on nonsingular rings, and generalization to nonsingular modules. We prove that a ring is right nonsingular right CS and left Utumi if and only if it is left nonsingular left CS and right Utumi. A nonsingular Utumi ring is right max (resp. right min, right max-min) CS if and only if it is left min (resp. left max, left max-min) CS. In addition, a semiprime nonsingular ring is right max-min CS with finite right uniform dimension if and only if it is left max-min CS with finite left uniform dimension.
