Recently is has been proved that if \sigma\in GL_n(R) where R is an commutative ring and n\geq 3, then each of the elementary transvections t_{kl}(\sigma_{ij})~(i\neq j,k\neq l) is a product of eight E_n(R)-conjugates of \sigma and \sigma^{-1}. In this article we show that similar results hold true if R is a (noncommutative) von Neumann regular ring, or a Banach algebra, or a ring satisfying a stable range condition, or a ring with Euclidean algorithm, or an almost commutative ring.
