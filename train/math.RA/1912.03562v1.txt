The classical Gelfand-Kirillov dimension for algebras over fields has been extended recently by J. Bell and J.J Zhang to algebras over commutative domains. However, the behavior of this new notion has not been enough investigated for the principal algebraic constructions as polynomial rings, matrix rings, localizations, filtered-graded rings, skew PBW extensions, etc. In this paper, we present complete proofs of the computation of this more general dimension for the mentioned algebraic constructions for algebras over commutative domains. The Gelfand-Kirillov dimension for modules and the Gelfand-Kirillov transcendence degree will be also considered. The obtained results can be applied in particular to algebras over the ring of integers, i.e, to arbitrary rings.
