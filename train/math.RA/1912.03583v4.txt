Consider \mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}, and the subgroup generated by (2,1), it is a subgroup isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}. If my theorem holds, it must contained in a cyclic group generated by some element of order 8 which is impossible.   The error in 4.2 is because "preimage" do not preserce the image of [x\mapsto px].
