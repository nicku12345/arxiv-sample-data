This introduction to graphs and graph algebras provides the optimal bound for the number of all paths of length k in a graph with N\geq k edges and no loops. Our proof relies on a construction of a number of terminating algorithms that reshape such graphs without ever decreasing the number of paths of length k. The key two algorithms work in turns each of them ending with a graph to which the other algorithm can be applied. Finally, one arrives at a specific graph realizing the optimal bound. Herein graph algebras mean path algebras and Leavitt path algebras. For the ground field \mathbb{C} of complex numbers, the latter are viewed as dense subalgebras in their universal C*-completions called graph C*-algebras.
