Classification of AS-regular algebras is one of the main interests in noncommutative algebraic geometry. We say that a 3-dimensional quadratic AS-regular algebra is of Type EC if its point scheme is an elliptic curve in \mathbb{P}^{2}. In this paper, we give a complete list of geometric pairs and a complete list of twisted superpotentials corresponding to such algebras. As an application, we show that there are only two exceptions up to isomorphism among all 3-dimensional quadratic AS-regular algebras which cannot be written as a twist of a Calabi-Yau AS-regular algebra by a graded algebra automorphism.
