In this paper, we analyze the definition Andr\'e proposed for near-vector spaces to make it more transparent. We also study the class of near-vector spaces over division rings and give a characterization of regularity that gives a new insight into the decomposition of near-vector spaces into regular subspaces. We explicitly describe span and deduce a new characterization of subspaces.
