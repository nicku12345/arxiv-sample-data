K\"ahler-Poisson algebras were introduced as algebraic analogues of function algebras on K\"ahler manifolds, and it turns out that one can develop geometry for these algebras in a purely algebraic way. A K\"ahler-Poisson algebra consists of a Poisson algebra together with the choice of a metric structure, and a natural question arises: For a given Poisson algebra, how many different metric structures are there, such that the resulting K\"ahler-Poisson algebras are non-isomorphic? In this paper we initiate a study of such moduli spaces of K\"ahler-Poisson algebras defined over rational functions in two variables.
