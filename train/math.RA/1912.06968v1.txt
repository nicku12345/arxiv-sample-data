Let T=\biggl(\begin{matrix} A&0\\ U&B \end{matrix}\biggr) be a formal triangular matrix ring, where A and B are rings and U is a (B, A)-bimodule. We prove that: (1) If U_A and _B U have finite flat dimensions, then a left T-module \biggl(\begin{matrix} M_1\\ M_2\end{matrix}\biggr)_{\varphi^M} is Ding projective if and only if M_1 and M_2/{\rm im}(\varphi^M) are Ding projective and the morphism \varphi^M is a monomorphism. (2) If T is a right coherent ring, _{B}U has finite flat dimension, U_{A} is finitely presented and has finite projective or FP-injective dimension, then a right T-module (W_{1}, W_{2})_{\varphi_{W}} is Ding injective if and only if W_{1} and \ker(\widetilde{{\varphi_{W}}}) are Ding injective and the morphism \widetilde{{\varphi_{W}}} is an epimorphism. As a consequence, we describe Ding projective and Ding injective dimensions of a T-module.
