Let K be a field of arbitrary characteristic, \CA be a commutative K-algebra which is a domain of essentially finite type (eg, the algebra of functions on an irreducible affine algebraic variety), \ga_r be its {\em Jacobian ideal}, \CD (\CA ) be the algebra of differential operators on the algebra \CA. The aim of the paper is to give a simplicity criterion for the algebra \CD (\CA ): {\em The algebra \CD (\CA ) is simple iff \CD (\CA ) \ga_r^i\CD (\CA )= \CD (\CA ) for all i\geq 1 provided the field K is a perfect field.} Furthermore, a simplicity criterion is given for the algebra \CD (R) of differential operators on an arbitrary commutative algebra R over an arbitrary field. This gives an answer to an old question to find a simplicity criterion for algebras of differential operators.
