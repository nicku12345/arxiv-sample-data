Frobenius' Theorem states that the algebra of quaternions \mathbb H is, besides the fields of real and complex numbers, the only finite-dimensional real division algebra. We first give a short elementary proof of this theorem, then characterize finite-dimensional real algebras that contain either a copy of \mathbb C, a copy of \mathbb H, or a pair of anticommuting invertible elements through the dimensions of their (left) ideals, and finally consider the problem of lifting algebraic elements modulo ideals.
