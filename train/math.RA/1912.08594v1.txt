Lotka-Volterra (LV) algebras are generally applied in solving biological problems and in examining the interactions among neighboring individuals. With reference to the methods applied by Gutierrez-Fernandez and Garcia in \cite{17}. this study examines the derivations of five-dimensional LV algebras. Before explicitly describing its derivation space, anti-symmetric matrices are used to define the LV algebra A.
