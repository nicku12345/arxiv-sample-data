Dendriform algebras are certain associative algebras whose product splits into two binary operations and the associativity splits into three new identities. In this paper, we study finite group actions on dendriform algebras. We define equivariant cohomology for dendriform algebras equipped with finite group actions similar to the Bredon cohomology for topological G-spaces. We show that equivariant cohomology of such dendriform algebras controls equivariant one-parameter formal deformations.
