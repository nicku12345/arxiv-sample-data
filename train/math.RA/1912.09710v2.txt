Given a set-theoretic solution (X,r) of the Yang--Baxter equation, we denote by M=M(X,r) the structure monoid and by A=A(X,r), respectively A'=A'(X,r), the left, respectively right, derived structure monoid of (X,r). It is shown that there exist a left action of M on A and a right action of M on A' and 1-cocycles \pi and \pi' of M with coefficients in A and in A' with respect to these actions respectively. We investigate when the 1-cocycles are injective, surjective or bijective. In case X is finite, it turns out that \pi is bijective if and only if (X,r) is left non-degenerate, and \pi' is bijective if and only if (X,r) is right non-degenerate. In case (X,r)  is left non-degenerate, in particular \pi is bijective, we define a semi-truss structure on M(X,r) and then we show that this naturally induces a set-theoretic solution (\bar M, \bar r) on the least cancellative image \bar M= M(X,r)/\eta of M(X,r). In case X is naturally embedded in M(X,r)/\eta, for example when (X,r) is irretractable, then \bar r is an extension of r. It also is shown that non-degenerate irretractable solutions necessarily are bijective.
