A matrix P is said to be a nontrivial generalized reflection matrix over the real quaternion algebra \mathbb{H} if P^{\ast }=P\neq I and P^{2}=I where \ast means conjugate and transpose. We say that A\in\mathbb{H}^{n\times n} is generalized reflexive (or generalized antireflexive) with respect to the matrix pair (P,Q) if A=PAQ (or A=-PAQ) where P and Q are two nontrivial generalized reflection matrices of demension n. Let {\large \varphi} be one of the following subsets of \mathbb{H}^{n\times n} : (i) generalized reflexive matrix; (ii)reflexive matrix; (iii) generalized antireflexive matrix; (iiii) antireflexive matrix. Let Z\in\mathbb{H}^{n\times m} with rank\left( Z\right) =m and \Lambda= diag\left( \lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{m}\right) . The inverse eigenproblem is to find a\ matrix A such that the set {\large \varphi }\left( Z,\Lambda\right) =\left\{ A\in{\large \varphi}\text{ }|\text{ }AZ=Z\Lambda\right\}  nonempty and find the general expression of A.\newline In this paper, we investigate the inverse eigenproblem {\large \varphi}\left( Z,\Lambda\right) . Moreover, the approximation problem: \underset{A\in{\large \varphi}}{\min\left\Vert A-E\right\Vert _{F}} is studied, where E is a given matrix over \mathbb{H}\ and \parallel \cdot\parallel_{F} is the Frobenius norm.
